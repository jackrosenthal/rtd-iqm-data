COMMITTEE WORKPLAN APPROVAL
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Finance and Planning Committee Work Plan

February 11, 2025

COMMITTEE ACTION
For the Finance and Planning Committee to approve the 2025 Committee Work Plan.
REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Guzman, Chair, Finance and Planning Committee
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Jack Kroll, Board Office Executive Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Annual committee work plans are a useful tool for ensuring the Board and staff collaborate effectively to
accomplish the necessary work of the agency and Board, while providing dedicated space for the Board
to pursue governance/policy objectives and gain further insights into matters of interest to Directors.
Work plans elevate and respect the role of the committees of the Board as some of the most effective
forums for completing the work of the Board. The work plan before the committee will cover meetings
through February 2026.
Per the Board’s Bylaws (Article VI, Section 1, d.), the Finance and Planning Committee “is responsible
for agency financial matters, including but not limited to budget and monthly financial statement review,
determination of the fiscal impact of all Board actions, asset management, and long-range planning and
capital projects.”
DISCUSSION
The Committee discussed this item at its January 14, 2025, meeting and again at the Board retreat on
February 1, 2025. Additionally, Committee leadership has coordinated with Debra A. Johnson, General
Manager and CEO, Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer, as well as William Sirois, Senior Manager,
Transit Oriented Communities, and Brian Welch, Senior Manager, Planning Technical Services, on this
work plan.
Directors are asked to review and make any additional changes to the work plan before voting to
approve the work plan.
Once approved by the Committee, the work plan, will be forwarded to the full Board for review. The
approved work plan may be adjusted by the Chair of the committee in consultation with the committee’s

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

Vice Chair and responsible RTD staff. It is expected that the timing of some items may shift throughout
the course of the work plan.
This discussion and approval align with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer
Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success, as the Finance and Planning Committee’s
ability to effectively govern directly impacts the overall performance of the agency. An organized
committee work plan will ensure RTD’s resources are used efficiently, and that the Board’s policy and
governance objectives are more focused, collaborative, and obtainable.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Certificates of Participation, Series 2015A Refinancing

February 11, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
February 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the RTD Board of Directors to adopt the attached Resolution Number ____ (the “COP Resolution”),
Series of 2025 authorizing the refinancing of Certificate of Participation (COP) Series 2015A.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD primarily utilizes sales tax bonds and certificates of participation (COPs), when necessary, as
financing mechanisms to provide funding for certain purchases of assets with useful lives in excess of
one year. Sales tax bonds are subject to Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) limitations and debt service
payments are secured by future collections of sales and use taxes. COPs are lease-purchase
arrangements and are not subject to TABOR limitations, however, COPs require annual appropriation by
the Board through the budgeting process to authorize annual principal and interest payments. COPs are
secured through collateralization of essential assets of the district. Bonds and COPs are referred to as
RTD debt for discussion purposes.
All of RTD’s debt has fixed interest rates, meaning that the interest rate paid on the portfolio of debt
does not vary with market changes. In addition, RTD’s debt has fixed terms of maturity and is not
subject to acceleration meaning that all debt payments will occur on a fixed schedule through the term
of each obligation. These features provide budget certainty as well as limit RTD’s interest rate risk.
RTD’s debt portfolio contains obligations that are either tax-exempt or taxable. Taxable debt results in
interest payments to debt holders being subject to income tax while tax-exempt debt is generally nontaxable. Taxable debt generally has a higher cost to RTD than tax-exempt debt due to the difference in
interest rates at the time of issuance. Taxable debt is issued instead of tax-exempt debt in situations
that are advantageous to RTD but do not meet the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements to be
issued as tax-exempt.
As of December 31, 2024, RTD’s total outstanding bonds and COPs totaled $2.804 billion.

Packet Pg. 9

1.C.2

In addition, RTD has other long-term obligations associated with the Eagle Public Private Partnership
(P3), which is the design, build, finance, operate and maintain concessionaire agreement entered with
Denver Transit Partners/Operators for the A, B and G Commuter Rail Lines and the Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility (CRMF), totaling $0.510 billion.
DISCUSSION
RTD and its Municipal Advisor, Hilltop Securities, constantly monitor market conditions for opportunities
for efficiencies regarding RTD’s finances. Current market conditions for debt have created an opportunity
to lower future interest expense.
RTD generally issues tax-exempt debt with 10-year call provisions to provide future flexibility for which
refinancing is permitted at the call date. Current IRS regulations do not permit advance refinancing (prior
to the call date) of tax-exempt debt obligations unless more expensive taxable debt is used.
The Series 2015A COPs were issued for equipment purchases, including light rail vehicles, mall shuttles,
60-foot articulated buses and 40-foot buses. These COPs are eligible for refinancing and current market
conditions indicate that refinancing for interest savings would generate savings of approximately $15.4
million through 2040. These savings are equivalent to net present value (NPV) savings of $4.1 million or
3.84%.
The attached Resolution allows the issuance of Certificates of Participation, Series 2025 to refinance the
currently outstanding Series 2015A COPs.
Substantially final drafts of the contractual documents are on file and available for review on the RTD
Investor Information webpage under the “Documents for Potential 2025 Certificates of Participation”.
The webpage can be found at the following link: https://www.rtd-denver.com/open-records/financialinformation
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Refinancing the Series 2015A COPs is estimated to reduce RTD’s gross interest expense by $15.4
million through 2040 or $4.1 million or 3.84% on an NPV basis. This equates to cash flow savings of
more than $900,000 annually through 2040.

general obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District
within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision, nor a mandatory charge or
requirement against the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year.
The District shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to the 2025 Certificates
except in connection with the payment of the Base Rentals and certain other payments under the
Lease, which payments may be terminated by the District in accordance with the provisions of
the Lease. Neither the Lease nor the 2025 Certificates shall constitute a mandatory charge or
requirement of the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year or
constitute or give rise to a general obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year
financial obligation of the District within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt
limitation and shall not constitute a multiple fiscal year direct or indirect District debt or other
financial obligation whatsoever. No provision of the Lease or the 2025 Certificates shall be
construed or interpreted as creating an unlawful delegation of governmental powers nor as a
donation by or a lending of the credit of the District within the meaning of Sections 1 or 2 of
Article XI of the Colorado Constitution. Neither the Lease nor the 2025 Certificates shall
directly or indirectly obligate the District to make any payments beyond those budgeted and
appropriated for the District's then current fiscal year.
Section 8.
Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized
pursuant to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair rental value of the 2025 Leased Property and do
not exceed a reasonable amount so as to place the District under an economic compulsion to
renew the Lease or to exercise its option to purchase the 2025 Leased Property pursuant to the
Lease. The Board hereby determines and declares that the period during which the District has
an option to purchase the 2025 Leased Property (i.e., the entire maximum term of the Lease)
does not exceed the useful life of the 2025 Leased Property.
Section 9.
Exercise of Option; Direction to Trustee. In the event that the
General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer determines to proceed with the Refunding
Project and executes a Sale Certificate in accordance with the provisions set forth herein, the
Board hereby elects and hereby declares its intent to exercise on the behalf and in the name of
the District its option to purchase all of the 2015A Leased Property currently encumbered under
the 2015A Indenture and to redeem all of the outstanding 2015A Certificates (the "Refunded
Certificates"), as applicable, on the redemption date and at the redemption prices set forth in the
Sale Certificate related to the Refunding Project. Upon the execution of the Sale Certificate
related to the Refunding Project, the District hereby irrevocably instructs the Trustee to give
notice of refunding and defeasance to the owners of the Refunded Certificates in accordance with
the provisions of the Sale Certificate, the Indenture of Trust related to the Refunded Certificates
and the Escrow Agreement between the Corporation and the Trustee, as escrow agent, related to
the Refunded Certificates.
Section 10.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 1157-209 of the Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District
acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of the principal, interest or prior redemption premiums on the 2025 Certificates. Such
recourse shall not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or
otherwise, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law, enforcement of penalty, or

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Authorizing Resolution for Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) Funding

February 11, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
February 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve Resolution No. ______, Series of 2025, authorizing the General
Manager and CEO to be responsible for applying for and legally committing RTD to compliance with
terms of awards from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD is a direct recipient of federal grant funding from the FTA. Eligibility for being a direct recipient of
federal funding requires certain qualifications, certifications, registrations, and authorizations granted by
the FTA. Application, expenditure, and receipt of federal grant funding is subject to several compliance
and reporting requirements as well as regular engagement and coordination with the FTA Region 8
Office.
RTD has internal policies and procedures for applying for grant opportunities regarding planned activities.
Therefore, the agency is strategic in its approach to considering and pursuing grant funding.
On December 6, 2024, RTD received notification from the FTA that certain enhancements will be
required for recipients to apply for and continue receiving FTA funding effective March 5, 2025. These
enhancements include:
•
•

Opinion of Counsel: Each recipient must be legally empowered to carry out the activities specified
in the award
Authorizing Resolution: Each recipient organization must have a resolution or equivalent, from the
recipient’s Board of Directors or equivalent Authorizing Official, to be responsible for applying for
assistance and legally committing the applicant or recipient to compliance with terms of an award

DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priority of Financial Success.

Packet Pg. 36

1.C.3

RTD will receive approximately $347 million or 26% of revenues from federal grants in 2025, including a
pass-through grant of approximately $170 million to the City and County of Denver for the Colfax Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT) project.
Types of grants received by RTD include the following:
•

•
•

Urbanized Area Formula Funding (Section 5307): provides formula grant funding for transit
capital, operating assistance, and transportation-related planning in urbanized areas resulting from
formulaic apportionments based on information filed with the FTA’s National Transit Database
(NTD)
Capital Investment Grants (Section 5309): provides discretionary grant funding for transit capital
investments that may be awarded funding that meet a unique set of individual grant requirements
Bus and Bus Facilities Formula Program (Section 5339): provides formula grant funding to
replace, rehabilitate, and purchase buses and related equipment as well as bus-related facilities

RTD qualifies as a direct recipient of FTA funding and follows all applicable rules, regulations and
reporting requirements regarding federal funding requirements.
This recommended action requests approval of the attached resolution to provide the enhanced FTArequired documentation necessary to continue to receive and apply for federal funding.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact associated with the adoption of this resolution.

RESOLUTION NO. ____, SERIES OF 2025
AUTHORIZATION OF THE GENERAL MANAGER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (“GM/CEO”) TO BE

1969, which is currently codified as Sections 32-9-101 through 32-9-164, inclusive, of the Colorado
Revised Statutes (the "Act"), and the District's Board of Directors (the "Board") and officers from time
to time, including the present incumbents, have been duly chosen and qualified; and
WHEREAS, RTD is authorized by Section 32-9-119(1)(q) of the Act to accept grants or loans
from the federal government, state government, or any political subdivision thereof and to enter into
contracts with the federal government, state government, and any political subdivision thereof; and
WHEREAS, RTD is eligible and authorized under state or local laws to request, receive and
spend FTA funds to administer FTA-funded projects; and
WHEREAS, RTD is a recipient of FTA funding and must demonstrate a legal capacity to carry
out the project(s) included in federal assistance awards.

Dear Colleague:
FTA is pleased to announce the release of a recent enhancement in TrAMS, FTA’s grants
management system of record, specific to the organization and labeling of recipient documents.
As you are aware, one of the prerequisites to be a recipient of FTA funding is demonstrating
legal capacity to carry out the project(s) included in federal assistance awards. This is generally
based on the review of the recipient organization’s documentation and certification that it has the
legal capacity to carry out FTA-funded programs and projects. Specifically, the recipient must be
eligible and authorized under state or local law to request, receive, and spend FTA funds to
administer FTA-assisted projects.
•

Opinion of Counsel: Each recipient must be legally empowered to carry out the
activities specified in the award.

•

Authorizing Resolution: Each recipient organization must have a resolution or
equivalent, from the recipient’s Board of Directors or equivalent Authorizing Official, to
be responsible for applying for assistance and legally committing the applicant or
recipient to compliance with terms of an award.

This enhancement provides updated document labels within the Recipient Document profile
module for these two required documents, as well as includes an enhanced search functionality
for all users to find important documents that may be uploaded in their profile. In an effort to
assist with the rollout of this enhancement, TrAMS has attempted to proactively label any
documents that were named using these terms for the recipient. However, all recipients are
asked to review and confirm that the correct document was properly labeled by the system.
Additionally, if the system was unable to locate a document labeled using these terms, recipients
must locate and properly identify both documents within their Recipient profile.
Beginning March 5, 2025, TrAMS will prevent any recipients that have not properly identified
the Opinion of Counsel and Authorizing Resolution in their Recipient Document profile from
transmitting or submitting new applications unless they have correctly labeled and/or uploaded
their required legal documents.

To prevent any grant making delays please confirm and/or upload in TrAMS current copies of
your Authorizing Resolution and Opinion of Counsel for your organization. This can be completed
by selecting your organizations record using your Recipient ID under Recipient Organizations.
Once your organization has been selected, next click on Related Actions and select the Recipient
Documents field. Finally confirm or upload each document using the Opinion of Counsel and
Authorizing Resolution Document Types. Information on this enhancement and a short tutorial
video are available on FTA’s TrAMS webpage.
