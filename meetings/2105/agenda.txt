GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT

X.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT
A.

August 2009 Service Changes
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors approve moving the proposed August 23, 2009 Service
Changes (Attachment A) on to public review and comment.

B.

Architectural/Engineering Contract with the Merrick & Company, 16 DO-025
Contract Amendment
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to amend contract 16 DO-025
with Merrick & Company for architectural and engineering design services in the
amount of $500,000 for a new contract amount of $1,100,000. Work is
administered on an as-needed, work order basis. The amended amount is to be
funded by annual capital projects for the duration of the contract.

C.

2008 Audited Financial Statements
It is recommended by the Financial Administration Committee that the Board of
Directors accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports
relating to the year ended December 31, 2008 as prepared by Staff and audited
by the District’s independent auditor, Bondi & Co. LLC.

D.

Sales and Use Tax Compliance Review Agent Designation and Permission to
Further Pursue Legal Appointment
It is recommended by the Financial Administration Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors authorize the General Manger and Staff to designate MuniServices as
the District’s representative to review RTD’s sales tax and use tax records,
contingent upon RTD’s obtaining permission from the Department of Revenue for
such an appointment under Colorado State Statutes and all pertinent regulations.

E.

Database Administration – Operational Systems Support
It is recommended by the Financial/Administration Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to
initiate the third-year contract option with Dataman USA for time and materials
Oracle DBA support contract, RTD Contract No. 17DJ001. This contract was
originally awarded on July 1, 2007 through the competitive bid process. Within
the contract, Article 6.0, allows for an initial year plus three one-year options to
renew based on positive performance by the vendor. The annual limit is not to
exceed $170,000. The second year option is to begin on July 1, 2009 and
remain in effect for 365 calendar days until June 31, 2010. The Board is being
asked to approve this contract because Legal has determined it to be a personal
services contract.

F.

State Legislative Liaison Services
It is recommended by the Legislative Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement (for state legislative
liaison services) with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BMPA) to exercise a
one-year option (July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010) to extend Contract No.
17-DX-001, at a cost of $98,000.

G.

Recommendation for Authorization of an RTD Funding Commitment to the
Denver Union Station Project Authority for the Design and Construction of the
Denver Union Station Project
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize a payment of $12 million a year for 30 years to the Denver
Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) subject to acceptable agreements for
the financing, design, and construction of the Denver Union Station (DUS) project
described in the Record of Decision entered on October 17, 2008 and
supplemented by the Letter of Intent signed by RTD and its partner agencies on
January 31, 2008. RTD’s obligation will be reduced if Tax Increment revenues
and other City tax revenues for the project are sufficient to pay off project debt
early.

XI.

H.

Rapid Transit Station Addition Policy Update
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt this policy, which updates the District’s current established
procedures and guidelines for evaluating proposed new stations on RTD’s existing
and planned light rail and commuter rail lines. Since each potential station and
station area is unique, no one set of guidelines should determine whether a
station is appropriate for a specific site. The criteria described below are meant to
serve as a policy framework for issues that should be considered when planning
for and approving new stations. RTD staff will evaluate each of the criteria, and
provide the results for the RTD Board’s information when considering the
approval of a new station. Final determination regarding whether new stations
will be added to light rail and commuter rail lines, and who will provide associated
funding of new stations, will be a Board decision on a case by case basis.

I.

Revised Eagle Stipend Agreement
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to negotiate and enter into a
compensation agreement with the three pre-qualified teams invited to respond to
the Eagle Project RFP (the Proposers) in an amount not to exceed $20,000,000
to be payable in the event that RTD elects not, or is unable, to execute and
implement a concession agreement with the selected proposer through no fault of
the selected proposer. Payment will only be to the team that is selected and not
the unsuccessful teams. As a condition of this compensation RTD would receive
all of the design work, including calculations, analyses and other supporting work
that the selected team completed as part of the proposal process. Funding for
the compensation agreement would be provided in 2010 through the FasTracks
financial plan for the East Corridor and Gold Line projects.
