Date:

Subject:

Budget Transfer for Platte Boiler Replacement
and Repair

CFO/AGM,

Date: February 5, 2020

GM
Board Meeting Date: February 11, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Finance, Audit, & Administration Committee that the Board of Directors
approve a budget transfer of $453,182 from the GM Contingency Fund to the Facilities budget to
fund the replacement of a boiler and 3 flues at Platte.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
The Platte shops has three boilers servicing the facility. They were replaced in 2014. Scope included
three new boilers and flues. Issues have risen with the boilers. RTD has filed a claim with our insurance
carrier for $278,182 for boiler #1.
We have a $100,000 deductible and have just received
$146,066.70. The insurance carrier is retaining $32,115.30 until the work on boiler #1 has been
completed. We are in the process of filing a claim with our insurance provider for boiler #2. We will be
pursing action against Legacy Mechanical, the installer, and Unilux Boiler, the manufacturer, to recover
our insurance deductible. We are currently evaluating the other boiler.
DISCUSSION
Shortly after installation it was determined that condensation from the three flues were becoming a
problem. Investigation took place to confirm that the new flues were deficient. RTD contacted the
manufacturer to inspect all three boilers. During inspection the manufacturer discovered that boiler #1
had a deformed housing or outer shell. The Risk Management Division was contacted to pursue claims
for the three flues and the damaged housing on boiler #1. An outsourced attorney and forensic
consultant have supplemented RTD’s investigation team. RTD has competitively contracted with
Rasmussen to replace boiler #1 and the three flues. Rasmussen was also contracted to tune up boiler #2
and boiler #3 as the firing was discovered to be excessive. Boiler #2 also failed while running on diesel
fuel. These boilers are designed as duel-fueled units. Boiler #2 also needs to be replaced which is why
additional funds for a second removal is required. A leaky valve is the suspected cause of the failure of
boiler #1 and boiler #2. We are only running on natural gas at this time. Funds being requested for
transfer will allow the project to move forward while the insurance claim is being processed.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The GM contingency fund was set up to handle emergency situations such as this. This is an immediate
impact of $453,182. When the funds are received they will be returned to the GM contingency fund.

ALTERNATIVES
Recommended Action: It is recommended that the Finance, Audit, & Administration Committee
that the Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $453,182 from the GM Contingency
Fund to the Facilities budget to fund the replacement of a boiler and 3 flues at Platte.
Alternative #1: Don’t approve the request. This is not the recommended action as we would
have to wait for an extended period of time before funds would become available from insurance
and the boiler needs to be replaced/ repaired now.

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
To:

Board of Directors

Requested
by:

Natalie Menten, Director, District M

Date:

February 5, 2020

Subject:

Check Register Publication

Date: February 5, 2020

Board Meeting Date: February 11, 2020

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by Directors Menten, Mihalik, Lubow, Lewis, Williams, and Folska at the February 11,
2020 Financial Administration and Audit Committee, that the RTD Board of Directors instruct the Interim
General Manager/Chief Financial Officer to take all necessary steps to deploy the RTD Financial
Transparency Check Register at our website. This portal shall include a downloadable comma or text
delimited file which includes payee, date, check number or electronic funds transfer (EFT), invoice
number (if available), purchase order number (if available), cost center account code, object account
code, and description of purpose for the purchase. The data file shall contain only information that is a
public record or that is not confidential or otherwise protected from public disclosure pursuant to state or
federal law.
In addition, the chart of accounts shall be published listing cost center and object code, this file shall
also be available for download in comma or text delimited format.
The account payable check register shall be published and accessible to the public by July 1, 2020. The
downloadable file shall be updated monthly and contain the last three years of payments.
This recommended action supports the following Agency/General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #1 Strengthen transparent public communication
Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District Board of Directors at their March 2019 retreat endorsed a 2020
strategic goal to strengthen transparency and communication. Easier access to and storage of electronic
financial data should facilitate increased transparency in Regional Transportation District financial and
budget matters.
This policy directs staff to publish a downloadable comma or text delimited file on our public website
which shall include all public account payable line items including payee, date, check number or
electronic funds transfer (EFT), invoice number (if available), purchase order number (if available), cost
center account code, object account code, and description of the purpose. The data file shall contain
only information that is a public record or that is not confidential or otherwise protected from public
disclosure pursuant to state or federal law.

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

In addition, the chart of accounts shall be published listing cost center and object code, this file shall
also be available for download in comma or text delimited format.
This account payable register shall be published and accessible to the public by July 1, 2020. The online
accounts payable file shall be updated monthly and contain the last three years of payments.
DISCUSSION
Currently, the Regional Transportation District publishes a monthly PDF check register which includes
date, payee, and amount. The monthly PDF format makes it difficult to compare month-to-month
expenditures and does not include description, cost center, or object code. Over the last decade, many
public agencies have expanded their financial transparency and provide a searchable and/or
downloadable accounts payable file. These examples include the State of Colorado, Jefferson County,
City and County of Denver, City of Boulder, Adams County, City of Northglenn, West Metro Fire, City of
Lakewood and City of Fort Collins are some examples. In an effort to create expanded transparency,
public agencies have invested various levels of public funds. In light of RTD's financial challenges, this
proposal requires minimal investment but greatly needed transparency in an agency that is facing
tremendous public scrutiny. The required data points including payee, date, amount, invoice number,
purchase order ID, cost center, object code, and description are currently available in Oracle. The most
simple and least expensive method is to offer a downloadable file which provides ability to search,
tabulate, and filter.
In November 2019, the Chief Financial Officer indicated the agency will be challenged to pay for
operations and maintenance on the current service. Enhanced financial transparency allows the public
better insight into the financial operations of the Regional Transportation District.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM9ZO-wPvFc&feature=youtu.be
FINANCIAL IMPACT
It will take approximately 64 hours at a cost of $5,610 to create the custom report. RTD’s IT team
needs to combine the Citibank Pcard activity from Citibank’s database and combine that with the AP
activity in Oracle and add the additional fields requested.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve recommendation to expand transparency in the Regional Transportation District.
2. Do not approve of expanded financial transparency and continue to publish monthly PDF without
useful detail.

Independent Accountants’ Report On Cost
Of General Manager’s Contract
Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
Denver, Colorado
We have performed the procedures enumerated below, which were agreed to by the
Board of Directors (the Board) of the Regional Transportation District (the District),
solely for the purpose of determining the cost of the General Manager’s Contract
covering the period of January 1, 2016 through January 20, 2020. The Board is
responsible for the General Manager’s contract with the District. The sufficiency of
these procedures is solely the responsibility of the party specified in this report.
Consequently, we make no representation regarding the sufficiency of the procedures
enumerated below either for the purpose for which this report has been requested or for
any other purpose.
The following procedures, and the results of applying those procedures, are as follows:
1. Review the executive employment agreement, effective January 1, 2016 through
December 31, 2020 (the Contract), by and between the District and David
Genova, for employment services as the General Manager and Chief Executive
Officer of the District.
2. Review the amended executive employment agreement, effective January 1, 2019
through December 31, 2025 (the Amended Contract), by and between the District

Procedures performed to validate the amounts paid to the General Manager for 2019
included the following:
1. Salary and benefit costs were agreed to payroll records.
2. Benefit costs under this Contract are the same as those provided for all salaried
employees under the benefit plans.
The 2019 actual paid amounts were below the original estimate. This is primarily due
to smaller than estimated discretionary performance payment in 2019 for 2018 services.
The revised estimated annual amounts for 2020 were adjusted for the following:
1. The voluntary retirement of the General Manager effective January 20, 2020
2. The Amended Contract outlined a new base salary and related annual base
salary increase percentage of 1.5% for 2019 - 2025
3. Updated annual health insurance growth rate of 5.5%
4. Updated for Social Security and Medicare tax rates and thresholds for 2020

5. The District contributes to the RTD Salaried Pension Plan an amount based on
recommendations from the Plan actuary, which is then adjusted within budget
to available cash flow projections. The contribution in 2019 was $5,100,000. The
actuary does not calculate a contribution amount for each individual employee
but instead recommends an annual contribution based on the current funding of
the Plan and projections of future benefits to be paid for all participants using
certain actuarial assumptions. Therefore, the annual contribution consists of
amounts for active employees, inactive employees and retirees. For presentation
purposes, the contribution for the GM has been estimated at 9% of wages in the
absence of the availability of a per employee contribution. Future benefits paid
are adjusted to limits under IRS Section 401(a)(17) of $425,000.
6. The Amended Contract removed the potential discretionary performance
payment provision.
7. No awarded discretionary performance payment in 2020 for service in 2019.
8. An adjustment for an employee advance as a result of a payroll system
conversion in prior years
Original Estimate
Assumptions used in calculating the estimated cost of the Contract:
1. Mr. Genova’s continued employment with the District through the remainder of
the Contract period, including the automatic renewals for two additional one-year
terms through December 31, 2020
2. A discretionary performance payment of 10% of prior-year’s base salary is no
longer provided for after 2017.
3. Base salary shall receive an increase of $10,000 effective January 1 of each
successive year of the term or renewal term.
4. Vacation and sick time are included in the salary amounts and assumed to be
fully used, except for the annual sellback of 80 hours as allowed for salaried
employees of the District.
5. Enrollment in the District benefit plans remains unchanged, and annual cost
increased 5.8% for health insurance benefits and 2.3% for other benefits (we were
not engaged to, and we did not, perform any procedures on the reasonableness or
accuracy of this estimate).
6. Contribution percentage of 9% to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Trust

7. Reimbursement of legal fees of $4,000 in 2016
8. Section 401(a)(17) limits equal to the amount of $265,000 were used in the
estimates.

POLICY REFERENCE
Investment Policy
DISCUSSION
Please find the District’s investment report for the fourth quarter of 2019 attached. RTD funds are
invested in high quality, short term investments which are often affected by changing economic
conditions and expectations and also by actions of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.
The U.S. economy and household spending continued to expand at a moderate pace during the fourth
quarter of 2019 while business fixed investment and exports have weakened. The U.S. unemployment
rate decreased to 3.5% and general inflationary pressures have been muted.
In view of implications of global developments for the economic outlook, the Federal Reserve Open
Market Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to between 1.50 and
1.75 percent.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:

invest earnings produced income of approximately $8.1 million.
Historical performance of RTD Liquidity Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy benchmark is

(4) Variance is due to timing of project expenses not yet incurred, many of which are grant-funded. Final year-end accruals are not yet included.
(5) Variance is due to lower outside security services costs. Final year-end accruals are not yet included.
(6) Variance is due primarily to timing of outside counsel costs related to litigation. Final year-end accruals are not yet included.
(7) Variance is due to timing of outstide IT services costs for projects. Final year-end accruals are not yet included.
(8) Variance is due to timing of outside printing costs for schedules, other outside services and special events. Final year-end accruals are not yet included.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Heather McKillop, Acting Interim General
Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

February 5, 2020

Subject:

LiVE Program Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: February 5, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: February 11, 2020
Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program transitioned to
new rules after December 31, 2019.

DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

Packet Pg. 49

1.C.6

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of February 3, 2020, 5,893 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 3,623 have been
approved, 1,550 have been denied and the remaining 720 are pending. Of the 1,550 denied, 1,062
were denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65 and older which entitles them to a
better discount. 353 were denied because their address was out of District, 14 were denied because it
was a duplicate application, 12 were denied because the applicants were already enrolled, 7 were denied
because they did not respond to requests for additional information, and 102 were denied because they
did not meet the income threshold. Of the 720 pending applications, 675 lack an uploaded photo, 33 are
pending for eligibility determination by a benefits program that would income-qualify the applicant for
LiVE, 1 is pending for income verification by Denver Human Services, and 11 applications are pending
because the applicant needs to provide additional information.

In addition to going live on July 29, 2019, the following actions have been completed:

LiVE fares are available through RTD’s mobile ticketing application.
LiVE fares are available on LiVE MyRide smart cards. The cards can be ordered through the
MyRide portal and have been made available for purchase at RTD sales outlets as well as
King Soopers and Safeway stores.
LiVE airport upgrades are available on buses and from Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs).
Order forms for LiVE 10-ride tickets have been made available to organizations in the RTD
nonprofit program.
RTD Operations staff and Security staff have been trained on the LiVE fares and eligibility
requirements.
Marketing, training, product readiness and communications activities have been deployed.
Step-by-by step instructions for applications as well as other materials are available
through the RTD LiVE web page. A LiVE Program handout has been created, printed, and
uploaded to the web page. The instructions and handout are available in English and
Spanish.
The LiVE application process in PEAK is available to applicants in both English and
Spanish.
RTD customer service is answering LiVE program questions and referring customers to the

Denver Human Services is verifying income for those not categorically income-eligible
through public assistance programs.
Denver Human Services is providing LiVE eligibility customer service by phone and e-mail.
RTD staff are performing quality control, making any needed adjustments for uploaded

Subject:

Longmont Fare Buy Up

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his/her designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the City of Longmont to buy up fares on all four of the Longmont local fixed route
services herein referenced as “the 300 series.” Specifically, the 300 series are routes 323, 324, 326
and 327 and complementary Access-a-Ride services for a period of two years.
BACKGROUND
Boulder County and the City of Longmont have funded and managed the Longmont fare buy-up program
since 2014. RTD and Boulder County entered into this agreement in 2014 to “buy up” all fares on the
300 series routes in Longmont with the objective of building ridership and increase mobility options for
low income riders. During 2013, annual boardings for the Longmont local routes were 156,863
boardings (Weekday and Saturdays). By the end of 2018, boardings increased to 613,280.
The City of Longmont has since taken over the funding and management of this agreement and would
like to continue the Longmont Free Fare program for a period of two additional years. This contract
would be in effect January 2020 through December 2021.
DISCUSSION
Under this agreement, all passengers will continue to be allowed unlimited boardings on all 300 series
routes. Transfers will be issued to any passengers requesting one and all passengers will be required to
adhere to all RTD rules, regulations, and codes of conduct. This agreement will not include the FlexRide
or regional routes operating within Longmont. Boulder County and the City of Longmont will continue to
perform the majority of the marketing and publicity for this program with the approval of the RTD
Marketing Department. RTD staff will also continue to conduct regular meetings with the local
municipalities to discuss any issues that need to be addressed with this agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
During this 24-month agreement, the City of Longmont has agreed to pay RTD the projected fares in the
amount of $972,402. In addition, the city has agreed to reimburse the RTD fares for all Access-a-Ride
trips that fall within the ADA service area boundaries of the 300 series routes. The City and RTD have
agreed on a methodology to calculate the cost of the program to the city based on ridership in arrears.
There will be a termination clause in the contract that will allow either the City or RTD to discontinue the
program with 60 days’ notice.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his/her designee, to execute all documents
necessary to enter into an Agreement with the City of Longmont to buy up fares on all four of
the Longmont local fixed route services herein referenced as “the 300 series.” Specifically, the
300 series are routes 323, 324, 326 and 327 and complementary Access-a-Ride services for a
period of two years.
2. Do not approve the Agreement with the City of Longmont for the 300 series buy up. This course
of action is not recommended, as it will result in a loss of a program valuable to the City of
Longmont and Boulder County. Additionally, this program provides transportation access to the
low-income population in these area. Local ridership will be reduced as customers are charged a
fare and lose the ability to travel for free at any time.

Contract Option Award for the Purchase of 48
Cutaway Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his/her designee, to exercise the option of contract 25FK006
with Master’s Transportation for the purchase of forty-eight (48) Goshen/Rev Group cutaway buses to
be used for the Access-a-Ride and FlexRide services at a price not to exceed $3,342,180.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services and Task
Goal #3 – Asset Management/State of Good Repair.
BACKGROUND
On January 19, 2016 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 233 Goshen cutaway
buses. The procurement was the result of RTD Invitation for Bids (IFB25FK006) issued on October 19,
2015. Five bids were received on December 8, 2015 in response to this IFB. Master’s Transportation
was the responsive and responsible low bidder for the selected bus configurations. The IFB allowed RTD
to purchase additional cutaway buses for a five-year period with each successive year pricing to be
based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price adjustment set by the US Department of
Labor’s Producer Price Index (PPI).
Staff is requesting Board approval to exercise the option to Contract 25FK006 with Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of forty-eight (48) additional Goshen/Rev Group cutaway buses. The
new buses will replace thirty-seven (37) 2014 model year Startrans buses used for Access-A-Ride
services, seven (7) 2013 model year Eldorado buses used for FlexRide services, and provide four (4)
expansion buses for FlexRide services.
DISCUSSION
The 2013 and 2014 model year cutaway buses to be replaced have exceeded their Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) service life of 5 years or 150,000 miles. The 2013 Eldorado buses are over 6.5
years old and average over 225,000 miles. The 2014 Startrans buses are over 5.5 years old and
average over 170,000 miles. They require intensive maintenance to keep them in service.
The new cutaway buses will conform to the configuration that was developed in cooperation with the
disability community several years ago during the initial 2015/2016 procurement of ADA cutaway
buses. The buses will be equipped with an extended sized wheelchair lift to accommodate large sized
wheelchairs, two wheelchair access areas for the FlexRide buses and three wheelchair access areas for
the Access-a-Ride buses to allow for ADA compliance. The buses will also be equipped with a security
camera system per the current standard on all new RTD buses.

2.B.2

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for this contract amendment is included in the District’s 2020 Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Master’s Transportation selected bus manufacturer, Goshen/Rev Group,
has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA's approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager or
his/her designee, to exercise the option of contract 25FK006 with Master’s Transportation for the
purchase of forty-eight (48) Goshen/Rev Group cutaway buses to be used for the Access-a-Ride
and FlexRide services at a price not to exceed $3,342,180.
2. Do not authorize the contract and re-solicit bids. This is not recommended as it would result, at
the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost to the project.

Contract Option Award for the Purchase of
Thirty-four (34), 40 foot Low Floor Transit
Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager, or his/her designee, to exercise the contract option and amend
contract 19FK002 with Gillig LLC for the purchase of thirty-four (34) additional new 40 foot transit
buses and associated spare components, and extended warranties for a total price not to exceed
$16,650,480.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Asset Management/State of Good Repair
BACKGROUND
RTD’s existing 5000 series Gillig 40 foot transit buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years
or 500,000 miles. The buses are 14 years old and have on average over 600,000 miles of stop and go
transit service. They have become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service.
This requested bus purchase is included in the adopted Mid-Term Financial Plan.
On September 24, 2019 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 46 Gillig 40’ buses to
begin the replacement of the 5000 series Gillig buses. The original procurement was the result of RTD
Request for Proposal (RFP) 19FK002. Contract 19FK002 allows RTD options to purchase up to 204 40’
buses during the 5 year contract period. Pricing for option buses is based on the initial base pricing plus
an inflationary price adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index”
(PPI) which is published monthly.
DISCUSSION
The 40 foot low floor buses are similar to those currently utilized at RTD with a proven seating layout
that is approved by the CCDC to maximize wheelchair passenger space. The buses are equipped with
clean diesel engines meeting the latest EPA requirements. Over the estimated lifetime of each bus,
emissions will be reduced by over 100 tons of greenhouse gases, 6.5 tons of Nitrous Oxides (NO x) and
0.25 tons of Particulate Matter versus the engines in the current 2005 buses.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The proposed contract is for the purchase of thirty-four (34) 40 foot transit buses, associated spare
components, and selected extended warranties not to exceed $16,650,480. Funding for this contract is
approved and available in the District’s 2020 Budget.

Packet Pg. 57

2.B.3

DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required bid
submittal documents, notice of this approval is provided to vehicle purchasers in the form of a certificate
attesting to this submittal and FTA approval. Gillig has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s
approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager, or
his/her designee, to exercise the contract option and amend contract 19FK002 with Gillig LLC for
the purchase of thirty-four (34) additional new 40 foot transit buses and associated spare
components, and extended warranties for a total price not to exceed $16,650,480.
2. Do not authorize the contract amendment and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it
would result, at the very least, in a significant delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase
the cost of the project. This will result in an increase in ongoing maintenance costs.

Attachment: Service Availability Memo - January 2020 (4099 : Service Availability January 2020)

TO:

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.65% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in January 2020. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflects an
improvement as compared to the same month (January) last year. Lost service for personnel
related reasons follows:





January 2020 – 47.88 hours
January 2019 – 124.19 hours
Year to date hours for 2020 – 47.88 hours
Year to date hours 2019 – 124.19 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in January were AB overloads, and planned
bus bridges.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.65% of all scheduled hours of service in the month,
it was necessary to cover 2,423 shifts with RTD operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 19,384 hours of service being provided
by a “6th day” RTD operator. Additionally, our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev,
covered 2,388 shifts, or approximately 18,735 hours of service, with operators working a
“6th day”.
