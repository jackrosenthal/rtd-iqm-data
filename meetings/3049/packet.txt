Access-a-Ride Web Portal

Information

RTD Launches New Portal for Access-a-Ride Customers
Progressive web app enables trips to be booked online, shows vehicle location and estimated time of
arrival
DENVER (Oct. 26, 2020) – Starting today, Regional Transportation District (RTD) customers who rely on
the agency’s Access-a-Ride service can access a highly anticipated resource: a web-based Customer
Portal that allows them to track their ride in real time, book new trips and cancel scheduled trips, all
from a desktop or mobile device.
The Access-a-Ride Customer Portal – developed entirely in-house over the last year by RTD’s IT team –
is a progressive web app that allows for easy monitoring and management of upcoming trips for Accessa-Ride, RTD’s complementary paratransit service. It updates every 30 seconds to provide customers
with a location and an estimated time of arrival (ETA) for their vehicle. The portal, available through the
RTD website, can be bookmarked on a web browser and added to a smartphone as a new icon. To
ensure that the Customer Portal is accessible, it has been independently certified as having met or
exceeded Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
“This is definitely the type of app that, when you use it once, you will be hooked,” said Access-a-Ride
Manager Larry Buter. “It is the game-changer that our customers have been waiting for and asking about
for years.”
To this point, Access-a-Ride customers could manage trips and confirmations by contacting reservations
or dispatch, or by using RTD’s Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, a voice-activated phone tree.
The IVR system places calls to passengers the night before their next-day trip as a reminder, and it calls
again the day of the trip to let passengers know when their vehicle is 10 to 15 minutes away. While
helpful, such an estimate can be altered by traffic and other variables, which makes a difference to
someone waiting in inclement weather, for example. The ETA in the Customer Portal reflects data from
Mapbox, a mapping and location cloud platform that is aware of real-time traffic.
The Customer Portal was designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind – providing users with the
information they want without anything extra that could prove distracting. It includes three tabs:
•

“ETA”, which provides real-time information for the next trip and updates automatically every 30
seconds with the following details:
o Estimated minutes until pickup or drop-off
o Scheduled pickup or drop-off time, if estimated time is unavailable
o Map of vehicle location, predicted vehicle route, intermediary stops and destination

Packet Pg. 6

1.D.1

•

•

“Scheduled”, which details scheduled trips that are not in progress or canceled. Through this tab,
customers can select and cancel trips that are not to occur within the next two hours. (To cancel
a trip scheduled within the next two hours, the customer will need to call Access-a-Ride.)
“Book”, which allows a customer to book a trip to or from any of their favorite locations. The
customer’s home address is included in this list by default. Trips can be booked two to five days
out.

Before release, RTD tested the Customer Portal in beta form with six members of RTD’s Access-a-Ride
Paratransit Advisory Committee to better understand how it performs, gauge experience with navigation
and determine whether there was room for improvement. Those who took part spoke highly of the
portal, rated its functionality favorably, said it is easy to navigate and expressed appreciation for the
ETA function.
Individuals qualify for travel on Access-a-Ride by being unable to access a bus stop or a lift-equipped
fixed-route bus by themselves, or by having a disability that prohibits independent travel on a fixed-route
bus, criteria set forth in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). RTD has more than 16,000
active Access-a-Ride customers and has continued to deliver an average of 21,025 trips each month
during the pandemic. Frequent travel destinations include day programs, medical offices, dialysis centers
and workplaces. Access-a-Ride began offering grocery delivery and pickup to its customers in March.
New customers interested in using Access-a-Ride service can sign up by filling out an application on the
RTD website or by calling 303-299-2960. From there, they must provide a medical verification form and
complete an in-person interview and transportation assessment.
ABOUT RTD
The Regional Transportation District develops, operates and maintains a public transportation system
that meets the transit needs of close to 3 million people within an eight-county service area in the
Denver Metro region. RTD’s buses, rail lines, shuttles and additional services provide approximately 100
million annual passenger trips. For more information, visit rtd-denver.com, call 303-299-6000 and follow

TO:

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.84% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in October 2020. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflects an
improvement as compared to the same month (October) last year. Lost service for personnel
related reasons follows:
•
•
•
•

October 2020 – 20.65 hours
October 2019 – 485.37 hours
Year to date hours for 2020 – 1693.37 hours
Year to date hours 2019 – 3065.26 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in October were bus bridges and the COVID19 pandemic and the pandemic service reduction.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.84% of all scheduled hours of service in the month,
it was necessary to cover 0 shifts with RTD operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 0 hours of service being provided by a
“6th day” RTD operator. Additionally, our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev,
covered 0 shifts, or approximately 0 hours of service, with operators working a “6 th day”.

approves and adopts the revised Fiscal Policy Statement for 2021.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #3 - Strong Financial Management
Strategic Priority #6 – Move RTD Toward Stable Financial Situation
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the proposed
Policy for development of the upcoming year’s budget.
The most recent modification to the Fiscal Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in October
2019 for the 2020 fiscal year. Those changes were clarification in Revenue Policies, addition of a policy
reference in Expenditure Policy, wording substitution/clarification, and update of rating agency credit
ratings at that date.
DISCUSSION
For 2021, the following changes are proposed. Please see the attached documents for the proposed full
document and document with changes shown.
1. Changes to Revenue Policies section as follows:
a. Wording clarification in Revenue Policy #1.
2. Rewrite of the Expenditure Policies section as follows:
a. Change to Expenditure Policy #5 to indicate that the Safety Management System has
taken the place of a safety program and add reference to the policy. The statement that
RTD will invest in safety outreach programs and personnel to communicate safety issues
is deleted because it has been superseded by the SMS and no longer considered relevant.
b. Change to Expenditure Policy #6 to replace service changes “needed to respond to budget
shortfalls” with “matched to funding capacity” for clarification.
3. Rewrite of the Capital Improvement Policies section as follows:
a. Change to Capital Improvement Policy #1 to replace “on annual basis” with “as
determined by the Board but not less than every two years” for preparation of the MidTerm Financial Plan. The capital projects criteria is deleted and replaced with #2 and #3
which state that:

2.B.1

i. Capital investments should further RTD’s purpose of moving people, which is
achieved when investments are aimed at established agency metrics or key
performance indicators.
ii. The asset investment decision making process will be data driven in accordance
with the RTD Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan.
The purpose of these changes is to indicate that the TAM is the basis for capital project
selection in the MTFP.
b. Prior Capital Improvement Policy #2 regarding basis for the capital program is deleted due
to a. above.
c. Prior Capital Improvement Policy #6 regarding facilities design is deleted due to its
irrelevance in a fiscal policy.
d. Wording clarification in Capital Improvement Policy #4 to give priority to existing,
“backlog, and deferred” assets before consideration of new assets.
e. Wording clarification in Capital Improvement Policy #7.
4. Changes to the Fund Balance Policies section as follows:
a. Wording clarification in Fund Balance Policy #1 and #2.
b. Prior Fund Balance Policy #6 regarding establishing a FasTracks construction reserve is
deleted due to its irrelevance.
5. Changes to Debt Policies section as follows:
a. Wording clarification in Debt Policy #5 and #6.
b. Update of Debt Policy #5 with the most recent rating agency credit ratings in effect.
6. Addition of new section entitled COVID-19 Response Policies as follows:
1. Guidance for Reductions:
• First consider reductions in administrative costs (overhead)
• Allowable to utilize reserves but limit use
• Allowable to utilize future FISA rubber tire service contributions
• Allowable to utilize future contributions from Credit Risk Premium (CRP) and project
savings to offset FasTracks shortfalls
• Should not utilize existing FISA balances, except for Board identified and approved
projects such as SH 119 BRT
• Do not reduce service levels below what is currently being offered
2. Guidance for Restoration:
• Restore reserves to three months if possible
• Do not utilize existing FISA balances
• Limit the use of, or do not use, future rubber tire service contributions to FISA
• Restore deferred projects related to compliance or safety
• Restore service as ridership allows
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Fiscal Policy Statement changes as requested may have a financial impact on the 2021
Recommended Budget, the details of which are presented separately.

potential fare adjustments to establish a fare structure to ensure that it:
 is understandable
 is implementable
 addresses equity including social and geographical
2. Fare or other revenue streams and cost savings should aim to achieve financial levels
equivalent to inflationary adjustments in fare revenue established in the Mid-Term
Financial Plan.

6. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure the
continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board will support
efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state financial resources
to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that would limit or diminish
revenue.
7. On an annual basis, staff will identify under- or un-utilized property and equipment, and
will make an ongoing attempt to monetize such property and equipment to enhance cash
flow.
8. RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use tax forecasting
containing projections for the short-term (one year by quarter), mid-term (six-year MidTerm Financial Plan period) and long-term (30-year Long Range Financial Plan period).
The purpose is to provide RTD with expert economic analysis and sales and use tax
forecasts using sophisticated financial modeling techniques not available internally.

be maintained at an amount approximately equal to three months of FasTracks operating
expenses excluding depreciation. RTD will consider and pursue resources that will be
directed to fund balance replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and
budget surpluses are an especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Debra Johnson, General Manager and CEO

Date: November 5, 2020

From:

Doug MacLeod, Controller

GM

Date:

November 4, 2020

Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2020

Subject:

Adoption of the Investment Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the attached Investment Policy which contains recommended changes to reflect a change in
ownership of the indices used to benchmark return and risk of the district’s investments.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in November 2019. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION
Staff solicited the expertise, knowledge and recommendations of the district’s investment advisor, Public
Trust Advisors, in reviewing the current Investment Policy. Recommended changes are in response to a
change in ownership of the indices used to benchmark return and risk of the district’s investments.
The purpose of the Investment Policy (the “Policy”) of the Regional Transportation District ("RTD") is to
specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and systematic program for investments in
RTD’s operating and reserve funds. The Policy also provides for the investment of bond proceeds that
are authorized through bond resolutions or indentures of trust.
By following best practices with respect to the management of public funds, the primary objectives of
RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2) sufficient liquidity to meet
known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield (achieving a market rate of return). Although RTD must
legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1) it
has previously made a policy decision to implement its investment program in a more conservative
manner than is dictated by state statute through imposing stricter diversification requirements.
A redlined copy of the recommended policy is attached which highlights the recommended changes from
the current investment policy.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement

The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
•

Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

1. PURPOSE

2.B.2.a

3.2 Liquidity

3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to

2
Packet Pg. 49

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy - REDLINE (4376 : Adoption of the Investment Policy)

The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.

2.B.2.a

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.

organizations (“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second
highest rating category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's
and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or
security is downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in
the Portfolio, the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is
advisable to sell such holding.

of purchase of the investment.

2.B.2.a

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,
the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers
in the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions
authorized to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities
only from those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i)
primary dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that
qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

6.1 Sale of Securities

2.B.2.a

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns
which may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this
Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.

denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement

The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
•

Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

1. PURPOSE

2.B.2.b

3.2 Liquidity

3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to

2
Packet Pg. 63

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy - For Signature (4376 : Adoption of the Investment Policy)

The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.

2.B.2.b

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.

the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).

security is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating
organizations (“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second
highest rating category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's
and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or
security is downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in
the Portfolio, the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is
advisable to sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.

2.B.2.b

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,
the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers
in the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions
authorized to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities
only from those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i)
primary dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that
qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

6.1 Sale of Securities

2.B.2.b

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

7.1 Safekeeping and custody

The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents) is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio (securities maturing
between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated performance
benchmark is the Merrill LynchICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns
which may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this
Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy,
denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

Subject:

Adoption of the 2021 & 2022 Modified MidTerm Financial Plan

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 4, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the 2021 & 2022 Modified Mid-term Financial Plan.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
COVID-19 Financial Goal: Identify Funding Sources
2020 Strategic Priority #6: Move RTD Toward Stable Financial Condition
BACKGROUND
The Mid-term Financial Plan is a six-year financial plan consisting of the Base System and FasTracks.
The Base System includes only service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales/use tax,
and FasTracks operations activity. The FasTracks includes expense and projects (non-operational)
funded from the FasTracks 0.4% sales/use tax.
Updated annually, the Mid-term Financial Plan provides important cash flow planning information used to
determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as services that the District
can provide using projected financial resources. The first year of the Mid-term Financial Plan serves as
the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
Each year during the planning process, operating costs are forecasted, and capital projects are developed
to support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal
and interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the District.
The other major component of the plans is the estimate of available revenues during the six-year time
period. These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will have
adequate resources to meet cash flow needs.
Per RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement, RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use
tax forecasting containing projections for the short term (annual budget), medium term (Mid-term
Financial Plan) and long term (Financial Plan). RTD has contracted with the University of Colorado-Leeds
School of Business for this service.
Capital and operating/maintenance projects are developed through the Asset Management Plan process.
The Mid-term Financial Plan also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit
funding through the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council
of Governments. The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal

Packet Pg. 74

2.B.3

funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the MTFP qualifying projects are included
in the TIP.
DISCUSSION
Although RTD was facing funding shortfalls prior to the pandemic, COVID-19 has had a significant effect
of the ability for RTD to offer the same level of service that was provided in 2019.
Multiple study sessions and workshops have been held with the Board over the last seven months to
provide guidance to RTD on how to move forward. On July 21, 2020, the Board adopted the following
COVID-19 budget reduction principles:
#1

Keeping riders, employees and the region healthy and safe: We will strive to keep our
communities connected and our riders, employees and region healthy and safe.

#2

Service reductions should not be our primary response. We’ll be creative: We will take a balanced
approach to budget reductions and do so in such a way as to align with our mission. Accordingly,
service reductions should be minimized so as to minimize the impact to our customers. We will
strive for a well-rounded approach by incorporating reductions in overhead, breaking down silos
and engaging partners, and seeking creative approaches to service delivery.

#3

We’ll prioritize mobility for people who most depend on transit during the pandemic: We will
strive to maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our
services to access essential jobs and other necessities, while also keeping our communities and
activity centers appropriately connected.

#4

We will support and value all of our employeesz: We acknowledge our frontline employees who
directly promote our mission to the public and who have borne the brunt of mandating in the
past. We also acknowledge those fulltime employees in the lower wage categories, because a
humane work environment is valued by RTD.

#5

Being data-driven and informed by collective wisdom and expertise: We will use a thoughtful,
responsible approach to decision-making for the COVID period, while planning for the mid-term
financial period and post-pandemic future, by incorporating the best available data, expertise, and
wisdom, including through the Re-Imagine project, the accountability committee, and
stakeholders.

#6

We’ll be actively transparent and seek input: We will take active measures to be transparent and
seek input regarding our use of CARES Act money as well as in the decision-making process for
measures we adopt to respond to ongoing COVID financial impacts

On September 1, 2020, the Board also provided guidance on how to solve for the shortfall.
• First consider reductions in Administrative costs (overhead)
• Ok to utilize reserves but try to limit use
• Ok to utilize FISA rubber tire service contributions

• Ok to utilize future contributions from Credit Risk Premium (CRP) and project savings to offset
FasTracks shortfalls
• Should not utilize existing FISA balances, except for possibility SH 119 BRT
• Don’t reduce service levels below what we are currently offering
In June, General Manager and CEO Paul Ballard established the an internal COVID-19 Fiscal Task
Force to focus resources on identifying savings. The Task Force identified the following:
Cost Reductions/ Elimination Recommendations
• Business Travel
• Temporary Employees
• Professional Dues
• Publications and Subscriptions
• Employee Referral and Signing Bonus (except for those already earned)
• Elimination of Professional Development Funds (except job required)
• Suspend the Leadership Academy
• Suspend MAX Program
Payroll/ Benefit Related Reduction Recommendations
•
•

•
•
•
•
•

No pay increases for Salaried Employees
Tiered Furloughs for Salaried Employees
o $0 - $60,000 – No furlough days or pay reduction
o $60,001 - $120,000 – 6 furlough days and no pay reduction
o $120,001 - $180,000 – 6 furlough days + 3.5% pay reduction
o $180,001 + - 6 furlough days + 7.5% pay reduction
No increases in the contribution to the Salaried Defined Benefit (DB) Pension plan
Temporary reduction in the contribution for the Salaried Defined Contribution (DC) plan
Elimination of Salaried Vacation/Sick/PTO Buyback
Elimination of Overtime and Extra Shift Pay (except OT when required in the runboard)
Adjustments to staffing levels to “right size” the organization to align staffing with the
anticipated continuation of operating service at the 60% level.
o Elimination of some position and consolidation of other positions
o Reduce the number of positions by about 25-30%
o Reductions include both vacant and filled positions for represented and salaried staff
o This equates to approximately 428 part-time and fulltime filled positions for both
represented and salaried staff

We had originally anticipated the shortfall to be approximately $166 million for 2021 as revenues
forecasts changed it grew to $215 million. We have since received the September 2020 forecast from
CU Leeds School of Business and the current shortfall forecast for 2021 is approximately $140 million.

2.B.3

The 2021-2026 cash flows are presented in Exhibit A for Base System and Exhibit B for FasTracks. In
addition, we have provided a line by line narrative for both the Base System and FasTracks (Exhibit C).
This narrative walks through some of the assumptions made and an explanation of what each line item
represents.
In order to balance 2021 and future years, we have relied on having fund balances to carry forward into
2021. Please see Exhibit D for more information.
Asset Management Plan
In being able to solve the shortfall for 2021, we had to defer all capital and expense projects except for
the Electric Bus and Infrastructure project for which we had received two grants. The Asset
Management Plan is Exhibit D. The list of projects that has been deferred in on page 1 for the Base
system and page 7 for FasTracks. The Asset Management Division along with the Asset Stewards will
be meeting over the next several months to review the projects listed and will reprioritize the projects
over the 2022-2026 timeframe. They will be look at how lower service levels may cause a reduction in
asset replacements.
The current list of deferred projects prior to the deferral of projects in 2021 equated to $205 million.
The deferral of projects in 2021 grows the deferred list by approximately 10% and increases the risk for
potential catastrophic failures that could create and immediate need for funds.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff-recommended Modified Mid-term Financial Plan for 2021 and 2022 is balanced where
forecasted revenues equal forecasted expenditures and provides RTD with a plan for maintaining three
months of reserves.

Narrative for 2021-2026 Mid-Term Financial Plan Cash Flows

Due to the uncertain nature of the impacts of COVID-19 on both revenues and expenditures,
the Board gave guidance that they would like to approve a modified Mid-Term Financial Plan
that encompasses 2021 and 2022 at this time. However, we have prepared a six-year analysis
so the Board can see the longer-term impact of current information regarding revenues and
expenditures and the assumptions made.
Base/FasTracks Cash Flow for 2021-2016
The first page is the cash flow for the Base system (2021-2026) and the second page is the cash
flow for FasTracks (2021-2026.)
Base System Cash Flow:
Line 1:

The 2020-2025 fare box revenue estimates have been reduced to the
percentages specified in the chart below to account for lower ridership due to
COVID-19 and the uncertainty as to when ridership will return. These estimates
include an assumption of a fare rate increase in both 2023 and 2026 which was
deferred from 2022 and 2025 per Board direction.

Line 2:

Other operating revenue such as advertising and local service buy-ups.

Line 3:

Total operating revenue to include fare box revenues and other operating
revenue.

Line 4:

Sales and Use Tax – Based on the September 2020 Leeds forecast which includes
July actual collections.

Line 5:

Grant revenues are based on 2020 formula grant allocations. The impacts of the
2020 Census and potential RTD service changes on formula grants are not known
at this time.

Line 6:

This was excluded from this analysis.

Line 7:

This is only applicable to FasTracks.

Line 8:

This revenue is lumped in with other operating revenue in 2021-2025 Mid-Term
financial plan but is broken out in 2026 and beyond – it includes lease, rental,
and miscellaneous income.

Line 9:

Total non-operating revenue.

Line 10:

Total operating and non-operating revenue combined. This is the amount of
total funds available for distribution.

Line 11:

These are the payment on the outstanding T-Rex Bonds. These bonds will be
paid off in 2024. After these bonds are paid off, RTD will be subject to TABOR
spending limitations on the Base System.

Line 12:

These are the payments due on the COPs in the base system. COPs were issued
routinely for bus and light rail vehicle purchases prior to 2017.

Line 13:

There are no other financing payments on the base system.

Line 14:

This is the sum of revenue bond and COP payments.

Line 14a:

This is the percent of sales & use taxes that are used for debt service.

Line 15:

These are the funds that RTD has available to spend on operations, projects, and
assets.

Line 16:

Operating and Maintenance costs taken from the 2020 Adopted Budget and
inflated by CPI.

Line 17:

Since we used the 2020 Adopted Budget as the baseline, we have to adjust for
changes reflected in the 2020 Amended Budget adopted by the Board in July
2020.

Line 18a:

Administrative Personnel Related Changes identified through the COVID-19 fiscal
task force.

Line 18b:

Other administrative reductions identified through the COVID-19 fiscal task
force.

Line 18c:

Savings from Service remaining at the 60% level (includes personnel savings
related to service).

Line 18d:

Onetime costs related to reduction in staffing such as unemployment.

Line 18e:

Other savings identified by Divisions through the 2021 budget process.

Line 19:

This is the total of lines 16-18e, and it represents the forecasted Operations and
Maintenance cost with all the adjustments.

Line 20:

Use of future rubber tire service contributions to the FISA to fund current year
service. No contributions are need currently.

Line 21:

Use and contributions to reserves () denotes use of reserves. A positive number
represents a contribution to reserves. Three (3) months of reserves are
maintained through 2026.

Line 22:

Total of lines 20 and 21.

Line 23:

These are the funds remaining after debt service, O&M, and contribution to (or
use of) reserves.

Line 24:

Per the Board direction, we funded SH 119 BRT in 2023.

Line 25 & 26: We deferred Burnham Yard and the Maintenance Facility until after 2026.
Line 27:

We are funding the electric buses and infrastructure. We have pulled these
electric bus purchases out of the Asset Management list because we received
two grants for these buses and infrastructure. One is a federal grant and one is
from the Volkswagen settlement.

Line 28:

This is an allowance for new projects which are non-asset related.

Line 29:

We are funding 70% of the Asset Management Plan (AMP). 2021 projects have
been deferred to 2022-2026. RTD should be funding between 80% and 90% of
the list so assets don’t fall into a state of disrepair, however funding is not
available to achieve that level.

Line 30:

This is the total of lines 24 – 29.

Line 31:

Funds remaining after all expenses have been funded. These funds can be used
for funding deferred projects from the AMP or restoring service.

Line 32:

There is a positive balance in years 2021-2026.

Overview of the 2021 Recommended Budget
Revenues of $945.5 million on a combined basis are expected to decrease $224.1 million (-19.2%) in
2021 from the 2020 Amended Budget. This is due to 1) a decrease in farebox revenue of $5.4 million,
2) a decrease in grant revenue of $367.4 million, 3) a decrease in investment income of $3.7 million, 4)
a decrease in other income of $1.7 million, offset by 5) an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $154.1
million.

•
•

•

Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenue of $88.5 million is budgeted to
decrease $5.4 million or 5.7% from the 2020 Amended Budget. Planned service levels in
2021 will be approximately 55% of pre-pandemic levels.
o On the Base System, farebox revenue is forecast at $61.0 million, a decrease of $4.7
million from the 2020 budget amount.
o For FasTracks, farebox revenue is forecast at $27.5 million, a decrease of $0.6 million
from the 2020 budget amount
Ridership is expected to continue to be diminished through much of 2021 due to the
effects of the pandemic.
Sales and use tax revenue of $655.0 million in 2020 is forecast to increase 5.5% or
$34.0 million over the 2020 estimate. The 2021 budget incorporates the most recent
September quarterly sales/use tax forecast by the CU-Leeds School of Business.
Total grant revenue, including new and carry-forward amounts, is estimated at $185.3
million, a decrease of $367.4 million from the 2020 Amended Budget.
o Total Base System grants are estimated at $118.5 million in 2021, and of that amount
$114.9 million is new grants while projected carry-forward grant funding is $3.6
million. Base System grants are projected to decrease $178.5 million from the 2020
Amended Budget. The forecast assumes no additional CARES Act grant funding for
2021. Large grants for the Base System include formula FTA grants for capital

maintenance (5307), fixed guideway (5337), and bus facilities (5339), state FASTER
grants, and VW settlement funds.
o FasTracks grants are budgeted at $66.8 million, which is a decrease of $188.9 million
from the 2020 Amended Budget. Of the amount, all $66.8 million is the projected
carry-forward grant funding to 2021, with no new grant funding. Operating grant
revenue is estimated to decrease $82.0 million while capital grant revenue is estimated
to decrease $106.9 million from the 2020 Amended Budget. The carryforward is
made up of final draws on the FFGA for the Eagle project and Small Starts funding for
SERE.
Combined investment income is budgeted at $0 due to expectation of minimal investable
fund balances.
Other operating income and other income totaling $16.7 million is budgeted to decrease
$1.7 million from the 2020 Amended Budget. This recurring miscellaneous revenue is
mostly increased at the CPI and includes advertising revenue, joint venture revenue,
parking income, rental income, third-party reimbursement, and other items. Included in
other income is the Build America bonds subsidy (FasTracks Project), payment by the
University of Colorado for naming rights on the A Line which discontinues in April
(FasTracks Operations), DUS rental income (Base System and FasTracks Operations), and
Greyhound rental income (Base System).

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $629.4 million on a combined basis in 2021 (excluding
depreciation), which is $103.8 million lower than the 2020 Amended Budget. Base System operating
expenses are budgeted to decrease $69.6 million, FasTracks Project operating expenses are budgeted to
decrease $4.0 million, and FasTracks Operations operating expenses are budgeted to decrease $30.2
million.
On the Base System, departmental operating expenses are targeted amounts derived from the 20212022 Mid-Term Financial Plan, plus operating/expense projects carry-forward from 2020, and other
miscellaneous revisions unknown at the time of the MTFP.
The 2021 budget is reduced in the following areas: business travel, temporary employees, professional
dues, publications and subscriptions, employee referral and signing bonus, professional development
funds, Leadership Academy, MAX program, no pay increases for salaried employees, tiered furloughs for
salaried employees, salary reductions for some salaried employees, no increase in contribution to salaried
defined benefit plan, reduced contribution to salaried defined contribution plan, elimination of PTO and
sick buy-backs, elimination of overtime and extra shift pay, and reduction in personnel as appropriate to
reduced service levels.
For FasTracks Operations, operating expenses include full allocation from Base to FasTracks for costs of
operating FasTracks services, which is a full allocation including administrative and support costs, and
which totals $31.0 million for 2021. FasTracks Operations also includes a $58.1 million estimated
service payment to Denver Transit Operators for commuter rail operations.
The operating/expense project carry-forward to 2021 is $10.4 million for Base System, $0.09 million for
FasTracks Project, and $2.6 million for FasTracks Operations.

Packet Pg. 100

2.B.4

Diesel fuel is budgeted at $2.03 per gallon, compared to a lock price of $2.00 per gallon in 2020.
Gasoline is budgeted at an average cost of $2.50/gallon in 2020, which is down from $2.90 in the
2020 budget. Total fuel usage will be lower in 2021 due to service reductions.
The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to the posted Requested
Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the initial Requested Budget
consist of carry-forward expense projects, various operating expense item reductions as detailed above,
new grant-funded expense projects, depreciation expense, and other minor items.
Interest expense in 2021 is budgeted at $175.7 million on a combined basis, an increase of $6.7 million
over the 2020 Amended Budget. Of total interest expense, $14.3 million is budgeted for Base System
and $161.4 million is budgeted for FasTracks. The increase is mainly due to interest beginning on the
TIFIA loan in 2021 for $10.7 million. FasTracks interest expense includes the TABOR interest expense
of $35.6 million.
Principal payments on debt will be $87.8 million on a combined basis, which is down $0.4 million from
the 2020 budget. Base System principal payments of $63.9 million are $1.9 million lower than the
2020 Amended Budget due to scheduled principal amortization on current debt and a refunding.
FasTracks principal payments of $23.9 million are $1.5 million higher than the 2020 Amended Budget
due to scheduled principal amortization on current debt offset by a refunding. The TABOR principal
payment of $10.7 million is included in the FasTracks debt payment. No new debt issuances are
planned in 2021 for either the Base System or FasTracks. Both will draw from previously issued debt to
fund major capital purchases and/or construction.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2020 (previously approved
capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2021. The capital carry-forward is
$452.2 million made up of $133.6 million on the Base System and $318.6 million on FasTracks.
New capital spending of $17.1 million on a combined basis will decrease $81.4 million from the 2020
Amended Budget. Base System new capital expenditures account for the entire $17.1 million,
consisting of the electric bus purchases project of $16.1 million funded by settlement funds, and $1.0
million in an innovative mobility project fully-funded by grants. FasTracks new capital expenditures are
estimated at zero. The Base System electric buses project was approved as part of the MTFP.
New capital expenditures for 2021 and the change in new capital in the 2021 Recommended Budget
over the 2021 Requested Budget are shown in Attachment B. The capital carry-forward expenditures
for 2021 and the change in the capital carry-forward in the 2021 Recommended Budget over the 2020
Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.
Fund balance and reserve accounts include an increase of $43.7 million to the Base System unrestricted
year-end fund balance for a total fund balance of $83.4 million. The actual amount realized may be
lower or higher than projected due to lower or higher fare revenue and sales tax revenue in 2021, which
will become evident in the 2021 amended budget. Also on the Base System, the Board-appropriated
fund is budgeted at $26.2 million, the capital replacement fund is budgeted to remain at $0, and the
unrestricted operating reserve is budgeted to be unchanged at $15.4 million. The total of these fund
balances is budgeted at $125.0 million for the Base System.
In FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the three key reserve funds (Board-appropriated, capital
replacement, and unrestricted fund) are maintained at 3 months of operating expenses and total $38.7
million in the 2021 budget. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) is budgeted at $137.3

Packet Pg. 101

2.B.4

million in 2021, an increase of $17.6 million.
estimated at $164.8 million.

Other designated reserve funds (unrestricted) are

On a District-wide basis, the total of the Board-appropriated fund, the capital replacement fund, the
unrestricted operating reserve and the unrestricted fund balance is budgeted to increase $34.9 million
over the 2020 Amended Budget. These fund balances are maintained in accordance with fiscal policies
for the Base System, FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations per Fund Balance Policy below.

Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2021 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly.

Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2021 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated fund, a
capital replacement fund, and the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance for both the Base
System and FasTracks, and an additional unrestricted operating reserve for the Base System. The
objective is for the total of these funds excluding the capital acquisition fund to equal approximately
three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for both Base System and FasTracks. The
2021 budget reflects maintenance of the FISA at a level considered sufficient to fund adjustments to
FasTracks operations and maintenance.
On a District-wide basis, the total of these fund balances (excluding the FISA) for 2020 is projected at
$163.7 million, comprised of 1) the Board-appropriated fund of $39.1 million, 2) the capital replacement
fund of $12.9 million, 3) the unrestricted operating reserve of $15.4 million, and 4) the remaining
unrestricted year-end fund balance of $96.3 million. The Base System portion of these fund balances
listed for 2021 is projected to total $125.0 million. The total combined fund balances excluding the
FISA are projected to be 20.3% of budgeted District-wide operating expenses including interest expense
at the end of 2021.

Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two
exceptions:
•
•
•
•

Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.
Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.

expenditures of $17.1 million, debt payments of $87.8 million, FasTracks Internal Savings Account of
$137.3 million, Board-appropriated fund of $39.1 million, capital replacement fund of $12.9 million,
unrestricted operating reserve of $15.4 million, and estimated unrestricted fund balance of $96.3
million. The previously approved capital (capital carry-forward) is $452.2 million. The sum of the
budget appropriation and capital carry-forward is $1.663 billion.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Debra Johnson, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

November 4, 2020

Subject:

PABs Refinancing Documents

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 4, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Bond Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Tax –
Exempt and Taxable Refunding Private Activity Bonds, Series 2020 (Denver Transit Partners Eagle P3
Project).
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
COVID-19 Financial Goal: Identify Funding Sources
2020 Strategic Priority #6: Move RTD Toward Stable Financial Condition
BACKGROUND
In 2010, RTD issued the Private Activity Bonds (PABs) as conduit issuer and lent the proceeds of the
PABs to Denver Transit Partners (DTP) to assist in financing the Eagle Project. (See attached 2010 RTD
Board of Directors Resolution.) The principal of and interest on the PABs are payable by DTP pursuant to
the 2010 Loan Agreement. The PABs do not constitute an indebtedness of RTD. However, DTP relies on
TABOR payments from RTD to pay debt service on the PABs. The PABs are subject to optional
redemption (refunding) on or any date after July 15, 2020. In September 2020 the RTD board voted to
authorize DTP to proceed with refinancing the Series 2010 Private Activity bonds.
DISCUSSION
The contractual documents required to effectuate the PABs refunding are identified in the Resolution and
include:
•
•
•
•
•

The Loan Agreement
The Trust Indenture
The Bond Purchase Agreement
The Preliminary Official Statement
The Continuing Disclosure Undertaking

Collectively, these documents comprise the “2020 Documents” as defined in the Resolution.
Substantially final drafts of the 2020 Documents are on file and available for review on the RTD Investor
Information webpage under the “Documents for Potential PABs Refunding”. The Investor Information
webpage can be found at the following link: https://www.rtd-denver.com/services/financials-investors
RTD Board approval of the 2020 Documents is required prior to the issuance of the PABs.

Packet Pg. 124

2.B.5

Resolution No. __ delegates to the General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer the authority (effective
for one year following the date thereof) to determine terms of the PABs, provided that: (a) the final
maturity of the Bonds shall be no later than December 31, 2044; (b) the maximum net effective interest
rate on the Bonds shall not exceed 5.00%; (c) the purchase price of the Bonds shall not be less than
98% of the par amount of the Bonds; (d) the maximum annual regularly scheduled payments of principal
and interest on the Bonds shall not exceed $37,780,000; (e) the maximum aggregate principal amount
of the Bonds shall not exceed $420,000,000; (f) the Bonds may be subject to optional redemption prior
to maturity, mandatory redemption, or extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption on such terms
and conditions as are permitted by the Act and determined by the General Manager or Chief Financial
Officer; and (g) the amount of savings from the refunding of the 2010 Bonds to be received by the
District pursuant to the Concession Agreement if taken as an upfront payment shall not be less than

Subject:

Masabi Contract Amendment

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 4, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves an increase to the contract with RTD’s mobile ticketing vendor, Masabi (contract #16DH050),
to a Not-to-Exceed (NTE) value from $1,450,000 to $8,867,000 (difference of $7,417,000), and
expansion of the Scope of Work to include Masabi’s Account-Based Ticketing (ABT) feature for the
remainder of that contract.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Mission-Oriented Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
2020 Strategic Priority #3 – Enhance Current and Future Transportation Methods
2021 Strategic Priority #4 – Increase Ridership and Improve Rider Experience (Implement Account-Based
Ticketing System)
BACKGROUND
Mobile Ticketing Program Success Story
RTD has three mobile app sales channels which allow customers to purchase fare products for bus and
rail; the RTD branded app (launched Nov 2017), Uber app (launched May 2019), and Transit app
(launched Sept 2019). Full fare, senior, individual with disabilities discount, and youth discount 3-hour
pass, day pass, and monthly passes, as well as, LiVE discount 3-hour and day passes are sold in all
three mobile app sales channels. All mobile tickets sold in the Uber app and Transit app cost the same as
they do in the RTD branded mobile app. 13.8% of the fare revenue generated January through March
2020 is from the mobile ticketing sales channel (all 3 apps combined). Since inception through August
2020, RTD has sold 5,407,774 tickets in the RTD branded app, 72,914 tickets in the Uber app, 31,074
tickets in the Transit app, and 128,405 tickets sold in other channels such as the mobile ticketing web
portal, and partner portal for a total of 5,407,774 mobile tickets valued at $32,855,175.
The mobile ticketing sales channel has been wildly successful. Sales have exceeded several other sales
channels and fare media offerings. In January 2018, mobile ticketing sales exceeded MyRide stored
value sales, in December 2018, they exceeded paper 10-ride ticket book sales, in December 2019, they
exceeded farebox sales, and in March 2020, they were expected to exceeded ticket vending machine
sales.

DISCUSSION
Account-Based Fare Collection System
Electronic Fare Operations resources and efforts are focused on launching a new Account-Based Fare
Collection feature to replace RTD’s existing, first generation card-based fare collection system from
Conduent. The $1.8M grant received from DRCOG, in 2019, will be used to purchase validators in a
competitive procurement. The new Account-Based Fare Collection System will consist of activating
Masabi’s Account-Based Ticketing (ABT) feature on RTD’s existing Masabi mobile ticketing platform and
connecting and integrating the new validators to the Masabi mobile ticketing platform. The ABT feature
allows smart cards and other media (such as a student ID or a contactless bank card) to be used as fare
media. Moving the Pass Program and MyRide product to the Masabi mobile ticketing platform will enable
RTD to improve customer experience and replace the current smart card system for a modern fare
collection system. Implementation will be conducted in a phased approach.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Account-Based Ticketing (ABT) Contract Amendment / Increase Contract Not-to-Exceed (NTE) Value
RTD pays Masabi implementation costs, license fees, commission and credit/debit card processing fees
(passed through to RTD at cost). Due to the incredible success of the mobile ticketing program, the
contract authority was exceeded approximately in August 2019. The team is requesting board approval
for an increase in contract NTE authority for the following reasons.
• The success of the mobile ticketing sales channel has resulted in higher than
expected sales and associated commissions/fees in excess of the 2017
authorization.
• To account for future commission and fee costs in excess of the 2017
authorization.
• Due to upcoming expansion work on the Fare Collection System by implementing
the ABT feature.
For these reasons, the team requests an increase in the Masabi contract NTE value from $1,450,000 to
$8,867,000 which represents an additional $7,417,000. Funding for project expenses have already
been budgeted through 2020. Commissions and fees are paid directly from associated sales.
Summary of justifications for the increase to the contract authority. (Details in the table below)
The higher than anticipated sales of mobile tickets have resulted in higher commissions and fees than
previously estimated and approved in the 2017 authorization in the amount of $1,134,000 from
November 2017 to September 2020. We also added a web portal functionality for $11,000 in late 2019
that allows customers to buy tickets through a website. Additionally, higher than anticipated future
sales of mobile tickets will result in commission and fees in the amount of $4,359,000 from October
2020 to March 2023. Finally, implementing the ABT feature will result in an additional cost of
$1,803,000.
Background information for Vendor Portal
We are also looking to add another functionality, a vendor portal that would allow our customers to
purchase mobile tickets at the RTD sales outlets with cash or checks. Tickets purchased through the
vendor portal appear in the customer’s mobile app ticket wallet. Implementation costs and the
commissions and fees associated with the anticipated additional sales would total about $110,000 from
early 2021 to March 2023.

2.B.6

RTD contracted with Four Nines Technologies to conduct a thorough analysis comparing Masabi total
cost of ownership over a 5-year period against some of the relative closest competitors. The findings
are attached separately as Attachment A – Total Cost of Ownership Report by Four Nines Technologies.
The report shows that Masabi, while not the least expensive, has one of the lowest up-front initial
implementation costs. A Masabi ABT sole source provides a savings of approximately $4,500,000 by
not duplicating efforts to redo work already implemented by RTD, and results in a project implementation
timeline savings in upward of 2 years. As a result of this analysis, RTD developed, evaluated and
approved a sole source justification (Attachment B) following the guidelines for substantial duplication of
costs and unacceptable delay in order to allow RTD to proceed with Masabi’s Account-Based Ticketing
feature in accordance with RTD’s procurement standards.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Debra Johnson, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

November 4, 2020

Subject:

Authorization of Fiscal Authority to the GM for
the North Metro Rail Line Project

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 4, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
(“Board”) increase the authority granted to the General Manager or designee to enter into all contracts,
real property transactions and intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Rail Line Project by
$35.2 million to a total authorization of $757.5 million. This authority shall include the ability to
negotiate and execute all contracts; work orders; change orders and contract modifications; agreements
for the acquisition and conveyance of property interests; and intergovernmental agreements that are
necessary or advisable to complete the North Metro Rail Line within the scope of the North Metro Rail
Line Project budget.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Strategic Priority #4: Increase Ridership, Improve Rider Experience.
BACKGROUND
As part of the RTD FasTracks Plan, the full North Metro Corridor is an approximately 18.5-mile-long
Commuter Rail line extending from Denver Union Station through the City and County of Denver, the
Cities of Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn and parts of Adams County. The initial segment of the
corridor, the N line to 124th Avenue, entered revenue service on September 21, 2020.
In November, 2013, the Board authorized eight actions related to the North Metro Rail Line project:
• Award of a design/build contract to Regional Rail Partners (RRP) for construction of the North
Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to 124th Avenue, with options to extend to 162nd
Avenue as funds become available.
• Provided the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts and
intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Rail Line Project in the amount not to exceed
the remaining project budget to 124th Avenue of $633.8 million.
• Provided the General Manager or designee with authority to accept grants or other contributions
and to increase the project budget in the amount of third-party contributions for project work
without further Board approval.
• Granted authority to the General Manager to exercise the option to extend to 162nd Avenue and
issue a notice to proceed for that phase, should funding become available, subject to presentation
to the board through the annual budget appropriation and with approval of financing provisions.
• Approved intergovernmental agreements (IGA) with the City of Commerce City, the City of
Thornton, and the City of Northglenn regarding the North Metro Rail Line project. Each IGA
includes specific terms defining the local agency contribution, coordination, and the rights and
responsibilities of each party within the boundaries of each municipality.
• Approved an IGA with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) regarding the North
Metro Rail Line project, including specific terms defining the coordination between CDOT and

Packet Pg. 179

2.B.8

RTD and the rights and responsibilities of each party associated with the construction of the
North Metro Rail Line, especially regarding interface with the state highway system.
In May 2014, the Board approved the issuance of Certificates of Participation (COPs) to fund a portion
of the North Metro Rail Line project, using the section of the corridor from Denver Union Station to
104th Avenue as collateral for the COPs. RTD issued the COPs in the par amount of $441 million in
July 2014.
In October 2014, the Board authorized the transfer of $16 million from FasTracks Railroad Right of Way
budget to a project to construct additional track sidings on the North Metro Rail Line. The Board did not
increase the General Manager’s contract authority for the project at that time.
In August 2015 the Board authorized an increase of $40 million to the North Metro project capital
budget through the Annual Program Evaluation to fund additional costs for hazardous materials, property
impacts, and the operations and maintenance interface with the Eagle project. At that time, the Board
also increased the General Manager’s contract authority by $56 million to cover these costs and the
previous authorization for the track sidings.
In March, 2016 the Board authorized the General Manager to execute contract amendments, change
orders and other necessary modifications to the Eagle Concession Agreement, or to enter into contracts
with subsidiaries and subcontractors of Denver Transit Partners (DTP) for purposes of North Metro Rail
Line vehicle and systems maintenance, dispatching and operations, up to the start of revenue passenger
operations on the N line. The resolution specified that this authority extended only to dollar amounts
included in the RTD annual budget, and the Board did not increase the General Manager’s contract
authority for the project at that time.
In October 2017 the Board authorized an increase of $52.7 million to the North Metro project capital
budget through the Annual Program Evaluation to fund additional costs for the current scope to
complete. The Board did not increase the General Manager’s contract authority for the project at that
time.
In October 2018, the Board authorized a settlement of claims with Regional Rail Partners in the amount
of $32.5 million and the transfer of $15 million from FasTracks Management Reserve to fund the initial
payment of settlement costs. The Board approved the total settlement amount as an increase to the
contract with RRP, and the increase to the project budget.
DISCUSSION
The intense nature of construction projects requires quick decision-making capability at the project level.
Failure to provide direction to contractors in a timely manner can result in delays or expensive rework.
Delays in approving change orders can also delay payments to contractors and subcontractors.
Similarly, the ability to acquire, dedicate exchange or dedicate property and property interests, enter into
third party agreements for goods, services, funds or mutually desirable change orders may be required in
time frames that are more abbreviated than board cycles.
Providing this delegation is consistent with previous Board actions for major corridor projects. Based on
this experience, the Board delegated fiscal authority to the amount of the remaining project budget at
the same time that it approved the contract for construction of the project.
At this time, the corridor has entered revenue service and is approaching contract closeout. However,
several outstanding issues remain on the project, which include, but are not limited to, the following:

the G Line opened on April 26, 2019 and the Southeast Rail Extension opened on May 17, 2019. Fares were suspended on April 5, 2020 and resumed on July 1, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic
The N Line opened on September 21, 2020. Fares are suspended for the first week and then will be only local fares for the first six months.
The second quarter 2020 SB154 ratio is 12.1% which is lower than the statutorially required 30% ratio. The low ratio is caused by the absence of fare revenue and reduction of taxes due to COVID.

(1) Variance is due to lower parts, suppliers and purchased transportation.
(2) Variance is due to lower labor, repair parts and purchased transportation.
(3) Variance is due to projects budgeted evenly across year but not yet started.
(4) Variance is due to timing of project expenses not yet incurred, many of which are grant-funded.
(5) Variance is due to lower outside security services costs.
(6) Variance is due primarily to timing of outside counsel costs related to litigation.
(7) Variance is due to timing of outstide IT services costs for projects.
(8) Variance is due to timing of outside printing costs for schedules, other outside services and special events.
(9) Variance due to purchasing card costs that initially get coded to this cost center until they can be coded to each cost center where they were incurred
(10) Variance due timing of hosting services charges for MinuteTraq.
(11) Variance due to timing of grant fund draws, particularly the Eagle P3 FFGA and preventive maintenance grants typcially drawn late in the year.

POLICY REFERENCE
Investment Policy
DISCUSSION
Please find the District’s investment report for the third quarter of 2020 attached.
Economic activity and employment picked up in recent months but remain well below levels experienced
at the beginning of the year. During the third quarter of 2020 as the coronavirus outbreak caused
tremendous human and economic hardships. The U.S. unemployment rate continued to decline during
the quarter and declined to 7.9% by the end of September. The continuation of social distancing in
response to the coronavirus outbreak continued to depress economic activity and long term interest
rates although credit spreads have continued to narrow.
The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee maintained the target range for the federal funds rate to
0.00 to 0.25 percent. The Committee stated that it expects to “maintain this target range until it is
confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum
employment and price stability goals.” This drastic reduction in short term interest rates is now directly
impacting returns on RTD’s financial investments.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance. The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return (yield plus change in market value) on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the
District’s unrestricted portfolio and investment benchmarks were as follows:

Fiscal Sustainability Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 4, 2020

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 10, 2020
Information

INFORMATION
This informational item is to update the Board with any changes to Fiscal Sustainability Task Force
recommendations. Per Board policy, an update is provided periodically on the status of the Task Force
recommendations.
BACKGROUND
A Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (Task Force) was formed in 2010 for the purpose of making
recommendations detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the
Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members
with 12 of those members being external to RTD.
The Task Force presented its written
recommendations to the Board of Directors in 2011. The Board of Directors subsequently approved
those recommendations and directed Staff to pursue implementation of each recommendation. The
Task Force reconvened for a final meeting in 2012 to be briefed on the progress of their
recommendations and provide an opportunity for feedback.
DISCUSSION
The Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy recommendations to
the Board of Directors, which were approved for further consideration and/or implementation. The
majority of the recommendations made have been completed or their status has not changed since our
last report in June 2020. Each recommendation is summarized below and expanded comments are
provided for those that have had a change in status since the last report.
Recommendations - Completed
Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
RTD contracted with the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business – Business Research Division
(Leeds) to provide sales and use tax forecasts beginning in 2011. These forecasts are updated semiannually by CU-Leeds each March and September.
Fund Balance Policy
Due to the volatility of RTD’s largest single revenue source, sales and use taxes, the Task Force
recommended implementation of a more robust fiscal policy regarding fund balances. In response to this
recommendation, RTD implemented a fund balance policy with a target level of three months of
operating expenses among applicable funds for both the Base System and FasTracks. Both entities are
expected to meet this goal in 2021.
Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
Exemption parity with the state of Colorado was identified by the Task Force as providing a benefit to
RTD during difficult economic conditions when the state implements exemption changes. In addition,

Packet Pg. 202

2.D.2

exemption parity removes the complexity to vendors of RTD having different taxable items than the
state. Through legislation introduced by RTD, exemption parity took effect in 2014.
Technology and Energy Innovation
In response to the Task Force recommendation, RTD conducted an energy review of the major operating
facilities and installed equipment and lighting upgrades where possible. RTD budgets for energy
upgrades throughout the District in each annual budget. We will continue to address energy efficiency
in building systems as on-going projects are completed.
Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
The Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) collects and audits sales and use taxes for RTD. The Task
Force identified an opportunity for revenue enhancement by performing additional sales and use tax
compliance reviews based on the favorable collection experiences of Colorado cities and municipalities
that implemented these reviews. While assessments from this effort exceeded the costs, it was not
clear to what extent those assessments would be collected. RTD staff decided not to extend the
contract for this work beyond 2015 due to the limited remaining opportunities for assessments outside
of the scope of work of the DOR.
Recommendations – Ongoing
Service Optimization
Service optimization was recommended by the Task Force and implemented with Board approval in order
to match services provided with available funding sources. Service modifications were brought forward
to accommodate new FasTracks lines opened since 2016. Certain service revisions are made with each
runboard period in response to public feedback, internal ridership, and utilization data. The Reimagine
RTD Project will review service optimization as part of the project scope. Service revisions were made
in 2020 in response to continuing labor shortages and the COVID-19 pandemic and revisions will
continue to be made in 2021.
Naming Rights
The first naming rights/corporate sponsorship agreement under the Board-adopted naming rights policy
was reached with the University of Colorado for naming the University of Colorado A Line and creating
an advertising presence on the Flatiron Flyer BRT line. The naming rights contract on the A Line will
conclude in April 2021. Any additional proposed naming rights/corporate sponsorship contracts will be
brought to the RTD Board for approval.
Partnerships and Privatization
The Task Force described this recommendation as a broad area that could include items such as
privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce expenses. These have included
the lease (retail) of the DUS historic building, lease of DUS bus concourse space to Greyhound, IGAs for
improvements to US36 and the East (A) Line, partnering with the City & County of Denver on Route 15L
improvements, partnering with the City & County of Denver on the 16th Street Mall to receive a grant
and share in the O&M costs, as well as TOD activities. RTD continues to look for partnership and
privatization opportunities on an ongoing basis.
Recommendations – Low Priority
The status of recommendations made by the Task Force and categorized as having lower priority
follows:

Packet Pg. 203

2.D.2

Charge for Parking
RTD currently charges parking fees to out-of-District patrons, in-District patrons who park longer than
24 hours, and for reserved parking. In 2016, RTD staff presented a parking management briefing at a
study session that focused on a consultant-led pay-for-parking study. In late 2016, the Board approved
the Parking Guiding Principles, which clarify how future changes to parking policy will be evaluated.
Tolling and Managed Lanes
The Task Force recommended investigating the possibility of RTD generating additional revenues
through charges for tolling and managed lanes.
Enacting this recommendation would require
coordination with CDOT and other agencies. The US36 BRT project is an example of how tolling and
managed lanes can enhance RTD operations and save costs.
Home Rule Initiative
The Task Force recommended that RTD consider becoming a “Home Rule” entity which would allow
RTD to collect and audit its sales and use taxes instead of the DOR. This initiative would require
legislation. The Colorado Municipal League and other entities recommended against it. It could only be
secured for RTD by statewide constitutional amendment. As noted earlier in this report, RTD has
effected simplification of state and RTD taxation through legislation that provides for uniformity on items
taxed.

Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program transitioned to
new rules after December 31, 2019.

DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.

As of September 30, 2020, 12,282 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 7,593 have been
approved, 3,649 have been denied, 1,026 are pending and the remaining 14 have been closed for other
reasons. Of the 3,649 denied, 2,111 were denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65
and older which entitles them to a better discount, 473 were denied because their address was out of
District, 81 were denied because it was a duplicate application, 81 were denied because the applicants
were already enrolled, 688 were denied because they did not respond to requests for a photo or
additional information, and 215 were denied because they did not meet the income threshold. Of the
1,026 pending applications, all lack an uploaded photo.
In the month of October 2020, 510 applications were approved.
The decrease in ridership caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the suspension of fare collection from
April to June 2020 have had a significant impact on the program. The number of approved applications
went from an average of 230 per week in the first two weeks of March to an average of 100 in April,
50 in May and June,110 in July and August, 123 in September, and about 117 in October.
The 7,593 LiVE participants enrolled as of September 30, 2020, provided a mailing address 1 in the
following counties: Denver 3,669, Arapahoe 1,697, Jefferson 857, Adams 710, Boulder 338, Douglas
88, Broomfield 32, and Weld 32. Note that some counties are only partially in the RTD District. 170
participants reside in the RTD District but provided a mailing address in a county outside of the District,
which is acceptable under the program rules.
From the implementation of the LiVE program through September 2020, we issued 610 LiVE MyRide
cards that were used for 15,250 trips. 3,010 mobile app users bought 38,650 mobile 3-hour passes and
day passes. Nonprofit organizations bought 139,840 LiVE paper tickets. We do not know how many
individual riders received LiVE tickets from nonprofit organizations since the number of tickets issued to
each client depends on the organization and the client’s situation.
We compared sales of LiVE mobile tickets and LiVE MyRide stored value to assess the drop in LiVE
ridership related to COVID-19. These sales only decreased by 23% between February and September
2020 (47% if adjusted for the fact that there were more LiVE participants in September than in
February). This is a significantly smaller decrease than the 67% COVID-related decrease in sales for the
same fare products across RTD’s entire customer base.

RTD kicked off a broader marketing campaign about all fare discounts, including LiVE,
starting with in-vehicle advertising and social media posts. In June, RTD issued social
media posts for each fare discount. We also included information about the fare discounts
in the communications and outreach related to resuming front door boarding and fare
collection on July 1.
We worked with Denver Human Services to adjust procedures due to the COVID-19
situation. The LiVE eligibility technicians are processing applications and provide customer
service remotely while the Denver Human Services offices are closed to the public. In
addition to the online application on PEAK, interested individuals have the option of
applying by phone, at least until the offices re-open.
Executed an amendment to the intergovernmental agreement with the City and County of
Denver to add the services of an Outreach Coordinator at Denver Human Services. The
person in this new position will assist eligible riders who face barriers to completing a LiVE
application. We plan to offer this service at rotating locations throughout the District, for
example in homeless shelters.
Created new LiVE informational materials based on feedback by customers, Denver Human
Services, and community-based organizations. This included a comprehensive questions &
answers document and short videos with basic information, how to apply, and how to use
the program. Updated the LiVE website for clarity and ease of use and added the new
materials and a new “partner toolkit” area.
Launched a new round of communications about the LiVE program. This included issuing a
news release and posting the new LiVE videos on social media. New communications
about the program and partner toolkit were emailed to community partners and RTD
Nonprofit Program customers. PEAK Outreach and Denver Human Services disseminated
the information through their email lists as well.

On-Going:
•
•
•
•

•

•

RTD is working with the State’s software vendor and Denver Human Services to work out
remaining “bugs” from the initial implementation in PEAK.
RTD is evaluating next activities for the marketing campaign about the discounts offered
by RTD, in accordance with the LiVE/All Discounts Communications Plan.
On-going communications with organizations in the RTD Nonprofit Program about program
rules, the application process, feedback, and changes due to the COVID-19 situation.
RTD is working with homeless services providers to develop and implement a temporary
LiVE ID card. Organizations that serve individuals in emergency situations will be able to
issue temporary LiVE ID cards to their clients after the PEAK application is completed. This
will eliminate the wait time between the LiVE application and the ability to use the
discounted tickets for these individuals.
Work with the City and County of Denver to add the services of an application outreach
worker who will help individuals apply for the LiVE Program at partner locations
throughout the District.
A survey for LiVE customers asking for feedback on all aspects of the LiVE program was

Packet Pg. 208

2.D.3

mailed in the week of October 26 to all current LiVE participants, with additional
communications going out to customers who provided an email address. We are asking for
information about the effectiveness of RTD communication, customer service provided by
DHS and RTD, application experience, fare products, demographics and income level, and
suggestions for improvement. LiVE participants can complete the survey by mail or online
until November 25.

Next Steps:
•
•
•

•
•
•

Denver Human Services has started the hiring process for the LiVE Outreach Coordinator.
Create policies, procedures, and agreements for the temporary LiVE ID card described
above.
Compile and analyze results of the survey of LiVE participants to determine common
themes and assist customers who indicate that there is an issue with their application or
LiVE ID card that was not resolved.
Prepare a program report after the LiVE participant survey information has been compiled
and analyzed.
RTD will continue to refine communications materials and outreach activities.
The team will use participation and usage numbers as well as feedback from customers,
partner organizations, and RTD staff to consider further enhancements to the program.
This will include re-assessing which fare products are available for LiVE.

In order to limit RTD’s handling of personally identifiable information for LiVE participants, RTD only
stores the mailing address of participants but not the home address. In most cases, however, home
address and mailing address are the same or in the same county.
