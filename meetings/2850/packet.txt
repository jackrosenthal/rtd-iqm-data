BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

From:

Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer

Date:

Board Meeting Date:

Subject:

May 2019 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the May 2019 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in
an annualized base system cost approximately $241,000 and a FasTracks cost impact of $4,745,900
and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as
necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability

DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and resources allow.
The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions.
The introduction of the Southeast Rail Extension service plan, which involves an extension of the E, F
and R Light Rail Lines in the South Metro area, is a notable part of this proposal. Also included is a
proposal to discontinue service on the Route 33 – Platte Valley, due to low ridership in an area with
overlapping transit service. A reduction of Saturday service to the Jefferson County Government Center
Station on the W Line light rail service is also proposed. With the expiration of grant funding for
expanded service on the Free Metro Ride and the review of ridership performance, it is proposed that
FMR service frequency be reduced. Additionally, a number of service changes aimed at increasing ontime performance and service reliability are included in these proposals. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC MEETINGS
Four public meetings were conducted between February 11th and 21st in Lakewood, West Denver and at
the Blake Administration Building Rooms T & D, with an additional presentation made at the City of
Golden offices. Comments and further details from these meetings and the service change website are
summarized in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATION
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following proposals have been significantly modified:
Route 15L – East Colfax: minor schedule adjustments.
Route 33 – Platte Valley: proposal rescinded for further analyses to address disparate impacts.
Route 51 – Sheridan Boulevard: After further analysis and customer input, the following existing Route
51 bus stops are proposed to be retained in the bus stop consolidation effort:
Northbound
Sheridan Blvd & 2nd Ave (16473)
Sheridan Blvd & Colfax Ave (nearside) (22707)
44th Ave & Eaton St (11124)
Southbound
Sheridan Blvd & 1st Ave (nearside) (26091)
Sheridan Blvd & 2nd Ave (16465)
44th Ave & Chase St (11115)
Route 120X – Thornton/Wagon Road: shifted 1st southbound AM trip to a leave time of 4:42am, in
order to address otherwise confusion with HOV lane entrance opening, as well as allowing for better
connections to E-Line at DUS.
Route JUMP –Boulder/Lafayette via Arapahoe: running time adjustments to address on-time performance
issues, specifically in the westbound direction.
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service improvements:
Route 15 – East Colfax: add midday trips to address passenger capacity concerns.
Southeast Rail Extension (SERE): E, F and R Lines: implement service on new light rail extension.

Routes proposed for service reductions:
Route 33 – Platte Valley: proposal rescinded.
Free Metro Ride – 18th-19th Street: reduce frequency from 15 trips per hour to 8 trips per hour.
W – Line (Light Rail - Denver Union Station to Jefferson County Gov. Center/Golden Station): reduce
Saturday service frequency between Federal Center and Jefferson County Government Center Stations.

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/ service Efficiencies:
Route 1 – 1st Avenue: change to eastern terminal location from Birch/Virginia to Leetsdale/Cherry.
Route 44 – 44th Avenue: route alignment changes between Broadway and Downing.
Route 51 – Sheridan Boulevard: formalize current detour in Englewood and bus stop consolidation.
Route 131 – Iliff: reroute of alignment around the Iliff Station (R Line).
Route 120X – Thornton/Wagon Road: shifted 1st southbound AM trip

Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments:
Route 0 – South Broadway
Route 15L – East Colfax
16/16L – West Colfax
Route 36L – Fort Logan Limited
Route 65 – Monaco
Route JUMP –Boulder/Lafayette via Arapahoe:
Changing to summer service levels for routes DASH, SKIP, and STAMPEDE. Other route related interline
changes as result of a change to summer service levels: (204,205, 225,206/206F, and 208/208F.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a base system cost of approximately
$243,300 and a FasTracks cost impact of $4,745,900.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed May 2019 service changes has
resulted in the adjustment of the proposals and as result, disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or
low-income populations have been ameliorated.

Route 51 – Sheridan Boulevard
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
This proposal would, formalize the current 4-block route detour in Englewood, which was
put into effect due to the City having converted a part of Elati Street into a one-way
operation. The new Southbound route direction from Kenyon Street would be left on
Galapago, right on Ithica, left on Elati, to regular route. The new northbound routing from
southbound Elati, right on Ithica, left on Galapago, right on Kenyon, to regular route.

1.B.1.a

Route 131 – Iliff
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Reroute north/eastbound buses via Anaheim instead of Abilene Street, north of Yale.
Provides better access for Heather Gardens residents by serving the eastbound stop at
Yale/Abilene. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route JUMP –Boulder/Lafayette via Arapahoe
Service Standard type - Suburban Local - (10%-4.7 pass. per hr. / 25%-11.4 pass. per hr.)
Running time adjustments to address on-time performance issues, specifically in the
westbound direction. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Free Metro Ride – 18th-19th Street
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Due to lower ridership (down from 82 passengers per hour to 62 passengers per hour) it is
recommended that the Free Metro Ride peak frequency be reduced from 15 trips per hour
to 8 trips per hour. Cost savings to FasTracks is estimated to be -3,570 hours and $281,500
annualized.
Changing to summer service levels for routes BOUND, DASH, JUMP, SKIP, and STAMPEDE
Other route related interline changes as result of a change to summer service levels: (204,
225,206/206F, 208/208F and Y.

RAIL
W Line - Light Rail/ Denver Union Station to Jefferson County Gov. Center/Golden Station)
It is proposed to reduce service between Federal Center Station and Jeffco Government
Center/Golden Station on Saturdays to every 30 minutes, consistent with Sunday service.
Under the proposed changes, this will require 6 all day trains rather than 7 as is used
currently and will be a savings of 1 all-day train. This will impact approximately 392
passengers who will need to choose a departure either 15 minutes earlier or 15 minutes
later. Anticipated FasTracks cost savings are estimated to be 728 hours and $134,600
annualized.
Southeast Rail Extension (SERE)
The Southeast Rail Extension Project is part of RTD’s 2004 voter-approved FasTracks plan
to expand rapid transit across the Denver metro region. The project will extend the Southeast
Rail Line 2.3 miles from Lincoln Station to RidgeGate Station in Lone Tree. There will be
three new light rail stations: Sky Ridge Station near Sky Ridge Medical Center; LoneTree
City Center Station; and a 1,300-space Park-n-Ride at the RidgeGate Station (Sky Ridge and

Lone Tree Stations will be “Kiss-n-Ride” stations). Anticipated cost impacts to FasTracks
are estimated to be 6,350 hours and $5,162,000 annualized.

F – Line 18th/Stout Station to Lincoln Station
It is proposed to extend the F Line Light Rail route to the Ridgegate Parkway Station
according to the 2004 FasTracks Southeast Rail Extension plan. In addition to extending
the line to the new station, minor running time adjustments are proposed. This proposal will
require 1 extra all-day train for a total of 8 all-day trains.
R – Line Peoria Station to Lincoln Station
It is proposed to extend the R Line Light Rail route to the Ridgegate Parkway Station
according to the 2004 FasTracks Southeast Rail Extension plan. This proposal will require
1 extra all-day train for a total of 10 all-day trains during week days. It also proposed to
increase weekend frequencies to 15 minutes all day in order to bring total rail service into
compliance with the Southeast Rail Extension FTA Full Funding Grant Requirements. This
will be an increase of 4 additional all-day trains for a total of 10 all-day trains on weekends

Staff in attendance included Jessie Carter, Jeff Dunning, Cooper Langdon, Maux Sullivan,
Kim Kinnison, Jeff Becker, Tegan Rice, and Public Outreach Staff. There were 6 members
from the public in attendance, along with Natalie Menten with the RTD Board.
Terin Blale – Lives in District B and is low income and transit dependent. She has an issue
with the times we hold our public meetings and doesn’t think they are held at times our
general riding public can attend. She also doesn’t like the information pamphlets we produce
for our service changes because they are too vague in their description and are not placed
where the majority of the public will see them. She also stated that RTD needs to provide
more, not less service, if they want to increase ridership. Finally, she doesn’t understand
why RTD continues to raise fares while, at the same time, reducing service.
Karen Vent – She wanted to thank RTD for the service we provide and for having the public
meeting to discuss service changes. She lives in Broomfield and thinks we need more
service on Sundays and Holidays because she currently has very few options. Ideally, she
would like to extend route 225 in order to provide Sunday and Holiday service to the
Broomfield area.
Natalie Menten – She made a brief statement regarding our public meetings and how they
help people to better understand our service changes. She also pointed out that we have a
website where the public can go and make a statement regarding the proposed service
changes.
Scott Ramming – He is concerned about the proposed FMR schedule and worries that is will
lead to an eventual cancellation of the route. He also has concerns about the new route 44
routing and how it will work with the new grocery store complex to be built near Lawrence
and Downing. He also wanted to know if the W-Line reductions were allowed if the service
was tied to federal grant funding. He was told that the W-Line has no such restrictions.
Chris Tenorio – He is very concerned about the stop nearside of Colfax, on Sheridan in the
northbound direction on route 51 and does not want that stop closed, as proposed for the
May service change. He said if we close that stop, many passengers will miss their
connection to route 16 and having to cross the Colfax intersection if very dangerous.
Elizabeth – She has complaints about the 122X and how busy most of the trips are. She
said it is very common to have standing room only trips and doesn’t think that is safe. She
said if you are at the wrong stop, the bus is already full when it arrives and you end up
having to wait for the next bus and hope to get on. She also asked how she would go about
getting Weld County included in the RTD District. She currently lives in Weld County and
has been trying to get the county to join the RTD District. Jessie Carter gave her some

information on how best to get that accomplished. She also wanted to know about any
new service coming to the area north of 120th. She also made a general statement about
her concerns regarding RTD reducing service and raising fares.

Staff in attendance included, Jyotsna Khattri (Communications) and Jessie Carter (Service
Planning and Scheduling). The meeting began with 4 members of the public in attendance.
Glenda Battels - Rides the Route 33 to works at the Denver Water Department. Without the
service she would have a long 15-minute walk from Alameda Station to work each day. She
asked that if the Route 33 is cancelled, could RTD consider extending the Route 8 back to
Denver Water?
Carol Streamer - Heard from a passenger, who is blind and in a wheelchair, that the last bus
stop consolidation effort moved a bus stop from a location without a sidewalk. She could
not recall the route name or location of the stop. She also provided a general comment that
RTD does not provide enough shelter location throughout the District.
Joe Sorlo - Referencing the bus stop consolidation proposal for the Route 50/51, noted that
the stop distance created by the elimination of the bus stop at 44th-Chase Street would be
inconsistent with the RTD stop distance policy. He asked that the stop at Fenton be
considered, though he felt the stops in the Mountain View community.

Staff in attendance included Kim Kinnison, Maux Sullivan, Lindsey Alarcon (Public Outreach),

along with RTD Board members Natalie Menten and Peggy Catlin.
Debbie Poland – was very concerned about the following issues:


72L - “The 72L has been consistently inconsistent since drivers change in January.
Most of the time it has been a little late to a lot. We seem to have different drivers
all the time. People missed the bus this morning because driver was early. Arrived at
P&R almost 4 minutes early.”



Complaint: The bridge is out at Indiana & 72nd and it seems that the newer drivers
don’t know about it and therefore don’t know they need to detour around it. Drivers
need to be better informed ab out how to reroute around the bridge outage.



Ward Rd PnR - Wondered what will happen to park-n-ride once G Line opens. Wanted
to confirm that it would be removed/no longer in service. Stated that customers and
those that work nearby that park there or that seem to be parked there for long
periods of time will definitely be upset that it’s gone.



0 - They catch the 0 at Union Station to get to work. Says that the connection is
always very tight, so they end up running to catch the bus every time. Wanted to
ensure that the proposed schedule adjustments would not make this any worse. Also
wondered why the 0 was re-routed from Welton to Lawrence. The bus used to drop
right outside of their office building, but no longer does due to the re-route last service
change.



Free Metro Ride - Concerned about schedule reductions. They already have trouble
in catching the FMR consistently, and therefore, usually chooses to take the 0
instead. Fears the proposed service cuts will make it even more unreliable and
infrequent.



G Line - Wanted an update on the progress of the G Line. Concerned that G Line
opening will have a negative impact on their commute due to the rerouting of the
72L to connect to the G Line. Said they will likely change their commute to drive to
a park-n-ride served by the Flatiron Flyer or to Westminster to catch the B Line instead
once the G Line opens.



Safety - When prompted by security, stated they had some concerns about safety
about the 72nd and Ward Rd PnR due to cars that are parked there for long periods
of time, and seeming lack of maintenance and upkeep of the facility, citing specifically
light outages and need for parking stripes to be repainted.



Privacy - Also, they refuse to use the restrooms at Union Station bus depot since the
doors have been removed.

2019 Service Changes
GOLDEN MAYOR & CITY COUNCIL COMMENTS
Mayor Marjorie Sloan
Mayor emphasized Golden’s longstanding support of transit and RTD - especially the W Line
and establishing and bolstering first and last mile connections. She cited examples including
Golden securing full funding for a pedestrian bridge over 6th (which was originally part of
the W Line plan, but later scrapped) which is now well used; working together with the
Colorado School of Mines and Jefferson County to fund an additional weekend vehicle for
the Flex Ride service so that it matches the weekday service; establishing a bike library; and
continuing to build sidewalk connections to make Golden more walkable.
Councilor Laura Weinberg
Stated that Golden has continued to invest in transit to encourage ridership, but that when
the service becomes more expensive and less convenient, it makes it harder to justify
investment and achieve higher ridership. Recognized RTD’s difficult role and responsibility
to serve the whole district area. Mentioned that reducing the Saturday service wasn’t much
of a cost savings and doesn’t warrant a schedule change. Doing so, would encourage more
people to use the Federal Center as the end of the line, isolating and bypassing Golden.
The mayor concluded the session by stating that cutting service and increasing fares is
counterproductive to “our mutual goals” (meaning RTD and the City of Golden).
Councilor Jim Dale
Stated that the biggest influence on ridership is service intervals and cost to ride. Emphasized
that this change not only impacts Golden riders, but those coming from Denver to Golden either for the services available in the area or for tourism. The expensive fare especially
affects local college students and veterans. Concluded that cheaper and more frequent
service would boost ridership.
Mentioned later that he is a representative on the Denver Regional Council of Governments
(DRCOG), which looks at alternative transportation modes in the effort to have the region
be more multimodal and transportation to be more efficient. Wants to know how RTD is
helping with those initiatives. Wants to work with RTD.
Councilor Rob Reed
Was especially concerned how the change would impact connections to and from the Airport
and that waiting at Union Station with baggage for long periods of time in the cold is not
appealing. Mentioned other efforts he’s involved in to revitalize Colfax and that the Route
16 does not serve Colfax up by Golden, and efforts to better connect south Golden, a lowincome area. Said service change and fare increase is inconsistent with these efforts.
Concerned that encouraging people to drive to Federal Center because of less frequent
service and higher fares at Jeff Co/Golden Station encourages people to drive which could
lead to more accidents and is unsafe.
Councilor Paul Haseman
Took issue with the fare zone system. Argued that Golden should be a local fare because
Veterans and students can’t afford the higher cost. The cost to ride the W Line [to or from
Denver] is inconsistent with how much Golden values transit. “Golden is worth it.”

Councilor Saoirse Charis-Graves
Wanted to echo the other council members’ comments. Emphasized that Golden has unique
services - social services, human services, courts and legal services, etc - that draw people
to the area. Many such people are dependent on transit to get there. Making it more difficult
for people to access theses services is a “crime.”
PUBLIC COMMENTS
Mike Hughes - New to the area. He just founded the West Corridor Transportation
Management Association, which is interested in increasing ridership. RTD should think about
connecting the W Line and the G Line via bus services, sees a lot of potential there. Also
wants to work with local businesses/employers to increase amount of EcoPass holders.
Wants RTD to make the Eco-Pass process less complicated. Long term, wants there to be a
rail connection into state capitol area of downtown Denver, and double tracking out to
Golden. In the past, he facilitated RTD fare change discussions and the consultant came up
with the different fare zones while the citizens wanted a flat rate. Believes a flat rate would
boost ridership.
Karen Oxman - Former Golden City Council member. Had just taken a trip from DIA to Golden
using RTD rail services that day. Said she had to help other passengers at the airport get
their tickets, thinks the ticketing is too complicated. She is more concerned about Golden
being in Fare Zone C than the proposed service change to the W Line. Thinks the fare zone
structure needs to be re-evaluated.
Dan O’Neil - Believes City Council represented Golden residents’ concerns very well. Finds
the fare zones to be impractical, and that the system map should be geographically accurate
and show the fare zones as concentric circles, current system map is impractical. Feels that
reducing service is counterproductive to the goal of boosting ridership.
Bob Eugan - Commends RTD for the great rail access to Denver and to the airport. Thinks
the W Line is the best thing that’s happened in the 60 years he’s lived in Golden. Uses the
service frequently. Thinks the time to get to the airport from Golden is convenient especially
since you don’t have to deal with traffic.
Don Cameron - The fact that Golden is a terminal makes it a draw, but decreasing service
will make Federal Center Station more like terminal and more of a draw. That plus the
cheaper fares will boost ridership at Federal Center. The W Line has the lowest subsidy per
boarding of any of the RTD lines and it’s because the Jeff Co Station is in a different fare
zone. Jeff Co/Golden Station should be in Zone B.
Scott Webber - Went to an Avs game on New Year’s Eve. On the way back he and his friend
got dropped off at Federal Center and had to wait for another train in the cold. He was very
angry because his friend’s feet got so cold she was almost in tears. Golden residents get
screwed both ways with the regional fares and the less frequent service.

JJ Trout - Works for People for Bikes, which conducted a research study of what motivates
peoples’ mobility decisions. Findings indicated that traffic was a significant motivating factor
for people to find alternatives to driving. Study also found that people choose transportation
modes that work with their schedules. Reduction in service will make people less likely to
choose transit because it may not work with their schedule. RTD should also find a way to
make fares cheaper for residents.

Staff included Jessie Carter and Dan Merritt and RTD Board Member Angie Rivera-Malpiede
attended. There were 6 members from the public in attendance
Sharlene Dianne Holt - Stated a concern about how the proposed elimination of route 33
would affect Access-A-Ride. Staff answered that it would not be impacted. She also
requested that the northbound route 88 needs to operate later in the evening.
Adam Hunt – Stated that route 88 and that it should have more service extended later. He
also complained that route 88 bus operators in general are rude to him when he requests
the use of the bus ramp.
Micah Puett – Stated that A-Line trains often operate ‘late’ in the westbound direction. He
explained that he uses the R,A,and B Lines to get to/from Anschutz. He said the late running
A-Line, in the westbound direction in the PM, makes it difficult to connect to the B-Line. The
recent fare increase has compounded his frustration with the late running A-Line. He said
RTD should do more to coordinate with DTO.
Yenchen Chang – Complained that R-Line trains often are running ‘hot’ (ahead of schedule),
breaking timed Anschutz Shuttle connections. Also stated that R-Line trains need better
cleaning and should operate with 2-car trains. Stated that the RTD “Next Ride” real-time
app does not work well for Light Rail and Commuter Rail trains and it needs to be more userfriendly.

While I know it may
not be feasible to

the 10 drops me off

concerning
the

It has come to our

used to regularly
stop at Water Street

7th

which is 0.3 miles
from the Children’s
Museum entrance,
has

and no longer stops
here on weekends.
This
has
greatly

transportation to our
location. As I am
sure you know, this
area becomes very
congested,
especially on the
weekends,
with
travelers commuting
to the Children’s
Museum, the Denver
Aquarium,
REI,
Highland Park, LoDo,
Elitch Gardens and
Mile High Stadium.
Reducing stops on
this bus line during
weekday
work

completely

on the weekends
(during our peak
visiting hours) will
greatly affect our

stop

our

its

Limiting this bus stop
will
affect
the
community and citywide
profits.
Finally, we are aware
that it is your policy
to post any changes
to a bus route at the

your
policy
that

of the problem with

You all are proposing
to eliminate stop
11124 at Eaton and
44th. Please do not
eliminate it because
it is the best stop in
the area. It has a pull
in for the bus so
stopping does not
impede traffic. It is
closer to the major
stores. You should
put a shelter there
and trash cans as
there are none and a

the stop at Depew as
it is less centrally
located. Also please
stop stopping the 44
at Kipling at 7pm. It
is a inconvenience as
it makes me walk 2

seems that shutting
the bus down affects
our ability to see the
bus on Next Ride and
it also doesn’t allow
us to board the bus
early.There is about
a ten-minute layover
at stop 26526 so it
wouldn’t affect the
running schedule to
make one of these
adjustments.
It
would be extremely
helpful for those of
us
needing
to
transfer
to
the
limited buses, the
route 1, and for
those who now have
to walk further to get

it’s

The recent change to
the 16/16L route to
stop by Oak Station
is really nice, but
could be a lot handier
for commuting to
downtown if the
schedule
matched
the W line better. If
the eastbound route
ran 5 minutes earlier
in the morning and
the westbound route
ran 5 minutes later in
the evening, it would
be very convenient
for folks commuting
from
Golden
to
downtown.
Regarding the rider
alert at Sheridan
Boulevard and Colfax
nearside
stop
number
22707.
There are always
passengers that get
off at this stop who
need to catch the
eastbound
16.
Busses usually stop
anyway for red lights
at this stop. There
would be a lot of
irate passengers if

bus drivers are not
allowed to let off
passengers at this
stop. It affects route
50 and route 51
northbound.
I have been an F line
regular daily rider
(Dry Creek station)
for over 6 years and
my concern is the
growing number of
riders and the lack of
seating on the trains,
particularly
during
Monday thru Friday
rush hour on both
north
and
south
bound trains. It used
to be that the trains
were rarely standing
room only – now
they are completely
full by the Belleview
station (going north
bound)! It doesn’t
help that there are
only 3 cars when
there used to be 4.
Taking all of those
rows of seats out
doesn’t help with
lack of seating –
particularly on the

middle light rail cars
that don’t access the
wheel chair ramp
anyway. But what’s
done is done on that
one. I guess it just
makes more room to
stuff the standing
riders.
I dread to
think how packed
the trains will be
when the Ridgegate
line opens in May. I
am unable to attend
the public meetings
on the 11th as I will
be out of town, but
I’m sure I’m not the
only one with these
concerns.
I hope
that the F line trains
will all have 4 cars
during peak hours
and
that
the
frequency of the
trains
will
be
increased.
I really love taking
the light rail and I
believe that RTD
does a great job in
general. I also am a
big believer in public
transportation

First of all, thanks for
all you do. I saw the
profile of your group
on
9News,
everything you have
to put up with and
the good humor with
which you deal with
it. You've always
been helpful to me
when I've written in,
and I appreciate it.
Now, about the F line
extension, I can't
attend any of those
public meetings so
will
submit
my
concerns here, which
are about volume of
ridership at weekday

rush hours. I have
some
mobility
issues; I don't have
to use an assistive
device but do need a
seat on the train. I
have adjusted my
work hours earlier so
that I'm sure to get
one,
and
I
do
although the trains
are still pretty darn
crowded early in the
morning and early
afternoon.
My
request is that RTD
consider scheduling
sufficient frequency
of trains running
during morning and
afternoon rush hours
to
accommodate
what I expect will be
an
increase
in
ridership, so that I
and others like me
can still get a seat. I
know
that
the
number of cars on
the light rail can't be
go
beyond
four.
Thank you!

I'm not confident
that the RTD Service
Planning
staff
member I spoke to
after the noon public
hearing on February
11th at the RTD
offices heard my
concern
correctly.
The staff member's
responses seemed to
be consistent with a
proposal to split the
Free
Metro
Ride
route so that half of
the buses would
travel on 18th Street
and half on 20th
Street. That was not
my concern. I was
attempting to convey
that Free Metro Ride
service
on
18th
Street downtown and the earlier Route
0 service that was
replaced by lessfrequent Route 20
service
at
the
January
2019
service changes - has
value to people who
work or live along
20th Street in ways

that
service
concentrated along
15th Street does not.
Measuring
along
Arapahoe Street, it's
about a half mile
between 20th Street
and 15th Street. This
is roughly double the
industry
standard
that passengers are
willing to walk about
a quarter mile to
reach a bus stop.
This calculation does
not
include
any
walking along 15th
Street to reach a
stop for the desired
route because of the
X/Y/Z
skip-stop
pattern.
The
distance
between
20th Street and 18th
Street is about 0.2
miles,
and
thus
within the industry
standard quarter-mile
threshold.
I would
argue
there's
sufficient service on
15th Street that RTD
would also able to
support

corridor along 18th
Street, and therefore
grow
ridership,
rather than cutting
service. Indeed, the
January
2019
service changes to
reroute the Route 0
were explained to me
as giving the Free
Metro Ride a chance
to serve the 18th
Street demand. Now
RTD is proposing to
roughly half the Free
Metro Ride service.
Thank you for your
consideration.
While the g line is still

I have recently seen
a increasing amount

Aurora Metro Center
just to immediately
transfer at the Florida

Because there is no

to suggest having
the H line extended

allow people to take

the opportunity to

often

cancelled,
over
crowded and take
too long.
I'm an
advocate for mass

the current level of

worth the time, cost

frustration.
During rush hours,
skipping every other

type of adjustment

should

Public

Children's Museum I Route 10 Changes at Water Street and 7th Street

Good Afternoon,
My name is Teila Theisen and I am the Executive Assistant at the Children's Museum of Denver at Marsico
Campus. I am emailing you on behalf of our President & CEO, Mike Yankovich, concerning the recent changes to
RTD Bus Route 10 at Water Street and 1h Street.
It has come to our attention that the Route 10 Bus, which used to regularly stop at Water Street and 1h Street,
which is 0.3 miles from the Children's Museum entrance, has undergone several service changes. It looks as
though Route 10 ceases to stop at Water/1h at 3pm and no longer stops here on weekends. This has greatly
affected our Museum staff and guests who take public transportation to our location. As I am sure you know, this
area becomes very congested, especially on the weekends, with travelers commuting to the Children's Museum, the
Denver Aquarium, REI, Highland Park, LoDo, Elitch Gardens and Mile High Stadium. Reducing stops on this bus
line during weekday work commute hours, and completely eliminating this stop on the weekends (during our peak
visiting hours) will greatly affect our operations.

RTD Buses, specifically Route 10, allows passengers living with disabilities to conveniently visit these communitybased organizations with ease. It also allows families traveling with young children to visit our Museum and it's
neighboring attractions safely and easily. This bus stop and our partnership with RTD, supports both Denver's
more marginalized groups and its highest tourism population. Limiting this bus stop will affect the community and
city-wide profits.
Finally, we are aware that it is your policy to post any changes to a bus route at the bus stop. It is also your policy
that passengers traveling with disabilities (which includes members of our staff and guests) will be accommodated
in a service change. Neither of these requirements have been met in this case.
I am emailing you today to ask that you please reinstate the regular Route 10 bus stop schedule for Denver locals

and visitors. Please support our organization and its beliefs in inclusivity in making this change. We will be
communicating with members of your leadership team and the Board of Directors until this change is reversed.
Thank you for your concern.

May 2019 Temporary Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required, for information only. The following service change proposals are temporary in nature
and are likely to be modified in through the formal process in future service change proposals.
DISCUSSION
Applewood Village / 38th & Youngfield
Due to new development at the Applewood Center, the transit terminal at 38th-Youngfield will need to
be moved near term May 2019). The transit terminal relocation affects customers and the operations of
Routes 28, 32, 38 and 44. The new temporary terminal location will be at the former Ward Road park-nRide (just north of I-70 and west of Ward Road. Permanent relocation of these services are being
evaluated with consideration of system performance, future Wheat Ridge developments and the
implementation of the G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan. (map on Attachment A)
Route 225 – Boulder/Broomfield via Baseline & US 287
In effort to address neighborhood concerns (along Talbot Street and Inca Street) and allow for safe and
accessible service, it is proposed to extend the trips currently ending at Mohawk Street and Talbot
Street to Lafayette Park-n-Ride. This effort will maintain the current 15 minute AM and PM peak
frequency on weekdays, and half-hour frequency on Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays. More extensive
service change proposals affecting this and other routes in this area are pending further analyses. (map
on Attachment B)
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Fourth Quarter of 2018. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 41 performance measures
tracked for the GM, RTD met 34 of the goals in the fourth quarter. The following is a discussion of
the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – Maintain System-Wide On-Time Performance
Regional on-time service at 87.0% did not meet the goal of 92.0% but was improved over 2017
and showed no change from the third quarter.
Goal 5.1 – Improve ADA On-Time Performance
ADA on-time performance of 86.6% at was below goal of 96.0%. For 2019, the goal of 86.0%
will reflect passenger on-time performance, which is consistent with fixed route.
Goal 6.2 – Increase in Ridership
Ridership for 2018 was down 1.4% from 2017. The decline was centered in bus service, and
mirrors the national trend. In 2017, ridership declined 1.9% from the prior year.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue
Year-end fare revenue was up 2.7% over 2017 but was short of the budgeted annual goal of 3.0%.
Goal 6.4 – Monitor Selected Internal Functions for Efficiency
The number of audits performed during 2018 met 90% of goal, due to under-staffing in this area.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
Both bus operator vacancies and mechanic vacancies exceeded their goals at year-end due to
attrition, retirements, system growth, and full employment in the strong local economy.

Re:

Service Availability – February 2019

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.40% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in February 2019. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflect a significant
decrease compared the same month (February) last year. Service delivery has improved
significantly since June 2018. Lost service for personnel related reasons follows:





February 2019 – 441.27 hours
February 2018 – 996.09 hours
Year to date hours for 2019 – 565.46 hours
Year to date hours 2018 – 1660.13 hours

While RTD did provide in excess of 99.40% of all scheduled hours of service in the month, it
was necessary to cover 2,293 shifts with operators working a 6th day (one of their scheduled
days off). This represents approximately 18,344 hours of service being provided by a “6th
day” RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our
contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev.
Additional information regarding bus operator headcount follows:

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in February were 3 extreme winter weather
events (coldest and highest snow year than the last ten years), planned/unplanned rail shuttles
(bus bridges), special events (Cupid Undie Run), and flu outbreak. Staff continues to
collaborate with our partners to address and implement measures to attract, retain and sustain
skilled employees.
* Note: Year to date numbers for 2018 in recruitment/retention graph reflect the end of the

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: March 5, 2019

From:

Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations

GM

Date:

March 5, 2019

Board Meeting Date: March 12, 2019

Subject:

Special Services 4th Quarter 2018 Report

DISCUSSION
RTD currently provides Call-n-Ride (FlexRide) service in 21 distinct service areas throughout the District.
The fourth quarter of 2018 ended on a high note as staff and the private contractors began preparing for
the much anticipated re-naming of Call-n-Ride services to FlexRide. This included preparing 32 new
white buses complete with the new FlexRide name and an updated graphics design for January 2019
service. In addition, staff sent out advance notice of the upcoming change to every community that has
Call-n-Ride service.
The performance for Call-n-Ride (FlexRide) service is measured on the following performance indicators:
Ridership, Productivity (boardings per hour), Safety (accidents), and Customer Satisfaction (customer
comments). The following is a discussion of Call-n-Ride (FlexRide) performance through the 4th Quarter
of 2018.
Ridership
Total Call-n-Ride (FlexRide) ridership for 2018 was less than the prior year. One of the factors
contributing to the decrease is low fuel prices, which gives customers a low-cost alternative to using the
Call-n-Ride service. The total ridership numbers for all Call-n-Rides (FlexRides) are as follows:
4th Quarter 2018 – 476,303
4th Quarter 2017 – 482,597
Productivity
A number of Call-n-Rides (FlexRides) continue to show high productivity. Most of these serve business
parks that connect with the light rail (Arapahoe, Meridian, North Inverness and South Inverness) or
communities where residents have embraced the service (Golden and Superior). Staff continues to
monitor Call-n-Rides (FlexRides) with low productivity and works with the local municipalities and RTD
Marketing to identify strategies for improving ridership. The re-naming of this service as FlexRide is
anticipated to generate renewed interest in the service.
The attached “2018 Special Services 4th Qtr Report” provides the productivity numbers for each of the
Call-n-Rides (FlexRides) and some other special services for which RTD provides cost-share funding. The
acceptable level of productivity for Call-n-Ride (FlexRide) service is 3.0 boardings per hour.
Customer Comments
Unfortunately, 2018 showed an increase in operator-related customer comments. The increase is
attributed in large part to the high number of new operators. The contractors experienced high turnover
in the operator ranks in 2018. The contractors continue to address performance issues with operators
individually. Additionally, the contractors have implemented hiring and retention strategies to help
stabilize the workforce.
Customer comments are reviewed on a daily basis. Those comments that are considered operator
related (within the operator’s control) are monitored for trends and improvement. In 2018, customer
comments were further monitored for “at fault” and “not at fault” classification, based on the

Packet Pg. 83

investigation and review of the comment. The number of operator-related customer comments are as
follows:
4th Quarter 2018
At fault
35
Not at fault
71
Commendations 47
4th Quarter 2017
All comments
57
Commendations 53
The number of all other customer comments received regarding Call-n-Ride (FlexRide) service (requests
for new service or a change in service which can include boundary changes, service day and hours, web
site issues, no return calls, etc.) are as follows:
4th Quarter 2018 = 419
4th Quarter 2017 = 380
Preventable Accidents
Preventable accidents increased through the 4th quarter of 2018 primarily due to new driver hires.
Contractors have retrained “at risk” operators identified as being involved in minor accidents and have
increased the number of “ride-alongs” performed by operations specialists and training staff.
The number of preventable accidents are as follows:
4th Quarter 2018 – 15 Accidents
4th Quarter 2017 – 1 Accident

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: March 5, 2019

From:

Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations

GM

Date:

Board Meeting Date: March 12, 2019

Subject:

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 4th
Quarter 2018

Information

RTD currently provides 45% of its fixed route bus service via four contracted bus divisions currently
operated by First Transit and Transdev. With bus divisions located in Longmont, Denver, Commerce
City and Englewood, our contract partners provide fixed route bus service throughout the RTD District.
The performance for First Transit and Transdev is measured on the following performance indicators:
Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 miles, Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 miles, OnTime Preventive Maintenance Inspections, On-Time Performance, Miles Between Lost Service Road Calls
and Operator Complaints per Boarding.
Because of their commitment to excellence, dedicated corporate support and detailed problem solving,
First Transit and Transdev as a group, met all of the Board of Director adopted 2018 key performance
measures through the 4th quarter 2018. In the areas where our contract partners First Transit
Commerce City and Transdev fell slightly short of their individual goals, they implemented both
procedural and staff changes which resulted in continuous improvement throughout 2018. The
following is a more detailed discussion of fixed route contractor performance through the 4th Quarter of
2018.


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles through the 4th quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to
utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of
operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety
meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities and on the
street.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles
through the 4th quarter. Transdev did not meet the goal but improved to 0.23 Passenger
Accidents per 100,000 miles compared to 0.28 during the 3rd quarter 2018. Just five of the
nineteen passenger accidents that occurred through the 4th quarter were classified preventable.
All of the bus operators involved in passenger accidents were provided retraining on the proper
procedures for addressing passenger safety. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise
awareness of passenger safety through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of
passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance Inspections
completed as scheduled through the 4th quarter. Transdev did not meet the goal but improved to
97.3% of Preventive Maintenance Inspections compared to 96.5% completed through the 3rd
quarter 2018. Transdev’s PMI compliance during the last six months of 2018 was 100%.

Packet Pg. 101

1.C.6

Competitive Services staff will continue to monitor the contractor operations to ensure PMIs are
completed on time.


ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
The contractors, as a group, met the target of 86% Local On-Time Service through the 4th
quarter. First Transit Commerce City (83.4%) did not meet the goal due in part to the high
number of new operators, unexpected detours, and traffic. First Transit reported that they are
adding an additional street supervisor dedicated to OTP management and reassign the QA
Manager of Operations to work directly with RTD Service Planning and Scheduling. RTD and the
private contractors also continue to campaign routes and operators with low on time performance
with a strong focus on first time point departures. On a monthly basis contractors review the
OTP report and meet with operators of low performing routes to discuss factors that are
impacting their ability to reach 86% on time performance. Running time issues are forwarded to
RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, as a group, exceeded the target of 30,000 Miles Between Lost Service
Maintenance Road Calls through the 4th quarter. Transdev did not meet the goal but improved to
22,737 Miles Between Lost Service Maintenance Road Calls compared to 21,972 though the 3rd
quarter 2018. Transdev did meet the goal during December 2018 with 30,662 Miles Between
Lost Service Maintenance Road Calls. Competitive Services staff will continue to monitor the
contractor operations to ensure Transdev is addressing this area by completing preventive
maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely manner, monitoring repeat
issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a pro-active approach to
maintaining the buses in their fleet.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
Year to date 4th quarter 2018 ridership was not available at the time this report was prepared
and as a result Complaints per boarding have not been calculated. The contractors did receive
8,528 complaints during 2018 which is 1,294 less complaints than 2017 (9,822). The
contractors continue to utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist operators in
improving customer interactions.
In addition, the steps noted above regarding on-time
performance have helped address some customer complaints. The contractors also continue to
address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.
The contractors continue to take a variety of actions over and above contract requirements to
address their operator hiring/retention challenges which include hiring bonuses, wage increases,
incentives to take on additional work, employing a full-time recruiter, and mentoring programs.

Annual File review compliance improved from 6% in 2017. Annual file re-inspection is in scheduled to occur
March 2019. 4th quarter original out of compliance observations included: MVRs not pulled within required
timeframe for medical card renewals (within 15 days of renewal) and annual list of violations review (MVR pull
must occur after violations review); missing outside employment and DOT examiner verification forms; incomplete
DOT medical card history forms and annual list of violations paperwork missing signatures. Competitive Services

Customer Comment Analysis - 4th Quarter
2018

Customer comments through the 4th Quarter of 2018 for both RTD and the private contractors showed
improvement over the same period in 2017. The total number of operator-related comments for the
District as a whole for 2018 was 19,339. The total number for 2017 was 19,199. Specific customer
comment categories showing improvement in 2018 include “Bus Did Not Show,” “Bus Early,” “Bus
Late,” “Careless Driving,” “Fare Dispute,” and “Incorrect Information.” The customer comment
categories of “Discourtesy/Operator,” “Discrimination,” “Improper Procedure/Operator,” and “Passed Up
Passenger at Stop” showed increases over 2017. However, throughout 2018, RTD and the private
contractors reviewed customer comments and implemented corrective action to address deficiencies and
improve performance.
Recapped below is an analysis of the customer comment trends through the 4th Quarter of 2018. Also
included is a comparison of customer comment data for the same period in 2017.
As noted in previous reports, over the past few years the implementation and enforcement of a variety
of policies and operating requirements have impacted the number of customer comments received.
Examples of the policies and operating requirements that have impacted customer comments include
securement area/priority seating issues, fare enforcement campaigns, improved Customer Care
availability, introduction of SmartCards and day passes, and changes to bus service associated with the
implementation of the University of Colorado A Line and B Line commuter rail service and the W Line
and R Line light rail service.
Accordingly, based upon recommendations from RTD staff, the Board of Directors has made
modifications to the performance goal for customer comments to account for these factors. In 2014,
the performance goal was set at .0004 comments per passenger boarding and remained at that level for
2018.
The “Comments per Passenger Boarding” for the District as a whole (local bus operations) for the 4 th
Quarter of 2018 was unavailable at the time this report was prepared due to the unavailability of
ridership statistics.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer comments on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer comments using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the comment is not supported by factual data. Some of the
reasons for the “Not Valid” classification include the following:
 Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
 Operator followed proper procedure
 Passenger presented insufficient fare







Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the comment

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer comments.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
 Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
 RTD conducts refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
 RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
 RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado Cross Disability Coalition,
Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis, DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force, RTD Advisory
Committee for People with Disabilities-ACPD) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service
for passengers with disabilities.
 Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide.
Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
 RTD increased operator wages effective March 1, 2018, and the Contractors increased operator
wages effective April 1, 2018. Both RTD and the Contractors have seen an increase in
applicants and employee retention. With the increases in headcount, additional strategies are
being implemented to help reduce the amount of dropped service and the associated comments.
Historically, and in 2018, the following comment categories generated the highest number of customer
comments:
 Bus Did Not Show
 Bus Early
 Bus Late
 Careless Driving/Operator
 Discourtesy/Operator
 Improper Procedure by Operator
 Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these comment categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
comment numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high comment categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and external,
that are impacting the number of comments. The input received from both RTD and private contractor
operations is noted below:

Packet Pg. 107

1.C.7

Bus Did Not Show – 4th Quarter 2018: The comments in this category decreased 1.43% compared to
the same period in 2017. RTD and the private contractors are showing strong improvement regarding
operator headcount. Continuing efforts to reduce operator vacancies will help ensure that service is
provided per published schedules. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 7.39 comments per
day. The comparable number for 2017 was 7.49 comments per day.
Bus Early – 4th Quarter 2018: Comments in this category decreased 2.58% compared to the same
period in 2017. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” comments often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The
YTD average in this category for 2018 is 4.55 comments per day. The comparable number for 2017
was 4.67 comments per day.
Bus Late – 4th Quarter 2018: Comments in this category decreased 1.06% compared to the same
period in 2017. Improvements to staffing levels have resulted in improvements in this category.
Improving on-time performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including
construction, traffic and heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of
passengers on fewer trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time
issues. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 8.15 comments per day. The comparable number
for 2017 was 8.24 comments per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 4th Quarter 2018: Comments in this category decreased 5.20% compared
to the same period in 2017. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride
checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In
addition, RTD and the private contractors have “G-Force Activated” event-recording systems (Drive
Cam, Smart Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators
continue to be counseled and retrained, as needed, to improve driving performance. Also, periodic
safety campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for
2018 is 3.55 comments per day. The comparable number for 2017 was 3.74 comments per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 4th Quarter 2018: Comments in this category increased 1.04% compared to the
same period in 2017. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 7.75 comments per day.
The comparable number for 2017 was 7.67 comments per day.
Discrimination – 4th Quarter 2018: Comments in this category increased 6.06% compared to the same
period in 2017 (from 99 comments to 105 comments). Investigation into discrimination-related
comments usually shows the operator not at fault. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 0.29
comments per day. The comparable number for 2017 was 0.27 comments per day.
Fare Dispute – 4th Quarter 2018: Comments in this category decreased 10.93% compared to the same
period in 2017. The implementation of the new fares and fare equipment presented challenges for some
customers. Investigations into “fare dispute” comments often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The

Packet Pg. 108

1.C.7

YTD average in this category for 2018 is 1.05 comments per day. The comparable number for 2017
was 1.18 comments per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 4th Quarter 2018: Comments in this category increased 2.08%
compared to the same period in 2017. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held
at the private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of
RTD passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not
following proper procedures, appropriate coaching activities are taken. The YTD average in this category
for 2018 is 6.58 comments per day. The comparable number for 2017 was 6.45 comments per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator – 4th Quarter 2018: Comments in this category decreased 2.36% compared to
the same period in 2017 (from 127 comments to 124 comments). The combined efforts of the General
Superintendent of Transportation, Operations Managers, the Bus Operator Training teams, Street
Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to provide operators with up-to-date information to answer
customer questions and address customer concerns. Although RTD and the private contractors have
seen an influx of new operators, their impact on this category is minimal, thanks to annual refresher
training, assistance from Street Supervisors and trainers, and improved communication. The YTD
average in the category for 2018 is 0.34 comments per day. The comparable number for 2017 was
0.35 comments per day.
Passed Up Passenger at Stop – 4th Quarter 2018: Comments in this category increased 6.07%
compared to the same period in 2017. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these comments will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop as the bus
passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting
directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” comments from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
comments (222 of the total 4,296 = 5.17%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded
to the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjusted, as needed, and as resources
will allow. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 11.77 comments per day. The comparable
number for 2017 was 11.10 comments per day.
Customer Satisfaction Survey
Customer comments help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can continue to
improve the quality of service provided. Additionally, the results of the 2014 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(very poor) to 5 (excellent), RTD bus service received high ratings in the following operator-related
categories:


Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
Fourth Quarter ~ October 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018

Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection on-board buses
and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then to issue a citation if
that person is contacted a second time without fare. The chart below shows the actual number of patrons
without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers from month to month may be due
to several factors, including special events or other security security-related incidents.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection

Light Rail Operations
The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a slightly
higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain- c l o t h e s program than for the rail station sweeps and
bus enforcement because of the following factors:
Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all patrons to
have fare before boarding vehicles
Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
Plain-clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they inherently
find more violations of fare evasion.

2018 Quarter 4 Monitoring Report – Private Contractor Drug and Alcohol
Compliance

In compliance with the Recommendation included in the Performance Audit of the RTD
conducted in 2015 on behalf of the State of Colorado, the following is a summary of
the monitoring activities completed by RTD Drug & Alcohol compliance personnel
through the 4th Quarter of 2018. These statistics represent the verification of records
reviewed for the private contractor operations.
Number of files reviewed:

2021

Percentage of records in compliance with requirements:

99.2%

All documents pertaining to testing are reviewed every quarter. Once exceptions are
noted, RTD staff returns to the contractor location to ensure that missing documentation
has been obtained. Any exceptions not addressed are noted and reviewed during the
next visit to ensure exceptions have been corrected.
Scheduled visits for the contractors are no less than quarterly and on-going on an asneeded basis. This audit schedule was implemented in March of 2016.
