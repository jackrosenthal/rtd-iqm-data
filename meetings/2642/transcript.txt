IV.

Retiree Awards
Chair Hoy noted there were three retirees for the month of November and one was in
attendance: Anthony Roberts-Ramey.
General Manager Genova asked Bruce Abel to introduce Mr. Roberts-Ramey.
Bruce Abel, Acting Chief Operations Officer and Assistant General Manager of Bus
Operations, said that Mr. Roberts-Ramey was present along with members of his family to
celebrate his retirement after 23 years. Mr. Abel noted that Mr. Roberts-Ramey had been a
full time bus operator and was working out of the East Metro division. He said that in
retirement, Mr. Roberts-Ramey planned to work on cars, lawn mowers as well as school
and relaxation.
Mr. Roberts-Ramey thanked God, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost. He noted said that 23 years
was a long time, and asked for 15 seconds of silence for his colleagues who had been lost
along the way. He noted that the people he wanted to thank the most for being in his life
were his wife, mother, his brothers for being his foundation, his children for their love and
support, and his sister-in-law. He also thanked his local union, ATU 1001, his supervisors,
the street supervisors, cleaners, maintainers, dispatchers, HR, health and wellness, and
most of all, his Aunt Doris who got him started at RTD. He said that prior to working at
RTD he was in the banking industry for nine years. His Aunt Doris would drive him
downtown on her route and would tell him that he looked nice in his suit, but one day he
would get old and have to retire and he should drive a bus for RTD. One day he was
notified that his bank had been bought out and would be downsizing, so his Aunt brought
him a Trailblazer and he studied on his lunch breaks, and there he was, 23 and a half years
later. He noted that there were bumps in the road along the way such as union strikes and
new routes every year, but he was able to witness light rail emerge and most of all, he
was able to meet and work with a multitude of people. He said that in closing, as a child

he and his brother and cousin would ride on the back of the bus by holding on to the back
of the sign from 22nd and York Street to Downing Street and back again for fun. He added
that he was both blessed and thankful to have had this unique career and he was proud to
have a new title: RTD Retiree.
Chair Hoy noted that hearing from retirees was always special and remarked that two
others were unable to make it to the meeting. He thanked Becky Rivers and David W.
Smith for their contribution and efforts to RTD.

V.

Public Participation
Chair Hoy stated public participation was open to anyone that wanted to address the
Board. He reminded the audience that each speaker was allowed three minutes.
Ean Tafoya, Denver, commented the he was speaking on behalf of the Colorado Latino
Forum, which was dedicated to advancing Latinos in the socio-economic realm. He said
that he wanted to speak against item G, the Approval of General Manager's 2017
Performance Evaluation, which he stated included a bonus. He said that the community felt
that the General Manager had not met or exceeded his goals. He commented that the
community experienced service failure, FasTracks faltering, service reductions, concerns
about cutting college passes, and concerns for driver safety. He added that gentrification
and the housing crisis ware real and the direct connection between affordable
transportation and affordable housing was equally real. He asked the Board not to support
item G, as RTD was not in a position to give bonuses to CEO’s while poor people had their
services cut. He added that if the Board chose to support this decision, the community
would not forget when it came time for elections. He further added that if it were
approved, he would call on the General Manger to return the bonus to RTD for the benefit
of the riders. He commented that there was a bigger issue at hand in terms of funding and
if taxes need to be raised to ensure people could get home and to their jobs that
conversation should be had. He stated that when the transportation bill comes forward next
year RTD should to fight for public transportation.
Janee Donelson, Denver, stated that she worked for 9to5 Colorado, a non-profit entity
that works for economic justice for women both in and out of the workplace. She said
that she was a transit organizer and a transit user who found out earlier in the day that
General Manager Genova would be getting a bonus while routes, such as the 12, 15, and
20, were being cut. She commented that she would have to tell seniors at the Senior
Support Services center at 18th and Emerson about the closures of their stops. She stated
that she was unsure as to what the Board’s goal was, but it did not make any sense. She
asked if any of the Board members used public transportation, or if they had spoken to the
people who use it. She added that she did not see where the General Manager’s
performance merited a bonus and asked the Board to vote against item G.

Approval of General Manager's 2017 Performance Evaluation
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management
Committee that the Board of Directors approve the General Manager’s performance
appraisal for 2017 as defined in the attached completed General Manager’s Performance
Evaluation Packet.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management
Committee is pleased to report they are in agreement with General Manager Genova’s selfassessments and feel he has achieved or exceeded his overall goals for the 2017
Performance Appraisal. Although it has been a challenging year, the General Manager
Oversight and Performance Management Committee recognizes that General Manager
Genova has met the “Exceeds Expectations” for all of the Core Goals and one of the Task
Goals and “Achieved Expectations” for the remaining Task Goals set forth for performance
in 2017. Based on the consistent and outstanding performance in leading the RTD and the
overall compensation philosophy is to hire and maintain top talent in keeping with the
industry compensation of transit leadership peers we feel General Manager Genova has
earned a discretionary performance payment of $11,400.00. This is an increase of 4%
over last year.
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to approve
the General Manager's 2017 Performance
Evaluation.
Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Francone said that the committee had done a lot of
work and thanked the members of the committee who
participated in the process. She noted that, going forward,

there would always be suggestions as to how this process
could be improved and added that Barbara McManus,
Executive Manager of the Board Office, had done a lot to
streamline the process. She invited the Board to comment on
the process and to provide commentary on how it could be
improved. She added that there were always comments on
items that should be considered in the General Manager’s
evaluation but if anything needed to be changed or looked at
differently it would need to occur before his task and core
goals are set. She explained that the committee tries to keep
the process fair for the General Manager, the agency, and the
public. She noted that she was the lone dissenting vote in the
committee for this action, but her no vote was because of the
percentage of the discretionary performance payment rather
than the General Manager’s performance.
Chair Hoy noted that Director Francone had worked hard
during this entire process and what she was pointing out was
that the committee had made every effort to take subjectivity
out of the process and made it objective. He added that the
committee did a good job of that this year and would need to
keep that in mind in the future.
Director Lubow commented that she would be voting against
this. She said that to her the analysis of the bonus is about the
agency as a whole, and the agency is still dealing with
problems. She added that if the Board was up for a bonus she
would turn that down because it would not be appropriate
given the current financial times. She said that the buck stops
here, and remarked that the bonus amount was too high. She
stated that, if the bonus were approved, the Board would be
ignoring the inconveniences the constituents had to endure.
She added that she would have recommended a smaller
amount because of his good work, but the current percentage
was too high. She further added that she attended one of
RTD’s town halls for the commuter rail and Nate Currey,
former Senior of Public Relations, did an excellent job and she
finally felt that RTD was giving the public the information that
they needed. She stated that, if there are big problems, it was
important to go out to the public and let them know. She
reiterated that the General Manager’s discretionary bonus was,

or should be, tied to the performance of the agency. She
added that one of the items missing from the goal review was
an analysis showing how the agency’s work affected the
public.
Director Deadwyler stated that she agreed with Director
Lubow. She said that RTD had a very challenging year and an
important metric left out of the goals was day-to-day
performance. She commented that she too would be voting no
and said that the core and task goals needed to be changed
for 2018.
Director Williams said that she would also be a no vote. She
said that, based on the comments made by the constituents
who spoke earlier, no one at the agency should receive a
bonus.
Director Anderson remarked that while the General Manager
had met and exceeded his goals, she agreed that it had been a
rough and challenging year. She noted that, because of the
many challenges faced by the agency, the General Manager
deserved a small performance payment for all of the things he
had done to keep the agency on track. She commented that
her community had suffered due to setbacks with the G Line,
but the Board could see evidence every day that the General
Manager was trying and the issue boiled down to regulators
and regulations for new technology that was not the fault of
the General Manager or employees. She added that this
would be a small payment and would support this item. She
noted that she was not happy with a lot of things that had
happened this year, but she stated that the General Manager
and his team had done an outstanding job despite all of the
challenges this year.
Director Walker stated that every year he had been on the
Board was classified as a difficult year, and not just this
agency but for every transit agency. He noted that anyone
could run this agency if times were good, but he found value
in how the person in charge handles things when times are
tough. He commented that the General Manager and his staff
had handled this past year with respect, honor, grace, and

skill. He added that the General Manger has performed well
and exceeded expectations and the Board should show their
appreciation for his abilities, so he would be supporting this
motion.
Director Solano said that he would not be supporting this item.
He stated that the General Manager makes twice as much as
the governor, and to him, he makes enough already. He
commented that as a government entity it sends the wrong
message, especially as elected officials. He noted that while
the General Manager does a great job, he already makes too
much money.
Director Folska commented that Directors Archuleta and
Solano have asked that RTD recruit on Spanish radio and Tv.
She said that a lot of transit agencies were having the same
recruitment issues, but one of RTD’s problems was that the
process was very slow and people need jobs today, not in a
few months. She noted that in Aurora, they have started to
pay new hires right away instead of making them wait to go
through the process, so because of that, she would be a no
vote. She added that staff should recruit retirees to be
recruitment ambassadors, especially after hearing the speech
by Mr. Roberts-Ramey this evening.
Director Tisdale stated that it must be difficult for the General
Manager to sit here and listen to the Board tell him that he
was doing a great job but his performance was not good
enough to warrant a discretionary bonus. He said that a
discretionary bonus was a nice gesture and a way to tell him
yes, he had done a good job in the difficult times in which he
had to perform difficult tasks, while noting the results have
not always turned out the way the Board wanted. He said that
to him this was a small discretionary bonus to appreciate the
General Manager’s work, while noting that he was working
hard. His critique was that the bonus was a small enough
number and it shows the Board’s confidence in the General
Manager, so he would be voting to support this item.

TMD Contract Amendment
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee to approve an amendment to the
Transportation Management & Design, Inc. (TMD) Contract 14DO009, awarded in March
2015, to exercise the two remaining one-year option periods thereby extending the
Contract period of performance to December 31, 2019 and to increase the contract
amount by $650,000 from $500,000 to a new Not to Exceed (NTE) total of $1,150,000.

Free Rides for Members of the Military

It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free rides on
RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should be extended from the
presently approved date of December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. Utilization has
been minimal to date and this extension will have minimal impact on RTD.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to approve the
Free Rides for Members of the Military.
Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Chair Hoy noted that when this item came up in committee,
some Board members mentioned that they had family in the
military and a subsequent discussion ensued. He remarked
that if a Director has a family member who would benefit from
this policy it could be perceived as a conflict, whether it is or
is not.
Director Solano commented that he had three grandsons and a
step-son in the military so he would recuse himself from the
vote.
Director Deadwyler stated that she would vote for this, but
noted that it was not enough. She remarked that RTD offered
free rides to active duty but commented that there were a lot
of military that are in hospitals for rehabilitation and, if the
Board was going to approve this item every year, the program
should be expanded to include other military members.
Director Menten stated that she would vote against this item
because she did not want to single out a certain class of the
public.
Director Folska remarked that her son-in-law serves in the
Navy in Connecticut and she sees the hardship first hand with
her daughter. She added that serving in the military is a huge
sacrifice and the US armed services are outstanding, so she
would support this item.

Director Walker stated that this was a benefit that would be
available to anyone and because of their service, he would be
supporting this item.
Director Mihalik commented that there are plenty of dangerous
jobs that people volunteer for that RTD does not offer free
rides to or recognize, and because of that he would be a no
vote.
Director Anderson explained that this has always been a
recognition of those people in the community that have served
in the military. She added that this program does not cost
RTD a lot, but allows RTD to recognize members of the
community that deserve something.
Director Solano added that this needs to be revisited next year
and combat disabled vets should be included.
Vote on
The Motion: The motion passed with 12 in favor (Anderson,
Archuleta, Broom, Deadwyler, Folska, Francone,

There was no old business.

XVI. New Business
Director Tisdale stated that next week the Board would hear an update on the Pass
Program Working Group (PPWG). He encouraged everyone to pay attention to the
discussion as it was important for the Board to be aware to provide guidance and overall
thoughts to the task force. He added that there would be materials from staff included in
the Board Packet and he encouraged everyone to read them.
Director Williams added that the PPWG had a page on RTD’s website. She further added
that on Friday, December 1st there would be a panel discussion at Denver Regional Council
of Governments (DRCOG) at 1:30 p.m.
Director Menten commented that during the last Executive Committee she had inquired
about the light rail reconfiguration as she was going to provide outreach in her district to
explain why seats were going to be removed. She also asked how many people in the last
year had received a one-year suspension from using RTD’s services.
Mike Meader, Chief Safety Officer and Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security &
Asset Management, said that he did not have exact number of suspensions on hand, but
he would provide that information to the Board.
Director Menten commented that there have been a couple in the past and she was
curious to know if those individuals had their money refunded.
Chair Hoy stated that he had a communication from one of the Directors indicating that
they would like to readdress an item from the Recommended Action list.
Rolf Asphuag, General Counsel, explained that a motion to reconsider could be made at
the same meeting the original motion occurred, but it would need to be brought forward
by an individual on the prevailing side.
Chair Hoy asked if the motion could then be amended.
Director Tisdale commented that if a member of the prevailing side wished to reconsider
the item, there needed to be a motion on the floor to reconsider, then once passed,
another motion could be made to amend.
Mr. Asphaug added that, if the motion to reconsider passed, it would bring the motion
forward for discussion.
Chair Hoy recognized Director Francone.

Motion
to reconsider: Director Francone made the motion to
reconsider item G, the General Manager’s 2017
Performance Evaluation.
Director Broom seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Director Francone commented that she would like to revisit
this action again. She stated that her original no vote was
based on the percentage of the discretionary payment, and not
the General Manager’s performance. She added that any
payment increase outlined in the General Manager’s contract
was not to be construed as a bonus.

the Motion
to reconsider: The motion passed with 8 in favor (Broom,

Motion
to Amend:

Director Francone made the motion to amend
the General Manager’s 2017 Performance
Evaluation discretionary performance payment to
1%.
Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Chair Hoy remarked that the only change to the General
Manager’s Performance Evaluation would be the percentage of
the discretionary performance payment.
Director Solano commented that 1% would be insulting to the
General Manager.
Director Mihalik noted that 1% equaled $2,850.00.
Mr. Asphaug noted that the Board would be voting to amend
the motion and, if that passed, the Board would need to vote
again for final approval.
