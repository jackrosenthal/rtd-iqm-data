It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management
Committee that the Board of Directors approve the General Manager’s performance
appraisal for 2017 as defined in the attached completed General Manager’s Performance

Evaluation Packet.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management
Committee is pleased to report they are in agreement with General Manager Genova’s selfassessments and feel he has achieved or exceeded his overall goals for the 2017
Performance Appraisal. Although it has been a challenging year, the General Manager
Oversight and Performance Management Committee recognizes that General Manager
Genova has met the “Exceeds Expectations” for all of the Core Goals and one of the Task
Goals and “Achieved Expectations” for the remaining Task Goals set forth for performance
in 2017. Based on the consistent and outstanding performance in leading the RTD and the
overall compensation philosophy is to hire and maintain top talent in keeping with the
industry compensation of transit leadership peers we feel General Manager Genova has
earned a discretionary performance payment of $11,400.00. This is an increase of 4%
over last year.

Others Present:

Transportation-Oriented Development Workshop
Bill Sirois, Transit Oriented Communities Senior Manager, stated that an assessment
completed in 2016 recommended that RTD assess projects from a policy standpoint. He
said that staff would like to begin a dialogue with the Board to establish a policy for
Transit Oriented Developments and that the goal for the discussion was to provide
information on concepts and past projects and to gather feedback for value evaluation
metrics to assist staff in the future. He added that presenting with him would be Chessy
Brady, Transit Oriented Development Manager (TOD), John Shaw, a respected local
developer with over 40 years of experience as a consultant for RTD and Andrew
Knudtsen, from Economic and Planning Systems (EPS). He noted that EPS provided real
estate analysis support for the TOD group in the form of financial analysis, land valuation,
developer negotiations and insight/perspective from working with peer transit agencies on
TOD.
Mr. Sirois commented that Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) was:
• More compact and dense development within a 10-minute walk or ½ mile
distance around transit facilities
• A mix of uses, usually including residential, retail, and office
• High-quality, pedestrian-oriented urban design and streetscapes
The basis for TOD:
• Integrates station areas into communities
• Promotes higher density development (growing up instead of out)
• Supports local economic development
• Improves station security (“eyes on the street”)
• Increases ridership
• Creates affordable housing opportunities
• Leverages private and other governmental investments
RTD’s vision for TOD will:
• Promote multi-sector, cross-jurisdictional partnerships
• Encourage livable communities and sustainable developments that support the
transit system
• Ensure a hierarchy of multimodal access; and
• Protect and enhances RTD’s transit assets
Mr. Sirois added that RTD could not do these alone. He remarked that RTD would need to
work with other jurisdictions to make these happen.

TOD at RTD stations can create Direct and/or Indirect value:
• Direct Value comes directly back to the agency and includes:
o
Cash/revenue from land sale/lease
o
Increased ridership/fares
o
Replacement or new facilities
o
Outsourced maintenance
• Indirect Value supports the agency and comprises:
o
Enhanced operations
o
Improved safety/security
o
Upgraded amenities and access
o
Jurisdictional support
o
Community facilities/affordable housing
o
Brand image enhancement
Mr. Sirois noted that RTD’s involvement in projects such as Boulder Junction and Union
Station was beneficial and allowed people to view RTD differently.
Mr. Shaw commented that he and staff wanted to discuss how the value of property is
established. He noted that fundamentally it is done by appraisal and there are three
approaches to estimate value. He added that sales comparison is much more challenging
when evaluating commercial property or empty lots.
Sales Comparison Approach:

Evaluates sales of properties that are similar to a subject property

Most accurate when numerous sales of comparable properties are available

Becomes more challenging to apply when development program of asset is
specialized
Cost Replacement Approach:

Sets value of property based on the cost of reproducing a substitute property,
incl. land, building, parking, etc

Costs are ‘all in’ and include hard, soft, land, profit, etc.
Income Approach:

Most appropriate when land is under consideration for future development

Works well when context offers few comparable sales or when the surrounding
uses do not represent the highest and best use of the property

Measures the present worth of a future income generated by a property, and its
eventual resale value



Determines the residual land value after accounting for total development costs
and sales revenues

In order to determine project value:

Project Value is a function of the net income it will produce over time

Developers compare potential projects based on expected income vs. land costs

Project value and project costs are calculated independently, using different
factors

Project costs can be broken down into four elements
o
Hard costs (60% of total cost)
 Construction materials
 Labor
o
Soft costs (15-20% of total cost)
 Professional Services
 Architects/Engineers
 Legal
 Survey
 Market Studies
 Costs for off-site expenses
 Financing costs
 Leasing costs
o
Developer Profit (8-10% of total cost)
o
Residual Land Value (13% of total cost)
 Project value minus project cost = Residual Land Value
Key considerations for Residual Land Value are:

In most markets, hard and soft costs are fixed and do not vary substantially
between submarkets

Higher land values correlate to higher density and higher market pressure

Greater net income provides greater project value and flows directly to land
value
Mr. Knudtsen noted that several factors can cut into residual land value such as:

On-site costs for RTD replacement facilities

Affordable housing or other community facilities
In some cases, RTD may wish to prioritize:

Revenues to the agency

Packet Pg. 11

Mr. Knudtsen explained that project value is ultimately derived by the income produced by
the asset.



Construction of transit-related facilities
Affordable housing or other community facilities

Ms. Brady noted that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) had its own approach to
TOD:

FTA understands tradeoffs are necessary to achieve benefits of development

FTA encourages Joint Development that satisfies four criteria:
o
Creates economic benefit
o
Enhances public transportation
o
Partner provides a fair share of revenue
 RTD must receive revenue equal to or greater than FTA’s original
investment
 Unless the project is a community/public facility or affordable
housing
o
Tennant pays a fair share of costs
Ms. Brady explained that peer agencies approach TOD in a variety of ways. She said
Dallas and Charlotte are focused on Direct Value and they do not offer a lot of other tools,
but Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco have broader goals and provide a lot of
additional tools and funding. Ms. Brady noted that Denver would end up in the middle,
and staff was looking for feedback on how staff can assess projects.
Mr. Sirois commented that staff would place RTD in the hybrid category. He explained
that there are various levels of benefit depending on the overall goal. He asked how RTD
might approach TOD going forward. He stated that the approach would include:

Developing TOD Value Evaluation Metrics

Guiding internal decision-making around all TOD projects by evaluating the
projects value to RTD

Develop principles and evaluation factors to be considered for every TOD project
Mr. Sirois commented that the next step would be to present draft evaluation metrics as
information to the Board in December and propose the final evaluation metrics for adoption
in January or February of 2018.
Director Broom asked if staff had an inventory of RTD owned property.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 31, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Costs for RTD facilities, affordable housing or other additional costs can be partially
offset by:
• Jurisdiction Subsidies
• Tax Increment Financing
• Metro District Taxes or Fees

6.A

Mr. Sirois stated that staff does have information that could be provided as to what
property could be available for TOD.

Mr. Knudtsen remarked that the discount is based on asset class and geography. He
noted that Denver has a little bit more risk to it, so the discount rates would go up. He
commented that generally, the market will use a 5.5-7.5% discount rate depending on the
use.
Mr. Shaw added that the rate has dropped over the past decade, which clearly reflects the
cost of today.
Director Williams asked how this related to selling versus leasing property for TOD.
Mr. Sirois commented that this was exactly what staff wanted to talk about, which was
property control. He noted that historically RTD had viewed property as for sale, but
noted that RTD should look more towards a lease model. He noted that there would be
situations where RTD could not do a lease, and condos were the best example of that.
Director Williams stated that she was interested in how affordable housing fits into TOD
where land can be leased, and she would like to explore that option further.
Chair Hoy commented that what gets developed, and how, is not the developer or RTD’s
choice. He noted that there are land laws, zoning, city councils, and other factors and
plans change all of the time.
Director Francone said that it was important for her to know what RTD has in its inventory
before she could consider setting policy goals. She added that the property inventory list
had been requested by the Board on more than one occasion and it would be helpful to
know if RTD had an abundance of vacant land, small pieces of land, or land that could not
be used for transit purposes.
Mr. Sirois stated that staff had had a lot of discussion about real property and real
property assets, but TOD is more focused on joint development. He noted that when RTD
has an asset or a piece of property that the agency is operating on it is separate from the
excess real property. He added that for the current discussion staff was referring to land
at stations that could be considered for joint development over time. He further added
that such projects would be difficult and complex and, just because RTD had 60 stations,

Director Broom inquired as to what kind of discount rates are available in the current
market.

it did not mean all of them would become TOD properties. He also commented that staff
was looking for direction on how to manage unsolicited TOD proposals.

Chair Hoy added that RTD’s staff and Board do not always know what development would
be best. He stated that it is beneficial when developers approach RTD because they might
be able to see options or a direction that RTD cannot.
Director Sisk applauded staff for including the private development segment. He said that
philosophically RTD would look at the indirect value but he saw TOD as a financing
mechanism for RTD in the future. He noted that RTD’s most successful TOD was Union
Station and some of the Board wished RTD would have kept one of those lots instead of
selling all of them to developers. He added that RTD has had ample opportunities to
engage the private sector to build TOD but RTD has been too passive in its real estate
development. He further added that this was an opportunity for RTD to put something on
the ground and hoped that staff would come back to the Board with a few models.
Director Walker stated that he would like to think that RTD is heading in the same
direction as Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. He noted that a lot of people were
moving here looking for more indirect values for TOD. He added that RTD’s priorities
would shift with the economy and the type of development would change with the sale or
lease of a property. He stated that the land value is based on factors outside of RTD’s
control but zoning and neighborhood pressure were also considerations. He commented
that he would like RTD to focus on the indirect value for TOD development.
Director Tisdale noted that he appreciated the discussion, but the question begins with
inventory. He noted that holding on to land was a great idea because when land is sold it
is lost forever as is any income it could generate. He added that he did not take into
account the FTA’s constraints and the Board needed to know what properties were
acquired with FTA funds. He added that another thing to consider was the Tiny Home
movement. He said that there were cities all across the state that have looked at tiny
homes for affordable or employee housing. He remarked that there are a lot of
opportunities and others who may be doing this as well. He noted that RTD needed to
look at what brings money to RTD and it must be a sustainable steam of money to the
agency.

Director Francone remarked that staff are the experts in this topic, but it was difficult for
her to create and accept a policy direction if she did not know what assets RTD had. She
added that there was a TOD opportunity at every station and without understanding what
RTD has it was difficult to establish policy.

6.A

Director Deadwyler remarked that she was disappointed that this was just now coming to
the Board, especially after the sale of the property at 29th and Welton. She added that the
Board needed to see if that sale could be rescinded so that the land could be leased
instead of sold.
Director Broom commented that Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG)
invested a lot of money and station area plans along the lines in the various jurisdictions.
He said that those plans should be attached to the inventory list as a reference as to what
could be done at those stations.
Chair Hoy noted that the Board did receive a property inventory list but it did not reflect
what was discussed here. He noted that the inventory list does exist but it was very dry
because properties were identified by a legal description or property number.
Mr. Sirois commented that the list Chair Hoy referenced was excess land that was not
slated for development. He said that RTD had existing operating facilities at most of the
development sites and the crux of the problem was how to reconfigure existing structures
for development, which would cost more money. He noted that Arvada for example,
brought $24 million to the project in order to build a multi-level parking structure.
Director Francone said that the whole Denver metro area is growing so fast that these
issues would come up again and again. She noted that growth needed to be carefully and
thoughtfully managed. She stated that, since RTD is a transit agency, transportation
needed to be RTD’s first and foremost goal, not becoming a landlord. She added that the
idea of TOD’s only being limited to train stations is limiting and some of the park-n-rides
were usable space. She commented that she had been in Evergreen a few weeks earlier
and everyone using the park-n-ride there was there for other reasons besides
transportation. She said they were swapping cars, picking someone up, or using it as a
meet up place for other events. She noted that there was no transit function and if staff
looked at park-n-ride lots they could be used for something else and made more attractive
as a destination. She further inquired as to how staff was benchmarking direct vs. indirect
value.
Mr. Sirois stated that staff has some project specific data, but they do not have a
framework approach for projects. He noted that, while staff has seen various levels of

Packet Pg. 15

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 31, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow stated that she too would like to see the excess property inventory list.
She noted that it is to RTD’s benefit to promote TOD’s that have been effective and RTD
should hold an open house and tell others that the agency would like to work with them in
order to be productive for both parties. She added that FasTracks has created unintended
gentrification and the agency had a responsibility to deal with that in an appropriate way.

6.A

value they are trying to look at this a new way to decide what might be more important
such as leasing land instead of selling.
Director Walker asked how many times a month staff was approached for TOD.

Director Walker noted that he was told that staff was difficult to work with, but he did not
mind that critique. He noted that the process should be difficult in order to be good
custodians of tax funds.
Mr. Shaw noted that developers did not mind difficultly, but they needed predictability and
a clear path to create a road map.
Chair Hoy stated that he had heard from more than one developer that they wanted to
know what the rules were so they could work with them.
Director Tisdale commented that he was happy to hear that there was a real estate
inventory as that was a good beginning.
Director Williams added that most of her district, which is highly TOD, does not have
trains and it had not impeded its ability to use public transportation.
General Manager Genova remarked that the TOD group were not changing, but they were
focusing on protecting RTD’s assets.

III.

Parking Update
Robin McIntosh, Senior Manager of Facilities, stated that at the next meeting, the Board
would have a different process to get to the building.
Jim Rhodes, Facility Engineer, commented that, as part of the sale of Market Street
Station, the condition of the sale included 20 off-site parking spots. He noted that there
were two accessible spots across the street from the Blake Street offices and 18 spots at
16th and Wewatta St. He stated that each Director would be issued a transponder that
would link with the controlled gate in the garage. He noted that this new parking site
would be challenging at first but should work itself out. He added that the access gate
was controlled and the garage would know when the 18 spots were occupied. He said
that once the 19th car entered the garage a ticket would be issued and the driver would

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 31, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Sirois remarked that staff received a lot of fishing calls. He commented that a lot of
times those calls did not materialize beyond the initial phone call, but staff developed a
TOD website page to help the process. He added that, since RTD is a public agency, there
were a lot of additional requirements that others do not have.

6.A

have a 15-minute window to exit the garage or pay for parking. He commented that the
spaces would be shared between the Board and RTD staff and the lot would be cleared
out for Board meetings and Board functions.
General Manager Genova commented that it would operate very much like the lot did at
the Blake Street offices in that the garage was a shared space.

Director Lubow inquired if the spaces reserved for the Executive Committee could be used
by other Board members.
Chair Hoy asked, if another Director was intending to use an Executive Committee
member’s spot, that the Director contact the Executive Committee member to see if the
spot would be available.
Director Tisdale asked if there was a specific place where the transponder needed to be
placed in order for it to work properly.
Mr. Rhodes stated that he was not sure but he would find out.
General Manager Genova added that RTD was not paying for access to the new garage.
He said that the 18 spots were included in the land sale of Market Street Station and,
when construction around Blake is done, RTD’s parking would be replaced.
Ms. McManus noted that if there was a Special Board Meeting or a Special Committee
Meeting outside of the schedule the Board Office would work with HR to get the spaces
cleared. However, for meetings such as the General Manager Oversight Committee,
Directors would be responsible for their own parking.
Chair Hoy commented that there would probably be more nuances that the Board and staff
would have to tackle as they come up.

IV.

Other Matters
Director Francone reminded the Board that the next General Manager Oversight and
Performance Management Committee meeting would be on Tuesday, November 7th. She
noted that the discussions that day would generate the General Manager’s performance
evaluation and more importantly his discretionary performance payout. She added that
only 10 Directors had completed the General Manager’s Performance Survey and the
survey had to be completed by midnight that evening. She asked if anyone had any

Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, added that this parking lot
would be in use for 2 years.

questions or issues completing their survey to please speak with Barbara McManus. She
further asked that the Directors review the parking situation before the next meeting so
that everyone could get to the meeting on time and ready to work.

General Manager’s ratings on his core and task goals and asked the committee
members, having reviewed his final summary, whether they had any questions
about or disagreement with his ratings.
Director Williams asked whether at any time the General Manager has been asked
what his shortcomings were.
Chair Hoy said he had not been asked but said that Director Williams could ask him.

Chair Hoy said the process was intended to evaluate whether the General Manager
had carried out what the Board asked him to do.
Director Williams said she thought the committee might want to ask.
Chair Hoy stated the focus of the committee was whether the General Manager
performed how the Board asked him to.
Committee Chair Francone said the process included defined goals and tasks and
the General Manager was evaluated as determined by the evaluation document.
She said the committee could change the General Manager’s tasks goals but not
the core goals unless changes were made to the job description.
Ms. McManus reminded the committee that they could not change any of the goals
for the current evaluation. She stated that the core goals were static and the task
goals were based on what the Board decided at the retreat.
Committee Chair Francone said that the committee can change the General
Manager’s goals in March for the following year and that the Board does not want
to have a moving target for the General Manager.
Director Williams said that, as someone who evaluates people and is evaluated by a
Board of Directors, there were simple things that could be discussed between the
committee and the employees. She said she was fine with the process and felt that
compensating the General Manager was appropriate.
Committee Chair Francone asked for some clarification to see what Director
Williams wanted to get from this.
Director Anderson said that Director Williams made a good point. She stated that
the requirements for the General Manager’s performance review were foisted upon
the Board by the state legislature because they felt a previous General Manager
received an outrageous salary and because an audit found that the Board was not

Ms. McManus noted that General Manager Genova would attend the following
committee meeting.

6.B

Director Williams compared the General Manager’s position to that of the head
coach of the Denver Broncos, Vance Joseph. She said that Mr. Joseph had goals
and tasks that he had met and exceeded, but there were questions about whether
his organization could perform. She said she was not saying that the General
Manager had done a bad job but that, as an agency that has had uncomfortable
times, she did not see the overall review of the agency reflected in the process.
Ms. McManus said that the committee would meet with General Manager Genova
at the next meeting and that the committee’s process was more streamlined than
before. She said that, because of the comments and feelings of committee, in next
week’s meeting the committee could give the General Manager the ability to speak
to his strengths and weaknesses. She said the Chair of the Board and the
Committee Chair spoke with General Manager Genova the previous year about
matters not included in the performance review, which was not shared, but she
said such conversations would be incorporated going forward. She said she was
open to suggestions on how to make things better.
Director Williams asked for confirmation that the General Manager felt he had
achieved the first goal.
Chair Hoy said the General Manager had achieved the goal set for him and did it
well.
Committee Chair Francone said he had achieved the goal plus one additional
criterion.
Ms. McManus said that the General Manager would have had to have met over
90% of performance measures to have exceeded expectations and over 80% to
have achieved his goal.
Director Anderson asked what had changed on the General Manager’s selfassessment.
Ms. McManus gave an overview of the itemized changes.
Chair Hoy added that the goal referred to the delivery of transit services, in addition
to the special services the General Manager stated that he had successfully
deployed.

Packet Pg. 21

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 7, 2017 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

carrying out its oversight responsibilities correctly. She felt that the review had
become unwieldy because no one was really comfortable with the process, but she
said that it was a clear way to determine compensation for the General manager.
She said that sometime in the future the Board should look at a different process
that meant more to the organization.

6.B

Ms. McManus said that General Manager Genova had clearly not met 90% of
performance measures but that the General Manager said he exceeded expectation
based on the special services criterion.
Director Anderson said that 2017 had been an extremely tough year to maintain
employees to serve the agency’s customers. She stated she did not know where
the agency stood with the percentage of performance measures achieved.

Director Anderson said that the General Manager had almost achieved the goal of
90% and had done some other things as well. She stated that some of the other
pressures on RTD to perform services in an ad hoc manner could make up for the
little extra he did not quite achieve. She stated that it had been a tough year in
terms of recruiting and maintaining bus operators and people who deal directly with
the public.
Committee Chair Francone asked whether Director Anderson was suggesting that
the General Manager exceeded expectations based on the other services provided.
Director Anderson said that, based on the circumstances, he came very close to
achieving 90% of performance measures as well as achieving the special services
criterion.
Director Walker felt that, considering the number of events, the General Manager
exceeded expectations. He said the staff had shown how deftly it could handle
what was tossed at them, with a few hiccups. He said the General Manager had
exceeded based on the service delivered during a trying time. He stated that the
lack of employees was not just a problem for RTD and that it was a challenging
time for everyone.
Director Sisk said that one shining star was how the agency handled the Women’s
March, for which the agency received a lot of praise. He said that one event put
him over.
Director Williams said that the General Manager had achieved his goals.
Chair Hoy felt the General Manager exceeded expectations, based on the special
service delivery. He stated that the General Manager was judged by the people he
surrounded himself with and that he was lucky to have Gina Callahan, Assistant
Deputy General Manager of Bus Operations, because she could pull the off
impossible. He said there were glitches but what the agency did was phenomenal.
Director Broom felt the General Manager exceeded expectations.

Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 7, 2017 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. McManus said the agency was at 87.8%.

6.B

Committee Chair Francone said she was leaning toward exceeded expectations but
asked whether the change of service to the R and W Lines equated to a significant
reduction of service standards.
Director Walker said no, the service was on time over 80% of the time and that
was the standard. He stated that, in order to meet those standards, sometimes
service had to be adjusted.

Director Williams said the committee was judging the General Manager on nebulous
categories.
Director Williams said that she could not give the General Manager a pass on
presenting a plan not to reduce service standards.
Chair Hoy said that the results were there but suggested the wording of the
criterion stating that the General Manager “presents a plan” was not accurate.
Director Williams said that the criterion was not worded well.
Chair Hoy responded that the General Manager was not being reviewed only on his
presentation of a plan, because otherwise he could merely present a plan and go on
vacation and the committee could give him marks.
Director Williams asked if there were a criterion that said the General Manager “fails
to present a plan to maintain existing service levels”. She said she had not seen
such a plan nor did the General Manager present a plan to her. She said that the
General Manager had not exceeded expectations as a result.
Director Walker said that he did not interpret the criterion as meaning that the
General Manager presented a tangible product. Rather, he stated that the plan was
shown by way of the service changes made three times a year. He said changes
such as those to the R Line and W Line were meant to free up operators to go to
other areas where they were needed. He reiterated that the plan was not
document, but rather, every four months the Board received a new plan that
maintained service adequate for the public demand.
Director Williams said that “adequate” was the key word.
Ms. McManus pointed out that the General Manager had included a bullet point in
his self-assessment regarding service levels as described in the run boards.
Director Williams asked what General Manager Genova had done to exceed
expectations.
Packet Pg. 23

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 7, 2017 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Hoy agreed that standards were different from service levels.

6.B

Ms. McManus clarified that the bullet point was in the “achieved goals” criteria.

Ms. McManus asked for conformation of the vote, and Committee Chair Francone
confirmed that six voted that the General Manager exceeded expectations, and one
said he did not.
Committee Chair Francone moved on to Core Goal #2, regarding strong and ethical
leadership, and Core Goal #3, regarding strong financial management. She said the
committee agreed during the General Manager’s mid-year review meeting that he
had exceeded expectations on those goals. She asked if the committee felt
anything had changed.
Regarding Core Goal #3, Director Williams said that General Manager Genova was a
great overseer.
Director Lubow noted that there was a booming economy, yet there was financial
stress in the agency. She said that was not the fault of the General Manager, but
the buck should stop with him and the agency’s situation must have something to
do with how the agency was handling its money.
Director Williams reiterated her earlier comparison to the state of the Denver
Broncos. She said the coach may have met his goals, but the team was in trouble.
Director Anderson said the issue of sales tax was very elastic, whether the
economy was good or not. She said she would not agree with Director Lubow’s
interpretation. She said the Board had been given a long-term plan for the future
based on conservative means, which she felt was good because a public agency
should be conservative because of future uncertainty. She said she thought staff
had done an excellent job in planning and that it was fault of the taxpayers, not the
agency, that there was not enough money in the plan. She said the agency had a
solid plan for future and that the plan would change if the economy got better if
there were changes in the Denver metro area. She said that one could not blame
the General Manager for what was going on.
Director Lubow stated that management issues had placed the agency into its
position. She said that operations and maintenance costs were higher than the
anyone expected and that the agency overextended mortgage-wise. She said she

Packet Pg. 24

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 7, 2017 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Francone said that, in order for the General Manager to have
exceeded expectations, he would have to have outstanding and noteworthy special
event services. She asked whether Director Williams still found the General
Manager to have achieved his goals, and Director Williams said yes. Committee
Chair Francone said she felt the General Manager had exceeded expectations.

6.B

knew why the decisions were made and the Board also contributed to those
decisions.
Committee Chair Francone said she did not disagree but said that, under General
Manager Genova’s leadership, the agency has moved from over-borrowing to a
more conservative approach with active budget management. She said that her
original assessment was that the General Manager had exceeded expectations and
asked for other comments.

Committee Chair Francone summarized that the committee did not change from the
previous vote of exceeds expectations, with Director Lubow’s comments included
in the discussion. Committee Chair Francone proceeded to Core Goal #4, regarding
equal opportunity employment, affirmative action, and small business enterprises
(SBEs) and disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs). She said the General
Manager had exceeded expectations during his mid-year review and asked if the
committee felt there were any changes.
Chair Hoy and Director Anderson said their assessment had not changed.
Ms. McManus noted that, as an opportunity for improvement, the committee had
previously identified the criterion stating that the agency had been lauded for the
SBE, DBE, and Workplace Initiative Now (WIN) programs. She asked if the
committee had been made aware of any recognition the agency had received for
those programs.
Committee Chair Francone and Chair Hoy said they were not aware of any such
recognition.
Director Sisk noted that it could be more difficult to receive recognition for civil
rights programs going forward when the agency moved from construction to
operations and maintenance. He suggested that the goal should be adjusted toward
maintenance.
Committee Chair Francone said that the WIN program had not completely changed
but had started moving toward RTD-centric efforts by training bus drivers and
diesel mechanics and working with colleges. She said that the committee voted
unanimously that the General Manager exceeded expectations. For Core Goal #5,
regarding effective communication, Committee Chair Francone said that the General
Manager exceeded expectations during his mid-year assessment.
Director Williams noted that the General Manager had never proactively met with
her, though she had initiated meetings with him three times.

Manager had met his goal.

whether

Manager

needed

Director Williams said he needed improvement on that criterion but had achieved
the goal as a whole. She said she did not receive information on pertinent issues in
her district.
Chair Hoy clarified the verbiage of the goal and said that the General Manager was
required to update the agency on what was going on. He said that he would soon
be able to view the General Manager’s calendar in order to see what he was doing
and that General Manager Genova was increasing his prominence nationally.
Ms. McManus noted that the General Manager submitted reports on his activity,
listed by district, on a weekly basis and said that he had an open door policy.
Director Anderson thought it was great that the General Manager met with Director
Williams each of the times she called him. She said she recognized that General
Manager had a lot on his plate, and, as one of 15 Directors, she tried to minimize
her need to speak to him because the agency also has responsive staff members.
She said she asked the General Manager to speak at one of her meetings in Arvada
and he did, because he would do what the Directors asked of him. She said he did
not call Board Members directly and ask to meet with them because of protocols
stating the Chair was the Board’s liaison with General Manager’s office. She said
she found General Manager Genova to be very responsive. He added that she called
him once this year because there was a real issue in Arvada, and she felt confident
she could get anything she needed from members of staff.
Director Williams stated that one of the criteria said that the General Manager
“meets periodically to confirm and address priorities”.
Director Broom said that he had met with General Manager Genova to discuss some
general questions of no real concern.
Director Lubow said that she met with the General Manager after his office
approached her. She stated that the General Manager did a great job with public
information but said that there had been fiascos with the commuter rail lines. She
said the public was frustrated with RTD and that it would have been better for RTD
to be more proactive, not reactive, to newspaper articles. She reported that people

6.B

were saying that they did not understand what was happening and that RTD was
losing touch of its message.

Committee Chair Francone summarized that six Directors voted that the General
Manager had exceeded expectations and that Director Williams felt he had achieved
his goal. She then spoke to Task Goal #1, regarding fiscal sustainability. She said
both the committee and the General Manager felt during the mid-year assessment
that he had achieved this goal.
Director Anderson agreed.
Committee Chair Francone asked for additional comments, and no one disagreed
with the committee’s previous vote. Regarding Task Goal #2, regarding workforce
and human capital, she said that the committee had voted that he achieved the
goal. She asked if there were any changes, and no one offered commentary. She
stated that, per the committee’s previous vote, the General Manager had exceeded
expectations on Task Goal #3, regarding State of Good Repair (SOGR).
Director Anderson said she would not change the assessment and that RTD was a
leader nationwide.
Committee Chair Francone asked if anyone disagreed and, hearing no additional
discussion, stated that the committee voted unanimously that the exceeded
expectations.
Ms. McManus noted that General Manager Genova had completed the criterion
stating that he “maintains assets at a zero backlog or any asset that is in backlog is
scheduled for replacement in the SBP”. She asked whether the committee should
indicate on his evaluation form that the General Manager had completed that
criterion.
Committee Chair Francone said the committee would agree to check off that box.
Ms. McManus said the committee would need to make overall decisions about
what to do that day in order to move forward.
Committee Chair Francone asked whether the General Manager should receive
discretionary performance payout based on the evaluation that was completed, on
his own self-assessment, and on survey results.

Packet Pg. 27

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 7, 2017 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Walker noted that, as with other categories, the goal did not mean that the
General Manager was solely responsible for achieving the criteria, but rather that
his employees contributed as well. He said that, if not the General Manager himself,
someone from agency had reached out to people with concerns.

6.B

Director Williams asked who would want to speak to the media to tell them the
General Manager had received an increase.
Committee Chair Francone said she did not speak to press. She asked which
members of the committee felt that the General Manager should receive a
discretionary performance payout.
Director Lubow stated that the General Manager received $10,000 automatically.

Director Walker said he was comfortable giving the General Manager a discretionary
performance payout.
Director Sisk also said he was comfortable with a discretionary performance
payout, but not a 10% payout.
Committee Chair Francone said the committee could discuss numbers.
Director Williams said she felt the General Manager should not receive a
discretionary performance payout.
Chair Hoy and Director Broom agreed that he should receive a payout.
Director Anderson said she felt the General Manager should receive pay increase
because the previous two years had been tough ones. She stated that it was still
unknown when the G Line would open but General Manager Genova had been in
front of the effort, working to get the job done. She said that she did not know
whether he should receive 5% or 10%.
Committee Chair Francone asked what amount she felt was appropriate.
Director Anderson said that the General Manager did not receive a discretionary
performance payout the last year, even though he performed well. She said that
giving General Manager Genova a performance payout would show confidence in
him and his staff and make an impression on the Colorado Public Utilities
Commission (CPUC).
Director Lubow said that Director Anderson had made an interesting point about the
positive impact on the CPUC but felt it would be destructive to ignore the
generalized feeling that there had been a problem with the agency. She said that
General Manager Genova had done as much as possible but thought that the public
would not be happy with an amount more than the $10,000 that the General
Manager’s contract would give him.

Packet Pg. 28

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 7, 2017 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Francone said that was not the discussion before the committee.

Committee Chair Francone said that she spent hours reviewing the performance
review process and that it was not perfect, though she said it had eliminated some
of the subjectivity the committee had seen. She said she did not disagree with
Director Lubow’s comments that agency has had problems, but she felt that the
General Manager had been out front on issues such as the A Line, the G Line, and
the drafting error in Senate Bill 17-267 (SB267). She stated that the committee had
already set the standard for the General Manager’s evaluation and that she felt he
was deserving of a discretionary performance payment. She said the question was
how much. She noted that the $10,000 amount that he automatically received
every year was based on a contractual agreement the Board made with him. She
said that she was inclined to suggest a discretionary performance payout between
1-3%.
Chair Hoy asked what the highest payout could be.
Director Sisk answered 25%.
Chair Hoy said that he would not suggest that amount but noted there were places
where a person could receive 25% or 50% bonuses.
Director Williams said that, because of RTD’s financial status and status as public
agency, she did not feel the General Manager should receive any more money
because of the agency’s fiduciary obligation not to give out unnecessary money.
Director Walker said he was contemplating a 3-5% payout. He said everyone has
seen what the General Manager and his staff had been doing. He said there were
problems with agency, such as with the University of Colorado A Line and the B
and G Lines, but he said those problems were not the General Manager’s or the
agency’s doing. He stated that the performance of the A and B Lines had been
great, with an on-time performance (OTP) in the 90’s, and that he had done a great
job helping persuade the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to move off of its
position on the crossing gates. He noted that RTD was the first to do that type of
project, and he said that the General Manager’s standing in the industry and his role
with the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) showed how well he
was considered y others He said the agency had problems but endorsed a 5%
performance payout.
Director Sisk said he thought that $6,000-7,500, between a 3-4% increase, would
be an acceptable number. He said that he, as a member of the Board, had an
obligation to uphold the contract the Board had agreed to. He spoke about the
agency’s fiduciary obligations and asked whether the Directors should not be going
on trips. He noted that was one of the reasons he had not taken any trips that year.
Chair Hoy said he would support a 4% performance payout.

Director Broom supported a 7.5% performance payout, 5% of which he said was
combat pay. He said everything that had happened had been tough but that the
important message to General Manager Genova was how much the Board valued
him. He noted that General Manager Genova would probably be in high demand and
could be gone next month if he felt he was not appreciated at RTD. He asked who
the agency would find to replace him and whether the General Manager could be
replaced for less money. Everyone recognizes there are things that need to be
addressed. At same token, he’s taken on a tough job of addressing these things.

Chair Hoy said his 4% figure was note arbitrary and represented a performance
payout of a little over $10,000.
Director Anderson said she could agree to 4-5%.
Chair Hoy said he could agree to 5%
Committee Chair Francone said she could not agree to much more than 3%.
Motion:

Chair Hoy made the motion to grant General
Manager Genova a discretionary performance
payout of 4%.
Director Walker seconded the motion.

Vote on
The Motion: The motion passed with 5 in favor (Anderson,
Broom, Hoy, Sisk, Walker) and 2 opposed
(Francone, Williams).

C. Review Survey Results
Committee Chair Francone asked whether anyone had any questions about the
survey.
Director Williams asked how many people responded.
Committee Chair Francone said thirteen had completed the survey.
Ms. McManus said she had met with Dennis Yaklich, Market Research Manager,
who had taken over responsibility for the survey. She said that the original survey
did not give the overall picture for the General Manager and that she worked with
Mr. Yaklich to arrange the information so that everything would be up front and
easily understandable. She said she would present samples first to Committee Chair
Francone and Chair Hoy and later to the whole committee.
Packet Pg. 30

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 7, 2017 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Francone said the committee had not agreed on a percentage.

6.B

Director Sisk said that one of the respondents to the survey asked why RTD
employed twice as many staff as operators.
Ms. McManus said she did not think that was a true statement and that RTD was
top-heavy on operators.

Director Sisk said the ratio of operators to administrative employees was four to
one.
Chair Hoy, commenting about future changes to the performance review, said he
could not know or guess how the General Manager related to other Directors or
senior members of management.

D. Benchmarking
Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, suggested going out of
order to the benchmarking item while the committee waited for Directors Broom
and Williams to arrive.
Committee Chair Francone said that Ms. McManus would be passing out
benchmarking data of general managers (GMs) of other transit agencies, which the
committee was statutorily required to review.
Ms. McManus said that staff had tried to expand the amount of information
contained in the benchmarking data. She said that it would be great for the same
transit agencies to participate every year and that, even after submitting open
records requests, the Board Office had not received information from certain
agencies. She said the chart outlined various data points of other transit agency
GMs, including their agencies’ service areas, ridership, and service population, and
showed a breakdown of their compensation. She noted that only three agencies
had responded the previous year and that the Board Office had begun its data
collection earlier this year.
Committee Chair Francone stated that comparing agencies’ benchmarking data can
be difficult because of the variables, such as the agencies’ size, service area, the
number of fleet vehicles. She asked whether the American Public Transportation
Association (APTA) had been a good resource for data.
Ms. McManus said APTA was not helpful and that the most recent GM
compensation data posted on their website was from 2012.

Packet Pg. 31

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 7, 2017 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Hoy said that there were roughly 3,000 operators, along with additional
contractors, and that there were around 800 salaried administrative employees.

6.B

Chair Hoy said he was familiar with one of the transit agencies on the chart and
noted that it was small, with only 50 buses in its fleet.

Committee Chair Francone said that the review of the benchmarking data was
requirement that came out of an audit a few years earlier and noted that RTD was
required to look at data from other transit agencies in order to evaluate the General
Manager’s discretionary performance payout and his performance. She said the
review was not meant to be a mandate for his payout. She said that the committee
previously determined that DART was closest to comparable to RTD but noted that
the agency’s service area was only 700 square miles. She contrasted DART to the
Washington Metro Area Transit Authority (WMATA), which covered 1,500 square
miles and serviced 4 million people. She stated there was no apples-to-apples
comparison agency wide and that the benchmarking chart was an overview of what
GMs from different agencies receive for salary and other compensation, which
would give data to the Board for the purposes of determining the discretionary
performance payout.
Director Sisk said that the committee was not comparing agencies and noted that
the Ann Arbor Area Transportation Authority (AAATA) serviced an area half the
size of Boulder. He stated that the committee performed a wage survey analysis of
GMs two years earlier, which he felt was more persuasive than the benchmarking
data. He noted that the information for the General Manager of the Los Angeles
County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Phil Washington, was not included in
the analysis, nor was the cost of living standard for each area.
Director Walker said that GMs have varying responsibilities
Director Anderson said she felt it would be better to benchmark among the top paid
executives in the Denver metro area or to compare public and private industry
salaries.
Committee Chair Francone said she did not know whether the statutory
requirements mandated that the transit agency data be used for benchmarking.
Ms. McManus said she would look at the verbiage and that she had provided similar
information to former Director Bagley.

Packet Pg. 32

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 7, 2017 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. McManus noted the larger agencies on the chart and mentioned that staff had
tried to get info from Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART). She said it could be difficult
to obtain data from some agencies without an open records request and noted that
some agencies were not eligible to release data due to negotiations. She said that
the chart detailed GMs of transit agencies that were different in terms of size,
responsibility, land area, and other factors.

6.B

Director Anderson said that DART was an interesting point of comparison, because
the agency transit facilities were closest to RTD’s and the agencies service areas
were similar.
Ms. McManus said that staff had tried to obtain information on the GM of DART,
Gary Thomas, but was not able to do so.
Director Williams said she had overheard that this benchmarking process was done
two years earlier to determine the General Manager’s salary.

Director Williams asked whether it would be simpler to look at what has changed
rather than recreating the wheel each year.
Ms. McManus said that she did not have the previous benchmarking data because
it was not left for her by her predecessor.
Director Williams said that people had decided two years earlier how much General
Manager Genova should be paid. She again asked why the committee would not
just say whether the General Manager or the agency itself has gotten better or
worse.
Chair Hoy said that doing so would presume that the committee was correct two
years ago. He said the benchmarking was valuable because the committee could
review where the agency should be as compared with where it was two years
earlier.
Director Williams said that one would have to assume that the Directors at the
time, half of whom were still on the Board, made valid judgments and that it did
not make sense to second-guess their decisions.
Director Sisk said the committee did a lot of benchmarking and noted that the Ft.
Collins city manager earned a salary of $300,000. He said the committee was
satisfied in terms of the General Manager’s salary and noted that former General
Manager Phil Washington had a higher salary than General Manager Genova. He
said that RTD had approached DART Executive Director Gary Thomas when
searching for a General Manager but could not come close to matching his salary of
$435,000. He noted that several Directors had felt that Mr. Washington was
overpaid.
Chair Hoy stated that half of the GMs in the benchmarking data earned a salary of
$275,000 or below and the other half earned more. To Director Anderson’s
comment, Chair Hoy said that the general manager of a company with a budget
similar in size RTD’s could be used for comparison.

B. Recommended Actions

• Approval of 2018 Contract Amendment to Kumar and Associates, Inc. for
the Construction Materials Testing and Inspection Services Contract
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve
the 2018 Contract Amendment for Kumar and Associates and increase the
contract Not-to-Exceed amount by $1,000,000. This will result in a new
Not-to-Exceed contract amount of $6,000,000 for Construction Materials
Testing and Inspection Services.
It is further recommended that the Contract end date be extended from
December 31, 2018 until December 31, 2019 to complete work on the
North Metro and SERE projects. Funds for the amendment are contained in
the 2018 Recommended Budget for the specific projects for which Kumar’s
services are utilized.
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 28, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital
Programs, introduced Kevin Diviness, Director of Quality
Assurance to provide the background on the contract
amendment. The Construction Materials Testing and
Inspection Services Contract with Kumar and Associates
(Kumar) was for an initial term of five years and five months,
with five option years, with initial contract not to exceed price
of five million dollars. Kumar and Associates is a locally-based
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) firm that provides

6.C

Mr. Stopplecamp added that this was a work order contract
and that the additional $1 million was not a lump sum contract
which could be used as needed, and any money left over
would stay within the FasTracks budget.
Director Mihalik asked whether Kumar was an exclusive
provider for these services, or whether it was one of several
other agencies.
Mr. Diviness explained that there were several agencies that
provided these services, however, Kumar committed to work
exclusively for RTD and not to accept work from any of RTD
contractors to avoid a conflict of interest.
Director Mihalik asked if Kumar was exclusive to RTD and if
RTD was exclusive to Kumar.
Mr. Diviness stated that Kumar does work throughout the
state.

specialized testing and inspections for unique applications
such as 1) Acceptance Testing of construction materials such
as concrete and soils for RTD’s smaller projects, 2)
Verification Testing for large projects whereby the contractor
has been tasked with Acceptance Testing, and 3) audits of
contractor testing procedures, personnel, and equipment. Mr.
Diviness explained that the request was for an additional
amount of $1 million and for an extension of the final option
of the contract for until the FasTracks projects are completed
in 2019.

Brian Welch, Senior Manager of Planning Technical Services, stated that
next month a recommendation from staff would be presented to award a
contract for services to provide the Regional Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
Feasibility Study. He explained that the study was funded primarily by
federal Surface Transportation Program (STP) Metro funds and a local match
from RTD which would be a comprehensive study included in the 2016 RTD
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) as well as the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) 2016-2021 Transportation Improvement Program
(TIP), and was intended to complement the FasTracks program to provide
mobility benefits at a significantly lower cost. He added that the study
would be without limitation as to where BRT may be developed, except for
three routes; Colfax, State Highway (SH) 119, and the 16th Street Mall that
are already a part of separate studies. He said that the study had a schedule
of 18 months with exhaustive criteria in order to determine the next
corridors to have BRT developed.
Committee Chair Lubow asked about the approach in determining how to
select the routes.
Mr. Welch explained the scope of work had been developed to look at a
comprehensive initial screening using previously acquired data that would
provide a windowing process in order to ensure that there was sufficient
budget to provide enough analysis to result in tangible prioritized investment
decisions that could be made as a result of the study. This would allow for
narrowing the selection by using a tiering process of the areas that meet the
specific criteria.
Director Sisk asked if the agency had funding available to engage in BRT
projects following the feasibility study.
Mr. Welch stated that the criteria for qualifying for a BRT project would be
that any corridor would be chosen based on the ability to qualify for New
Starts Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) funding, and also have
stakeholder match.
Director Broom ask how the project would be financed.
Mr. Welch clarified that these projects would be candidates for matching
funds and would not be part of the base FasTracks system.
Chair Hoy asked if a consultant had been determined, and asked about the
cost and the length of time for the study.
Mr. Welch explained that the consultant selection process would be
completed in November, and that the proposal would include a
recommended consultant based on the competitive procurement process

used by RTD, as well as the budget amount that had been set at a not to
exceed amount of $1.25 million.

Mr. Welch explained that there was $1 million of federal CMAC/STP Metro
funds that represents DRCOG funds, with no direct funding from CDOT, and
RTD was providing a match to the federal funding. He stated that the
agencies would have an important technical role as well as involvement in
the selection process, because an important piece in BRT success was local
jurisdiction support.
Director Folska asked why a consultant was needed to perform the work for
this study.
Mr. Welch explained that the complexity and scale of the scope required an
expertise in BRT with public agencies, and that RTD staff determined that
experience was best found in the consultant community.
Director Folska asked for clarification on the budget and the match that RTD
was providing.
Mr. Welch clarified that the total budget amount was 1.25 million dollars;
that $1 million was provided by federal funds and RTD’s match was 25%
for a total of $250, 000.

• Mobility Choice Blueprint (Verbal/No Backup)
Mr. Welch provided a brief update stating that RTD has selected a consulting
team as a result of the rigorous process that followed the CDOT
procurement procedures. He said this team would be led by HDR with Rick
Pilgrim as the Project Manager. He stated that a notice to proceed would be
issued in December with a 12-month schedule due to budget constraints.
Mr. Welch explained that there would be bi-monthly updates to the Board,
with the first one in January 2018, and that the project had two phases’.
The first to identify a 2030 future for the Denver Metro region, and the
second to develop the blueprint for what the major jurisdictions within the
Denver region would do to address this envisioned future. He concluded that
the project would have an extensive communication and outreach program
to provide an open opportunity for involvement.

• East Colfax Transit Improvements
Lacy Bell, Manager of Corridor Planning, said she was currently the planning
project manager for the 15L Route Improvement project as well as the

primary liaison for the City and County of Denver’s (CCD) Colfax BRT
Project. Ms. Bell provided the following key points on the 15L Route
Improvement project that is one of two separate projects part of the East
Colfax Transit Improvements:
o 15L Route Improvements Overview
 The project is a RTD grant funded project to improve
15L stops and operations
 Total project budget of$11 million
 FTA Ladders of Opportunity Grant of$5 million
 East Colfax bus routes 15/15L serve as many
passengers per day (over 20K) as some rail corridors
 There have not been improvements to the route in 30
years
 The project area is from Broadway at Civic Center
Station to Potomac at the R Line Stop
 The stops have as many boardings per day as A line or
the Littleton Mineral Station and are without shelters
 The threshold for providing a shelter is 40 boardings
per day and the stops along this route have hundreds of
boardings per day
 The scope includes:
 37 total stop locations
 12 bus bulbs / curb extensions
 8 queue bypass lanes
 Received environmental clearance from FTA
 Began implementation of Transit Signal Priority (TSP)
 Developed enhanced bus shelter design
 Incorporated feedback from an onboard
passenger survey
 Each stop will include a shelter with transparent
weather protection, security cameras, lighting,
and passenger information
 Look for opportunities to add additional benches
 Electronic passenger information will be
implemented at a minimum of 6 locations as a
pilot project
 Current Tasks:
 Work through CDOT and Denver/Aurora design
review and approval processes
 Stakeholder updates
 Mid 2018: Issue RFP for contractor
 End of 2019: Construction complete

Connection project which is a City and County of Denver (CCD) project that
dovetails the RTD 15L project. Ms. Snyder stated that CCD shifted their
focus to moving more people in the CCD corridors. She explained that
Colfax Avenue had the highest ridership of all RTD routes with over 22,000
boardings and about 40,000 vehicles per day. By implementing a center lane
BRT, she stated mobility through the corridor could be increased by 20%
and change the distribution to more people riding the bus. Ms. Snyder
detailed the process of implementing the project, stating the following:
 2010: Denver completed the Colfax Streetcar Feasibility Study
 2011: Denver initiated a $3 million Alternatives Analysis (AA) /
environmental documentation study
 2012-2015: Planning, outreach, and initial analysis of side-running
BRT
 2016-2017: Further analysis of public preferred alternative of centerrunning BRT
o Center-running public outreach and Task force meeting
 Fall 2017
o Begin design and environmental work
o Federal Funding process
o Possible funding from the $55 million bond
Ms. Snyder presented some technical detail between the side-running BRT or
the public preferred alternative of the center-running BRT stating that the
center-running BRT option allowed for 24-hour operation, stops spaced at
about every 3rd of a mile, excusive travel lanes in the middle, the
improvement of crossings, a middle median for pedestrian safety and
mobility, open sidewalk space, and lastly reduced conflicts between buses
and vehicles. Ms. Snyder concluded that this update was to explain why the
CCD was pursuing a center-running BRT because it provides a safe street,
reliability for transit operations, and the ability to move more people through
a constrained area.
Director Broom asked whether traffic signal preemption technology was the
same technology that fire trucks used and how the technology was
coordinated.
Ms. Snyder explained the Transit Signal Priority (TSP) was not the same
technology as emergency vehicles. She stated that when a bus approaches
a signal, if there was not a higher priority (pedestrian or emergency vehicle)
present, the signal could be extended or changed early for the bus.
Director Tisdale stated that real-time display was a tremendous value and
would be beneficial to the agencies riders. He then asked Ms. Snyder to
explain parking comparisons between side-running or center-running BRT.

Ms. Bell explained that both would retain parking, as studies showed that
parking was more important than an extra lane, and the center-running
option does eliminate the right turning parking conflict, which was
beneficial.
Ms. Snyder stated that due to the varying widths along the corridor parking
would be maintained.

Director Sisk agreed with Director Tisdale on the benefits of having real-time
displays installed along the corridor. He commented that vending machine
locations should be considered during installation.
Director Walker stated that the center-running BRT would be beneficial to
the corridor and that he appreciated the agencies partnering on a projects
like this.
Director Folska stated that real-time information was expected, should be on
the front end of the project, funded by advertising, and both audible and
visual. She asked for the length of the BRT route.
Ms. Bell explained that the 15L Route improvements total length was about
10 miles and that the CCD BRT would be focused in its jurisdiction and
would span about 5 miles.
Director Folska asked what the expected travel time savings would be when
the two projects were complete.
Ms. Bell explained that the 2035 model determined that it would result in
about a 15-minute travel time saving.
Director Folska asked if this was a comparison from current travel times.
Ms. Bell explained that the 2035 model presented alternatives and showed a
15-minute travel time savings from the current alternative.
Committee Chair Lubow asked how the CCD center-running BRT alternative
impacted RTD bus bulbs and the queue jump lanes.
Ms. Bell explained that queue jump lanes would not be a capital investment
for restriping, and that the 12 locations for the bus bulbs have been
determined by working with CCD, and would remain to become added
sidewalk space.

Ms. Bell commented that the shelters along the corridor were all the same
design and that, as funding became available, they would be converted to
real-time electronic displays.

6.C

Committee Chair Lubow asked who would be operating the buses.

Ms. Snyder explained that the current cost estimates had full funding for
design within the 2017-2018 capital improvement budget. She added that
CCD hoped to secure additional bond funding and federal funding for
construction, and that cost estimates include fleet buy up to support
operation of the corridor, but noted that CCD currently assumed that
operation would remain with RTD.

D. Other Matters
Mr. Stopplecamp provided an update on the Longmont First and Main Station
stating that the City of Longmont has requested to enter into a Memorandum of
Understanding and a future Intergovernmental Agreement regarding the station,
which was currently a park-n-ride as part of the Eagle Project.
Director Sisk stated that this was positive news.
Chair Hoy asked how the $17 million budget would be used to change the scope of
the current project.
Mr. Stopplecamp explained that RTD will provide the amount set aside for the
original project, that the new scope must include RTD requirements, and Longmont
would need to provide the additional funding to any modifications to the scope.
Chair Hoy stated that it was not unlike what the agency has done in the past with
other cities.
Committee Chair Lubow thanked Mr. Stopplecamp for moving forward on this
project for the City of Longmont.

B. Recommended Actions

• Federal Liaison Services
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter
into an agreement for Federal Liaison Services with Squire Patton Boggs LLP
for a one-year option at a cost of $270,000 (January 1 through December
31, 2018). This action represents the fourth year of a five-year contract.
Funding for this contract is included in the annual budget.
Motion:

Director Sisk made the motion to move this item
to the full Board at the November 28, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Williams seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, provided the
background on the Squire Patton Boggs (SBP) contract and
stated that having the team in Washington D.C. allows them
to constantly stay in touch with legislatures and other federal
agencies that RTD deals with on a regular basis. She noted
that just this week, SPB sent a letter to Elaine Chao the
Secretary of Transportation in regards to RTD’s application for
the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery
(TIGER) grant. She added that Mike Dino and his SPB
colleagues continue to keep RTD in the forefront of the
congressional delegation and they are extremely important and
valuable to RTD.
Director Folska commended SPB and stated that RTD needed
the support in Washington D.C.

C. Updates

was no additional information to report.
Director Lubow asked for additional information regarding the Metro Mayors
Caucus favoring a larger sales tax increase.
Ms. Ellebracht stated she would have Mr. Sherman send the information
when he returned.

• State Update - Brandeberry McKenna
Jennifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry McKenna (BBMK), followed up on the
written report adding that the firm continued to schedule and coordinate
meetings on behalf of the District with key legislators on a variety of
subjects. She added that the firm provided an update on the G-Line and
FasTracks to the following officials:

Future meetings are scheduled with Representative Lebsock, Kraft
Tharp, Gray, Garnett, Winter, Bridges, Covarrubias and Senator
Martinez Humenik.
During the September meeting of the Transportation Legislation
Review Committee (TLRC) a bill draft was requested to implement
a low-income transit fare reductions pilot program.
BBMK continues to meet on behalf of RTD with the lobbyists and
lawyers for Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD) and
the Special Districts Association on potential legislative options to
address the drafting error in SB267.
RTD will be presenting to the TLRC on November 2nd at 10:15am
and encouraged Board members to attend.
BBMK organized a briefing on Public Private Partnerships to
legislators and members of the Denver Metro Chamber Public
Affairs Council. The briefing highlighted successful projects such
as FasTracks and Denver Union Station.

Director Broom requested additional information on the marijuana tax
marijuana tax issue and how the tax could be reinstated or reset up to a
certain percentage.
Ms. Brandeberry stated that the firm could provide the legal analysis and the
current status of that issue.
Director Folska commended BBMK for all of their work.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Mike Dino, SBP, followed up on the written report and said that his firm had
assisted in receiving four delegate signatures from the Colorado House of
Representatives (Buck, Coffman, DeGette, and Perlmutter) for RTD’s TIGER
grant application. He explained that the proposal was for $12.85 million
which would fund the replacement of the light rail track and switches in the
Denver central business district that was in need of heavy repair as it was
the most utilized part of the light rail system. Mr. Dino added that the new
administration had released its tax legislation package and there were two
elements which were surprising: they want to eliminate private activity
bonds which funds a lot of public financing and they want to also eliminate
public refinancing bonds which are used to secure lower interest rates. He
noted that this is currently in the House and is being argued in the Ways and
Means Committee but the Senate is also working on their version and they
tend to be more supportive of local and state activities. He added that this
package would also remove the deductibility of state and local taxes, which
would not impact Colorado as much as the higher tax states. He stated that
the firm continues to press the issue for RTD’s refund of the $29 million
credit risk premium associated with the Federal Railroad Administration

He further added that the 2018 appropriation budget may be extended past

C. Updates

• Civil Rights Committee Updates
Zamy Silva, Senior Manager of Civil Rights, introduced two new employees
to the Civil Rights Division: Kathryne Grove, Equal Employment Opportunity
(EEO) Manager, and Anne Hillyer, ADA Investigator/Specialist.
Ms. Silva stated that this year RTD went through the Federal Transit
Administration’s (FTA) Triennial Review and the FTA recognized RTD’s
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) and Equal Employment Office
(EEO) as model programs with best practices.
Ms. Silva added that in July RTD hosted a one day US Department of
Transportation (DOT) Career Days Discovery:
 Six girls with ages ranging from 13-19 had an opportunity to spend a
day at RTD learning about careers in transportation and construction.
 They also spent a day at Denver International Airport (DIA), Iron
Horse Architects Inc., P&H Equipment, and Wagner Equipment. This
also created media coverage in the Denver Post, Denver Business
Journal, and news channels 7, 9 and 31.
Ms. Silva commented that RTD implemented a new Advisory Committee for
People with Disabilities (ACPD):
 The mission of ACPD, through multi-directional communication,
apprises the ADA Steering Committee on ADA-community related
issues and concerns and provides suggestions, ideas, and feedback
on matters as they relate to people with disabilities. ACPD will serve
in an advisory capacity and be assisted by a designated staff liaison
to the ADA Steering Committee.

ACPD is comprised of 13 members who will serve 1, 2, or 3 year
terms.
ACPD will work with an ADA Steering Committee made up of 11
members who are RTD staff as well as ADA working groups made up
of various RTD staff across the organization.
RTD held an orientation for ACPD members on August 31, 2017.
ACPD will meet on a quarterly basis and the next meeting will be
November 9, 2017.

Ms. Silva stated that the Small Business Office (SBO) collaborated with the
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the City and County of
Denver, and Denver hosted the first Colorado Small Business Collaboration
Conference on September 21st:
 VIP Presenters gave their perspectives on the future of transportation
and opportunities for small, minority, women and disadvantages
owned businesses.
 VIP Presenters included:
o Mayor B. Hancock from the City of Denver
o David A. Genova, RTD General Manager and CEO
o Shailen Bhatt, CDOT Executive Director
o Eric Hiraga, Executive Director of the Denver Office of Economic
Development
 369 people pre-registered for this event and 303 people attended. It
was an all-day event and a huge success.
Ms. Silva added that the next SBO event would be the Small Business
Breakfast of Champions, which would be held at the Radisson Hotel Denver
Southeast on Thursday, November 9th. She noted that RTD has spent over a
billion dollars in small business development and the agency wanted to
recognize that achievement.
Director Folska inquired if the Civil Rights Division was helping to recruit
operators.
Ms. Silva explained that currently the Workforce Initiative Now (WIN)
program is helping with the outreach for bus and light rail operators. She
commented that since RTD received a grant in 2015, staff is working with
the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to see if some of those funds could
be used for a more robust outreach effort to help RTD recruit operators.
Director Folska asked how many people Civil Rights helped to recruit and
hire.
Ms. Silva stated that the information would be researched and provided to
the Board the next day.

Director Lubow asked if the ADA investigator was a new position, and if so
what did that position do.

General Manager Genova remarked that the Small Business Breakfast of
Champions was sponsored so that people could attend at no charge. He
added that the Civil Rights team had been working hard on event planning
and it was a great opportunity to mark the FasTracks success with small,
women-owned, and disadvantaged business owners.
Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, commented that he had pulled Kathryne
Grove, RTD’s new EEO Manager, out during the break in between meetings
and said that he wanted to make sure that she was properly introduced to
the Board.

Ms. Silva explained that the position was new and was identified last year.
She noted that RTD has had a lot of ADA complaints and in 2016 staff
spent a lot of time improving ADA procedures. She added that some
complaints required more attention than others, and with Ms. Hillyer’s legal
background, she was able to work with the various RTD divisions to ensure
complaints were properly handled and investigated.

B. Discussion of General Manager's Performance Appraisal
Committee Chair Francone stated that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss
General Manager Genova’s performance appraisal and the committee’s
recommendations. She noted that that meeting agenda showed the possibility of an
executive session, and she asked whether the Directors felt the need to go into
executive session or whether they could speak freely.

Chair Hoy said he did not feel the committee would need to go into executive
committee but the possibility should be reserved.
Director Sisk agreed and said he would like to stay away from executive sessions.
Committee Chair Francone asked whether the General Manager had any objections.

Committee Chair Francone said the possibility would be reserved but noted that, if
someone felt it necessary, the committee could resolve into executive session. She
stated that procedurally the committee had evaluated the General Manager’s
performance, and the General Manager had completed a self-evaluation, based on
the core goals stated in his job description and the task goals set forth and
approved during the joint Board and Senior Leadership Team (SLT) retreat in March
2017. She noted that the General Manager had previously provided the committee
with his formal mid-year self-evaluation and had updated that document to reflect
his accomplishments to date. She stated that the committee also considered
surveys submitted to the Directors from mid-year and the end of the year. She
stated the committee’s consensus was that the General Manager had exceeded
expectations on Core Goals #1 through #5 and Task Goal #3 and had achieved
expectations on Task Goals #1 and #2. Based on that evaluation, she stated the
committee’s recommendation, on a vote of five in favor and two opposed, was to
award the General Manager a 4% discretionary performance payout. She noted that
her no vote was based on the amount of the payout, rather than the General
Manager’s performance grade or any other factor.
Director Broom asked whether the recommendation would be voted on by the full
Board.
Committee Chair Francone said that the full Board would vote and that she had
hoped for more participation from the rest of the Board during the review process.
She said the purpose of that day’s meeting was to socialize what would come
before the Board, which was the committee’s recommendation.
Ms. McManus said that, though the committee voted at last the meeting, based on
the conversation during that meeting and the committee’s previous vote, she had
put together the official Board report, which the committee would move forward
that day.
Director Broom clarified that the Board report would reflect the committee’s
decision and the Board members who were not on the committee would still be
able to speak to the recommendation.

Packet Pg. 55

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 14, 2017 2:00 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova said he had no objections to remaining in open session.

6.F

Ms. McManus said that was correct and noted that the Executive Committee would
approve the recommendation and send it to the full Board, barring any unforeseen
circumstances. She stated that the full Board would receive the entire contents of
the committee packet, rather than just the recommended action.
Chair Hoy mentioned that he and Committee Chair Francone had met with General
Manager Genova the previous Friday to brief him on the outcome of the
committee’s recommendation.

Director Broom asked General Manager Genova whether the Board could do
anything to help him do his job better.
General Manager Genova said that the Board supported him and the staff very well
and that he and staff had two-way relationships with each Board member. He said
that all of the Directors were comfortable talking to him and to staff about their
ideas and recommendations and suggested that everyone should continue forging
ahead with open, candid dialogue. He noted that he had met the previous week
with Director Broom to discuss ideas surrounding the R Line and stated that he
would continue to do one-on-one meetings with Directors in 2018. He said that it
was important to be transparent and present with the stakeholders and with the
Board. He stated that committees and community groups were good ways to tell
RTD’s story and to get input from stakeholders.
Director Anderson thanked the General Manager for his hard work trying to keep
the agency focused on going down the right track. She said she knew things had
been tough and was still disappointed with the G Line not opening on time. She
stated that she appreciated everything that the General Manager and staff had done
to see everything through, even though the cards were stacked against them. She
said the agency had received a great deal of criticism, but she had not seen any
wavering as they strove to achieve their goal.
Director Sisk noted that 2018 would be an election year stated that he hoped the
Board would continue to do the business of the agency and rather than politicizing
and making staff the subject of anyone’s campaign. He said that would mean
taking the high road in supporting staff and understanding that staff was
responsible for implementing direction given by the Board.
Director Menten said suggested that the phrasing of the recommended action be
changed from “Board” to “Committee” to reflect which body had made the
recommendation.
Ms. McManus said the she did not see any reason the verbiage could not change.
Packet Pg. 56

Committee Chair Francone said they had spoken with the General Manager so that
he would be prepared to answer questions.

6.F

Committee Chair Francone asked whether a resolution would be drafted following
the Board’s approval of the recommended action.
Ms. McManus explained that the Board had adopted resolutions in the past but that
it was decided they were no longer needed.

Ms. McManus said the results were good but were not definitive as to whether the
General Manager had exceeded or achieved expectations. She said the surveys
were not set up to be as granular as the performance evaluation but would be
changed to mirror the evaluation going forward. She also asked whether the
committee agreed to change the language in the recommended action.
Committee Chair Francone asked whether a motion was needed.
Chair Hoy suggested the motion for the recommended action could state that the
action be approved as amended.
Committee Chair Francone noted for those on the phone that Directors Williams and
Solano were in attendance. She explained to Director Solano that the committee
was soliciting questions with respect to their recommendation on the performance
evaluation and discretionary performance payout and asked if he had comments.
Director Solano said that he wanted to read the recommended action.
Director Broom said he assumed that establishing a budget for the organization was
the General Manager’s primary function. He asked when the General Manager’s
goals for 2018 would be established.
General Manager Genova stated that the Board decides the following year’s goals in
March of each year. He stated that the General Manager was responsible for
presenting a strategic plan, which would become the specific task goals. He noted
that core goals remain the same and were based on the job description.
Director Broom reiterated that the General Manager would know ahead of time
what the next year would look like.
Committee Chair Francone said that the Board and General Manager were always
ahead so that the General Manager could put together a plan for the upcoming
year.
General Manager Genova said that the staff takes the General Manager’s goals and
work them into the annual budget and the longer-term strategic budget plans.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 14, 2017 2:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten asked whether all respondents to the survey felt that the General
Manager had exceeded expectations.

6.F

Committee Chair Francone said the committee would reconvene in 2018 around the
time of the retreat and would meet with the General Manager once again to assess
his performance.

Director Sisk said that the committee has been handled in an effective and efficient
way, and he thanked Committee Chair Francone and Ms. McManus. He stated that
the committee had previously been acrimonious and not productive and that more
objectivity had been established, which made the committee more manageable and
understanding. He stated that disparate thoughts had not been disregarded. He
gave kudos to those involved and said they were not afraid to make changes.
Director Solano stated that the human capital aspect of the agency left a lot to be
desired. He said that the agency’s budget was such that he could not see giving
the General Manager a discretionary performance payout.
Committee Chair Francone said that the work of the committee had been to go
through and evaluate the General Manager’s performance for 2017 based on the
core goals set out in his job description and the task goals that came out of retreat.
She said the review chart, which was different from previous years, was used to
graphically display this committee’s agreement or disagreement on the General
Manager’s self-assessment. She said that document was taken into consideration,
as were the Directors’ comments and the survey that went out to all Directors,
along with the committee’s performance review in which they rated the General
Manager as having exceeded expectations on six goals and as achieving
expectations on two. She said the committee voted in favor of a 4% discretionary
performance payout as a result.
Director Solano said he disagreed and stated that a public agency should not
measure the General Manager in the same way a private corporation would. He said
the General Manager was being paid a bonus out of taxpayers’ money and said he
had a problem with that.
Director Broom noted that the General Manager’s performance payout in his
contract was part of the pay package that would be reviewed as a part of the
contract. Regarding Director Solano’s earlier comment about the state of the
budget, he said that the budget was balanced and that he had never seen a public
budget in which all of the entity’s needs had been met. He explained that Director
Solano’s position would mean that the General Manager would never be given a
bonus.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 14, 2017 2:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. McManus pointed out that the retreat in March 2018 would establish the goals
for 2019. She said that the General Manager would present his tactical goals for
2019 in the April 2018 study session and that the goals would be approved by
Board. Following that, she said the committee would take a break until mid-year, at
which point the General Manager’s performance would be reevaluated against the
2018 goals established in 2017.

6.F

Director Solano said that his position would be that employees, the backbone of the
organization, should get the bonus.
Committee Chair Francone thanked Director Solano for his comments and for
voicing his opinion. She stated that the committee’s recommendation would be
presented to full Board on November 28th, 2017. She said that she and the General
Manager were available to answer questions or take comments.

Committee Chair Francone asked Director Solano if he completed a survey.
Director Solano said that information was confidential.
Committee Chair Francone said that the comments of Directors who completed the
survey would be been included in the packet. She asked the General Manager if he
had any questions moving forward.
General Manager Genova said he had no questions but was happy to see that the
committee’s evaluation was aligned with his self-assessment. He stated that his
evaluation was reflective of the entire agency. He said he would share the results
with the entire organization to show that the agency was meeting goals set out for
them.

C. Recommended Action

• Approval of General Manager's 2017 Performance Evaluation
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance
Management Committee that the Board of Directors approve the General
Manager’s performance appraisal for 2017 as defined in the attached
completed General Manager’s Performance Evaluation Packet. The General
Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee is pleased to
report they are in agreement with General Manager Genova’s selfassessments and feel he has achieved or exceeded his overall goals for the
2017 Performance Appraisal. Although it has been a challenging year, the
General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee
recognizes that General Manager Genova has met the “Exceeds
Expectations” for all of the Core Goals and one of the Task Goals and
“Achieved Expectations” for the remaining Task Goals set forth for
performance in 2017. Based on the consistent and outstanding performance
in leading the RTD and the overall compensation philosophy is to hire and
maintain top talent in keeping with the industry compensation of transit
leadership peers we feel General Manager Genova has earned a discretionary

B. Recommended Actions

• Longmont Fare Buy Up
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
execute all documents necessary to enter into an Agreement with the City of
Longmont to buy up fares on all four of the Longmont local fixed route
services herein referenced as “the 300 series.” Specifically the 300 series
are routes 323, 324, 326 and 327 and complementary Access-a-Ride
services for a period of two years.
Motion:

Director Lubow made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 28, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Brian Matthews, Manager of Special Services, provided the
overview stating that Boulder County entered into an
agreement with the RTD in 2014 to “buy up” all fares on the
300 series routes in Longmont. He explained that Boulder
County received the funding from the City of Longmont to
assist in the buy up program, and that contract to buy up
service will expire in December 2017. He explained that this
is an extension of the contract and that the City of Longmont
would like to continue the Longmont Free Fare program for
an o t h e r two years.
Director Broom asked how the $130,000 amount determined.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 14, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson and Folska participated via phone. Director Tisdale was absent.

6.G

Mr. Matthews explained that the amount was calculated by the
finance office, and it took into consideration fare increases. He
also stated that if there were another increase that the “buy
up” cost would increase.

Director Lubow stated that this was a very popular program
and stopped the nose dive in ridership. She added that the city
was paying for the program and that she supports it.
Director Francone stated that she was in support of the
program. She asked if the decline in ridership due to high fares
was based on statistical data.
Mr. Abel explained that with the fare adjustments made in the
early 2000’s there was a separate fare in Longmont that was
lower than the general RTD Local fare price, and when RTD
implemented a district wide adjustment that all local fares be
priced the same Longmont suffered a decline in ridership. He
added that the City of Longmont decided to implement this
program to see if ridership would increase.
Chair Hoy asked if the dollar amount that the City of Longmont
paid had remained constant since the “buy up” contract had
become effective.
Mr. Matthews stated that was correct.
Chair Hoy asked whether the 8% ridership increase had been
since this contract went into effect or in the last year.
Mr. Matthews explained that ridership was 156,863 boardings
and had doubled to 373,204 boardings since the program
began. He added that RTD performed a survey and that
determined that there is an 8% increase of new riders. He also
explained that the riders previously would take one trip with a
number of transfers and the program had given riders more
alternatives and take multiple trips.
Director Deadwyler asked if there would be an increase in the
amount provided by the City of Longmont due to the increase
in ridership, and if that impacted revenue to RTD.
Packet Pg. 63

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 14, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Bruce Abel, Acting Chief Operations Officer and Assistant
General Manager of Bus Operations, explained that the amount
was based on fares received over the last year prior to
Longmont entering into the fare “buy up” agreement.

6.G

Mr. Matthews explained that the city will not pay additional
cost because there is no additional or new equipment being
used. He added that if there was a fare increase the city
would pay an additional amount.

Mr. Matthews explained that a passenger on the local 300
series could be issued a transfer and pay the difference for a
regional route ticket.
Director Folska stated that she was in support of the program.
Director Anderson asked if the issue was either the number of
riders or the number of trips.
Mr. Matthews explained that prior to this program a customer
would make several stops on one trip, and with the program
the same customer would take several trips per day.
Director Anderson stated the program allows for riders to board
several times per day. She added that she supports the
program.
Director Menten stated that RTD receives two payments a year
and that it breaks down to approximately $0.70 per boarding,
which is quite a difference from the regular $2.70 for a local
fare. She asked if RTD was losing money through the program.
Mr. Abel clarified that the intent of the program was to see if
the increase to the fare in 2002 was a decline in ridership. He
explained that the amount of boardings had increased from this
program with an increase of 8% new riders, that was
determined by the survey RTD conducted. All of this is done
within the existing capacity and that while riders are increasing
their trips by almost double. There is no cost to RTD the
revenue per has gone down.
Director Menten asked if the 300 series routes have more
people in the seats.
Mr. Abel explained that the increase was trips per person.
Director Solano asked at what point would the agency need to
buy more buses.
Packet Pg. 64

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 14, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler asked if the program was for local fares
only, if there was route from Longmont to Denver, and if the
free ride applied to those routes.

6.G

Mr. Matthews stated that the agency has a lot of capacity and
it was not anticipated to add equipment for many years.

Committee Vice Chair Williams stated that the people in
Boulder County are pleased with the program and that it has
been very good for the RTD image. She added that the agency
was not adding any additional services or costs and that the
program is making transit affordable and accessible.
Director Francone asked if RTD was losing money on the
program.
Mr. Abel stated that the intent was for RTD to remain revenue
neutral, and that the contract had a short out clause was
because if ridership increase to the point of requiring additional
service the contract would have to be renegotiated. He added
that this project worked because Longmont has a very isolated
service system, and that this project could not be done in a
district where travel overlaps into other districts.
Director Walker stated his support of the program and that it
opened access to a lot of people and gives riders more options.

Motion:

Director Broom made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 28, 2017
Board Meeting.

Discussion:

Jeff Becker, Manager of Services and Development, explained
that Transportation Management & Design, Inc. (TMD)
provides on-call service planning assistance to RTD a n d
t h a t TMD has been selected on three different occasions
through RTD’s Request for Proposal (RFP) process over the
last 15 years to perform a variety of service planning studies
for projects which require more time or specific expertise
than RTD Service Development staff have available. He
stated that some projects have included the restructuring
of bus services associated with the opening of the A-Line rail
service, the B-Line rail service, the R-Line rail service, and the
planned opening of the G-Line rail service. He added that
TMD is currently working to provide assistance in the
restructuring of bus service associated with the planned
opening of the N-Line rail service, and that TMD has provided
assistance with various transit priority studies.
Director Archuleta asked why there was an increase of
$150,000, and if the company was performing additional
work.
Mr. Becker explained that the additional money is for the
exceeding years and that this funding was for the option years
and for performing additional tasks.
Director Francone asked whether the tasks are outside the
scope or expertise of RTD.
Mr. Becker stated that RTD doesn’t have the time and possibly
the expertise to do the tasks.
Director Folska stated she was in support.

• Free Rides for Members of the Military
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that
free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military
should be extended from the presently approved date of December 31, 2017
to December 31, 2018. Utilization has been minimal to date and this
extension will have minimal impact on RTD.
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the November 28,
2017 Board Meeting.
Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications,
explained that at the October 30, 2006 Special Board
Meeting, the RTD Board of Directors approved a resolution
allowing active duty U.S. Military personnel to ride free on all
RTD services through the end of 2006. This offer has been
extended annually by the Board since that time and is now
valid through December 31, 2017. As a result of these
actions, all active duty members of the Army, Navy, Air
Force, Marines, Coast Guard, National Guard, and Reserves
are entitled to ride free on any RTD service including special
services such as SkyRide and BroncosRide. To be eligible to
ride for free, active duty military personnel must either be in
uniform or present an active duty military ID card. Staff
recommends that the RTD Board of Directors extend this offer
beyond the current expiration date of December 31, 2017 and
that the expiration date be extended by one year at this time
and revisited again next year.
Director Folska stated she would vote in favor to show support
of the active duty members.

C. Updates

• 2016 Performance Review
Jeff Becker, Manager of Special Services, provided an overview of the 2016
Service Review stating that this report is done annually that is done to meet
the RTD mission to provide cost-effective service throughout the district. He
stated that the review did not include fare revenue by route because the fare
zone structure was changed and Service Standards were revised to combine
the Express, SkyRide and Regional routes into one Regional class. He added
that the department discovered some issues with the revenue allocation
method used for many years that will be addressed with a new model under
development to improve revenue allocation and provide better inputs into the
service performance evaluation. He stated that due to all these changes, the
agency did not have the resources to prepare accurate subsidy calculations
for 2016, and the report reflects only cost or cost per boarding by route. He
added that the results are still very useful and similar to previous reports and
we will provide a complete analysis for 2017. He concluded that the agency
guidelines state that the least productive 10% of routes based on either
subsidy per boarding or boardings per hour need to be evaluated for
marketing, revision or elimination, or both if measures fall below 25% for a
route, and that the agency had addressed some of the “outside of the box”
routes with service changes.

Director Sisk stated that he was continually disappointed about not having
ridership numbers, and it discredits RTD that ridership figures have not been
provided.
Mr. Becker stated we do have that numbers and will provide those numbers
to the board office.

Mr. Abel stated that the agency had some technical issues with the people
counters used to determine the ridership numbers and a number of people
working to resolve the issue.
Mr. Becker stated that the agency would rather put out the correct numbers
than any numbers.
Director Francone requested time offline to understand the details of the
2016 Service Review.
Chair Hoy asked how the Broncos Ride has less boarding per hour because it
appears that there were hundreds of people boarding those routes.
Jessie Carter, Service Planning and Scheduling Manager, explained that the
number of boardings and the number of service hours need to be considered,
and that in the case of the Bronco Ride there are operating hours where
buses are not in service.
Chair Hoy concluded that the operators were paid for time spent waiting for
the bus to leave, or the game to end.
Director Menten stated that she would like to join Director Francone in a
meeting regarding the performance review results
Mr. Carter stated that 2016 had a lot of big changes in service with the
introduction of the Flatiron Flyer in January, the A line in April, and the B line
in August.
Director Deadwyler requested to be included in the meeting with Director
Francone and Menten.
Director Anderson requested a presentation in writing to the whole board.

Mr. Abel assured the Board that a workshop would be scheduled regarding
on the service performance review.

Mr. Abel stated RTD has been providing updates on lost service hours since
reports showed that it was an issue. He stated that in 2013 to 2014 lost
service hours were reported in the single digits, but by the middle of 2015
had risen to double and triple digits. He added that in 2016 and 2017 as the
agency experienced greater head count challenges the ability to meet service
commitment to customers. He summarized the increase in lost service hours
provided in the report stating that 2016 and 2017 continue to be
challenging to meet service commitment. He added that the lost service
hours coincide with the mandating of employees to work on their days off.
He explained that RTD mandates 9-10% of the daily service hours and are
unable to perform approximately 1% of service hours. Mr. Abel stated that
the agency continues to work with human resources to address the
headcount shortage, which is 11% under the required number of operators,
on recruitment and retention. He added that this is one of the most
important issues facing the agency provided some of the incentives that
have been implemented to recruit and retain operators. He concluded that
the agency has recently needed to mandate on the rail lines due to lack of
operators and are working to resolve that issue.
Director Menten how many applicants fail a drug exam, specifically
marijuana.
Mr. Abel shared that prior to legalizing marijuana approximately 6-8
applicants a year that failed a drug test and after legalizing marijuana
approximately 11-12 applicants per year failed. He added that that RTD is a
drug free workplace and those that participate in extracurricular drug use
should not apply.
Director Menten asked if there a zero tolerance, or if there was certain
percentage that was allowed.
Mr. Abel explained that there are thresholds established by the federal
regulations, but he would ask the agencies drug and alcohol department
provide that information.
Director Archuleta asked how much money the agency was losing due to
lost service hours.
Mr. Abel explained that the agency tracks only the lost service hours and
has not converted those numbers to a monetary value.

Director Lubow asked if there was a plan or expectation to address the
issue.
Mr. Abel explained that RTD analyzes all avenues to address the issue and
that it is a viscous cycle that when you get behind in head count then RTD
mandates operators which in turn makes operators leave the agency. He
added that maybe the agency should examine if Ask RTD the correct size to
provide all the service being provided. service.

Mr. Abel stated that the agency continues to examine all avenues to improve
recruiting and retention.
Chair Hoy we are not running the routes that are high volume 20-25%
Mr. Abel explained that RTD may save money by not running some service
but that doesn’t meet our customer service, however the financial
assessment is on the mark.
Chair Hoy ask what happened in September and October as to why there is
such a higher demand for service.
Mr. Abel explained that the spikes in service correspond to the National
Football League (NFL) season beginning that create a large volume of
required/mandated service. He added that the NFL and other seasonal events
add an extraordinary demand on RTD service and that reports show the
agency would mandate less when there are less games or events.
Director Walker stated that operator demand is a nationwide issue, and that
the low level unemployment rate makes this it hard to resolve the issue.
Director Deadwyler asked what the agency was doing to create new
strategies and ideas to address the issue.
Director Abel stated that the issue of work life balance is an issue facing
transit agencies across the country. He stated that some agencies has
deferred service due to the issue of retaining or ability to man the operation.
He explained that the agency has attempted to provide more straight runs
and fewer split runs for operators, and to minimize spread time in order to
create a better work life balance. He added that RTD is working on the
financial side, but that 72% of our ridership was school and work related
both of which has very real peaking hours and until there is a shift in society
from the population needing to travel between 6-9 in the morning and 3:30
– 6:30 in the evening, RTD will continue to need to provide 800 buses or
more during those time and half in the middle of the day. He concluded that

the incentives are have far less impact than the agency would like but that
we continue to persevere at improving the situation.
Director Solano that the Metro or somewhere back east were planning on a
strike during the super bowl and asked how this would be handled if the
agency were faced with the same issue.

Director Lubow stated her surprise that many missed routes were based on
the Bronco games and the different
Abel explained that it was a holistic issue and that the agency is impacted
by all events that take place in the area, htat it impacts routes both the day
of the event and the morning after.
Director Lubow asked if the agency prioritized the routes, stating that it
made sense that the morning routes to get customers to work were more
important than an event.
Director Anderson stated that it was a vexing problem it is not something
the Board can resolve and hopes things will improve. She added isn’t just a
wage problem and paying employees more but that with the low
unemployment rate there is a problem attracting and retaining employees.
Committee Chair Williams thanked all of the staff for working hard to deal
with the situation.

• 2018 Investment Policy
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”),
attached.
Motion:

Director Lubow made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 28th,
2017 Board Meeting.

Discussion:

Brendan Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments,
stated that the purpose of the recommended action was to
specify the Board’s policies and procedures that support a
prudent and systematic investment program for operating and
reserve funds. He said the priorities for the agency’s
investments were safety, liquidity, and yield. He said that the
only change to the policy was the addition of a rating by the
Fitch credit rating agency.
Director Broom asked whether RTD bought Yankee bonds as
part of its investment portfolio.
Mr. Morgan said that the agency did not presently buy Yankee
bonds but did own supranational bonds, such as those issued
by the World Bank, that were denominated in US dollars and
backed by the federal government.
Director Broom then asked whether the agency purchased
Canadian bonds.
Mr. Morgan confirmed that RTD did not purchase Canadian
bonds.
Directors Anderson and Folska both said that they had no
questions and would support the motion.

• 2018 Recommended Budget
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2017 for the
adoption of the 2018 Budget, Resolution No. ___, Series of 2017 for the
2018 Budget Appropriation and Resolution No. ___, Series of 2017 for the
appropriation of 2018 Previously Appropriated Capital.
Director Mihalik made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 28th,
2017 Board Meeting.
Director Archuleta seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Ms. Scarpino presented the overview of the recommended
budget and noted that the Board had already discussed the
Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and the Strategic Budget
Plan (SBP). She said the total appropriation for 2018 was $2
billion, with a capital carryforward of $743 million. She stated
the budget contained three major changes since the requested
budget was presented to the Board in October: the inclusion of
$13 million in expense projects approved in the SBP, an
expense project carryforward of $41 million, and the startup
costs for the RTD operation of North Metro. She said that the
total district operating expenses for 2018 were $13.6 million
higher than in the 2017 amended budget. She reported that
overall FasTracks project expenses were diminishing. She said
the agency budgeted diesel fuel at $1.80 per gallon, compared
with $1.69 per gallon for fiscal year 2017, and she stated that
fuel prices had recently been above $2.00. She said the
agency would move to lock in fuel prices in the near future
and added that gasoline prices in the budget were projected to
be $2.65 per gallon. She indicated there would be no change
to interest expense or principal debt payments and stated that
no new debt would be issued in 2018. Regarding capital
expenditures, she said the budget contained $59 million in
new capital for the Base system, which included the purchase
of 40’ transit vehicles, the Burnham Yard Lead purchase, and
the Colfax transit priority project. She noted that the fleet
would be financed through previous debt issuances. She said
the capital carryforward on the Base system was $105 million.
For the FasTracks system, she stated that new capital totaled
$129 million, which included North Metro projects, and the
capital carryforward totaled $639 million. Regarding budget
assumptions, she stated that sales & use tax revenues were
projected to be 4.9% over 2017, farebox revenue was

projected to be 3% higher, and grant revenue was expected to
be $13 million lower, largely due to drawdowns in 2017 rather
than 2018. She stated that FasTracks accounted for most of
the ridership growth.

Ms. Scarpino said that the budget did not contemplate any
proceeds from the Volkswagen settlement and that the agency
did budget for filled positions, meaning that the agency would
experience vacancy savings for the duration of any vacancy.
She noted that any new positions created must first go
through the SBP evaluation process.
Director Sisk said it was alarming that the agency had not
locked in the price of diesel fuel at a time when prices were
over $2.00 per gallon.
Ms. McKillop said that fuel prices were still seeing the effects
from disruptions caused by hurricanes and that the agency
would lock the diesel fuel price once it reached $1.80 per
gallon.
Bruce Abel, Acting Chief Operations Officer and Assistant
General Manager of Bus Operations, said that RTD received
reports from the fuel supplier and had placed an order for an
automatic lock on diesel fuel once prices reached $1.80 per
gallon.
Director Sisk asked whether fuel prices were lower before the
hurricane season.
Ms. McKillop said that fuel prices had not been below $1.80.
Mr. Abel added that fuel prices were in the mid $1.80 range
and were experiencing declines.
Ms. McKillop said the agency would be better off not to lock
prices too early.
Director Lubow stated that the Board Report mentioned higher
than estimated service payments for operations and
maintenance on the Eagle project.
Packet Pg. 77

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 14, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Broom asked whether the budget anticipated any
forthcoming proceeds from the Volkswagen settlement and
whether RTD budgeted the personnel costs for filled positions,
rather than the actual headcount.

6.H

Ms. Scarpino answered that the higher costs were associated
with performance metrics for Denver Transit Operators (DTO).
She said that they received a higher payment due to a high ontime-performance rating.

Director Lubow asked about the $5 million contingency
reserve contained in the budget.
Ms. Scarpino said the contingency reserve would be used for
emergency needs and project overruns. She said the reserve
was created in an effort to reduce overbudgeting in certain
projects. She said the General Manager controlled
disbursements from the reserve and that requests would go
through him for approval.
Ms. McKillop noted that General Manager Genova’s approval
authority had limits and that request amounts exceeding his
authority would be sent to the Board. She said staff changed
the way they budgeted operating costs to look at different
factors for the allocation of costs, which were applied to the
operating budget. She said that the change was made both to
temper the budget and to allow flexibility, while at the same
time building trust with budget managers. She said that the
new process would be monitored and could be reexamined the
following year.
Director Francone asked whether the capital carryforward
projects identified in Attachment C were incomplete projects
for which funds had been appropriated.
Ms. Scarpino said that was correct.
Directors Anderson and Folska said they would support the
recommended action.

Packet Pg. 78

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 14, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. McKillop said that DTO would earn a bonus for reaching
an on-time-performance rating of 95%. She said the budget
was adjusted because DTO was approaching the 95%
threshold.

• September 2017 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug McLeod, Controller, presented the monthly financial report. He said
sales and use tax continued to perform better than budgeted. He said that
revenues had been projected to increase 4% over 2016 but actual revenues
were 2.7% higher than expected, yielding $11.7 million over expectations.
He noted that the agency was still receiving $200,000 per month in
marijuana sales tax revenues, despite the fact that vendors were not
required to collect the tax beginning July 1, 2017, and that the total loss of
revenue to the agency was $800,000. He said that the higher than expected
sales and use tax revenues were attributable to sales in certain economic
sectors, such as car dealerships, full service restaurants, hotels, and home
centers. He said the agency experienced an increase in revenues from
internet sales of $600,000.
Ms. McKillop said that vendors who remitted marijuana sales and use tax
revenues after July 1, 2017, were entitled to a refund upon their request.
She said some vendors would not ask for a refund and noted that the
agency had received $500,000 in additional marijuana tax revenues since
July.
Director Menten asked for more information regarding internet sales.
Mr. MacLeod said that RTD could collect sales tax from vendors who had
nexus in the district. He said that Amazon had created nexus in the district
and that the agency had begun to receive taxes collected on Amazon’s
sales. He added that ridership was 9.9% lower than expected and that fare
revenue was down 8.9%. He noted that the 2017 budget had contemplated
higher growth in ridership from the R and G Lines. He said that ridership was
down 4.4% year-over-year for the month of September and down 1.5%
overall year-to-date. He noted that ridership on non-revenue services, such
as the 16th Street Mall Shuttle, was down as well. He noted King Soopers
had returned unused 10-ride ticket books purchased in 2017, which resulted
in a credit of $300,000. He said fare revenue was up 5.6% year over year,
which was largely attributable to the University of Colorado A Line and the

increased ticket price for that line. Overall, he said that total revenues were
$11.1 million, or 2%, over budget.
Chair Hoy asked whether it would be fair to assume that retailers who
remitted marijuana sales and use taxes and subsequently received a refund
would have difficulty locating the patrons who had paid the tax.

Director Francone asked about the $29 million refund that resulted from the
Denver Union Station refinancing.
Ms. McKillop said that the bill that would facilitate the refund had stalled
because Congress was operating under a continuing resolution. She said a
bill could pass in 2017 and noted that staff regularly spoke with
representatives from the City and County of Denver because of Denver’s
own financial interest in the refund.

• SmartCard Project Update and Mobile Ticketing Demo
Ms. McKillop stated that the mobile ticketing smartphone application (app)
went live on November 1, 2017. She said that users could purchase day
passes through the app and that the agency was looking into offering other
types of fare media. She said that the option to purchase and store tickets in
advance would be rolling out in the first quarter of 2018.
Tonya Anderson, Manager of Electronic Fare Operations, showed a
demonstration of the app, which she said could be downloaded on the
Android and Apple mobile platforms. She noted that the app offered options
for local and regional zones, as well as full and discount fares, and she
stated that, as with other day passes, the electronic tickets expired at the
end of the service day, 2:59 a.m., even if they had not been activated. She
said the app could store payment methods and split payments among
different cards and that storage for tickets for future use would be
implemented soon. She stated that RTD was working with the vendor,
Wasabi, to correct minor technical problems with the app, such as an error
encountered when using American Express cards. She said that, based on
their last update, the fixes would be implemented by the end of the week.
She noted that the electronic tickets were similar in appearance to paper
fare media, which meant that users and operators would be familiar with
them, and that the electronic tickets featured security features such as QR
code and a scrolling date and time bar with colors that changed based on
the time. She said that operators and fare enforcement officers would use
visual validation, rather than hardware authentication. She said the app
included access to the RTD Trip Planner and NextRide platforms, with future
access to the Transit Watch app planned for the first quarter of 2018.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 14, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. McKillop said that retailers who received refunds would not need to
return the tax to the consumers.

6.H

Ms. McKillop said that the current fare policy dictated the expiration of day
passes at the end of the service day at 2:59 a.m. She said RTD’s system
was unusual in that respect and that Wasabi typically worked on systems
with a rolling 24-hour schedule. She said staff was contemplating changing
the policy as part of the upcoming fare changes. She said that staff was
required to implement current policy for media purchased through the app.
Chair Hoy said the Board could reconsider the service day policy. He said he
could not remember the reason behind the policy. He thanked the staff who
worked hard on the app rollout, which he said took only five months.
Director Anderson note that the app was not custom-built, as opposed to
the SmartCard.
Ms. McKillop said both the team that worked on the app and the vendor
were great and stated that the app looked as though it were custom-built
even though it was not.
Director Williams said she liked the app and that her constituents were
excited. She commended staff for showing that the agency was moving
toward the 21st century.
Director Menten asked whether the app would work for people who were
sight limited, and Ms. Anderson responded that it would.

• Fiscal Sustainability Update
Ms. Scarpino stated that the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force was formed in
2010 and presented recommendations to the Board in 2011, many of which
were implemented. She said that the completed items were contained in the
Board Report, including policies on naming rights, ongoing partnerships, and
privatization. She said the fiscal sustainability report was given twice
annually and that she would report any further progress.
Director Williams questioned whether anyone had looked at the University of
Colorado A Line running through the Colorado State University campus at
the National Western Complex.

Director Deadwyler said she was impressed with the app and could not wait
to show her family members who frequently use RTD services. She stated
that many emergency services and restaurant employees were excluded
from using the app because the day passes expired at 2:59 a.m. She asked
whether it would be possible for day passes to expire 24-hours after the
time of purchase.

6.H

• Quarterly Investment Report
Mr. Morgan presented the investment report for the third quarter of 2017.
He said the year had been good for the agency’s investments, which were
performing ahead of benchmarks. He said short term interest rates were
good, having experienced two rate hikes so far in 2017 with a potential for
a third. He said that year-to-date earnings for all funds was $6.1 million,
performing well to budget.

Mr. Morgan said the agency did not review all of its portfolios in aggregate
and noted that the agency held portfolios for individual projects. He said that
bond proceeds were the largest items held in the portfolios. He said staff
managed the portfolios for cash flow rather than for duration and that
project managers were expected to spend from the cashflows. He stated
that one year was a typical duration, though some portfolios went out
further, such as those for reserves required under the Taxpayers Bill of
Rights (TABOR).

D. Other Matters
Ms. McKillop reported that RTD hired a senior manager of human resources, who
started with the agency that day. She said he would be introduced during the
following month’s committee meetings and said he had more than 20 years of
experience in human resources and spent 13 years in the Air Force.
Director Menten asked about the implementation costs of the SmartCard and
mobile ticketing programs.
Ms. McKillop said that the SmartCard rollout had cost $30 million and the mobile
ticketing app had cost $46,000. She said that Wasabi did not make money on the
distribution of its app but rather received a percentage of the sale of each fare
purchased though the app.
Director Menten likened the fee to a credit card processing fee.
Ms. McKillop agreed and noted that the vendor was responsible for PCI compliance,
processing, and liability.
Director Menten said that, during the recent Transportation Legislation Review
Committee (TLRC) meeting, the legislators discussed a proposed bill regarding a
vendor fee change, and she asked for a briefing on the bill.
Chair Hoy said that Sherry Ellebracht, RTD’s Government Relations Officer, would
prepare a bill summary.

Director Menten asked when sales tax remittance forms were printed and
submitted.
Ms. McKillop said they were printed in the last quarter of the state fiscal year and
distributed in the summer. She said vendors of a certain size were required to remit
taxes via an online form.
Director Lubow said she would be interested in learning if the vendor fee would be
a good source of funding for low-income passes.
Ms. McKillop reiterated that TLRC did not pass the bill in question. She said the
vendor fee had been a contentious political issue and stated the funding source was
not an appropriate topic on which RTD should weigh in. She noted that a lowincome program was being considered by the pass program working group.
Director Lubow asked whether the pass program working group was looking at
alternative funding sources.
Ms. McKillop said the pass program working group was evaluating broad proposals
and had not yet considered funding. She said that each proposal contained a lowincome component.

Ms. McKillop said the bill dealt with a proposed low-income program that would be
supported by a reduction in the processing fee vendors were allowed to retain
when collecting sales tax. She said that the legislature had in the past changed the
amount allowed to be withheld. She noted that RTD presented information to TLRC
about the pass program working group, and she stated that RTD was not directly
asked for information regarding the vendor fee, though the agency’s presenters
mentioned the vendor fee reduction was an option considered by the working
group. She added that staff does not take positions on bills without Board’s
approval but noted that the bill did not pass out of committee.

November Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Hoy reviewed the Board Meeting agenda and said that it included an updated
recommended action from the General Manager Oversight and Performance Review
Committee (GM Oversight). He asked whether that was the only change to the
agenda, and Ms. McManus said yes. He noted the items on the unanimous consent
and recommended action agendas and said that he would assume that no additional
items needed to be moved to recommended actions unless someone said
otherwise.

Other Matters
Director Francone noted the agenda would show both the GM Oversight update and

Director Deadwyler said that the Board had gone into executive session before
when speaking about the General Manager’s performance.
Barbara McManus, Board Office Executive Manager, stated that GM Oversight did
not go into executive session during its last meeting.
Chair Hoy stated the GM Oversight committee members felt an executive session
was not needed, nor was there an executive session scheduled for the Board
Meeting. He said he would find out during the Board Meeting if that was a mistake.
Director Francone said she wanted to have an open and fair discussion and to allow
the General Manager to respond.
Director Deadwyler asked how many Directors attended the previous GM Oversight
committee.
Chair Hoy said seven or eight Directors. He noted that, for the recommended action
regarding the General Manager’s performance evaluation, he would ask Director
Francone to lead the discussion.

Packet Pg. 85

Chair Hoy agreed and said the budget was an item for public discussion, meaning
there would be two opportunities for public comment.

6.I

Director Francone noted that the Bike Jeffco organization would be in attendance
for the Board Meeting to ask for a review of RTD’s bicycle policy. She said she
anticipated three people would attend from that group. She suggested that an ad
hoc committee be created that could serve in an advisory capacity.

Director Francone said that Bike Jeffco’s representatives were reasonable,
passionate about what they were doing, and had good information for staff. She
said it would be helpful to revisit the policy regarding bicycle stowage and the use
of the high blocks.
Chair Hoy suggested that the Bike Jeffco representatives could sit in on an ADA
Paratransit Advisory Committee (APAC) meeting. She said they might be able to
get a better global look at what it means to be on a high block with wheelchair
users.
Director Francone responded that Bike Jeffco was informed and engaged and had
partnered with the disabled community. She said they realize that persons with
mobility devices or mobility impairment would have first priority in using the high
block. She said she was surprised to learn the number of people with bicycles who
used light rail. She noted that RTD as an agency was pushing first/last mile
solutions and stated that bicycles were one of the ways people solved that issue.
She suggested people might use public transit more if they had better
accommodations.
Chair Hoy noted that he had carried his bike onto a train many times.
Director Deadwyler asked whether the bicycle users intended to use the disabled
areas.
Chair Hoy said that the bicycle users’ rights were to subordinate to those of
persons with disabilities.
Director Deadwyler said she could foresee bikes overloading the trains.
Director Menten asked whether the video showing the adjusted seating
arrangement of the train cars, which would allow people to understand how much
room mobility devices require, had been posted on the RTD website.

Chair Hoy said he would listen to the request from Bike Jeffco and decide where to
go from there.

6.I

Mr. Abel said he would check.
Director Deadwyler said that the agency would receive pushback.
Mr. Abel said that what the stakeholders were asking was for a review of bicycle
policy and to be able to participate, which would not be resolved immediately.

General Manager Genova reminded the committee that a recent settlement was the
reason for the train car reconfiguration, which needed to be taken into
consideration.
Director Francone said they were aware of the lawsuit and ADA priority and the
implications of sharing that area. She said the Bike Jeffco representatives were
reasonable and were looking to have a discussion about whether more bikes could
be safely accommodated on light rail, rather than asking for additional train cars
exclusively for bicycles.
Mr. Abel said that Bike Jeffco’s participation would allow them to be involved in
the conversation and to understand perspectives but noted that the settlement
would be the guiding force.
Director Walker said that he rode light rail frequently and noted that bicycles, if
placed in the middle of a train car, could easily trap people trying to escape in an
emergency. He said the reason for the lawsuit was that RTD could not
accommodate everyone.
Chair Hoy said that bicycle users should know that they could have to wait if the
train ran out of space.
Director Menten said she was not aware of a separate bicycle policy and stated
that the code of conduct contained relevant provisions.
Mr. Abel noted that the agency issued brochures regarding the use of light rail and
other guidelines for bicycle riders.
Director Menten said she wanted to revisit the topic of the GM Oversight
committee. She said that previous practice had been to move into executive
session, where the General Manager was not present. She asked for clarification

Directors Francone and Deadwyler requested a copy of the bicycle policy, and Ms.

that, during the Board Meeting, the Board would have an open discussion regarding
the General Manager.
Chair Hoy stated the Board would proceed in that manner barring objections. He
said the GM Oversight meetings had been open to the public.

Director Deadwyler stated that some Directors may not want to voice their opinions
in a public forum. She said the committee should expect surprises.
Chair Hoy noted that what was said during the GM Oversight committee was public
record and said he did not see a difference between Directors speaking at the
committee meeting and the Board Meeting. He asked whether Director Deadwyler
felt the Board should go into executive session.
Director Deadwyler said she did not think the Board should change policy.
Chair Hoy said he did not think the Board was changing policy.
Director Deadwyler said the Board previously went into executive session without
the presence of the General Manager.
Chair Hoy said that the committee directly discussed its findings with the General
Manager and asked for the General Manager’s thoughts.
General Manager Genova said that, as he and the GM Oversight committee had
discussed, he was agreeable to not having an executive session.
Chair Hoy said he had gotten the sense that the executive session was not
necessary.
Director Deadwyler said she felt it inappropriate to consult the General Manager
regarding whether to go into executive session.
Director Walker stated that the Board would not be strategizing or negotiating. He
asked which statutory citation the Board had used the previous year to validate the
use of an executive session.

Director Francone said her preference was to keep the Board Meeting open and not
to go into executive session unless doing so was necessary. She said Directors
should say what they needed to say.

6.I

Ms. McManus responded that the provision regarding personnel matters was used.
Director Walker said the Directors were all public officials who should say what
they have to say.

Director Menten asked whether the video recordings of the previous two GM
Oversight meetings were on the website, and Ms. McManus said they were not.
Director Menten then asked whether the Board could provide the audio recordings if
someone requested them, and Ms. McManus said that would be possible.
Chair Hoy spoke about open houses and telephone town halls. He said the Public
Information (PI) team had begun scheduling open houses and telephone town halls
beginning the following week and running through December 2017. He said that,
when the available dates, personal schedules, and human resources were
considered, along with the fact that the telephone town halls had not been fully
procured at that time, he made the decision that the Directors would hold telephone
town halls in March 2018. He further stated that the district open houses, as
envisioned by the PI team, would be held at the discretion and convenience of each
Director. He stated that staff would be approaching the Directors to discuss the
preferred dates and locations. He asked whether the Directors were in agreement
with him on his decision.
Director Francone asked whether this meant that the PI team would inform the
Directors of their participation more than two days prior to the date of the event.
Ms. McManus said that she was working with the PI team on timing and said that
the timing of Director Francone’s open house had been a topic of discussion.
Chair Hoy said the issue had been brewing for a while stated that staff would work
with the Directors individually to meet their needs.
Director Deadwyler said she had wanted to do away with town halls when staff
had dictated the timing, but she stated she was willing to participate as long as she
could pick the dates.

were opposed to moving into executive session.

6.I

Ms. McManus said that outreach meetings would be scheduled in the same
manner. She noted that the telephone town halls would take place over a two-week
period in March 2018.

Director Walker said that his open house had already been scheduled and the
scheduling had been done much in the same way that Chair Hoy had described it.
Chair Hoy said that the PI team had previously attempted to compress 20 meetings
into a two-to-three-week period, but the problem was that there were not enough
time slots. As for the open houses, he said that the Directors would have latitude in
how they could work with the PI team in order to tailor the presentation to each
district. He said that Ms. McManus would help facilitate the outreach process with
the PI team. He stated that each Director would be responsible for preparing for
their events and inviting constituents and that the PI team would collaborate with
the Directors to identify pertinent district issues and construct meetings that would
benefit RTD and its constituents.
Ms. McManus added that she was working with the PI team to schedule walking
tours for each district starting in the spring of 2018. She said that the Chair had
decided that spreading out the three types of outreach meetings over a longer
timeline would be more communicative to constituents than doing everything all at
once.
Director Menten said she was glad to have in-person town halls and had not been
an advocate of telephone town halls. She said that she did not expect staff to help
with the town halls but noted she did require assistance with the technological
aspects of her recent meeting. She asked whether Roger Sherman of CRL
Associates would facilitate the telephone town halls as part of his contract.
Ms. McManus said that the telephone town halls were not in Mr. Sherman’s
contract at that time. She said Mr. Sherman would have facilitated the town halls
through a different contract if they had been held in 2017, but she noted that the
facilitation contract would need to go out for bid in 2018.

Chair Hoy said the telephone town halls would be held mostly in the same way
they had been done in the past. He said that he the PI team would send an email to
all Directors with available time slots that would be filled on a first-come, first
served basis. He said the technological constraints were the reason for this format.

6.I

Chair Hoy said he enjoyed working with Mr. Sherman because of his knowledge of
the agency and that the town halls had not gone as well when a different vendor
was used.

Ms. McManus said they were separate functions. She said some of the mobile labs
would take place on the same date as the open houses. She noted that the open
houses and community engagement meetings for Districts I and N were scheduled
back to back, which she said was a lot for a single day, but she stated that the
structure would be revisited.
Director Francone said that the PI team had done a great job working with her to
creating the type of event she had envisioned. She stated that a walking tour did
not make sense in her district.
Ms. McManus asked whether Director Francone wanted her community
engagement event scheduled for December 13, 2017, and whether she wanted the
open house to be scheduled for a future date.
Director Francone said she would be fine with holding both on the same day but
said she was struggling with the concept of the walking tour.
Ms. McManus said the structure of the walking tours was still undecided. She said
she had a cursory discussion with Nate Currey, Senior Manager of Public Relations
and Public Information, about the plans for the walking tours, and she said Mr.
Currey had engaged in similar efforts in Utah. She noted that walking tours were
more feasible in certain districts than others and said that the events should be
inclusive.
Director Deadwyler said that Stapleton was the only neighborhood in her district
suitable for a walking tour.
Chair Hoy said that any and all outreach was important and that Directors should
be involved with guiding the PI team in their districts. He said that Directors would
have discretion to decide whether or not to hold walking tours and how they would
be structured.
Director Walker reiterated that all of the outreach events were discretionary and
that Directors were not obligated to do anything, though he recommended against
nonparticipation. He said that the Directors could shape their events to be

Director Menten asked whether the mobile labs were tied to the walking tours.

representative of their districts and that the PI team is interested in Directors’ input
on how to structure the events.

Ms. McManus said that the PI team would work with each Director to select the
appropriate audience for the events.
Director Menten said that she felt that she was now in control of her events,
whereas previously she had been handed a script.
Chair Hoy noted that the PI team could still want certain questions asked
consistently across all districts.
General Manager Genova said he would further discuss plans with the PI team the
following week.
Director Walker stated that he was in favor of telephone town halls because not all
of his constituents were able to attend meetings.
Director Deadwyler said that she would like to be able to take more calls during
telephone town halls because a lot of callers were unable to participate.
Director Menten noted that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) waiver
contained some conditional terms. She said the Directors were told that compliance
with those term would not be too difficult and asked about the status of that
compliance.
General Manager Genova said that the waiver conditions were in relation to atgrade crossing timing, specifically the infrequent occasions when the conventional
activation system triggered the gates. He said that positive train control (PTC)
accounted for up to 98% of activations. He noted that the FRA had observed the
gate timing that week and said the agency would know more following a debriefing
on the FRA’s observations.
Director Menten asked whether she could expect an update the following week.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 16, 2017 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten said she preferred face-to-face interaction with her constituents
rather than telephone town halls and preferred speaking to constituents rather than
groups of elected officials or other high-level government representatives from her
district.

General Manager Genova said he was hopeful staff could present an update the
following week.

Public Participation
Chair Hoy stated public participation was open to anyone who wanted to address the
Board. He said speakers would be be called in the order that they signed up. He reminded
the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.
Kevin Flynn, Denver City Council, 4981 South Garland Street Denver, stated that he
appreciates the work and the challenges that the Board and RTD faces. Mr. Flynn stated
that he came to address a service change with the C and D Line. He commented that he
routinely uses transit and addresses the D Line ridership has decreased almost 20%,
though there are still more D Line riders than the C line and this service change may erode
the D Line ridership. He asked that the Board consider this impact with the decision to
make this change.
Joan Peck, City of Longmont, provided two letters one from the Longmont Economic
Development Partnership and from the Longmont Chamber of Commerce, that support the
State Highway 119 (SH 119) Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project. She stated it was
encouraging that CU Leeds offered better revenue predictions for RTD, but frustrating that
the Board has decided to push the timeline for the SH 119 project back one year. As an
elected official representing Longmont she said she worked to receive Volkswagen
settlement funds for electric busses along the SH 119 in order to save RTD dollars in the
project, and was concerned that the 16th Street Mall and its new buses would be the
recipient of those funds. She stated that Longmont was advocating heavily that the
timeline of 2022 for the SH 119 BRT project to be put back on the agenda with a revote
by the RTD Board. She noted that Longmont was experiencing rapid growth and that she
believed maintaining the timeline would help leverage over $100 million in CDOT funding

Robin McIntosh, Senior Manager of Facilities, commended his team for their hard work and
participation in the competition.

currently planned for the corridor. Ms. Peck stated that Longmont officials and citizens
feel that the RTD Board of Directors continued to push this project back because the
directors lived in the southern parts of the district. Ms. Peck respectfully requested that
the RTD Board rethink priorities and to be the board that would finish the FasTracks
program within the next 12-15 years.
Mac Callison, Planning Supervisor, City of Aurora, spoke on behalf of Mayor Hogan
regarding the modification to the R Line and bus routes proposed on October 17, 2017.
Mr. Callison explained that Aurora had a number of developments progressing along the R
Line and requested RTD to draw riders through marketing, rather than cut service. Mr.
Callison stated that RTD needed to add creative marketing, convenient schedules, and
other innovative measures to increase ridership, and that Aurora was ready to support
these measures. He concluded that in order to realize the full potential of the R Line,
Aurora and RTD needed to work together.
George Gerstle, Commuting Solutions Chairperson, offered thanks and acknowledgment
from Boulder County, the US 36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition, and Commuting
Solutions for keeping the SH 119 BRT in the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). Mr. Gerstle
commented that by keeping the funding for this project, which is a high priority in the
Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), allows partnering with CDOT and utilizing federal
funds to leverage the RTD funds.
Chris Sorauf, 6127 Holmes St., Arvada, stated that the line is 46 weeks behind schedule
and without a date for opening. Mr. Sorauf questioned if the wireless technology is the
issue, and if it was too late to change to a more conventional system. He voiced concern
about tax dollars that are spent and hopes to hear a date for testing in the near future.
David Rothenberger, 1310 Garrison St., Denver, expressed concerns regarding the graffiti
issues along the W Line. He noted that there was a policy that stated that graffiti would
be cleaned up within 24 hours after being reported and that policy is not being adhered to.
JM Fay, no address given, questioned why there is a lock being placed on electrical
outlets, why there are still busses being used when there are trains to use in the same
routes, why are the connections so poor from the R Line to other trains, what are you
doing with the R Line and the service to it, and lastly has a parking fee been considered
rather than raising local fares.
Paul Sorazano, 84B Nome Way, Aurora, expressed concerns regarding the deterioration
and unreliability of RTD service. Mr. Sorazano stated that customer service responses are
not providing any assistance as to tracking routes or planning a route. In regards to fares
he requested that RTD make it available to pay up for a day pass as welfare programs

and all crossings along the G Line these requests were verbally denied. General

that go through the crossings.
Director Deadwyler commented on the letter from the union and recommended that

requests in a public and open forum. He offered that there are a variety of items
that include wages, hours, percentages of split shift, recovery time, better use of

Director Lubow commented that the union stated that negotiations were not going
well and that the General Manager was stating the opposite.
General Manager Genova clarified that a lot of progress had been made on language
clean up and items that are easy to solve. He stated that both teams were working

hardest being the RTD mandating on bus and rail operators. General Manager
Genova stated that proposals have only recently been exchanged and that RTD
cared about their employees.
Director Archuleta questioned if there was a chance of a strike.

January 2018 Service Change

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the January 2018 Service Change package as summarized in
Attachment A and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute
contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by
these changes.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to approve
the January 2018 Service Change.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Menten said she would vote no to support the original
recommendations from staff for the reduction in service for
both the R and the W Line, rather than this revised proposal.
Director Solano stated that he would vote no because the R
Line has not been given enough time to determine ridership
and for the vulnerable population that rely on this transit.
Director Folska stated she would vote yes to support the
changes, which would increase the ridership. Director Folska
commended the staff on taking in consideration stakeholders
and the community to amend the service change, and giving
the area a chance to grow the ridership. She reminded those
present that all districts need to work together in order to
grow ridership.
Director Mihalik commented that the R Line should not be
exempt from the next service change review.

Packet Pg. 108

Director Francone thanked the staff for their work, but said
she cannot support this motion because RTD cannot run
empty trains waiting for future ridership to increase. The
service should change according to ridership and can always
be adjusted based on the four times a year that ridership is
analyzed.
Director Walker said he would vote yes because it appeared
the constituents were attempting to improve the ridership. He
offered thanks to Mr. Flynn for comments and acknowledges
that riders would be impacted from the service change.
Director Tisdale seconded Director Mihalik’s comment
regarding continued review. He called upon the City of Aurora
to promote the R line and collaborate with RTD. He addresses
the letter provided by Mayor Hogan, which suggested that the
burden of improving ridership was placed on RTD, and said
that it was far more effective for the city to market the
ridership.
Director Anderson agreed with Directors Tisdale and Mihalik
about the Lines need a chance.
Director Sisk suggested that a no vote could put the agency in
peril as it would continue the current service, and the agency
could not afford to run service as it was. He said he would
vote yes, and recommended that others to think about there
no vote.
Director Lubow said she would vote yes, regardless of the
reduction of service quickly, but agreed that this will protect
the agency’s financial investments.
Director Williams reminded all present that RTD is in the
business of moving people, not trains or busses or vehicles.
Director Broom said he was voting no because there had not
been enough time to gauge the effectiveness of the line before
making changes to the service.

Director Deadwyler explained that she would vote yes because
this line is important. She stated that the amended proposal
was a good compromise and that it gave the line time to
improve until the next evaluation.
Chair Hoy stated that this was a perplexing vote as some
directors don’t believe it is enough of a cut, a cut is a cut, to
not pass this, is surprising because those that want to cut the
service should cut the service. Referring to the letter that
stated that RTD needed to improve marketing and take the
lead in attracting riders, he stated that Aurora should take the
lead and RTD would stand behind them. He invited the mayor
to contact him directly.

Director Deadwyler stated that it appeared that a company

change.

million, debt payments of $64.7 million, FasTracks management reserve of $15.9 million, FasTracks

Overview of the 2018 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $1,213.4 million on a combined basis are expected to increase $34.9 million
(3.0%) in 2018 from the 2017 Amended Budget. This is due to 1) an increase in farebox
revenue of $4.3 million, 2) an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $40.1 million, 3) an increase
in investment income of $3.1 million, and 5) an increase in other revenue of $0.3 million, offset
by a decrease in grant revenue of $12.9 million.

Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenue of $146.8 million is budgeted to
increase 3.0% over the 2017 Amended Budget. Farebox revenue is forecasted on the
basis of a fare revenue model now being used to estimate and allocate fare revenue
between Base and FasTracks and within FasTracks service corridors. The model uses
ridership forecasts and current data on average fare paid per boarding. Based on the
model, in 2018 a higher proportionate amount of fare revenue is allocated to Base and a
lower amount is allocated to FasTracks than in previous periods.
On the Base System, farebox revenue is forecast to increase almost 1% over the 2017
Amended Budget to $115.2 million in 2018.
For FasTracks, farebox revenue is forecast to increase 11.6% to $31.6 million over the
2017 budgeted amount.
Ridership growth is expected to be flat on Base with ridership increases attributed to
FasTracks. Total revenue ridership is projected to grow 4.4% in 2018 over that projected
for 2017.
Sales and use tax revenue of $626.2 million in 2018 is expected to increase 4.9% over
the 2017 projected level according to the most recent September quarterly forecast by the
CU-Leeds School of Business. The same forecast was used in the 2018-2023 Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP).
Total grant revenue, including new and carry-forward amounts, is estimated at $414.4
million, a decrease of $12.9 million from the 2017 Amended Budget. Total Base System
grants are estimated to total $146.9 million in 2018; of that amount, $90.0 million is new
grants while projected carry-forward grant funding is $56.9 million. Base System grants
are projected to decrease $3.4 million from the 2017 Amended Budget. The decrease
reflects grant draws for LRT overhaul work and Civic Center that were made in 2017
instead of 2018.

FasTracks grants are budgeted at $267.5 million, which is a decrease of $9.4 million from
the 2017 Amended Budget largely due to lower final draws on the FFGA and decreases in
certain CMAQ grants.
Combined investment income of $7.3 million is projected to increase $3.1 million over the
2017 Amended Budget due to expectation of somewhat higher interest rates on investable
fund balances.
Other operating income and other income together will increase by $0.3 million from the
2017 Amended Budget generally due to CPI increases on recurring income such as rental
and joint venture income. The Build America Bonds subsidy of $8.8 million for FasTracks
Project is not increased at the CPI. Other income also includes full-year payment by the
University of Colorado for naming rights on the A Line (FasTracks Operations) and DUS
rental income (Base).

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $675.6 million on a combined basis in 2018 (excluding
depreciation), which is $13.6 million higher compared to the 2017 Amended Budget. Base
System operating expenses are budgeted to increase $25.9 million, FasTracks Project operating
expenses are budgeted to decrease $19.5 million, and FasTracks Operations operating expenses
are budgeted to increase $7.1 million. On the Base System, departmental operating expenses
are targeted amounts derived from the SBP, plus operating and maintenance projects approved in
the 2018-2023 SBP, plus operating/expense projects carry-forward from 2017, and other
miscellaneous increases unknown at the time of the SBP. For FasTracks Operations, the
increase is generally due to both direct costs and full allocation from Base to FasTracks of costs
of operating the new service corridors, including additional security services, and a higher
estimated service payment to Denver Transit Operators for Eagle operations and maintenance.
For FasTracks Project, the decrease is due to completion of several FasTracks projects and
capitalization of certain costs to the uncompleted corridors. For FasTracks, operating expenses
are derived from the Annual Program Evaluation (APE).
The operating/expense project carry-forward to 2018 is $19.0 million for Base System, $20.9
million for FasTracks Project, and $0.9 million for FasTracks Operations. New operating and
maintenance projects approved in the SBP (Base System) for 2018 total $13.3 million (in 2017
dollars). It should be noted that reductions were made overall to departmental operating budgets
including expense projects to bring expenditures into alignment with the SBP and APE.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at an estimated price of $1.80 per gallon, compared to a lock price of
$1.69 per gallon in the 2017 Amended Budget, resulting in an incremental higher cost of
approximately $1.1 million over 2017. Senior staff is reviewing opportunities to lock diesel at a
favorable price for 2018. Gasoline is budgeted at $2.65/gallon, which is the same price as in
the 2017 budget for no change.
The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to the posted
Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the Requested
Budget consist of additions for approved SBP expense projects and expense projects carryforward, as well as start-up costs for North Metro operations not determined in the Requested
Budget.
The 2018 Recommended Budget includes funding for the first year of start-up costs related to
future RTD operation of the North Metro commuter rail line. The expense budget of $3.9 million

Packet Pg. 119

11.A

covers staffing, consumables and spare parts to be purchased for maintenance of the
infrastructure and passenger facilities, and training and other support needed to prepare for
revenue service. The capital budget of $13.4 million covers the first year of facilities
modifications and heavy equipment to be purchased to support revenue service.
Interest expense in 2018 is budgeted at $153.2 million on a combined basis, a decrease of $2.2
million from the 2017 Amended Budget. The decrease is due to the effect of refundings and
rescheduled amortization. Of total interest expense, $21.8 million is budgeted for Base System
and $131.5 million is budgeted for FasTracks. FasTracks interest expense includes the TABOR
interest expense of $34.4 million which is paid with the DTO service payment.
Capitalized interest (combined) is budgeted at $21.4 million, all of which will occur in FasTracks
Project for the North Metro debt. Capitalized interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for
interest payments in 2018.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $64.7 million on a combined basis, which is $6.6
million higher than the 2017 Amended Budget. Base System principal payments of $59.0 million
are $9.0 million higher due to re-scheduled amortization of debt through refundings. FasTracks
principal payments of $5.7 million are $2.4 million lower due to re-scheduled amortization of
debt through refundings. No new debt issuances are planned in 2018 for either the Base System
or FasTracks. Both will draw from previously issued debt to fund major capital purchases and
construction in 2018.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2017 (previously
approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2018. The
capital carry-forward will be $743.5 million made up of $104.8 million on the Base System and
$638.7 million on FasTracks.
New capital spending of $187.8 million on a combined basis will decrease $114.5 million from
the 2017 Amended Budget due mainly to project completion in FasTracks. New capital spending
for FasTracks will decrease $105.9 million to $128.9 million in 2018 due to on-going project
completion, mainly North Metro, offset by an increase to the East corridor for reconciliation of
finance charges. For the Base System, new capital spending will decrease $8.6 million from the
2017 Amended Budget to $58.9 million. Of this amount, the Base system will spend $5.6
million less on facilities construction and maintenance (mainly Customer Care Center relocation,
Blake entryway remodel, and fire protection), $6.2 million less on bus Infrastructure (16 th Street
Mall reconstruction), $1.4 million less on Park-n-Rides (US36 & Sheridan station), $0.9 million
less on rail transit and infrastructure (several projects), and $12.7 million less on fleet
modernization and expansion (all vehicles except for ADA). These decreases will be offset by
$10.4 million more on capital support projects (Burnham Yard land purchase, Colfax 15L Route
Improvement project, and blank out screens on Welton Street), $4.6 million more on rail
construction (downtown track and switches replacement and Central corridor rail replacement),
and $3.2 million more on capital support equipment (support and service vehicles and in-plant
equipment). The Base System new capital was approved as part of the Strategic Budget Plan in
October 2017 and is the amount identified for minimum “must have” projects within SOGR
priorities.
Regarding the Colfax 15L Route Improvement project, capital funds were approved in the SBP as
$4,638,103 in 2018 and $1,625,000 in 2019. In this 2018 Recommended Budget, the project
funding will be revised so that funds from 2019 will move to 2018 to allow for a bid on the

Packet Pg. 120

11.A

construction contract in early 2018. Thus, the project amount for 2018 will be $6,263,103 (in
2017 dollars) and the amount for 2019 will be $0.
New capital expenditures for 2018 and the change in new capital in the 2018 Recommended
Budget over the 2018 Requested Budget are shown in Attachment B. The capital carry-forward
expenditures for 2018 and the change in the capital carry-forward in the 2018 Recommended
Budget over the 2017 Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.
Notable designated fund balance and reserve changes include an increase in the Base System
year-end unrestricted fund balance from the 2017 Amended Budget to $31.4 million. This
projected fund balance is in alignment with the SBP target after incorporating all revenue and
expense adjustments. The actual amount realized, however, may be lower (or higher) than that
projected due to lower (or higher) fare revenue and sales tax revenue in 2017 (this will become
evident in the 2018 amended budget). Also on the Base System, the Board-appropriated fund is
projected to increase by $3.0 million to $20.4 million, the capital replacement fund is projected
to decrease by $2.7 million to $0, and the unrestricted operating reserve is projected to increase
by $5.0 million to $14.7 million.
A $5.0 million contingency reserve is created for the first time for the Base System. The
purpose of this reserve is to cover unanticipated needs that may arise through the fiscal year.
The funds will be used at the General Manager’s discretion to fund unbudgeted inflationary
increases, respond to emergencies, new regulations, and cover cost overruns.
In FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the reserve funds are maintained at 3 months of
operating expenses. Additionally, the FasTracks management reserve is budgeted at $15.9
million and the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) is budgeted at $71.5 million.
On a District-wide basis, the total of the Board-appropriated fund, the capital replacement fund,
the unrestricted operating reserve and the unrestricted fund balance is projected to increase
$23.6 million over the 2017 Amended Budget. These increases are in minimum accordance with
fiscal policies for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks Project and FasTracks
Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2018 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado
General Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA farebox
revenues divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and
expenditures incurred for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure)
exceeds the annual target of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.
Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2018 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated
fund, a capital replacement fund, and the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance for both
the Base System and FasTracks, as well as an additional unrestricted operating reserve currently
for the Base System. The objective is for the total of these funds excluding the capital
acquisition fund to equal approximately three months of operating expenses excluding

Packet Pg. 121

11.A

depreciation for both Base System and FasTracks. The 2018 budget reflects maintenance of a
FasTracks management reserve at a level deemed sufficient to fund adjustments to the
FasTracks construction schedule.
The total of these fund balances (excluding the management reserve) for 2018 on a District-wide
basis is projected at $105.3 million, comprised of 1) the Board-appropriated fund of $33.3
million, 2) the capital replacement fund of $12.9 million, 3) the unrestricted operating reserve of
$14.7 million, and 4) the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance of $44.3 million. The
Base System portion of these fund balances listed for 2018 is projected to total $66.5 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two
exceptions:





Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.
Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.
Attachments

As noted above, please refer to the attached Fiscal Year 2018 Recommended Budget and Fiscal
Year 2018 Recommended Budget-Fund Balance (Exhibit I) which shows the operating/nonoperating sources, debt and reserves, and capital sources as well as operating uses, capital
expenditures, and fund balances of the District, and a reconciliation of net assets. Also attached
is the Program Capital Summary including previously approved capital, an Operating Budget
Changes Since Posted Budget summary (Attachment A), a New Capital Projects summary
(Attachment B), and Capital Carry-Forward Expenditures (Attachment C).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2018 Recommended Budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Revise the 2018 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed revisions.
3. Do not adopt the 2018 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended since the District
will not be in compliance with State regulations that require the District to adopt a budget by
December 31, 2017. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2017, State
statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations and
maintenance purposes and objects is deemed re-appropriated."

Date: November 2, 2017

From:

Henry
Stopplecamp,
Assistant
Manager, Capital Programs

GM

Date:

October 17, 2017

Subject:

Approval of 2018 Contract Amendment to
Kumar
and
Associates,
Inc.
for
the
Construction Materials Testing and Inspection
Services Contract

General

Board Meeting Date: November 28, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the 2018 Contract Amendment for Kumar and
Associates and increase the contract Not-to-Exceed amount by $1,000,000. This will result in a new
Not-to-Exceed contract amount of $6,000,000 for Construction Materials Testing and Inspection
Services.
It is further recommended that the Contract end date be extended from December 31, 2018 until
December 31, 2019 to complete work on the North Metro and SERE projects. Funds for the amendment
are contained in the 2018 Recommended Budget for the specific projects for which Kumar’s services are
utilized.
BACKGROUND
On July 15, 2008, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to Kumar and
Associates spanning August 1, 2008 through December 31, 2013, for an initial Not-to-Exceed amount
of $5,000,000. The contract also allowed for the exercise of up to five option years beyond the initial
contract period. The Not-to-Exceed amount was only expected to cover the initial contract period, with
increases to the Contract amount negotiated at each annual amendment.
Since 2008, the contract has been amended annually based on the scope of work for the year,
which included both FasTracks and Base System projects. After the initial five years and five
months, RTD exercised its option years in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017; and yet in the nearly 9½
years since contract award the Not-to-Exceed amount has never been increased. The 2018
workscope will require an increase the Contract price.
DISCUSSION
The Construction Materials Testing and Inspection Services Contract was specified for an initial term of
five years and five months, with five option years, to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s
work scope. The purpose of the annual re-negotiation of the contract was to ensure that specific tasks
and deliverables responded to the needs of RTD’s capital programs.
Kumar and Associates is a locally-based DBE firm that provides 1) Acceptance Testing of construction
materials such as concrete and soils for RTD’s smaller projects, 2) Verification Testing for large projects
whereby the contractor has been tasked with Acceptance Testing, and 3) audits of contractor testing
procedures, personnel, and equipment. They can also provide specialized testing and inspections for
unique applications such as micro-pile installation at Civic Center, weld inspections, etc.
Specific projects that will require Kumar’s support in 2018 include:

12.B






North Metro Rail Line
Southeast Rail Extension
Streets and Misc. projects
Facilities Engineering projects

Projects that will require Kumar’s support in 2019 will be limited to those in which Kumar has had an
ongoing role that requires continuity of effort, namely:
 North Metro Rail Line
 Southeast Rail Extension
RTD has established a 12% DBE Goal for this Contract. However, since Kumar and Associates is a
certified DBE, 100% of the work counts toward the DBE Goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this contract amendment is included in the 2018 Recommended Budget for the specific
projects whereby Kumar’s services will be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to increase
the board authorized contract amount with Kumar and Associates by $1,000,000 for a total Notto-Exceed amount of $6,000,000; and that the Contract end date be extended to December 31,
2019. Funds for the contract authorization are included in the 2018 Recommended Budget for
the specific projects where Kumar’s services are utilized.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Rather, authorize the General Manager to increase the
board authorized contract amount with Kumar and Associates by $500,000 for a total Not-toExceed amount of $5,500,000; and keep the Contract end date at December 31, 2018. Funds
for the contract authorization are included in the 2018 Recommended Budget for the specific
projects where Kumar’s services are utilized. This is not recommended at this time, as this
would cause a break in responsibilities at a critical time in two major corridor projects, with little
time for a new testing contractor to learn the project history and strengths/weaknesses of the
design-builders’ quality programs.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
contract amendment to Kumar and Associates. Rather, transfer the scope of work to one of the
other support contracts. This is not recommended since Kumar is satisfactorily performing as a
prime contractor with RTD and has deferred working with any of our construction contractors to
avoid conflicts of interest. Any other consultants working for RTD would have to sub-contract
this work out to one of the few qualified testing firms in the local area, most of which are
working or have worked for our contractors.
4. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
contract amendment to Kumar and Associates. Rather, re-solicit and award this work to another
testing contractor. This is not recommended at this time, as Kumar is satisfactorily performing its
work assignments on all of RTD’s current projects. Furthermore, it is anticipated that RTD will
procure a new materials testing contract in 2018 to take over testing for any new projects.

Boulder County entered into an agreement with the RTD in 2014 to “buy up” all fares on the 300 series
routes in Longmont. Boulder County received funding from the City of Longmont to assist in the buy up
program. The Boulder County contract to buy up service will expire in December 2017. The City of
Longmont would like to continue the Longmont Free Fare program for a period of two years. This
contract would be in effect January 2018 – December 2019.
DISCUSSION
Boulder County and the City of Longmont feel that one of the major reasons that ridership has declined
in Longmont over the years is due to high fares. The objective of this action is to continue to build
ridership and increase mobility options for low income riders.
Under this program all passengers will continue to be allowed unlimited boardings on all 300 series
routes, in both directions, throughout the day. All RTD rules, regulations, and codes of conduct will be
the same as if passengers were paying fares. Transit operators, other RTD staff and members of law
enforcement will continue to have the discretion to refuse boarding to any passenger they deem will
compromise the safety of others. Transfers will be issued to any passengers requesting a transfer. This
program will not include the Call-n-Ride or Regional routes operating within Longmont. The purpose of
the program is to focus on fixed route local ridership. The local agencies, specifically Boulder County
and City of Longmont, have performed the majority of the marketing and publicity for this program with
the approval of RTD Marketing. Boulder County, City of Longmont and RTD will hold meetings to
discuss any issues that need to be addressed with the Buy Up program.
During this 24 month period, the City of Longmont has agreed to reimburse the RTD $130,602 in
advance in 6 month periods. Additionally, the city has agreed to reimburse the RTD fares for all Accessa-Ride trips that fall within the ADA service area boundaries of the 300 series routes. The City also
agreed that if the RTD has a fare increase, all dollars amounts will be adjusted to reflect any fare
increases. There will be an escape clause in the contract that will allow either the City or RTD to
discontinue the program with 60 days’ notice.

Packet Pg. 146

12.C

Overall the program has been doing very well in terms of increased boardings. RTD survey results
reflected that approximately 8% of the increased boardings were “new” riders. 2013 boardings for the
Longmont local routes were 156,863 boardings (weekday and Saturdays). By the end of 2016,
boardings increased to 373,204.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no financial impact to the RTD.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the Agreement with the City of Longmont for the 300 series buy up.
2. Do not approve the Agreement with the City of Longmont for the 300 series buy up. This course of
action is not recommended, as it will result in a loss of a program valuable to the City of Longmont
and Boulder County. Additionally, this program provides transportation access to the low-income
population. Local ridership will be reduced as customers are charged a fare and lose the ability to
travel at any time.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

November 8, 2017

Subject:

2018 Fiscal Policy Statement

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 8, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 28, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves and adopts the revised Fiscal Policy Statement for 2018.

BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the proposed
Policy for development of the upcoming year’s budget.
The most recent modification to the Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in November 2016
for the 2017 fiscal year. Those changes primarily related to: 1) maintaining a total fund balance for the
Base System at an amount approximately equal to three months of Base System operating expenses
excluding depreciation among the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating reserve, and the
remaining unrestricted fund balance; and for FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund and
unrestricted fund balance would be maintained at an amount approximately equal to three months of
FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation; 2) designation of an unrestricted operating reserve
fund on an annual basis, to be used to mitigate service or project disruptions due to revenue
fluctuations, meet unanticipated non-recurring expenditures, or avoid cash flow disruptions, and to be
replenished promptly; 3) the maintenance of only the FasTracks Management Reserve for future
construction; and 4) clarification that the FISA will be used to complete and operate additional FasTracks
projects with expenditures subject to Board approval. The Policy Statement was also updated with the
most recent rating agency credit ratings at the time.
DISCUSSION
For 2018, the only changes proposed are for wording clarification and are reflected in the attachment.
This consists of reference to the APE where necessary, and the substitution of the word “monetize” for
“sell” in Revenue Policies #6.
Debt Policies #5 is updated with the most recent rating agency credit ratings in effect at this date.
Please see the attachments for the full proposed document and document with changes indicated.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Fiscal Policy Statement as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2018
Recommended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approval and adoption of the revised Fiscal Policy Statement for 2018.
2. Board of Directors further modifies the recommended changes. Staff reviewed the fiscal policies
and welcomes any suggestions for modifications requested by the Board of Directors.
3. Do not adopt the RTD 2018 Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not recommended because RTD’s
Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current language, would not adhere to best
practices, and would not best facilitate the needs of RTD’s financial operations.

REVENUE POLICIES
1. Staff will plan fare adjustments every three years in the mid and long-term budgets
to adjust for inflation. The Board of Directors may consider potential fare
adjustments annually at the time of the development of the Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP) and Annual Program Evaluation (APE). As part of this process, staff will review
potential fare adjustments to establish a fare structure to ensure that it:
 is understandable
 is implementable
 is equitable
 achieves revenue levels established in the SBP
2. Fare policies will take into account the special needs of all transit dependent patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.
6. On an annual basis, staff will identify under- or un-utilized property and equipment,
and will make an ongoing attempt to sellmonetize such property and equipment to
enhance cash flow.

7. RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use tax forecasting
containing projections for the short-term (one year by quarter), medium-term (sixyear SBP and APE period) and long-term (30-year Financial Plan period). The purpose
is to provide RTD with expert economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts
using sophisticated financial modeling techniques not available internally.

methods of delivering transportation services.
3. RTD will endeavor to maintain its assets at a level that protects capital investment
and minimizes future maintenance and replacement costs.
4. RTD maintains a risk management program which will provide protection against loss
and mitigate exposure to liability.
5. A safety program will be maintained to minimize RTD's exposure to liability and
thereby reduce the number of claims against RTD. RTD will invest in safety outreach
programs and personnel to communicate safety messages.
6. RTD will develop service changes that are needed to respond to budget shortfalls
using the system-wide and route-specific productivity measures that have been
approved by the Board.

Attachment: 2018 Fiscal Policy Statement red-lined (3313 : 2018 Fiscal Policy Statement)

INVESTMENT POLICIES

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT POLICIES
1. On an annual basis, RTD will prepare and update a six-year Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP) including projected capital construction and improvements, service levels,
operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Capital
projects to be included in the SBP will be evaluated using the following criteria:
2
Packet Pg. 151

12.D.a








total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
source of funding;
operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the SBP period;
benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited
to the effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and
ridership;
consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); consequences of not
funding; and
RTD mission statement elements, Board strategic goals, and other relevant
criteria.

2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks APE and/or financial plan (see #7
below).
3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted SBP and APE as the
basis for the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If the
cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be brought to
the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future technological
changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance
with the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks APE which will be integrated
with the SBP incorporating the actual costs incurred and the most recent available
projections of capital improvement costs, service levels, and operating costs and
revenues to fund the FasTracks capital and operating programs.

FUND BALANCE POLICIES

Attachment: 2018 Fiscal Policy Statement red-lined (3313 : 2018 Fiscal Policy Statement)

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective November 298, 20167

1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and FasTracks to
provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected
increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as a result of economic
downturns affecting revenue. The Base System should strive to maintain a total
fund balance at an amount approximately equal to three months of Base System
operating expenses excluding depreciation among the following three reserve funds:
the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating reserve, and the remaining
3
Packet Pg. 152

12.D.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective November 298, 20167

RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board-appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as economic downturns. With Board
approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the need
for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond rating.
The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled
major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases.
The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a
prompt manner.
4. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate an unrestricted operating
reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to mitigate service or
project disruptions due to revenue fluctuations, unanticipated expenditures of a
nonrecurring nature, or to avoid cash flow disruptions. The source of replenishment
of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution.
6. The Board shall establish a reserve for future construction under the FasTracks plan:
 The FasTracks Management Reserve will be appropriated at a sufficient level each
year to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule, relating to
logistics or cost savings opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is
adopted, and will not be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System capital
or operating activity.

Attachment: 2018 Fiscal Policy Statement red-lined (3313 : 2018 Fiscal Policy Statement)

unrestricted fund balance. For FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund
and unrestricted fund balance should be maintained at an amount approximately
equal to three months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation. RTD
will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund balance
replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses are an
especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.

7. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding to
complete and operate additional FasTracks projects. Expenditures from the FISA will
be subject to Board approval. Funding of the FISA will be provided from the sources

identified in the Board approved Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) and other sources
approved by the Board.

DEBT POLICIES
1. Debt financing will not be issued to support operating expenditures.
2. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, Certificates of Participation
(COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to exceed the
lesser of the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.
3. Effective communication with credit rating agencies will be maintained, and a policy
of full disclosure on every financial report and official statement will be followed.
4. Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures and the net revenue coverage ratio will be analyzed.
5. It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's credit ratings at the highest reasonably attainable level
in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to receive
lower interest rates and lower debt insurance premiums than would be possible with
lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

Subject:

2018 Investment Policy

CFO/AGM,

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 28, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.
BACKGROUND
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in November 2016. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION
Staff solicited the expertise, knowledge and recommendations of its investment advisor, Public Trust
Advisors, in reviewing the current Policy. One Minor change is recommended this year for clarification
sake.
The purpose of the Investment Policy (the “Policy”) of the Regional Transportation District ("RTD") is to
specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and systematic program for investments in
RTD’s operating and reserve funds. The Policy also provides for the investment of bond proceeds that
are authorized through bond resolutions or indentures of trust.
By following best practices with respect to the management of public funds, the primary objectives of
RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2) sufficient liquidity to meet
known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield (achieving a market rate of return). Although RTD must
legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1) it
has previously made a policy decision to implement its investment program in a more conservative
manner than is dictated by state statute through imposing stricter diversification limits.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement

The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:



Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:


Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 11-2-17 REDLINE (3314 : 2018 Investment Policy)

1. PURPOSE

Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

1
Packet Pg. 162

12.E.a

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.

The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 11-2-17 REDLINE (3314 : 2018 Investment Policy)

3.3 Yield

4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to

2
Packet Pg. 163

12.E.a

the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).

While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 11-2-17 REDLINE (3314 : 2018 Investment Policy)

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the

portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.

Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,
diversification requirements, extraordinary events and other factors may be considered when
awarding investments.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions
authorized to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities
only from those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i)
primary dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that
qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 11-2-17 REDLINE (3314 : 2018 Investment Policy)

7.1 Safekeeping and custody

RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.
8
Packet Pg. 169

12.E.a

RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns
which may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this
Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy,
denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 11-2-17 REDLINE (3314 : 2018 Investment Policy)

The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents) is the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio (securities maturing between 90 days and
5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated performance benchmark is the
Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: November 1, 2017

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 1, 2017

Board Meeting Date: November 7, 2017

Subject:

Federal Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Federal Liaison Services with Squire
Patton Boggs LLP for a one-year option at a cost of $270,000 (January 1 through December 31, 2018).
This action represents the fourth year of a five-year contract. Funding for this contract is included in the
annual budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Federal Liaison Services was issued on August 12, 2014. This solicitation
was a Best Value Procurement where technical factors and cost were all considered. Ten responsive
proposals were received, and they were evaluated by an evaluation committee that recommended Squire
Patton Boggs LLP. The recommendation of the evaluation committee was subsequently referred to the
Government Relations Committee on November 11, 2014. The Government Relations Committee
recommended that Squire Patton Boggs LLP be offered a new contract for a five-year period. Squire
Patton Boggs has been RTD’s federal lobbyist since 2000 and has assisted in RTD’s receiving over $2.5
billion in federal grants and loans. In addition to constant monitoring of Congressional and Executive
Branch activities, status reports are issued and special reports are prepared when required by the Board
of Directors or the General Manager.
DISCUSSION
Constant monitoring of federal legislative activities that relate to RTD is required, and RTD’s interests
must be conveyed to appropriate members of Congress, including the Colorado delegation and other key
Congressional committee members. The Squire Patton Boggs team has excellent rapport and respect
from the Colorado delegation and serves as a resource for the delegation staff. When RTD has a Full
Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) in place as it now does (Eagle P3 Project), the annual appropriations
process requires intense attention to committee hearings and to the status of the Congressional budget
process.
The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST) was passed on December 4, 2015, and the
federal lobbyists played a key role in representing RTD’s needs in this reauthorization bill. With the build
out of FasTracks, the lobbyists need to be especially attentive to the federal financing needs for the new
corridors, and they will monitor discussions and advocate for RTD’s best interests regarding new plans
for the Executive Office’s infrastructure bill to be introduced sometime in the near future. When the bill
is revealed, Squire Patton Boggs will play a key role in advising RTD as to the contents of the bill and
monitoring the amendments and progress of the proposed language.
In addition to helping with Congressional activities, assistance is also necessary with the Executive
Branch of the federal government, including the US Department of Transportation (the Federal Transit
Administration and the Federal Railroad Administration). Squire Patton Boggs provides guidance and

Packet Pg. 174

13.F

assistance in applying for and receiving federal funds from the Department of Transportation, as well as
advising staff on proper protocols for these agencies.
The Denver office of Squire Patton Boggs serves in an important advisory role in RTD’s connection to
relevant national personnel and issues. In addition, annually, or as required, meetings with the Board of
Directors are also held.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Government Relations Committee’s Recommended Action to authorize the General
Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Federal Liaison Services with Squire
Patton Boggs LLP for a one-year option at cost of $270,000 (January 1 through December 31,
2018). This action represents the fourth year of a five-year contract. Funding for this contract is
included in the annual budget.
2. Continue the contract on a month-to-month basis, if amenable to the current Contractor (Squire
Patton Boggs LLP). This option is not recommended because continuity and stability in liaison
services is an important consideration.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and issue a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for Federal
Liaison Services. This option is not recommended because RTD’s RFP process was properly
utilized for this procurement, and all the proposals were reviewed and subjected to the evaluation
criteria, resulting in a recommendation from the evaluation committee—pursuant to RTD’s longstanding procurement procedures.

Performance Evaluation

Manager's

2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the General Manager’s performance appraisal for 2017 as defined in the
attached completed General Manager’s Performance Evaluation Packet. The General Manager Oversight
and Performance Management Committee is pleased to report they are in agreement with General
Manager Genova’s self-assessments and feel he has achieved or exceeded his overall goals for the 2017
Performance Appraisal. Although it has been a challenging year, the General Manager Oversight and
Performance Management Committee recognizes that General Manager Genova has met the “Exceeds
Expectations” for all of the Core Goals and one of the Task Goals and “Achieved Expectations” for the
remaining Task Goals set forth for performance in 2017. Based on the consistent and outstanding
performance in leading the RTD and the overall compensation philosophy is to hire and maintain top
talent in keeping with the industry compensation of transit leadership peers we feel General Manager
Genova has earned a discretionary performance payment of $2,850.00. This is an increase of 1% over
last year.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee works with the General
Manager to enhance its oversight responsibilities for the General Manager’s performance and to develop
processes that are approved by the full Board and are transparent to the public.
On July 20, 2010, the Board approved the goal setting process for the General Manager. That process
defines the steps the Board will follow in establishing the annual goals for the General Manager.
Beginning in 2011, these goals include core and task goals. Core goals are based on the General
Manager’s job description and are generally considered part of the ongoing responsibilities of the General
Manager. The task goals are a compilation of the priorities from the annual joint Board and staff
Planning Session that occurs in the first quarter of the year setting goals for the following year.
One of the steps in the process is to formalize the General Manager’s annual goals using the same
process as the salaried employee performance evaluation. That process was used in the 2017 GM
performance appraisal process.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair and the full committee
have moved through the process of the 2017 performance evaluation utilizing the policies set on July
10, 2010, through the recommendation by the State Legislative Audit Committee.

Performance Evaluation

Manager's

2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the General Manager’s performance appraisal for 2017 as defined in the
attached completed General Manager’s Performance Evaluation Packet. The General Manager Oversight
and Performance Management Committee is pleased to report they are in agreement with General
Manager Genova’s self-assessments and feel he has achieved or exceeded his overall goals for the 2017
Performance Appraisal. Although it has been a challenging year, the General Manager Oversight and
Performance Management Committee recognizes that General Manager Genova has met the “Exceeds
Expectations” for all of the Core Goals and one of the Task Goals and “Achieved Expectations” for the
remaining Task Goals set forth for performance in 2017. Based on the consistent and outstanding
performance in leading the RTD and the overall compensation philosophy is to hire and maintain top
talent in keeping with the industry compensation of transit leadership peers we feel General Manager
Genova has earned a discretionary performance payment of $11,400.00 $2850.00. This is an increase
of 4% 1% over last year.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee works with the General
Manager to enhance its oversight responsibilities for the General Manager’s performance and to develop
processes that are approved by the full Board and are transparent to the public.
On July 20, 2010, the Board approved the goal setting process for the General Manager. That process
defines the steps the Board will follow in establishing the annual goals for the General Manager.
Beginning in 2011, these goals include core and task goals. Core goals are based on the General
Manager’s job description and are generally considered part of the ongoing responsibilities of the General
Manager. The task goals are a compilation of the priorities from the annual joint Board and staff
Planning Session that occurs in the first quarter of the year setting goals for the following year.
One of the steps in the process is to formalize the General Manager’s annual goals using the same
process as the salaried employee performance evaluation. That process was used in the 2017 GM
performance appraisal process.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair and the full committee
have moved through the process of the 2017 performance evaluation utilizing the policies set on July
10, 2010, through the recommendation by the State Legislative Audit Committee.

TMD Contract Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee to approve an amendment to the Transportation
Management & Design, Inc. (TMD) Contract 14DO009, awarded in March 2015, to exercise the two
remaining one-year option periods thereby extending the Contract period of performance to December
31, 2019 and to increase the contract amount by $650,000 from $500,000 to a new Not to Exceed
(NTE) total of $1,150,000.
BACKGROUND
Transportation Management & Design, Inc. (TMD) currently provides on-call service planning assistance
to RTD under the terms of Contract 14DO009. TMD has been selected on three different occasions
through RTD’s Request for Proposal (RFP) process over the last 15 years to perform a variety of service
planning studies for projects which require more time or specific expertise than RTD Service
Development staff have available. Previous projects have included the restructuring of bus services
associated with the opening of the A-Line rail service, the B-Line rail service, the R-Line rail service, and
the planned opening of the G-Line rail service. TMD is currently working with RTD to provide assistance
in the restructuring of bus service associated with the planned opening of the N-Line rail service. In
addition, TMD has provided assistance with various transit priority studies.
DISCUSSION
RTD has found TMD’s analysis and recommendations to be thorough and well documented, allowing
RTD staff to propose appropriate changes through a timely and responsive process we would otherwise
not be able to accomplish in a timely manner. TMD is currently working with RTD on the restructuring
of bus service to accompany the planned opening of the N-Line rail service. Additional future projects
include: analysis of potential transit priority applications, transfer analysis, analysis of ridership patterns,
analysis of potential bus stop consolidation activities, streamlining routes and frequent route network
analysis. TMD planning assistance is provided to RTD on an on-call basis through the issuance of
specific task orders for each specific project/task.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD has approved an additional $50,000 in the adopted 2017 Budget as amended. $300,00 is included
in the 2018 RTD budget request currently under consideration by the RTD Board of Directors. Future
funding requests will be included in future year’s budget requests.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager to approve the exercise of the two one-year option periods with TDM
and increase the contract Not to Exceed (NTE) by $650,000. Individual task orders, each with a
specific NTE amount will be released for each project. The total Contract NTE amount will not
exceed $1,150,000.
2. Further modify the NTE increase. This is not recommended because it will delay the implementation

of these services.
3. Do not authorize the General Manager to exercise the two one-year option periods or to increase the
NTE dollar amount with TDM. This is not the recommended action because RTD would not have the
opportunity to continue with these important service-related studies.

Subject:

Free Rides for Members of the Military

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free rides on RTD for active
duty members of the United States Military should be extended from the presently approved date of
December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. Utilization has been minimal to date and this extension will
have minimal impact on RTD.
BACKGROUND
At the October 30, 2006 Special Board Meeting, the RTD Board of Directors approved a resolution
allowing active duty U.S. Military personnel to ride free on all RTD services through the end of 2006.
This offer has been extended annually by the Board since that time and is now valid through December
31, 2017. As a result of these actions, all active duty members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines,
Coast Guard, National Guard, and Reserves are entitled to ride free on any RTD service including special
services such as SkyRide and BroncosRide. To be eligible to ride for free, active duty military personnel
must either be in uniform or present an active duty military ID card.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the RTD Board of Directors extend this offer beyond the current expiration date
of December 31, 2017 and that the expiration date be extended by one year at this time and revisited
again next year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The exact financial impact of this action is not known, but is expected to be minimal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Extend free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should from the
presently approved date of December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. This is the staff
recommendation.
2. Do not extend RTD’s program offering free rides for active duty members of the United States
Military.
