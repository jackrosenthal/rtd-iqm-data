FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: FEBRUARY 7, 2017

It has become increasingly clear that Congress will not act on a broad infrastructure proposal in the
first 100 days of the new Administration. Recently, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said the
funding levels of any infrastructure proposal are unknown, and won’t be determined until Congress
considers it in the greater context of the upcoming budget process this spring. To date, there is no
consensus, even among Republicans, on how such infrastructure spending will be paid for.
Senate Democrats Propose Infrastructure Plan
As details about President Trump’s proposal remain unclear, Senate Democrats have released their
own 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure proposal that they assert would create 15 million jobs. The
Senate Democratic proposal has little chance of becoming law, but it will be an important messaging
document as negotiations over an infrastructure proposal progress throughout the year.


The proposal would expand the TIGER grant program by $10 billion over ten years
(apparently doubling the current $500 million/year to be $1 billion/year).



The plan would also provide $130 billion for public transportation, with $90 billion to
address the backlog of state-of-good-repair needs and $40 billion for new construction and
system expansions.



Importantly, the proposal also calls for a bipartisan plan to ensure the long-term solvency of
the Highway Trust Fund, including the Mass Transit Account.

Congressional Hearings on Infrastructure Begin
To lay the groundwork for an infrastructure bill later this year, both the House and Senate
transportation authorizing committees are kicking off their hearing schedules.


The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee will hold a hearing on February 1,
titled “Building a 21st Century Infrastructure for America.” Testifying at the hearing will be
leaders of corporations that rely heavily on the nation’s surface transportation systems,
including the leaders of FedEx Corporation, Cargill Incorporated, BMW North America,
Vermeer Corporation, and the AFL-CIO.



The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will hold its first hearing of the
session on “America’s infrastructure” on February 8. No witness list has been released.

Secretary-designate Elaine Chao Confirmed
On January 31, by a vote of 93 to 6, the Senate confirmed Elaine Chao’s nomination to serve as
Secretary of the US Department of Transportation.
