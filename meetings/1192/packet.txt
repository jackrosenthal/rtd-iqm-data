Subject:

BroncosRide 2013 Update

There will be two distinct differences in the BroncosRide service for the 2013 season that should be
pointed out:
First, the new West Line will provide service to Sports Authority Field at Mile High via the new DecaturFederal Station. Although it has been general practice to discontinue BroncosRide bus service from Light
Rail Stations, RTD will keep the Federal Center Station BroncosRide for the 2013 season in order to
evaluate the West Line service capacity to the Stadium on game days. A decision on the continuation of
the Federal Center Station BroncosRide will be made after the 2013 Broncos season.
Second, the BroncosRide service has previously included the Federal Shuttle. The Federal Shuttle has
two elements: a south shuttle for customers parking at Lincoln High School and a north shuttle for
customers parking at Chase Bank at Lakeside Office Park. Ridership on each shuttle ranges between
250-300 customers per game. For the Broncos 2013 season, the north portion of the shuttle will not
operate as Lakeside’s previous commitment to RTD’s BroncosRide parking has changed. Unfortunately,
there is no alternative for customer parking along Federal Boulevard for the north shuttle. RTD Marketing
materials will direct the customers to Ward Road or Olde Town Arvada Park-n-Rides for BroncosRide
service. Therefore, for the 2013 Broncos season, the revised Federal Shuttle routing will only include
the south shuttle which will operate from Lincoln High School to Decatur-Federal Station for access to
the Stadium.

Status
The system continues to have high severity problems reoccur
on a regular basis. RTD is requesting a Senior Central
System Engineer from INIT to be onsite. The 60-day minifleet test was halted and will not restart until high-severity
problems are resolved. Therefore, testing will continue into
September.
890 buses are installed with 114 remaining. Projections still
show August completion. Installations still projecting to
complete at the end of August. But, there is risk of not
completing until early September.
Fourteen Street Supervisor vehicles have been installed.
ASA drive testing went well. The length of messages may be
a problem on shorter blocks. Modifications of announcements
are being considered to adjust for this limitation.
Asset management interfaces are going through detailed
testing that will extend into July.
A downstream data management interface is being
developed.

Smart Card Project Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
The Smart Card Program continues to effectively gather rider taps for bus and train EcoPass and
CollegePass riders. During the month of June, 2013, 993K taps were recorded on bus and train
validators, an expected continued reduction from May due to a decrease in college pass use as many
colleges and universities are on summer break. The Smartcard Customer Service Center, (Operated
under an RTD contract with Xerox by Celina, Inc.) continues to distribute new cards upon request, issue
replacement cards and answer riders’ questions as they arise.
A team of RTD Technical Support staff meets weekly to discuss reported issues with bus installations
and determine steps required to address issues that arise. A work effort is under way to repair/replace
defective stanchions on which the Smart Card readers are mounted.
All one-hundred-nine Light Rail validators have been installed and are operational. Work on the
installation of two additional validators at 16th/California and 18th/California has been completed. An RFP
(Request for Proposal) has been published to retain a work order contractor to provide on-call installation
and electrical services for additional validators as needed. Review of the responses to the proposal is
scheduled for July 9, 2013.
An update to the Fare Inspector software used to confirm that passengers have tapped prior to boarding
is expected to be delivered on July 8, 2013. Once complete, the upgrade to the hand-held devices will
provide an extended battery life for the unit, as well as display more comprehensive messaging regarding
suspended cards. Xerox is engaged in additional work to simplify the method by which software
upgrades are applied to the hand held devices. Fare Inspectors continue to operate in an “educate &
inform” mode, and will receive additional training on the software improvements when implemented.
As part of the Phase 2 Smart Card deployment, detailed testing plans have been developed to fully test
the Retail Point of Sales (RPOS) Terminals that were delivered to RTD in May. Phase 2 will see the
implementation of these terminals at RTD sales locations and will provide the general public with the
ability to purchase Smart Card products. The detailed testing scenarios are designed to ensure a
seamless integration of the point-of sale units into the existing Smart Media Technology platform. A
review of the Retailer’s Agreement/Application will take place on July 17, 2013. RTD Marketing staff
will meet with Safeway and King Soopers after a contract is signed to develop the appropriate marketing
campaign. In addition to the web portal already in place, approximately 150 locations will be established
throughout the region for riders to purchase monthly passes and/or add value to their cards. Planning for
Phase 2 of the program is in full-swing and the schedule continues to be evaluated to ensure adequate
timing for a successful Phase 2 launch.

management” feature that would shut down the smart
card reader in an effort to save battery power on July 8.
Xerox is investigating improvements to the daily update
process, as well as an improvement to software upgrade
delivery.
The documented results of the June 5th Ride-a-long were
reviewed with the Heads of RTD Transit Police. A plan for
Fare Inspector Training has been developed and is targeted
for completion by August 15, 2013.
Based on feedback from the fare inspectors, as well as
RTD Technical staff supporting the handheld units,
additional information is being added to the User Manual.
This manual, along with system/software specifications
will be included in the Fare Inspector Training Materials

Marketing has completed their review of the SMT web
portal. A meeting has been scheduled for July 11, 2013
during which Marketing will review the requested changes
to the portal. These changes will be developed into
requirements which will be presented to Xerox for
completion. Marketing has provided advanced information
that there are a large number of changes to be reviewed
and discussed. Some of these changes are “cosmetic” in
nature regarding the appearance of the web portal. Others
may require changes to the functionality of the portal
itself. A more detailed description of the impact to the
portal will be provided in the August Board Report.
The Upload/Suspend functionality was thoroughly tested
and performs as expected in the test environment. The
new software was moved into production on Thursday,
5/30/13. At present, colleges and universities are
continuing to work through the process of suspending and
deactivating college passes. RTD has scheduled one-onone meetings with the larger schools and universities to
offer assistance as they prepare their records for upload
into the Smart Card system. At these meetings, RTD staff
will assess the current status of College Pass programs at
each location and provide support where needed to get
cards suspended or deactivated as appropriate.

Safeway has committed to continue selling RTD products.
Safeway has a moratorium on all changes during the
months of November and December. Site surveys and
installations may begin in the first quarter, 2014.
Meeting with King Soopers held in early March. They have
indicated they would like to avoid their busy months of
November and December for implementation and training
of their staff. Installations of the units may be done during
this time as long as the work is done during the overnight
hours.
No response from 7-Eleven; may possibly pursue a
partnership with Walgreens.
Design document has been approved. RTD will provide a
cellular modem for communication to the RTD network.
All 300 RPOS Units were delivered to RTD on time.
Network installations at all RTD Retail outlets have been
completed and the sites are ready for RPOS installation at
the appropriate time.
Testing on the new RPOS units is tentatively scheduled for
the Week of July 15. Xerox will be onsite for testing and
test plans have been developed and reviewed by the
extended project team.
The SMT Program Team continues to look for additional
retail partnerships and outlets.
The printers associated with the APOS devices are
experiencing issues with printing cards. These devices are
still under warranty and RTD is working with the vendor to
resolve the technical issues.
