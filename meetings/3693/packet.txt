BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
29th and Welton Property D isposition Time Extension

September 10, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
September 24, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to extend the outside closing date to December 31, 2024 for the negotiation
and execution of all documents necessary for the disposition of the real property located at 2907-2915
Welton Street, Denver, Colorado (the Property), including execution of any deeds, covenants, and other
property conveyance documents.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chessy Brady, Manager, Transit-Oriented Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD acquired the property located at the corner of 29th Street and Welton Street (Property) for
$148,000 in 1993 to replace the on-street parking for local businesses that was lost during the
construction of the Central Corridor. The Property is currently a vacant parking lot used for neighborhood
retail parking and is not managed as part of RTD’s parking management system.
In 2010, the Board of Directors adopted the Strategic Plan for Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) to
create a more focused policy that guides RTD’s role in encouraging the creation of mixed-income
communities near transit. Pursuant to that policy direction, RTD selected the Welton Corridor as one of
four pilot program sites because of a combination of favorable market conditions for redevelopment and
the City and County of Denver’s (CCD) commitment to revitalization of the Welton Corridor, a
commitment that currently continues.
In 2013, the Five Points Business District published its Vision Plan Implementation and Revitalization
Strategy, which called for removal of vacant parking lots along the corridor, including activation of the
Property. The plan emphasized the need to retain housing affordability along the Welton Corridor.
Beginning in 2014, staff and representatives from the Denver Department of Economic Development and
Opportunity began discussions around how to partner to implement the community vision established in
the Five Points Business District plan as part of the TOD Pilot Program implementation. CCD determined
that attainable for-sale housing was the preferred strategy for the site.
In December 2016, the Board of Directors approved an option agreement for CCD or its assignee to
purchase the Property at fair market value, for the development of mixed-income housing. The exercise

Packet Pg. 3

1.E.1

of the option was contingent on the mutual selection of a development partner. A developer was
selected in December 2017 but could not secure adequate financing, prompting RTD and CCD to dismiss
the developer and the project in January 2020 prior to closing.
In February 2021, the Board of Directors approved a resolution of commitment to promote affordable
housing as detailed in the agency’s Equitable TOD (eTOD) Policy. In August 2021, the Board of Directors
authorized the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) or her designee to dispose of the Property according
to the terms below:
1. RTD will successfully procure a development partner to build a mixed-income condominium
project with affordable units.
2. The selected developer will secure the financing necessary to complete the project.
3. The final lease or purchase price for the Property will be based on a fair market value appraisal of
the Property with a potential for reductions in purchase price or rent in exchange for affordable
housing development or other benefits to the agency pursuant to the eTOD Policy.
4. Lease signing or closing will occur a maximum of two years from the date of developer selection,
with the ability to grant two 90-day extensions if necessary to complete the transaction.
5. RTD will grant property rights to the development partner via a ground lease rather than a sale
unless a ground lease structure is financially infeasible; or if a sale structure substantially
increases the quantity, depth, or length of the term of affordability; or a sale structure is
financially beneficial to RTD, as determined by RTD.
DISCUSSION
In 2022, RTD selected Shanahan Development, LLC, to purchase the property from the agency and
construct 62 affordable condominiums, which will immediately be sold to Elevation Community Land
Trust (ECLT). ECLT will then manage the sale of the units to homebuyers earning up to 80% of Area
Media Income. As the landowner, ECLT will ensure all future sales meet requirements that both maintain
the affordability of the condos and permit the original buyers to build equity. CCD has approved the Site
Development Plan for the project and is ready to issue building permits as soon as Shanahan closes on
the purchase of the Property.
Of the terms of the property disposition authorized by the Board of Directors in 2021, terms 1, 3, and 5,
listed above, have been adhered to and/or accomplished. Term 2 is nearly complete; in June 2024,
Denver City Council allocated $5 million to the project, and the State’s Department of Local Affairs is
contributing more than $8 million. The financing package will be complete on September 23, 2024,
when Denver City Council is expected to authorize the Denver Urban Renewal Authority to contribute
$2.2 million to the project. However, the Board of Directors’ authorization expires on September 26,
2024, pursuant to Term 4. Since the closing on the sale of the Property is currently planned for late
September or early October 2024, shortly after Board authorization expires, additional flexibility is
needed to accomplish the closing.
This action would extend the GM/CEO’s existing authority to dispose of the Property to the selected
developer once the above conditions are met, allowing for the flexibility required to ensure the closing
can happen.

Packet Pg. 4

1.E.1

FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD currently spends approximately $10,500 per year maintaining the property. If the property is
disposed of, the agency will no longer have this maintenance obligation and will receive $1.5 million
from the selected developer.

BACKGROUND
This action addresses the Equitable Transit-Oriented Development (eTOD) Policy, approved by the Board
in February 2021, as well as the policy goals of Resolution 17, Series of 2010, the Strategic Plan for
Transit-Oriented Development, by supporting creation of mixed-income housing near transit stations.

o

RTD acquired the Property located at the corner of 29th Street and Welton Street for $97,000 in 1993
to replace the on-street parking for local businesses that was lost during the construction of the Central
Corridor. The Property is currently a vacant parking lot used for neighborhood retail parking and is not
managed as part of RTD’s parking management system.

In 2010, the Board adopted the Strategic Plan for TOD to create a more focused policy that guides
RTD’s role in encouraging the creation of mixed-income communities near transit. The Board also

RTD and CCD have outlined a competitive process to solicit developers to build a mixed-income
condominium project with affordable units on the Property. RTD would lead the Request for
Qualifications (RFQ) process and CCD would participate in the developer selection panel and provide gap
financing for the project. A letter from Denver Mayor Michael Hancock expressing CCD’s commitment to
this project is attached to the Board packet. It describes CCD’s willingness to contribute substantial gap
financing to support an appropriate development on the Property.

To aid in the successful completion of the developer selection, RTD must establish certainty for potential
bidders that the property will be available at previously agreed upon terms. Therefore, staff has
requested authority to dispose of the Property according to the terms below.
DISCUSSION
This action would give authority to dispose of the Property to the selected developer conditioned upon
meeting the following requirements:

on

1. RTD will successfully procure a development partner to build a mixed-income condominium
project with affordable units.
2. The selected developer will secure the financing necessary to complete the project.
3. The final lease or purchase price for the Property will be based on a fair market value appraisal of
the Property with a potential for reductions in purchase price or rent in exchange for affordable
housing development or other benefits to the agency pursuant to the eTOD Policy.
4. Lease signing or closing will occur a maximum of two years from the date of developer selection,
with the ability to grant two 90-day extensions if necessary to complete the transaction.
5. RTD will grant property rights to the development partner via a ground lease rather than a sale
unless a ground lease structure is financially infeasible; or if a sale structure substantially
increases the quantity, depth, or length of the term of affordability; or a sale structure is
financially beneficial to RTD, as determined by RTD.

Ap

If a selected developer fails to complete the transaction, RTD would remain the property owner and any
subsequent decisions about the Property would be subject to Board approval. RTD staff will keep the
Board apprised of the developer selection process and project implementation.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD currently spends approximately $10,500 per year maintaining the property. If the property is
disposed of, RTD will no longer have this maintenance obligation and will receive the amount determined
by a fair market value appraisal of the Property.

December 2017 but could not secure adequate financing, prompting RTD and CCD to dismiss the
developer and the project in January 2020 prior to closing. Later in 2020, the Board affirmed its
preference to ground-lease, rather than sell, this property for redevelopment. The Property was appraised
in January 2020 at $2.4 million. In 2021, the Board approved a resolution committed to promoting
affordable housing as detailed in the agency’s eTOD Policy.

To the RTD Board of Directors:
This letter is to express the City and County of Denver’s strong and enthusiastic support for the
proposal before you to approve the disposition of RTD-owned property at 2907-2915 Welton
Street for the development of mixed-income housing.
Since the fall of 2014, Denver’s Office of Economic Development (OED) and now the office of
Housing Stability (HOST) has been working closely with the RTD Transit-Oriented
Development team to plan for the development of mixed-income for-sale housing on this
site. We look forward to continuing to collaborate on this joint effort to provide critical
affordable homeownership opportunities in the Five Pointsneighborhood.
As part of HOST’s mission, we invest federal and local funds in the development and
preservation of a variety of income-qualified housing throughout the city. Each year, HOST
invests millions of dollars of gap financing in non-profit and private-sector-led development
projects that add to the city’s stock of affordable housing.
Housing costs in the Denver region are rising out of reach for even moderate-income residents,
with an estimated 100,000 households in Denver County alone paying more than 30% of their
income for housing costs. We recognize the need to invest in affordable housing options not
only to provide shelter for our region’s most vulnerable residents, but also to support the
economic mobility of Denver’s low- and moderate-income families as they become ready to
move into homeownership. To achieve this goal, HOST invests in affordable housing units
ranging from supportive housing for the lowest-income residents to for-sale units for
households earning up to the median income.

Attachment: 2021-08-24 29th and Welton Property Disposition (4983 : 29th and Welton Property D

Due partly to construction defects restrictions, very few for-sale units have been built in Denver
over the last several years, limiting the entry-level housing options available to lower- and
moderate-income homebuyers. The city is eager to continue to collaborate with RTD and a
mutually selected developer to pilot on this site a new model for mixed-income condominium
construction at this location. We are prepared to contribute substantial gap financing to an
appropriate development on this site to support this effort.
We look forward to the opportunity to continue to deepen and strengthen our relationship
with RTD as a key partner in innovative development throughout Denver.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2025-2029 Five-year Financial Forecast (FYFF)

September 10, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
September 24, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2025-2029 Five-year Financial Forecast (FYFF).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 2025-2029 Five-year Financial Forecast (FYFF) is the financial forecast used as the basis for the
development of the 2025 Proposed Budget and provides guidance for future year financial planning. The
FYFF was formerly the six-year Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP).
The development of the FYFF seeks to balance planned expenditures with anticipated available funding
sources in alignment with RTD’s Strategic Plan. The FYFF is prepared on an annual basis or can be
produced more frequently if material changes in assumptions and inputs occur. The previous financial
forecast, the 2024-2029 MTFP, was approved by the Board during the Board Meeting held on Tuesday,
October 24, 2023.
The 2025-2029 FYFF is prepared using currently available information to assist in planning and
modification of the Fiscal Policy, if necessary, within projected financial constraints.
The FYFF is a forecast or projection of financial results and is not an appropriation of funds and is nonbinding.
DISCUSSION
Staff presented a discussion item during the Finance and Planning Committee meeting held on July 23,
2024, related to the 2025-2029 FYFF. The discussion item described the purpose of, and assumptions
being used for, the 2025-2029 FYFF, as well as the financial planning process refinements that are
being implemented in a phased approach. The phased approach will occur from 2024-2027 and will
consist of:
• Generation 1:
o A careful evaluation to ensure that the right monies are used at the right time and for the
right needs

Packet Pg. 17

1.E.2

Continued improvement of the Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan inventory and asset
maturity information
o An internal communication campaign and improved transparency through the Performance
Dashboard
Generation 2:
o Process and control improvements and the expansion of the decision framework
o Reliance on enhanced business case justification
o Implementation of decision gates
o Continuous improvement regarding data quality and development of staff’s planning
competencies
Generation 3:
o Consideration of implementation of decision support technology tools for the combined
prioritization evaluation of projects and resources
o Consistent measurement of project outcomes
o

•

•

The 2025-2029 FYFF has been prepared using currently available information and does not include
assumptions regarding future potential changes such as passage of the TABOR ballot question or new
grant funding from the collection of oil and gas production fees authorized by Senate Bill 24-230. The
FYFF will only include funding source and use projections that have reasonable certainty to occur in
accordance with RTD’s Board-approved Fiscal Policy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2025-2029 FYFF projects continued adherence to Fiscal Policy requirements and maintenance of
adequate reserves to continue to cash fund expenditures while providing the necessary funding to
support the Comprehensive Operational Analysis while meeting TAM needs.

2025-2029 Five-year Financial Forecast

Each year, or more often, if necessary, the Regional Transportation District prepares a multi-year financial forecast
for planning purposes. In previous years, a six-year Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP) was produced. In 2024, RTD
implemented a new financial planning horizon of five years that will be referred to as the Five-year Financial Forecast
(FYFF).
The 2025-2029 FYFF represents the expected revenues, expenditures and financial position anticipated for the fiscal
years January 1 through December 31. The RTD Board of Directors is requested to approve the annual FYFF, however,
it is a forecasting and planning tool and not an appropriation of funding. The forecasted revenues and expenditures
from the FYFF are then used as the basis for the scope of the annual proposed budget.
Forecasted revenues and expenditures are developed in the FYFF using the most current information available at the
time of report preparation. As such, forecasted amounts will change over time. If assumptions change materially,
staff will revise the FYFF for presentation to the Board, as necessary.
The expenditures set forth herein align with RTD’s Strategic Plan Priorities and are developed in support of executing
the Comprehensive Operational Analysis (COA). In order to maintain fiscal sustainability, financial forecasts must
consider balancing with expenditures not exceeding revenues over the long term. Financial Success also must
consider maintaining adequate fund balances, adhering to the Board-approved Fiscal Policy and being good stewards
of taxpayer funds.
The development of the 2025-2029 FYFF was a cross-departmental collaborative effort; hence the proposed 20252029 FYFF for the Board’s consideration is a collective staff recommendation, centered on a One RTD approach.

ASSUMPTIONS
Consolidated

Fare revenue is projected to continue to account for approximately 5% of revenue. Modest annual
ridership increases of 2% will contribute to fare revenue increases and the impact of Zero Fare for Youth
is included in each year.
Sales and use tax projections provided in March 2024 by the University of Colorado Leeds School of
Business are included. Prior forecasts assumed a 1.4% annual growth cap for the Base System as an
assumption for the impact of TABOR revenue growth limits. This prior assumption has been replaced
with a more thorough and complete TABOR revenue calculation which assumes TABOR refunds of $2.4
million in 2027 and $3.7 million in 2029. It is important to note that this assumption does not assume
an economic slowdown and is more optimistic than the experience of other TABOR impacted
governments that are routinely subject to TABOR refunds of 7-10% of applicable revenues.
Operating expense inflation increases have been incorporated at an average annual rate of 5.1% over
the five-year period. Inflation assumptions are applied at differing rates by category such as wages,

benefits and materials while also applying known contractual increases such as with contracted services.
The basis for operating expenditure forecasts is the System Optimization Plan (SOP), which is the
Agency’s COA.
Asset management expenditures are included that maintain assets in a state of good repair using
information from the Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan. It should be noted that the TAM is not fully
populated or mature from an asset condition assessment standpoint and staff continues to improve the
information continued therein. Further, the TAM Plan includes occasional large outlays for asset
replacements such as revenue vehicle purchases, some of which are planned to occur beyond the FYFF
planning horizon. The Fiscal Policy includes the intention of RTD to continue to cash fund purchases,
however, it may be necessary to finance some large purchases in the future with Certificates of
Participation (COPs), a form of lease-purchase financing, to spread the costs over multiple years for
efficient cash flow purposes and maintenance of fund balances. It is also important to recognize that
RTD recently began to realize the financial impacts of large repairs and replacements as certain transit
system elements reached a 30-year age. This trend will continue as more of the transit system continues
to age and approaches useful life benchmarks.
Reserves are projected to continue to meet the Fiscal Policy requirements for the Operating and TABOR
reserves. Due to TAM repair and replacement activities, the Capital Replacement and Unrestricted
Reserves will diminish over the five-year period, as expected. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account
(FISA) is projected to continue to be funded according to the Fiscal Policy.

Revenue growth is primarily attributable to increases in tax collections and small ridership increases
driving fares. Revenue increases are tempered by a modest impact from assumed Taxpayer’s Bill of
Rights (TABOR) revenue growth limitations as well as decreasing investment income as interest rates are
expected to decrease. Grant revenue includes a pass-through grant in 2024 and then reduces and is
assumed to be flat due to no assumption of future new capital grant funding opportunities
Operating expense annual increases approximate 4% for inflationary and contractual increase
assumptions. Capital expenditures are in accordance with the TAM Plan while debt service will continue
to decrease with reductions in remaining obligations and the Fiscal Policy directive to target cash funding
of purchases
Capital expenditures are significantly higher in 2024 and 2027 due to the inclusion of funding for rail
reconstruction work and bus purchases, respectively
While net sources and uses project a deficit in each year, this line item includes funding contributions to
reserves to maintain Fiscal Policy requirements and continue with cash funding of TAM needs rather than
funding through more costly financing mechanisms
The Unrestricted Fund balance will decrease due to funding of the TAM Plan needs while the Capital
Replacement Fund increases to set aside funding for future year TAM needs with additional investments
for vehicle replacements and other asset renewals and repairs after 2029. A transfer to FasTracks of
$26.6 million will be necessary in 2029.

Revenue growth is primarily attributable to increases in tax collections and small ridership increases
driving fares. Fare revenue from the A Line is expected to continue drive overall RTD fares with a
relatively larger proportion attributable to FasTracks. TABOR revenue growth impacts are smaller than
the Base System due to TABOR exemption of the 0.4% tax through 2050. Decreasing investment income
is expected as interest rates are anticipated to decrease, and investible balances decrease
Operating expenses have increases in 2025 and 2029 due to variations in annual payments under the
commuter rail concessionaire agreement that were included for scheduled periodic repair and
maintenance activities. Debt service increases due to the intentional issuance of debt with repayment
occurring and growing then subsiding in relation to the Base System decrease in debt service as planned
due to consolidated cash flow needs and the ability of the Base System to be allowed to provide funding
to FasTracks, as approved by voters
Fund balances will decrease due to the net cash outflows primarily driven by FasTracks’ debt service
requirements. The unrestricted reserve is projected to be exhausted by the end of the forecast period
to avoid debt financing while the FISA is assumed to grow according to the 2013 FISA funding plan. This
FISA funding plan uses contributions to fund the temporary increases in the commuter rail concessionaire
agreement during 2025-2027 for scheduled periodic maintenance of the RTD owned assets operated and
maintained by the concessionaire. Because of these reserve funding structures, funding of $26.6m from
the Base system will be necessary in 2029.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Investment Policy

September 10, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Each year staff presents the proposed Investment Policy for the upcoming fiscal year in accordance with
Fiscal Policy requirements. The Investment Policy may be amended by the Board at any time.
The purpose of the Investment Policy is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment of RTD’s operating funds, debt proceeds and reserve funds.
The primary objectives of RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2)
sufficient liquidity to meet known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield to achieve a market rate of
return. Although RTD must follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised Statutes
(C.R.S. 24-75-601.1), this Investment Policy is more conservative in order to achieve the Strategic
Priority of Financial Success.
The most recent modification to the Investment Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in
October 2023 for the 2024 fiscal year.
DISCUSSION
Staff has identified minor grammatical changes to the Investment Policy as shown in the attached. This
draft 2025 Investment Policy has also been reviewed by legal counsel as well as RTD’s municipal
advisor to ensure adherence to state statutes and efficient investment management. No other changes
have been identified at this time.
Staff is performing analyses regarding the efficacy of the application of the current state statutory
requirements regarding allowable investments for governmental agencies to determine if there are
opportunities that could provide material improvements to RTD’s ability to garner improved investment
returns while maintaining safety of principal.

Packet Pg. 39

1.F.1

In addition, staff is considering alternatives regarding the accounting for investment income associated
with federal funds that would effectively segregate them from other investment income for purposes of
mitigating impacts from TABOR revenue growth limitations in 2025.
As this research is finalized, staff will return to the Board with any recommended changes to the Fisal
Policy and/or Investment Policy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this action item.

20254 INVESTMENT POLICY

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of RTD
(collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through Board-approved bond resolutions or indentures
of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated for
investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Subject: 20254 Investment Policy
Page 2

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value
of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD, thereby
reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open market prior
to maturity

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification and
purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard to
insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of
the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual investments
as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses are
inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

Subject: 20254 Investment Policy
Page 3

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market
price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will
hereinafter be referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation
by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating
category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and
Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is
downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio,
the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to
sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates of
indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 100%
of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum maturity for
investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities: Obligations, participations or other
instruments of any Federal agency, instrumentality or United States government-sponsored
enterprise as described in CRS 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an “Agency” or “Agencies”). Such
securities shall be rated in one of the two highest rating categories (as described above in
the Credit Criteria section) by at least two NRSROs. No more than 75% of the Portfolio
may be invested in Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities, with no more than 25%

institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any materiallarge

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment precludes
pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices. However,
fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where securities
may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to reinvest
proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,

Packet Pg. 47

Attachment: RTD 2025 Investment Policy.doc (4982 : 2025 Investment Policy)

No more than 50% of the Portfolio may be invested in repurchase agreements and no more
than 10% may be invested with a single counterparty. The maximum maturity for a
repurchase agreement shall be limited to 90 days.

1.F.1.a

Subject: 20254 Investment Policy
Page 8

the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in
the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.

The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized
to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from
those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary
dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody
With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.

6.3 Portfolio Duration

1.F.1.a

Subject: 20254 Investment Policy
Page 9

7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Staff will include an annual listing of investments held and investment returns within the Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report.
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the average maturity of the investment
portfolio.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return, commensurate
with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the composition of the
Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various indices may be used to
monitor investment performance.
The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash equivalents)
is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the
designated performance benchmark is the ICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns which
may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this Policy
“bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of participation or
other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy, denoting
any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.
