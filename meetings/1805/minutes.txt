Approval of 2008 and 2009 Contract Amendment to Montoya Masonry for 16th Street
Mall Transit way Lanes – Granite Paver Maintenance – Second Year Option – Liz Rao
brought forward this action. Stan Szabelak passed out a Fact Sheet regarding the 16th
Street Mall.
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to
accomplish the following two amendments to the Mall Paver Contract for Montoya
Masonry.
Amendment #1: Increase the current contract funding for maintenance of the Mall
Transitway Lanes for the remainder of 2008 through December 31 by $300,000. Funding
for this contract amendment is included in the 2008 Amended budget.
Amendment #2: Exercise the second year option of this 3rd year contract and authorize
$1,000,000 funding for 2009. This amount is included in the 2009 Requested Budget and

Motion:

the recommendation and forward to the
September 16, 2008 Board Meeting

agenda.
Second:

Director Elfenbein seconded the motion.

Discussion:
Mr. Szabelak reviewed the 16th Street Mall Fact Sheet that was distributed to the
Committee. A copy of this fact sheet is available in the Planning and Development meeting
minute notebook. Cal Marsella spoke about a meeting he had with Tamara Door, of the
Downtown Denver Partnership regarding the mall and he expressed the board’s concern
with the maintenance costs. Director Kemp questioned the operating costs of the mall
shuttles.
Director Tayer asked about asphalt and why staff did not recommend it. Mr. Szabelak said
asphalt is a lot further aesthetically than concrete from the current paver system.
Director Yamrick asked about replacing the mall shuttles with street cars powered by solar.
Director Chacon asked about reducing frequency on the mall. Director Chacon said that
there needs to be an exit strategy for exiting the care and upkeep of the mall.
Director Busck spoke about honoring the contract to maintain the mall but also putting the
Partnership on notice that we will not continue to maintain the mall.
Director Kemp gave support for Director Chacon’s idea of reducing service as he said the
rest of the District is going through service reductions and service on the mall remains the
same.
Director Brohl said that this is not the forum for this discussion and wanted to focus on
approving the recommended action which is about maintaining the mall. She wanted
clarification that RTD’s obligation for maintaining the mall ends in 2012 and then the City
takes over the maintenance. Cal Marsella said that was correct and also that the contract
states that before the City would accept turnover, the mall would have to be in good
operating condition. Director Brohl thought the Board needed to look at this from a long
term perspective as well as a short term perspective. She said the current obligation only
would total $4 million through the end of the contract whereas the asphalt paving option
would cost $10 million. Director Brohl would like to see what condition does the mall have
to be in to turn it over to the City in 2012 and what will it take to get to that point.
Chair Christopher said this item needs to come back in a different form. More conversation
is needed and a solution needs to be found with other partners.
Director Kinton said that when the mall was created, RTD had money to maintain the mall
and now it doesn’t. Director Kinton pointed out that for some RTD taxpaying customers,
this is the only time they access the system.
Director Elfenbein said there is a mall Committee and the Partnership is very aware of this

Summary of the Planning and Development Committee meeting held on Tuesday,

issue. This is not a normal bus service; you can not divide it as you would other bus
service. This is the heart and soul of the regional bus system. This is also a political issue,
not only the Partnership but the City and County of Denver. The mall service is vital to
downtown commuters. That being said, other ways must be studied to pay for the upkeep
of the mall.
Director Tayer said the District needs an exit strategy to get out of the mall maintenance
business.
Director Christopher spoke about being cautious about turning over the maintenance of the
street to someone else as they may not keep it up to the standards the District needs to
operate the shuttle.

Motion:



The Motion passed 9-1 (Director Tayer
opposed)

Horizon Uptown Annexation – Marla Lien, General Counsel spoke to this item. Horizon
wanted to annex into the district prior to selling off the land. Cal Marsella spoke that the
developer is unique in that they are looking to imbed transit access into the development
from day 1.
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the annexation of the 503 acre Horizon Uptown property to RTD. The property
owners, Lend Lease Horizon LLC, have petitioned RTD to approve the annexation. Upon
approval of this annexation, the area would become part of District F. None of the requests or
commitments contained in the development plan has been agreed to and the approval of this
annexation does not commit RTD to any future service at this time. Any future service request
will require a separate agreement by the Board.

approve the recommendation and forward
to the September 16, 2008 Board Meeting
agenda.

Second:

developer imbedding transit into their plans. Director Yamrick commended

voiced their support.

Proposed RTD/CDOT Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) for the FasTracks Southeast
and Southwest Corridor Extensions Environmental Study and Basic Engineering Phase –
Liz Rao brought forward this action. The District has an IGA with CDOT for all corridors
where we are performing environmental impact statements, environmental studies and
basic engineering. The IGA helps RTD coordinate with CDOT about transit and
roadway expansion. There is no financial impact to the District from this IGA.
It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to negotiate and execute a proposed
RTD/CDOT Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) for the FasTracks Southeast and
Southwest Corridor Extensions Environmental Study and Basic Engineering Phase.
There is no financial impact related to the approval of this IGA.

Altes introduced this action. Staff is asking to add additional money to the H.C. Peck
contract for relocation assistance. There are over 100 families that need to be
relocated from several apartment homes at 10th and Sheridan. The market is difficult to
find low income housing so it is taking longer and needs more resources.
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents
necessary to award a contract amendment to increase the total contract amount on RTD
Contract No. 17DH013 from $800,000 to $1,300,000.00, an increase of the $500,000.

issues and costs for all the corridors.

Approval of Contract Amendment with DMJM Harris for Final Design for the Elati Light
Rail Maintenance Facility Expansion and Mariposa Upgrade – This action is to complete
the final design for expanding the Elati and Mariposa facilities to accommodate the
additional 55 vehicles included in FasTracks. Instead of building a new facility, the
District is expanding the existing facilities.
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that RTD’s contract
with DMJM-Harris for the Light Rail Maintenance Facility Environmental Assessment –
Conceptual Engineering (EA-CE) be amended to add $257,531.42 to the contract
amount for the consultant to complete final design. These funds are included in the
FasTracks budget. The current contract amount is $1,598,975.00. This amendment

Updates

 I-225 Corridor Preferred Alternative Update – Larry Warner, FasTracks Contractor, gave the
update on the Corridor. The presentation is available for viewing in the Planning and
Development meeting minute notebook. Alignment will be on the east side (from median)
of I-225 which will not preclude a future eight lane highway. The long flyover has been
eliminated by going under the existing 13th underpass, along Tollgate creek.
Current issues: Parking at the 13th Avenue Station would be an enhancement. Aurora
would need to pay for the station platform. The District would pay for the parking as it is
being moved from the Colfax station.
Director Daly asked how the meeting with the Aurora TAPC went because there are major
changes to the plan. Mr. Warner spoke about how he has worked very closely with the
City of Aurora and has been working with them step by step instead of presenting all the
changes at once. Director Chacon asked about the reaction at Fitzsimmons and the

Summary of the Planning and Development Committee meeting held on Tuesday,

changes. Director Kinton said that he was impressed with how they will cross the highway
at Tollgate Creek and wanted to know if there were flooding issues. Mr. Warner responded
that the track will be built above the 100 year flood plain.
Director Yamrick voiced her support for the project and how well the negotiations have
gone.
