B. Updates

• MPACT64 Update and Process - No Backup
Marla Lien, General Counsel, stated that she would review the process with
the Board and Maria Garcia Berry, CRL, would provide an update of the
status. She said that they met with Don Hunt, Executive Director of CDOT,
and he indicated that if MPACT64 goes forward, it will be as a citizens’
initiative; there will not be a referred measure coming out of the Colorado
Legislature. Marla Lien explained that this means an independent party, or
more than one, will go to the Title Board as is authorized by the Colorado
Constitution and Title 1 of the Colorado Revised Statutes with a ballot title.
The Title Board would approve the title and then authorize that petitions will
be circulated. She said that to have a measure on the ballot there will need
to be an adequate number of ballot signatures collected under the process
outlined by state law.
Marla Lien stated that as a practical matter, this means that the RTD Board
has no one to directly negotiate with about how the ballot will look; it is not
a matter of going to CDOT, the Governor, State Legislature, etc. and
outlining what RTD wants. She noted that RTD has been informally asked
for a list of projects by various proponents but we do not know how those
will fit into the measure. Marla Lien reiterated that this is something RTD
does not have direct control over.
Marla Lien said that if a measure passes, it will not address RTD’s ability to
keep any revenues under TABOR and it will not address RTD’s ability to
bond. She stated that to the extent RTD has TABOR limits on the base
system, RTD may need to de-Bruce those revenues. Also, if RTD wanted to
issue debt against the revenues we would need to have a subsequent
election to the extent that our debt cap has been exceeded.

Director Menten commented that the polling is being done by a private
entity. She wondered if public entities had paid for any of the polling up to
this point. Maria Garcia Berry stated that was not correct. She said both of
the polls on this issue were done by the Colorado Transportation Coalition,
which is made up of the Denver Chamber, the Colorado Contractors
Association, MOVE Colorado, CASTA (Colorado Association of State Transit
Agencies), Colorado Concern and several other private
construction/engineering firms. Maria Garcia Berry stated that there are no
public dollars, nor will they take any public dollars, in this effort. Director
Menten noted that RTD pays dues to organizations like MOVE Colorado and
the Denver Chamber. She wonders how the taxpayers have a guarantee
that public funds are not being funneled to pay for these polls through these
organizations. Maria Garcia Berry said that she could not address MOVE
Colorado specifically; however, organizations like the Denver Chamber
segregate their funds and are very precise about what funds are used to pay
for what activities. She stated that funds going to the Colorado
Transportation Coalition were coming from the Denver Chamber’s private
sector fund. Marla Lien explained that there would not be any prohibition at
this point on public funds being used by an organization to do a study; the
fair campaign practices act does not have any application to surveys. She
said if an entity like the Denver Chamber wanted to do a survey on various
tax issues there would be no trigger of the fair campaign practices act.
Maria Garcia Berry stated that the Coalition’s decision to take no public
dollars is because they do not want one public entity to control what was or
was not in the poll. She said that they have not shared the questionnaire
with any public entity; the Coalition took advice, counsel and opinions but
has not shared the questionnaire with any public entity.
Director Menten asked if it becomes a ballot issue once the title is set or
when the signatures are certified. Maria Garcia Berry stated that it is when
the signatures are certified.
Director Lubow wondered how it was decided that this was not going to be
a referendum but would be a citizens’ initiative. Maria Garcia Berry
explained that it has always been the intent of the coalition not to go to
ballot by General Assembly; they have always thought it would be best if it
became a grassroots effort. Director Lubow noted that she has been
involved with many citizens’ initiatives and it is an arduous process. Maria
Garcia Berry recognized that it is absolutely a huge task but it forces the

Marla Lien reiterated that at this time RTD does not know how the measure
will look. She stressed that this is something the RTD Board will not have
any direct control over.

6.A

Maria Garcia Berry shared that at this point the Coalition thought they would
have poll results but do not as they just went into the field Sunday evening.
She noted that this was a very complex poll to put together and the
Coalition has spent a great deal of time going through it. Maria Garcia Berry
informed the Board that the Coalition will have a meeting with MPACT64 at
which time the Coalition will release the topline results that they think are
germane. She said the single most important thing that they are trying to
find out is what the tax appetite is in the State of Colorado. Maria Garcia
Berry commented that given the devastation that Amendment 66 went
through there is no appetite in the private sector for a tax campaign; this
means that the Coalition needs to understand how important transportation
is to the voters of the State of Colorado. Maria Garcia Berry reiterated that
the Coalition would give some preliminary topline results to MPACT64 that
could also be presented to the RTD Board at a later date. She stressed that
this is a private poll so the Coalition will not release the entire poll; they will
just release the critical information. She stated that if the private sector
indicates they do not have an appetite for this tax there will not be an
initiative in Colorado.
Director Folska asked what the process would look like if there was a
referendum from the Legislature. Marla Lien stated that if the Legislature
refers something to ballot there is no need for the petition process,
campaign, etc. as the item is on the ballot. She explained that this means
that someone in one of the chambers has to bring a bill with the ballot
language that is agreed upon by both chambers and then passed. Marla Lien
noted that it is a pretty daunting process either way. Director Folska also
wondered if any of RTD’s lobbyists or our Government Liaison Office had
approached anyone in the Transportation Committee of the State Legislature
about this measure. Marla Lien said that RTD has not suggested that we
would be the proponent of a State transportation tax.
Maria Garcia Berry stated that is it also important for the Board to keep in
mind that the Legislature would have to determine if this was an amendment
to the Colorado Constitution or if this was a referred law. She does not
believe RTD could get a 2/3 vote to go to ballot and amend the Constitution.
Maria Garcia Berry commented that Amendment 66 is a perfect example of
how this can get very confusing to voters. Director Folska stated that the
issues between education and transportation are very different so she is
cautious of compare the two; 80% of the population in Colorado does not
have children in school but everyone has to use the roads. Maria Garcia
Berry agreed that you cannot look at the education issue and say that you
cannot pass a tax in Colorado. She said that the biggest issue is

organizers to talk to the voters. Marla Lien commented that there is also no
will at the Legislature to bring this forward.

6.A

determining how important transportation is to the people of Colorado. She
stated that if it is not a priority the tax will not pass.
Director Lubow asked when the Coalition thought they might go to
MPACT64 with their top line. She thinks it would be great if the
presentation could be given to the RTD Board after that. Maria Garcia Berry
stated that assuming the polling was completed that evening they will be
presenting to MPACT64 on Friday, January 10, 2013.

B. Updates

• I-225 Rail Line Fitzsimons Alignment Update
Chuck Culig, I-225 Engineering Project Manager, reviewed a Power Point
presentation with the Board that is available in the January 7, 2014
FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.
Director Tobiassen mentioned that Directors Deadwyler, Folska and he pretty
much live and breathe this project every day since they live in the I-225
corridor. He thanked Cuck Culig and his entire team for the great job they
do. He informed the Board that the PI and Construction teams are out more
than twice a week briefing different organizations, committees, etc.
Director Tobiassen reiterated his thanks to the I-225 team for all their hard
work and great progress. He stated that it is no small task to keep everyone
informed about what is going on and he really appreciates what they are
doing.
Chair Sisk stated that it is incredible what has taken place; however, he
noticed that missing from the presentation was information about the
continuing of our conversation with the University of Colorado. He
commented that there were many questions brought up by the Board when
the decision was made to change the alignment. He hopes that RTD is
engaging with them on a regular basis because he believes it is critical for
them to be involved, especially in terms of the transportation they are
providing from the train to campus. General Manager Washington stated
that CU President Bruce Benson is thoroughly engaged in this project. He
shared with the Board that he met with Mr. Benson several times since the
new alignment was approved. General Manager Washington said that CU is

looking at preliminary information and data on the shuttle service and are
committed to providing it. He reiterated that CU is heavily involved from the
top down.

Committee Chair Hoy asked the following questions:
1) He noted there was a lot of controversy when the alignment change was
made because of the need to remain on-time and on-budget. He asked if
this has delayed the completion date. Chuck Culig stated that at this
time it has not.
2) He commented that the contractor is responsible for the land acquisition
for this project. He wondered if we are on schedule with acquisitions.
Chuck Culig stated that acquisitions are on schedule.
3) He asked if the flood plane would require a concrete land bridge. Chuck
Culig said no.
4) He commented that Chuck Culig said the background noise level was 50
decibels in the area. He asked how the additional 40 decibels from the
train would affect the background noise. Chuck Culig said that the noise
just disappears; it has no affect nor does it raise the level of background
noise.

C. Other Matters
General Manager Washington reminded the Board that several weeks ago he
informed them of the departure of Jim Starling, Project Manager for North Metro.
He said that since then RTD has gone through the recruitment and interview
process and has selected Ashland Vaughn to be the new North Metro Project
Manager. General Manager Washington shared with the Board that Ashland was
working on the Eagle P3 project and goes all the way back to T-Rex. He noted that
while Mr. Starling leaves big shoes to fill General Manager feels confident Mr.
Vaughn will be able to.
Committee Chair Hoy stated that he was glad to hear the position has been filled.
He recognized that a lot of consideration was given to the choice and shared that
he has heard great things about Mr. Vaughn.

Director Walker noted that in looking at the walkable area around Fitzsimons
Station it is easy to see how the street pattern can cut off people who could
be a 5 or 10 minute walk from the station. He thought it may be something
to look at how those people can make the connection since it is not beyond
the realm of a reasonable walk. Director Walker commented that he is also
not a fan of screening. He believes it is hard to maintain so he asked staff
to consider other options.

Committee Chair Walker turned the meeting over to Marla Lien, General Counsel, for a
brief update. Marla Lien informed the Board that earlier in the day the Denver District
Court had a preliminary injunction hearing over the lawsuit to stop House Bill 1272, which
provided sales and use tax parity between the State and RTD. The plaintiff had requested
there be a preliminary injunction which was denied. This means that the Department of
Revenue will now be collecting taxes per the new legislation. Marla Lien stressed that this
was just a preliminary injunction hearing; there may still be discovery and a trial but the
judge will be trying to do this in an accelerated fashion.

Terry Howerter asked Doug MacLeod, Manager of Financial Reporting, to
explain how the Government Accounting Standards Board’s (GASB) new
standards will affect RTD.
Doug MacLeod stated that GASB issued pronouncement 68 (GASB 68)
which applies to RTD’s financial reporting in fiscal year 2015. He explained
that GASB 68 requires governmental agencies with defined benefit pension
plans to report pension liabilities differently than current requirements;
currently, GASB requires RTD to report in its financial statement a liability
for its net pension obligation (NPO). An NPO is simply the amount to date
that has not been funded to meet pension obligations and assumes that
future payments to the pension will make up for the current or future
shortfalls. Doug MacLeod stated that GASB 68 will require RTD to report
the unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL) rather than the NPO. The
UAAL is the underfunded amount assuming the current payment and
investment returns continue and additional funds are not paid into the
pension to eliminate the shortfall.
Doug MacLeod explained that recording a liability in the financial statements
such as the UAAL has the effect of reducing the fund balance, which is the
amount of net assets available for RTD’s use. If RTD was to early adopt
that pronouncement in 2013 the current additional liability that we would
have to recognize is an additional $8.8 million dollars. Doug MacLeod noted
that this is a relatively small amount and staff believes RTD can absorb this
without a problem.
Director Folska asked what might be the origin of GASB 68. Doug MacLeod
stated that is has evolved from the fact that many defined benefits plans
have seen their UAALs increase at many cities, municipalities, etc. He
commented that the full liability owned was not shown under the old

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, reminded the Board that each year
they present an actuary report for the Salaried Employees’ Pension Trust.
He introduced Terry Bright of Rael and Letson, RTD’s Salaried Employees’
Pension Trust Actuaries and Benefit Consultants. He also recognized

standard so this was how the GASB is addressing the growing liabilities
being accurately reflected.

• Represented Employee Defined Benefit Pension Plan Update

Leslie Thompson reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is
available in the January 14, 2014 Financial Administration and Audit
Committee Agenda Packet. She stressed to the Board that Plan funding is in
peril; reforms have been enacted to reduce benefit accruals for new hires
and to improve the funding of the plan but projections are not enough to
ensure the plan will remain viable throughout the next 30 years.
Terry Howerter stated that RTD has an obligation to fund the pension plan at
the negotiated rates each year. He said that when RTD recognizes a
substantial liability for the unfunded portion of this plan RTD will wind up
with a deficit balance in our fund balance. Terry Howerter thinks this is an
accounting entry to recognize and comply with the GASB and auditor
requirements while the legal requirement is what RTD negotiated in the
collective bargaining agreement (CBA).
Director Hoy noted that while return on investments (ROI) of over 20% and
14% are impressive, it appears that there are different investment
strategies. Marla Lien explained that in each plan there are trustees. The
RTD Board of Directors appoints the trustees for the Salaried Pension Plan.
She said the Salaried Pension Trust hires investment advisors and firms to
invest the funds, and ultimately makes the investment decisions. Marla Lien
stated that the RTD/ATU Pension Trust has different trustees: three RTD
salaried members and three from the union. The RTD/ATU Pension Trust
hires its own, separate advisors and firms to invest funds. She said that this
Trust has made different choices over the years.
Director Folska asked for further information about Amendment 22 that was
referenced in the presentation. Marla Lien explained that Amendment 22
was adopted by the RTD/ATU Pension Trust that made changes for
participants hired on or after January 1, 2011.
Director Folska expressed concern having this unfunded liability on RTD’s
balance sheets. She wondered what impact this might have on RTD

(Howerter/Gabriel Roeder Smith)
Terry Howerter stated that staff wanted to review the RTD/ATU 1001
Pension Plan actuary report with the Board as pronouncements 67 and 68
will have some significant impacts on RTD’s financial reporting. He
introduced Leslie Thompson, Actuary from Gabriel Roder Smith & Company.

6.C

Director Lubow stated that this is not a pretty picture even if RTD is not
legally responsible. She thinks this unfunded liability does not look very
good for RTD. Director Lubow expressed concern that this will create the
appearance of fiscal irresponsibility on the part of RTD despite the fact that
RTD is not legally responsible. Terry Howerter believes the appearance of
this is big. He said that through negotiations staff came up with a short
term fix for this plan and now staff and the union have to take a close look
at this to come up with a long term plan. Terry Howerter explained that part
of the reason the Salaried Employees Pension Plan looks so good is because
the trustees had the foresight to put in place a Defined Contribution plan for
any employees starting after January 1, 2008; this limits the liability on the
Defined Benefits plan.
Director Lubow wonders what other entities are doing if they are coming up
with similar funding shortages. Marla Lien noted that this is being seen in
California and Detroit; however, this is an area of law that is just starting to
develop.
Director Lubow asked if the Union employees are aware of the funding
situation. She also wonders if information is shared between the two trusts.
Terry Howerter stated that while a 14% ROI in a year is very good the Union
side does a different mix of investments. For example, they are not as
invested in real estate as the Salaried Side. He said that staff would pull
together the actuary reports to provide a year-over-year comparison.
Director Bagley commented that last year was an incredible year in the
market. He believes both plans would be lucky to get a 7% ROI this year.
Director Bagley stressed that last year’s returns cannot be expected all the
time.
Chair Sisk thanked Leslie Thompson for her presentation. He believes it was
very sobering. He said that one solution might be to allow people to retire
early. He wonders if this is something available to employees. Chair Sisk
asked that this be something staff considers.
Director Menten reminded the Board that she voted no for the Collective
Bargaining Agreement because she thought it was clear that there were
some red flags in the pension. She asked Director Daly, as a former member
of ATU, what the Board can do to help the Union employees understand
their position. Director Daly does not think there is a lot the Board can do as
this is part of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. He said that the

Packet Pg. 20

will have a negative impact on RTD’s ability to get funding going forward.

members are aware of the situation but are not quite ready for a defined
contribution plan.

• November 2013 Monthly Financial Status Report (Howerter/MacLeod)
Terry Howerter noted that everything in green in the dashboard. Doug
MacLeod reviewed the November Monthly Financial Status report with the
Board that is available in the January 14, 2014 Financial Administration and
Audit Committee Agenda Packet.
Director Folska asked if staff has any concerns over a security breach with
our Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs) now that we are accepting credit and
debit cards. She also wondered what the cost is to RTD for accepting credit
and debit cards. Terry Howerter stated that RTD does not keep any credit
or debit card information locally. All information goes directly to Wells Fargo
and the Clearing House. He said that the fees RTD charged vary based on a
number of factors so he would put together the information and send it to
the Board.
Director Folska also asked if her understanding that the subsidy for paying
for parking was higher than it is for subsidizing the EcoPass. Bruce Abel,
Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said he believes Director
Folska is referencing a tax free employer transportation benefit program. He
said that at certain times the tax free benefit for parking is higher than for a
transit pass. He stated that he would need to confirm but he believes with
the October 1st reauthorization the benefit for parking was increased.
Director Hoy asked for a reminder where the $5.6 million in the FasTracks
Internal Savings Account (FISA) came from. Doug MacLeod said this came
from a portion of the Civic Center Air Rights sale; $2.5 million was set aside
for the Northwest Area Mobility Study and the remainder put in the FISA.

Committee Chair Walker asked if staff anticipated any policy changes or
future employment trends with the new Federal Reserve Chair that might
affect RTD. He also wondered if it would affect RTD’s ability to bond.
Terry Howerter stated that on the Federal Transit Administration side they
look at RTD’s cash flows in and out, net revenue coverage, ability to fund,
operate and maintain projects, etc. He said that to them a balance sheet
accrual would not have an impact on what they focus on. Terry Howerter
does not anticipate this affecting our ability to bond at all.

D. Other Matters
Director Tobiassen shared with the Board that he assisted people getting on the
light rail at Nine Mile on Sunday for the Broncos Game. He commended staff for
the new TVM displays. Director Tobiassen through they were much easier to use,
see, etc. He thanked staff for the upgrades and hard work.
Bruce Abel shared with the Board that for last Sunday’s Bronco’s game in excess of
20k attendees used our service out of a 70k capacity stadium.

B. Recommended Actions

• TMD Contract Amendment
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve an
amendment to the Transportation Management & Design, Inc. (TMD)
Contract 10DO024 to exercise the remaining two option periods and to
increase the contract amount by $215,368 from $384,682 to an new Not
to Exceed (NTE) total of $600,000. TMD provides service planning by task
order over a five year period and the anticipated NTE total dollar amount will
exceed the General Manager’s authority of $500,000 in 2014.
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the January 21, 2014 Board
meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
stated that this is really a housekeeping item. He explained
that Transportation Management & Design, Inc. (TMD) is a
task order on-call company that supplements RTD’s Service
Planning Department during one-time major restructuring.
Bruce Abel noted that RTD has done two Requests for
Proposals (RFPs) over the last 10 years and TMD was selected
both times. He explained that normally staff would not
exceed the General Manager’s signature authority of 500k but

Committee Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

• Purchase of up to 59 Buses for US 36 Bus Rapid Transit
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee,
to exercise the option of Contract 12FK002 with Motor Coach Industries
(MCI) for the purchase of up to 59, 45-foot heavy duty intercity buses to
replace the existing Neoplan intercity coaches at a price not to exceed
$35,036,000 and to authorize the use of existing COP proceeds to finance
the cost of such acquisition. Funding for 18 vehicles is provided in the 2014
FasTracks capital budget for the US 36 BRT project, and funding for the
remaining 41 vehicles will be provided through a budget transfer.
It is further recommended that the Board of Directors authorize transfers of
$9.351 million from the articulated bus replacement project and $14.996
million from the transit bus replacement project to cover the cost of the
remaining 41 vehicles. Funding for these projects will be restored in the
2014 Amended Budget.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the January 21, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Committee Chair Tobiassen asked if TMD does bus planning in
conjunction with rail planning. Bruce Abel stated that they will
assist with the reconfiguration of bus service to tie in with our
new rail lines.

6.D

Bruce Abel echoed Chair Sisk’s thanks. He informed the
Board that there have been some very substantive and
productive conversations as to how to approach the vehicles.
He stated that staff is recommending authorizing an
amendment with Motor Coach Industries (MCI) to acquire 59,
45-foot heavy duty intercity buses to replace the existing
Neoplan intercity coaches. He explained that the strategy
behind this is that Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) along the US 36
corridor is both express and all-stop service. This
recommendation comes from extensive analysis of vehicles,
surveys with customer, and extensive stakeholder workshops.
Bruce Abel said that staff would also like to move forward
with a continuing dialog with the industry to see if vehicles
that might not currently be available but are more desirable
may come online in the upcoming years. He explained that if
they do then RTD will issue an RFP; staff can then take these
MCIs and put them into regional service as part of our
continuing replacement schedules. Bruce Abel stressed that
the MCIs are the best match in terms of vehicles that are
currently on the market.
Director Folska asked what percentage of this purchase will be
funded by Certificates of Participation (COPS). She also
expressed concern about MCIs longevity in light of what
happened with DesignLine. Bruce Abel stated that the entire
acquisition will be financed through COPs. Terry Howerter,
Chief Financial Officer, informed the Board that in early 2013
staff took advantage of the low interest rates and borrowed
the money for these buses. Bruce Abel explained that MCI is
a very solid company with a long history in bus manufacturing.
He said that due to our history with MCI it is the expectation
that they will be around for quite some time.
Director Daly shared with the Board that when we first started
discussing BRT he had visions of articulated buses with lowPacket Pg. 26

Solution Executive Director Audrey DeBarros who came to the
meeting in support of this action. He stated that they have
been great in their collaboration with RTD in terms of making
efforts to seek common ground. He thanked them for all their
hard work and dedication. Chair Sisk noted there are some
issues remaining that everyone is working through so he will
be voting no but advocated for the rest of the Board to
overwhelmingly vote yes.

Director Lubow stated the she loves the fact that RTD staff
has worked so intensely with stakeholders. She inquired
about the status of a response to Boulder City Councilman
Macon Cowles regarding the bike capacity. Nadine Lee stated
that a formal response was sent to Sue Prant and forwarded
to Mr. Cowles.
Director Lubow said she still has the impression that there is
concern that there is a better bus than we are ending up with.
She noted that General Manager Washington told the Board
that RTD would be issuing a Request for Information. She
wonders if that could have been issued 8 months ago so RTD
would have all the information in time for this purchase. Dean
Shaklee, General Superintendent of Maintenance, stated that
there is not a better bus out there at this time; that is
something staff is hoping is developed in the future. He said
that staff is in contact with the major manufacturers on a
regular basis but they just do not have what we are looking for
right now. Nadine Lee, Project Manager for US 36,
commented that we do not want to go with an unproven
technology or company; it would take at least 4 years to
develop, test, manufacture, etc. Marla Lien also noted that if
we had done that we might be in the same position that we
are now with DesignLine.
Director Hoy thanked the stakeholders for coming to the
meeting. He thinks is shows a great deal of interest on their
part. He noted that RTD and the stakeholders have been
working on this a long time with a tremendous amount of
ongoing dialog. Director Hoy stated that he does not get a lot
of input from his constituents on very many things but in the
last week he has had many constituents encouraging him to
move forward with this action. He said for that reason he is
voting yes but does want staff to continue to explore the
possibilities.

floor and 4 doors. He noted there was even a tour and ride of
a New Flyer bus and he was very disappointed. He explained
that the bus did not have the power to climb the hill to get out
of Boulder. Director Daly said that this is not Bogota or
Shanghai; this is foothills country and we need the correct bus
for this type of corridor. He stated this is the correct but for
US 36.

6.D

Director Bagley stated that BRT is not like a street car, it is not
like a light rail and it is not like commuter rail. BRT has to be
related to the application. He noted that US 36 is a
specialized location and that is the number one factor when
determining the vehicle choice.

Director Folska wondered if we could increase the bike
capacity at the front of the bus. She also wondered about
the availability of B-Cycles. Dean Shaklee stated that we are
limited to two in the front; there are manufacturers that do
three but they do not meet FTA standards so MCI will not put
them on their buses. Nadine Lee stated that the B-Cycle
program is available in Denver and Boulder but not necessarily
at every stop.
Director Hoy commented that the buses that are being
discussed this evening are the same buses in the corridor now;
this bus does not hold fewer bikes than the present day buses
we are buying. He does not think the bike capacity affects
the Board’s decision tonight. He also noted that he’s been
along the corridor many times with 36 commuting solutions
and he does not believe anyone has been left behind because
there was not room for their bike. He thinks that the drivers
and the bikers get along great.
Director Anderson said she will be voting in favor of this
action. She complimented the staff and stakeholders for all
their hard working in getting to this point. She noted how
important it is for the Board to approve this action so RTD can
have an opening day with a complete bus fleet.

• Contract Amendment, Central Parking, Contract No. 13-DO-002

Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the January 21, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Errol Stevens, Manager of Parking Management, reviewed a
Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the
January 14, 2014 Operations and Customer Service
Committee Agenda Packet.
Director Daly asked what stations would be added for the
West Line. He commented that he rides the corridor
frequently and he does not see many of the parking facilities
anywhere near capacity. He believes adding the West Line
may be premature. Director Daly does not believe these
facilities should be added until the parking is full. He also does
not believe that many out-of-district people are riding the West
Line so RTD will not see a lot of revenue from adding it. Errol
Stevens said it would be Federal-Decatur, Sheridan,
Wadsworth, Oak and the Federal Center. He said that on the
West Line out-of-district usage has actually been much higher
than expected. Errol Stevens said that in the five years RTD
has done this program there has not been an issue where
there was a significant impact on ridership except with Pine
Junction.
Director Lasater stated that there is a great deal of confusion
as to who needs to pay and for what days. He believes the
signs need to be clear to eliminate this confusion. He wants
staff to work to make the signage better so things run more
smoothly. Errol Stevens said that there is room for
improvement and staff will be working with marketing on this.

Packet Pg. 29

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 14, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to amend the existing
contract with Central Parking to include the West Line parking facilities in
the contract, to extend the term of the contract through December 31,
2018, to change termination provisions, to modify financial arrangements, to
agree that RTD has an obligation to reimburse Central Parking for
unrecovered expenses at the end of the contract term, and to provide for
upgrade to smart pay stations and stationary cameras at selected facilities.

6.D

Director Folska asked how much Central Parking collects a
year and how much is remitted to RTD. She recommended
that RTD’s parking staff read three books: Signs, The High
Cost of Free Parking, and Sustainable Transportation. She
stated that she supports charging for parking but she believes
it needs to happen in a more thoughtful, seamless, integrated
approach. Director Folska requested that the issue of parking
fees be looked at in conjunction with the Fare Task Force.
Robin McIntosh, Senior Manager of Facilities, state that
currently RTD does not receive any funds from Central
Parking; RTD’s surplus is being used to accelerate paying off
equipment and start-up costs. Bruce Abel stated that staff
would look at parking during the Fare Task Force.
Director Rivera-Malpiede asked if there was any way that
when a person put in their license plate number the machine
could tell them if they were in- or out-of-District. Dave
Genova, Assistant General Manager of Planning, said that
while the machine may not tell them on the screen, it will be
connected to a database that will determine this and then
calculate their parking accordingly.
Chair Sisk stated that he could not agree more with Director
Lasater’s statement. He shared that he has heard many
complaints that RTD is heavy handed in debt collection. Chair
Sisk wondered why RTD was worrying about allowing Central
Parking to recover past operating deficiencies. Errol Stevens
stated that these deficiencies came early in the program while
all the details were still being worked out. He explained that
RTD never intended for Central Parking to lose money so staff
thought this was fair. Additionally, this is tied to reduction of
operating expenses and risk management so it benefits RTD as
well.
Director Hoy noted that the single biggest source of
complaints he hears are related to parking. He said in his
personal experience Central Parking is terrible at answering
phones but efficient in giving tickets. He hopes RTD can work

with them on the various issues related to customer service to
make this an even better program.

Committee Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED.

C. Updates

• May 2014 Service Plan
Bruce Abel reminded the Board that this is just an update so they are
informed about what will be presented for public comment. The Board will
be asked to approve the changes at a later date. He turned it over to Jessie
Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, to answer any
questions. Jessie Carter stated that the changes were outlined in the
January 14, 2014 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda
Packet.
Director Bagley asked for the patronage on the trips that were being
cancelled late in the evening, Monday through Thursday, on the D-Line.
Jessie Carter stated that the highest trip they had seen was 61 people.
Bruce Abel explained that one of the driving factors behind cancelling some
late night and early morning trips Monday through Thursday has to do with
expanding our timeframe for Maintenance-of-Way activities.
Director Menten shared with the Board that she has been receiving petitions
with no way possible to contact the petitioners. She wondered if other
Directors had been receiving this and if anyone had success in contacting
the people. Jessie Carter stated that staff had spoken with the originator of
the petition but not the others. He is not sure if some of the petitioners also
participated in our public hearing related to Denver Union Station. He noted
that due to feedback received at the public hearing staff has made changes
to reduce bus traffic on 18th as staff felt the public had a valid point.
Director Folska asked how many signatures a petition needs for RTD to take
action. Jessie Carter stated that it is not related to the number of signatures
but the subject of the petition. It is more important if they petitioners have
a valid point than a lot of signatures. Marla Lien stated that there is no

Director Daly asked why the 15L was being rerouted to have the FederalDecatur station as its terminus. Jessie Carter said this is the change he
referenced was made due to the public hearing comments related to 18th
Street. This changes reduces the number of buses going down 18th by
30%.
Committee Chair Tobiassen expressed concern that the changes to the 15L
could lead to overcrowding as this is one of the busiest routes RTD has. He
also asked for confirmation that we are not reducing early morning service
on the H-Line. Jessie Carter stated that this will really bring new customers
who would likely be riding only in the new service area so that is not a
concern. He said that we are reducing service around 1:00 a.m. but not
around 4:30-5:00 a.m. on the H-Line.

• Access-a-Ride 3rd Quarter Performance Report
Bruce Abel stated that the Access-a-Ride 3rd Quarter Report was included in
the January 14, 2014 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda
Packet. He asked if there were any questions.
Director Folska asked for an update on Global Transportation. She
wondered if RTD ever issued a statement regarding the owner’s guilty plea
to charges of failing to properly withhold taxes for employees. Bruce Abel
stated that Global’s contract with RTD’s expired on December 31, 2013. It
was extended through March 31 to allow time to transition to our two
contractors moving forward. He said that RTD is working to transition
Global’s workers to our other providers. Bruce Abel stated that the guilty
plea was not a surprise for RTD as we participated in the investigation as
the Board was advised several months ago. Scott Reed said that RTD has
not issued a statement because the issue has passed.

Director James reminded everyone that with the Free Metro Ride we were
forced to cutback service due to budget. He wonders if there is a dollar
amount associated with that cutback and if it really was cost effective.
Jessie Carter stated that it saved RTD have to purchase one vehicle for peak
hour service. He explained that additionally, if you look at 6 hours of service
at the local rate cost it would be about 50k annualized that RTD was saving.
Jessie Carter noted that there would be more to learn though once it was in
service.

Committee Chair Tobiassen thanked the entire Access-a-Ride staff. He
stated that he gets very few complaints and the few he gets are addressed
by the staff right away.

 Fare Task Force Update

Director Folska expressed that she is so glad staff is looking at this. She
believes the simplification and clarification will be very helpful. She
reiterated her hope that the Task Force will also include parking in the mix.
She stressed that it is very important for fares and parking to be
complimentary.
Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that she wants to make sure we address the
entire fare process for the working poor. She has been hearing that people
on the end of the West Line are unable to use it to get Downtown because it
is too expensive.

D. Other Matters
Director Rivera-Malpiede encouraged everyone to go to a new website,
mywaytogo.org. This is a website that was launched by DRCOG and the TMAs.
She said it is really amazing and they are trying to bring awareness to it.
Director Menten stated that she has received several phone calls from people who
applied to the Customer Panel but have not yet heard if they were selected. She
asked for an update on that process. Scott Reed said he would look into it.
Committee Chair Tobiassen noted that this was probably his last time as the
Operations and Customer Service Committee Chair. He thanked Bruce Abel for his
support. He said it had been a great pleasure working with the entire team.

to 59, 45-foot heavy duty intercity buses to replace the existing Neoplan intercity

Board Committee Assignments

He began by asking Director James about the Fiscal Sustainability Taskforce and if it
needs to exist as an ad hoc. Director James stated that as he understands it and per his
conversation with CFO Howerter, the committee has completed its mission. Staff will
plan to provide timely quarterly updates on the status of the recommendations so he
questions the need for this committee to exist as part of the Board committee
assignments. Several other Board members expressed their opinion. Director Folska
recommended that this committee gets integrated under the auspices of the F&AA
Committee. A letter should be sent out informing the TaskForce member of the
importance of the work from the fiscal sustainability committee and how this will be a
living document which we will be accountable for its success as part of a report out in our
F&AA committee.
Paula Perdue indicated that the charter for F&AA will need to be updated to reflect this
integration. Chair Sisk wants to make sure the importance of the work of the fiscal
sustainability taskforce is not lost or minimized.
The committee reviewed each of the standing committees and the outside committee
appointments. Chair Sisk will take the input under consideration and make a decision soon
on the committee assignments. A central goal is to grow the bench while maintaining
continuity among the committees.
IV.

Other Matters




Chair Sisk indicated that the Committee needs to give it some thought on how to
effectively handle public comments especially for frequent fliers. Director James
suggested that the Chair needs to set the tone in his introduction when he announces
the three minutes and suggest that speakers speak only to new information that may
need to be added on a matter versus repetitious speaking.
Chair Sisk noted that more and more cell phones are going off in the meeting which
can be distracting. He indicated this may be something we need to remind people of
while in the meeting. Director Tobiassen indicated that CML has protocols, etc., on
how local government should handle these types of things and suggested we should
obtain a copy. Paula Perdue indicated she is working with her counterpart for the CML
and will obtain this information. Committee members indicated that both the Boulder
Council and the City of Denver have such protocols and meeting decorum.

Michael commented that he was honored to be here. We have always had a good transit

V.

Public Participation


Peter Richard, Boulder Co, indicated that he has always been a transit advocate and
served as Eco pass coordinator for 15 years. He had observed that we have a
visibility problem on the back end of our bus which creates a traffic hazard
especially around the Broadway-University area. He recommended RTD put a color
scheme on the back of buses similar to fire units. He provided the Board members
with a picture of what he was recommending. He also suggested they do a pilot
project on this.
Chair Anderson stated the idea sounded interesting and asked staff to investigate.



Nghia Nguyen, RMR, stated that he was back again with lots of work to be done.
He acknowledged some progress had been made but stated RMR should not be
allowed to regress back to misclassification of wages or in compliance to DBE/SBE
requirements. He indicated they do plan to file a formal DBE/SBE compliant with
the City of Denver and RTD.



Sheila Lieder, Denver, stated she represented the Denver area Labor Federation
which represents about 50K people. They also represent thousands of rail workers.
They are very concerned with the federal wage violation as well as the issues with
DBE. She hopes that RTD will do better and help to enforce the laws affecting



Ricky Martinez, RMR reiterated some of his previous claims and asked that RTD not
have RMR on our job sites. They are bad news and one of the worse companies
that he has ever worked for.



Rima Sinclair spoke about the ads running on buses. She feels we need to
differentiate between free speech and hate messages which are racism. She feels
the ads are in violation of free speech and borders on hate. She spoke about how
ADL has denounced these ads; this is a fringe extremist group. She asked RTD to
(1.) Uphold free speech but do not support hate speech: targeting an ethnic group
is hate speech. (2). Do what Miami Dade Transit did: pull down the ads as
promoting bigotry and fueling discrimination. (3). San Francisco: similar ads came
up, and board distanced themselves and dedicated funds to go to study
discrimination.

Board Meeting Date: January 21, 2014

Subject:

TMD Contract Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to approve an amendment to the Transportation Management & Design,
Inc. (TMD) Contract 10DO024 to exercise the remaining two option periods and to increase the contract
amount by $215,368 from $384,682 to an new Not to Exceed (NTE) total of $600,000. TMD provides
service planning by task order over a five year period and the anticipated NTE total dollar amount will
exceed the General Manager’s authority of $500,000 in 2014.

BACKGROUND
Transportation Management & Design, Inc. (TMD) has been selected twice by Request for Proposal
(RFP) in the last 10 years to perform a variety of service planning studies for projects which require more
time or specific expertise than RTD Service Development staff has available. These projects have
included, for example, the Southeast and West Corridor preliminary service plans, the Union Station
operating plan, Boulder County services review, On-Time performance assessment/recommendations and
the DUS-Cherry Creek-Glendale service enhancement feasibility study.
DISCUSSION
The last tasks under this contract will be in 2014 for the development of preliminary service plans for
the Gold Line, I-225 and East corridors in preparation for their opening in 2016. RTD has found TMD’s
analysis and recommendations to be thorough and well documented, allowing RTD staff to propose the
needed changes in a timely and responsive process we would otherwise not be able to accomplish
expeditiously.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD has included funding for this action in the adopted 2014 operating budget
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager to approve the exercise of option with TDM and increase the
contract Not to Exceed (NTE) by $215,368.00. Individual task orders, each with a specific NTE
amount will be released for each project. The total Contract NTE amount will not exceed
$600,000.
2. Further modify the NTE increase. This is not recommended because it will delay the implementation
of these services.
3. Do not authorize the General Manager to exercise the option or to increase the NTE dollar amount
with TDM. This is not the recommended action because RTD would not have the opportunity to
continue with these important service-related studies.

Board Meeting Date: January 21, 2014

Subject:

Purchase of up to 59 Buses for US 36 Bus
Rapid Transit

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of Contract 12FK002 with Motor
Coach Industries (MCI) for the purchase of up to 59, 45-foot heavy duty intercity buses to replace the
existing Neoplan intercity coaches at a price not to exceed $35,036,000 and to authorize the use of
existing COP proceeds to finance the cost of such acquisition. Funding for 18 vehicles is provided in the
2014 FasTracks capital budget for the US 36 BRT project, and funding for the remaining 41 vehicles will
be provided through a budget transfer.
It is further recommended that the Board of Directors authorize transfers of $9.351 million from the
articulated bus replacement project and $14.996 million from the transit bus replacement project to
cover the cost of the remaining 41 vehicles. Funding for these projects will be restored in the 2014
Amended Budget.
BACKGROUND
The RTD Board of Directors approved the purchase of 48 MCI intercity buses on May 22, 2012 and six
(6) additional MCI buses on November 27, 2012 as replacements for the 1998 model year 1900 Series
MCI buses.
The procurement was the result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP) advertised on January 27, 2012.
Proposals were received on April 20, 2012, and MCI was determined the most responsive and
responsible proposer. The RFP allowed RTD to purchase additional MCI intercity buses for a five year
period with each successive year pricing being based on the initial base pricing plus a price adjustment
set by the US Department of Labor Producer Price Index (PPI).
DISCUSSION
In 2013, RTD staff conducted several vehicle workshops with the US 36 corridor stakeholders to
identify the most appropriate vehicle for use in the US 36 BRT service. This process included exercises
to define vehicle attributes that relate to desirable service characteristics, demonstration vehicle displays
and tours, and a survey of existing passengers and their vehicle preferences. Based on workshop
findings, observations of the demonstration vehicles, and the passenger survey results, RTD staff
recommends utilizing intercity buses for the BRT service due to their ability to provide the best
combination of power, speed, reliability, and ride quality. This recommendation is also consistent with
the vehicle preferences indicated by the passenger survey results.
US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) will use a dedicated fleet of 59 buses to operate high frequency, rapid
transit service between Denver Union Station and Table Mesa park-n-Ride in Boulder. Currently, RTD has
a fleet of 43 intercity coaches in revenue service for the “Route B”-series routes that will make up the
core of the future US 36 BRT operating plan. These vehicles are scheduled to be replaced as part of the

Packet Pg. 67

13.C

Board adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). In addition, 16 more buses will be needed to meet the
frequency and capacity requirements for the BRT. Revenue service is scheduled to begin in 2016.
RTD currently operates eighty-four (84) 2001 Model Year 2800 Series Neoplan buses. These buses
have exceeded their Federal Transit Administration (FTA) service life of 12 years or 500,000 miles. The
buses are approaching 13 years in age and have accumulated, on the average, over 600,000 miles of
service each. They require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. The bus manufacturer,
Neoplan Corporation, went out of business several years ago. Replacement parts are difficult to obtain,
and many of the parts are simply no longer available. The requested buses will replace many of the
aged and soon-to-be obsolete Neoplan buses and additional buses will be acquired to supplement the
existing fleet to meet the needs of the US 36 BRT operating plan.
RTD staff is making the recommendation to exercise the option on the MCI buses at this time due to the
standard 18-24 month lead time needed for the manufacture and delivery of new vehicles. Exercising
this option now will allow RTD to take delivery on the new vehicles in time for the US 36 BRT opening
day in 2016.
The MCI buses will be 45' long and have 57 passenger seats. The buses will be equipped with a
wheelchair lift and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance. The clean diesel engines
will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up to 90% from the level of the
existing buses. The buses will be equipped with the passenger counting system and the security digital
camera system per the current standard on all new RTD buses.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
In 2013, the District issued COPs to fund upcoming bus acquisitions, including the acquisition of the
buses for US 36 BRT service. Funding is available in the COP project funds to finance these vehicles.
RTD staff is requesting approval to exercise the purchase option for up to 59 intercity coach buses in an
amount not to exceed $35,036,000. The capital budget for these units was included in the 2016 SBP
and FasTracks Financial Plan with the expenditure of COP proceeds from Base and FasTracks to fund the
acquisition. The requested budget transfer will advance the funds for replacement of 41 Neoplan buses
into the 2014 Base budget. The amounts programmed in the 2014 budget for the purchase of
articulated buses and 40-foot transit buses will be transferred in the amount of $9,351,000 and
$14,996,000 respectively to the Base System intercity bus capital budget. This budget transfer from the
articulated buses and 40-foot transit buses will be restored in the 2014 amended budget process.
The acquisition of 18 additional vehicles needed for US 36 BRT service is included in the 2014
FasTracks capital budget for the US 36 BRT project. FasTracks will be funding a total of 18 vehicles
to cover the additional cost of branding the entire fleet of vehicles for US 36 BRT service.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, MCI has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA's approval of its DBE
plan.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of Contract
12FK002 with Motor Coach Industries (MCI) for the purchase of up to 59, 45-foot heavy duty
intercity buses to replace the existing Neoplan intercity coaches at a price not to exceed

replacement project to cover the cost of the remaining 41 vehicles. Funding for these projects
will be restored in the 2014 Amended Budget.
2.

Do not authorize the change order and re-solicit proposals. This is not recommended as it would
result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost to the
project.

Subject:

Contract
Amendment,
Contract No. 13-DO-002

Central

Parking,

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to amend the existing contract with Central Parking to include the West
Line parking facilities in the contract, to extend the term of the contract through December 31, 2018, to
change termination provisions, to modify financial arrangements, to agree that RTD has an obligation to
reimburse Central Parking for unrecovered expenses at the end of the contract term, and to provide for
upgrade to smart pay stations and stationary cameras at selected facilities.
BACKGROUND
The Board-approved Parking Management Program was implemented in 2009 under conditions enacted
by the Colorado State legislature that limited which patrons can be charged for parking to: (1) out-ofDistrict patrons every day; (2) in-District patrons after the first 24 hours; and (3) reserved parking in
exchange for a flat monthly fee. Approximately 15% of RTD parking patrons pay for parking.
The program was implemented with a public-private-partnership (P3) in order to avoid the necessity of
using RTD funds that were needed for the provision of transit services. Central Parking was selected
from submissions in response to a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) process. Under the contract,
Central Parking provides all operating expenses and infrastructure investments, collects all revenues,
recovers expenses and investments from revenues, retains 2.5% of Net Revenue and remits 97.5% of
Net Revenue to RTD. To date, RTD’s portion of Net Revenue has been applied to the recovery of the
original investment for start-up costs and equipment of approximately $890,100. The remaining balance
on the original investment for start-up costs and equipment is approximately $244,036.00.
In November of 2012, the Board authorized the inclusion of West Line parking facilities into the Parking
Management Program and approved an amendment to the existing Central Parking contract. During the
intervening time since then both RTD and Central Parking have worked diligently to reach agreement
upon and execute the amendment, but unexpected and unavoidable delays occurred and the amendment
has not been executed. Staff is bringing forward a revised contract amendment described in detail
below.
DISCUSSION
The parking management program required significant investment to implement which has nearly been
recovered. Current revenue exceeds $1,000,000 per year and as the result of negotiations we have
been able to reduce operating expenses by about 18%. These factors make it possible to make some
equipment upgrades to improve the system and the user experience. The upgrades include: (1)
replacement of the existing pay stations with new, more user-friendly pay stations that independently
identify out-of-District patron license plate numbers instead of relying upon patron selections; (2) install
stationary cameras where the majority of extended parking sessions occur, giving the program more
accurate control of entry, departure and dwell time; and (3) recover an estimated $1,300,000 in Net

Packet Pg. 70

13.D

Revenue for the RTD General Fund over the next 5 years while retiring all of the past and current
financial obligations.
The contract is a cost recovery contract meaning that all expenses are recovered from the parking
revenues. There were a number of months during the first 3 years in which Central Parking
accumulated operating deficits in the total amount of $355,100.00. The current contract language
does not provide a means by which to retroactively apply monthly surplus revenues to the recovery
of previous monthly losses. During negotiations, Central Parking sought a means by which to
recover these deficits. At the same time RTD sought substantial reductions in the annual cost of risk
management, which, in the parking industry is a significant annual operating cost. The outcome of
this negotiation is that the risk management cost has been reduced by approximately $400,000 over
5 years and the operating deficits will be recoverable by Central Parking.
The proposed Amendment to the Central Parking contract that will enable these initiatives is detailed
below:
1. Extend the term of the contract through 2018 with two, two-year extensions at RTD’s option.
2. Add the West Line parking facilities to the program, with the exception of the Jefferson County
Government Center-Golden Station which cannot be included in the program until the parking
usage level reaches 90% (by IGA with Jefferson County); and incorporate an equipment upgrade
plan that provides for the change out of pay stations at all 38 managed facilities, and for
installation of stationary cameras at 9 SkyRide served facilities (an estimated $1.1 million
investment).
3. Establish $7.69 as the fixed annual cost of risk management per space chargeable by Central
Parking to RTD (previously this cost exceeded$12.00 per space).
4. Eliminate the current termination clause in favor of Central Parking and establish RTD’s right to
terminate the contract at RTD’s convenience.
5. Authorize Central Parking to recover $355,100.00 in operating deficits as a last priority on a
monthly basis from revenues available after all other monthly operating expenses and scheduled
expenses have been covered.
6. As an incentive to maximize revenue and reduce operating expenses, after operating deficits have
been recovered, Central Parking’s management fee will be increased from 2.5% of Net Revenue
to 7.5% of Net Revenue.
7. At the end of the contract term, 2018, or later if extended at RTD’s option, RTD will be obligated
to pay for any unrecovered investments or losses incurred by Central Parking directly pursuant to
management of this contract.
8. Provide for an estimated $1,300,000 in Net Revenue to the RTD General Fund over the next 5
years.
If the contract is terminated under its terms and Central Parking’s original investments for start-up
costs and equipment costs have not been fully recovered by Central Parking from parking revenues,
RTD is obligated to pay those amounts to Central Parking that are deemed fair and reasonable. As of
January, 2014, the total of the unrecovered start-up and equipment costs is $244,036.00, having
been reduced from the original total of $890,100.00.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adoption of the recommended action will (1) reduce the risk of a financial obligation to the General Fund
by eliminating the only existing contractual provision that could allow Central Parking’s termination of

Packet Pg. 71

13.D

the contract before its term expires; and (2) result in an estimated $1,300,000 in Net Revenue to the
RTD General Fund over the next 5 years.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the recommended action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to amend the existing
contract with Central Parking to include the West Line parking facilities in the contract, to extend
the term of the contract through December 31, 2018, to change termination provisions, to
modify financial arrangements, to agree that RTD has an obligation to reimburse Central Parking
for unrecovered expenses at the end of the contract term, and to provide for upgrade to smart
pay stations and stationary cameras at selected facilities.
2. Do not adopt the recommended action. Instead, direct the staff to solicit proposals for the
management of the parking management program. This action is not recommended because it
would delay implementation of the program on the West Line and desirable equipment upgrades
to selected facilities and potentially result in an obligation to the General Fund.
3. Do not adopt the recommended action. Instead, take no action. This alternative is not
recommended because it would delay implementation of the program on the West Line and delay
the opportunity to upgrade equipment and realize the resulting revenue improvement.
