BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Paratransit Vehicle Procurement

November 15, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
November 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with Model 1 Commercial Vehicles, Inc., for the purchase of 19 paratransit vehicles at a price
of $149,047 each, for a total cost of $2,831,893 in 2024. The contract also contains options for the
purchase of up to an additional 231 paratransit and 53 FlexRide vehicles over a five-year period, for an
estimated not-to-exceed cost of $49,000,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The agency’s current paratransit vehicles entered service in 2014 and have traveled an average of
156,000 miles. These vehicles now require extensive maintenance to remain in service and are in dire
need of replacement.
At the time of the vehicles’ original purchase, the planned replacement date was 2019, in alignment
with the Federal Transit Administration’s useful life benchmark of five years for such vehicles.
Replacement of the vehicles was postponed due to service reductions related to impacts from the
COVID-19 pandemic as well as budgetary constraints.
The current paratransit vehicle fleet provides 90% of service using lift-equipped vehicles, while only
25% of paratransit customers require lift-equipped vehicles. The remaining 10% of the paratransit fleet
is comprised of sedans for ambulatory trips, which account for 75% of paratransit customer demand.
The procurement described herein is part of a holistic mid-range review of fleet size and mix within the
paratransit vehicle fleet. In 2023, the review includes the procurement described herein as well as the
retirement and disposal of 50 vehicles that have met their useful life. As part of this review process,
staff will also:
• Develop a detailed stakeholder engagement plan
• Analyze industry-specific risks, benefits, and standards to assess the ideal mix between liftequipped vehicles and sedans in order to be reflective of customer needs, and finally
• Develop vehicle fleet recommendations prior to the next anticipated procurement in 2027

Packet Pg. 3

1.D.1

DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Priorities of
Community Value and Customer Excellence.
On June 7, 2023, RTD issued a solicitation for the replacement of paratransit and FlexRide service
vehicles. Following the open solicitation period, one proposal was received from Model 1 Commercial
Vehicles, Inc., which formerly did business as Creative Bus Sales, Inc.
Vehicles procured under the contract will conform to the configuration developed, in cooperation with
members of the disability community, at the time of a prior paratransit vehicle procurement.
Each vehicle procured under the contract will be equipped with:
• An extended lift to accommodate large mobility devices
• A security camera system, which is agency-standard for all newly procured rubber-tire vehicles
• An upgraded suspension system to provide a higher level of comfort, addressing a prevalent
customer comment with regard to paratransit vehicles that are traditionally retrofitted, as there
are no original equipment manufacturers currently designing and manufacturing paratransit
vehicles in the United States
Paratransit vehicles will offer three access areas for mobility devices, in compliance with standards
promulgated under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Any FlexRide vehicles procured would
offer two such areas.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding is included in the Amended 2023 Budget for purchase of the initial 19 paratransit vehicles.
Funding for future contract years is contemplated in the Mid-Term Financial Plan and will be presented
for the Board’s consideration annually, as identified within each year’s respective budget. Currently the
project is funded at $23,849,900.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
January 2024 Service Change

November 15, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
November 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the January 2024 Service Changes as revised and summarized in
Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators impacted by these changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 (ATU), the January
2024 Service Change Proposal facilitates both an opportunity for RTD bus and rail operators to select
new work assignments and for Service Development staff to adjust the operations plan for RTD’s transit
network.
As stated in previous reports, staffing levels continue to be the primary challenge in increasing service
levels to match those identified in the System Optimization Plan (SOP). Considering the agency’s current
staffing levels and anticipated attrition, the January 2024 Service Change recommendations are
designed to have minimal impacts to staffing levels. The recommended changes to service are centered
on improving system performance and CBA compliance related to respite time.
DISCUSSION
The recommended service changes herein include a mix of service improvements and adjustments
centered on system maintenance. Adjustments to bus schedules are aimed at improving on-time
performance on services such as the 15/15L – East Colfax routes, which will see construction related to
the East Colfax Bus Rapid Transit project. Rail line schedule analyses are also recommended to address
system network connections and signal system delays experienced in the downtown Denver area. This
recommended service change includes schedule adjustments on over 20 routes/lines of service to
improve service reliability and network connectivity.

Packet Pg. 5

1.D.2

In alignment with Strategic Plan priorities, relating most directly to Customer Excellence, and recognizing
RTD’s workforce challenges, the proposals herein are directed at improving on-time performance,
maintaining compliance with the agency’s CBA with ATU.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on RTD service standards
• Effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit-dependent markets
• Availability of alternative services to affected riders
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the district and family of services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act objectives: benefits and services are provided without
regard to race, color or national origin; also, corrective and remedial action is taken to
prevent disparate impacts on low income and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
A summary of the service proposals is provided below, which are detailed in Attachment A.
Public Hearings Summary
Three public hearings were conducted:
• Monday, September 25, 2023, at noon (virtual)
