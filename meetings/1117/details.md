### B. Recommended Actions

There were no recommended actions.

#### 1. Government Relations Updates (State, Local, Federal)

State – Brandeberry-McKenna

Julie McKenna thanked the Board for allowing Brandeberry-McKenna to represent RTD.  They will support a bill carried by Senator Nancy Todd and Representative Kevin Priola.  They are working to help RTD increase the sales tax collection and streamline the process in collecting what RTD should be collecting.  They are working with the Department of Revenue to make sure that RTD is not over or under inclusive.  Another legislative initiative is to ensure that RTD is collecting taxes on items like soda pop and candy that the State collects tax on but RTD does not.

Director Bagley stated that he looks forward to working with Julie and Jennifer and thanked them for their past work.

Director Hoy asked if the tax collection is being done through the State Revenue Department or through the State Legislative Process.  Julie stated that they are working through the Department of Revenue in making sure that the citizens within RTD’s boundaries are paying the right taxes.  Director Hoy asked if the parity portion was going through the State Legislature and Julie stated that was correct.

Director Lasater stated that in a previous meeting with a past Director, the Director suggested self-collection for RTD.  He stated that Parker and Castle Rock entered into an Intergovernmental Agreement and began self-collection.  Between the two cities they found an additional $1.2 million and he encourages RTD to continue this process and hopes that RTD will be able to accomplish a similar ability which will help the agency better serve the community with the correct funding.

Julie expressed they appreciate the support from the Board.

Local – CRL Associates

Roger Sherman congratulated all the newly elected Board members as well as the newly elected Officers.  He stated that CRL has met with a number of county commissioners from Arapahoe, Boulder and other areas.  He also mentioned that there are some vacancies in different City Councils and they are continually tracking those vacancies and will keep the Board informed.  He said they continue to work with the Metro Mayors and other counties about long term transportation issues and how that ultimately helps RTD.

Director Deadwyler asked how large CRL’s staff is and how many are working on these initiatives.  Roger stated that they have 3 staff members from CRL working for RTD.  Director Deadwyler stated that she would like to see a report that includes the outcome of the meetings instead of just a list of meetings.  Roger responded that they are the liaison with the local officials.  They can provide a government relations plan that has the goals explained.  Director Deadwyler would like to see the plan but also would like to see what the results of those conversations are.  Roger stated that it allows them to have a better understanding of the elected officials’ point of view.

Federal – Patton-Boggs

Mike Dino also congratulated the newly elected Officers.  He stated that the team is doing what they need to do to represent RTD.  In Washington the Government delayed the sequestration which would have taken effect last week and reduced much of the budgeted amounts across federal agencies including defense.  They delayed sequestration because they raised revenue on those who make $400K and above per year.   He explained that most employees will see an increase on their FICA tax for Medicare and Social Security.  One of the positive things is that they increase the pre-tax dollars for transit benefits from $120 to $240; this will encourage businesses to invest in transit passes.  He also stated this is only a two month solution; they did not deal with debt ceiling.  By the end of March they will have to deal with the debt ceiling, the end of 2013 fiscal year since it has only been approved until the end of March, and the budget cuts.  Patton-Boggs is also working with RTD staff on final rule by the FTA related to ridership calculations and New Starts grants.
