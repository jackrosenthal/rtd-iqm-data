Results of Stakeholder Engagement
Initial project scope was to conduct a data driven evaluation process to identify 3 to 5 corridors that have
the highest potential to compete well for FTA Small Starts funding. Stakeholders requested that a regional
network of BRT be included in the study.
As a result of this stakeholder input:
• The study developed a proposed District-wide Regional BRT Network that could be phased in over
time
• The study worked to include language that assured stakeholders of RTD’s support of local agency
BRT investments across the district
Stakeholders requested evaluation of passenger miles of travel and reduced stop spacing to account for
the benefits afforded longer, regional routes that operate in less dense areas.
As a result of this stakeholder input:
• The Tier 2 modeling and evaluation were updated to include evaluation of passenger miles of travel
and reduced stop spacing

1.C.3.a

Results of Stakeholder Engagement
Stakeholders reviewed the proposed District-wide BRT network and suggested that it include all corridors
identified in NAMS rather than just those that were evaluated and appeared to be the highest
performers.
As a result of this stakeholder input:
• The proposed network was modified to include all NAMS corridors
Stakeholders reviewed the updated District-wide BRT network and expressed concern that the phasing
and the term “phase” could be detrimental to implementing corridors that were not identified in Phase 1.
As a result of this stakeholder input:
• The term “phase” was removed, and four phasing categories were changed to two
• The two categories reflect those corridors that are likely to compete better for FTA funds and those
that may have more success seeking local and state funding

Tier 4 Route Development
• This extensive level of analysis focuses on those corridors
that appear to have high potential to compete well for FTA
Small Starts funding
• Tier 4 analysis is necessary to test adherence to Small Starts
project justification criteria.
• Corridors that are not Federal funding candidates did not
require this level of analysis.
