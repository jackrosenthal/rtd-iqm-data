innovative approaches to delivering the program.

C. Motion to Resume from Executive Session into FasTracks Monitoring
Committee
Committee Chair Hoy resumed the FasTracks Monitoring Committee at 7:04 p.m.

D. Updates
General Manager Washington began by thanking staff, the evaluation teams
and stakeholders for working very long hours in evaluating the proposals
that RTD received. He noted that it took a lot of work and staff put
together an aggressive timeline for the evaluation teams but they came
through. General Manager Washington also thanked the four teams that
proposed on this solicitation, noting that all four are great teams made up of
great people with great ideas. He stated that the willingness of these teams
to respond to the Request for Proposal (RFP) and this agency on the North
Metro Corridor is truly appreciated.
General Manager Washington reviewed six key terms that he wanted to
ensure the Board and public understood as staff reviewed the process.
1) Best Value Proposal/Solicitation: all the criteria and everything in the
proposal is looked at and evaluated in terms of best value to the District
2) Lump Sum Fixed Price: the contractor has the burden to bring in the
contract at the stated price proposed
3) Best and Final Offer: after evaluation the two highest scoring proposers
are asked to give their best and final offer
4) Certificates of Participation (COPs): this is what is being used to finance
the project. RTD owns the right-of-way and this will be used as
collateral to finance the project. COPs can only be used if RTD owns the
asset
5) Regional Transportation Plan (RTP): RTD must submit an RTP to DRCOG
to show what projects we are planning to do and how we will pay for
those projects. The current RTP shows completing DUS to 72nd a long
way out. This schedule will be improved upon with staff’s
recommendation
6) Phase: staff broke the proposal into three phases
 Phase I: DUS to 72nd
 Phase II: 72nd to End of Line
 Phase III: all other extensions
General Manager Washington introduced Rick Clarke, Assistant General
Manager of Capital Programs, Gene Putman, Stakeholder Subcommittee
member, and Terry Howerter, Assistant General Manager of Finance &
Administration/CFO. They reviewed a Power Point presentation that is
available in the November 5, 2013 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda
Packet.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 5, 2013 5:00 PM (Committee Reports)

• North Metro Procurement Update

6.A

Gene Putman stated that the team’s evaluation goals were to:
1) Build entire North Metro Line
2) Ensure communities long-term vision
3) Meet North Metro EIS and ROD Commitments
4) Uphold communities needs expressed in IGAs
5) Continue to foster regional cooperation
6) Address communities comments on 31% plan
Gene Putman explained that these goals were only from the team’s
perspective. He said that everyone has been working long hours on the
IGAs. He is glad it is coming to an end because there have been so many
scenarios to work through.
Gene Putman said that the team initially thought it would be a hard decision
to come to a consensus; however, the team agreed that Graham, Balfour
Beatty, Hamon Contractors (GBBH) had the best proposal. He noted that it
was amazing that before today the team had not seen the actual rundown
that the Technical Subcommittee put together as their scenario was just like
the Technical Subcommittee. Gene Putman said that it took the team over
six hours of reviewing the pros and cons before they decided unanimously
that GBBH was number one and Kiewit was number two with those two
proposers being at the upper end. He reiterated that it was very similar to
what the Technical Subcommittee had. Gene Putman stated that GBBH’s
proposal demonstrated the ability to complete Phase I and II as well as go
beyond the end of the line which were key factors.
Gene Putman reiterated that GBBH was the unanimous preferred proposal by
the Stakeholder Subcommittee. He said the committee thought it contained
the most innovation, gave greater attention to details and recognized
individual stakeholder concerns and issue while developing sound
resolutions. Gene Putman noted that this was the only proposal to build
Phases I, II, III and additional scopes.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 5, 2013 5:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Gene Putman stated that the North Metro Corridor Stakeholder
Subcommittee spent a lot of time going over the RFP and each proposal. He
recognized Chris Cramer, Jeanne Shreve and Brook Svoboda who were on
the committee and present at the meeting; two members were unable to
attend due to previous commitments. Gene Putman noted there were many
times when the team was kicked out of the FasTracks offices because they
were so thorough in their review; this was something the team spent a lot of
time on, felt very strongly about, and wanted to help RTD as much as
possible.

6.A

General Manager Washington stated that staff is recommending that the first
phase of the North Metro line be built to 124th with the funding that is
currently available. He noted that building to 124th as the first phase
actually serves the majority of the projected ridership for the corridor. As
additional funds become available, RTD can exercise the option with the
contractor to complete the line to 164th. General Manager Washington
shared that he is encouraged that RTD can exercise that option prior to the
demobilization of the contractor. General Manager Washington stated that
the benefits of this recommended action are that it serves the majority of
projected ridership and also provides a firm price on the various extensions
should RTD realize the additional funds to be able to exercise the options at
a later date.
General Manager Washington read the recommended action as follows:
“It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors (“Board”) authorize the General Manager to award the
design/build contract and negotiate final terms with Graham, Balfour Beatty,
Hamon Contractors (GBBH) to serve as the Contractor for the North Metro
Rail Line Project. The Project consisting of the North Metro Rail Line from
Denver Union Station to 124th Avenue, which will be constructed for a lump
sum amount of US $343.3 million. Acceptance of this proposal would
complete the North Metro corridor to 124th Avenue with an option to extend
to 162nd Avenue as funds become available.”
Committee Chair Hoy thanked everyone for the presentation. He stated that
it is nice to see more of our FasTracks Operation being built; RTD hears from
both North and South constituents that they want to see the system built
and this is another step in the process.
Committee Chair Hoy noted that a Special FasTracks Monitoring Committee
will meet Thursday, November 14th, 2013 to discuss the recommendation
further. He informed the audience that there will be an opportunity for
public input which is unusual because it is a committee meeting.
Committee Chair Hoy recognized the people from GBBH who were in the
audience.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 5, 2013 5:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Hoy thanked the Stakeholder Subcommittee for their hard
work and diligence. He believes it is uncanny how their suggestion is
dovetailing in with RTD’s management and staff suggestion. General
Manager Washington also thanked Mr. Putman and the rest of the team. He
thinks the team was fantastic and did great work.

Director Folska stated that she is thrilled with the stakeholder participation in
the evaluation process. She values everything they have shared with RTD
and appreciates their feedback. Director Folska thinks it is interesting that
their assessment is in line with staff’s assessment. Director Folska asked
staff to explain positive train control (PTC) and how it affects RTD with the
North West. She also wondered if GBBH had any prior experience with
positive train control. Rick Clarke explained that in 2009 there was a bad
head on collision with a Metro Link train in LA and a Union Pacific Train. As
a result congress passed an act mandating PTC be instituted by 2015,
which the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) had been
recommending for years. He said PTC is a complex set of computers
monitoring train location, relaying it to the back office who is communicating
with the field to keep two trains from coming close to each other and
avoiding a collision. Rick Clarke explained that when congress mandated
PTC the technology was not available but now every railroad is scrambling
to get it done. He stated that the Technical Subcommittee was looking for a
team they felt confident could implement this system.
Director Folska asked if any consideration was given to the Northwest Area
Mobility (NAM) or Central Corridor Studies. She wondered if MPACT64 was
weighted into the decision making process with regards to funding
considerations. Director Folska also wondered how the potential yearly
decrease in RTD’s Full Funding Grand Agreement (FFGA) might affect this
proposal. Terry Howerter stated that the NAM and Central Corridor Studies
did not come into this RFP on the finance side. The Financial Subcommittee
evaluated cost, the strength and ability of the proposal to be delivered to
RTD, and the financial impact long term. Terry Howerter stated that staff
anticipates collecting the entire FFGA by the end of the grant term but in the
short term, if RTD continues to get a reduction staff would look to program
that into the overall cost for TABOR. General Manager Washington stated
that MPACT64 was not assumed. The proposers were directed not to
assume that RTD would go to ballot or that MPACT64 would happen.
Director Lubow noted that when we began this process staff was hopeful
that we would be able to build out the entire line. She wonders what
changed after getting the bids that they no longer think that will happen.
Terry Howerter said that after the proposals came in staff had a good feel
for the cost of the project. He explained that they used these proposed
costs to begin modeling to see how much RTD could borrow and stay within
our debt covenants. Based on the modeling staff determined that RTD could
spend around $500 million so from there staff could determine how far we
could go. Terry Howerter noted that staff also had to model in operating
costs; quite often these are overlooked but it is a huge piece of the
equation. He said that over the next 30 years RTD will be looking at over
$200 million in operating costs. Another critical aspect is the repayment of

Director Lubow commented that page 47 says that COPs can be used on
non-federally funded projects and projects where RTD owns the asset. She
wondered if both of those statements needed to be true or if this was an
‘or’ type situation. Director Lubow asked for confirmation that the plan for
the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) is to accrue the $300 million
and use it in 2030. Terry Howerter explained that when there is a federal
investment the Federal Government takes an interest in the asset; that asset
cannot be sold or disposed of until the end of the useful life. He said that
there are no grant funds on this line. RTD purchased the right-of-way so
since there is no other lien staff feels this is a great line for COPs. Terry
Howerter stated that Director Lubow is correct about the FISA; that is the
way it is modeled in the financial plan at this time.
Director Solano thanked the teams for all the work they did to put their
proposals together. He also thanked staff. Director Solano quoted Mother
Teresa: “Life is a dream. Realize it.”
Director Sisk seconded Director Solano’s appreciation. He feels Gene
Putman and the other stakeholders have done a great job. Director Sisk
asked for a presentation that outlines how this proposal might impact the
other lines. Director Sisk stated that RTD and the Board need to support all
of the projects to get FasTracks finished; that includes projects in both the
North and South.
Committee Chair Hoy pointed out that about one year ago there were
discussions about I-225 and how RTD could not afford to finish the line but
now it is being built. At that time General Manager said that staff was
going to move its focus to the North Metro. He said that based on where
we are today he is confident that staff will just move their focus to other
areas and RTD will continue to see progress; this is not an organization that
just sits around.

E. Recommended Actions

• Approval of Tenth Year (2014) Contract Amendment to Jacobs Engineering
for FasTracks Program Support Consulting
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the tenth
year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in the amount of
$23,462,562 for Program Support Services Consulting (PSC) for
FasTracks for the year 2014. Funds for the award are contained in the

debt. If RTD needs $500 million to build the line then RTD has to pay back
$500 million plus another $600 million in interest.

2014 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the
specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
Motion:

Director Sisk made the motion to move this item
to the full Board meeting on November 26th,
2013.

Discussion:

Rick Clarke explained that the initial multi-year contract was
approved by the Board in 2005; however, staff negotiates the
contracts each year because the flow of work changes. He
stated that these individuals are really an extension of the RTD
staff; they are used for their expertise in areas where it would
be difficult to hire a full-time employee. Rick Clarke stated
that this also helps minimize the challenges of placement for
RTD employees when many of the projects will end in 2014.

items forward to the full Board at the November
26th, 2013 Board meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director James expressed his support for voting on these
items together. He asked General Counsel if there would be
any issue with this type of vote. Marla Lien stated that since
the FasTracks Monitoring Committee was just voting to move
the items forward to the Board meeting this would be fine. If
the vote was all in favor these items would end up on
Unanimous Consent; if the vote passed but there was at least
one ‘no’ vote then each item would end up under
Recommended Actions.

B. Recommended Actions

• Federal Center TOD Pilot Resolution
Bill Sirois greeted the Board and reviewed the history of the Federal Center
TOD Pilot Resolution. Mr. Sirois explained that RTD initiated a process with
the City of Lakewood (Lakewood) and General Services Administration
(GSA) back in 2010 with a goal of looking at a comprehensive development
plan that would include RTD property at the Federal Center as well as GSA
property which GSA intended to dispose of for private development. The
area under consideration is the area north of RTD’s platform.
Mr. Sirois reported that the City of Lakewood has always intended to buy
this GSA property and they are currently in the process of negotiating terms.
The City of Lakewood would like to release a solicitation for a master
developer. Staff has worked extensively with Lakewood for almost a year
on this solicitation and will also be a part of the selection process. This
Resolution offers a way for RTD to show our commitment to the project for
Lakewood and the development community. Some of the highlights do
include the TOC concept and pilot program. Mr. Sirois shared that any

Packet Pg. 29

6.C

development deal negotiated would be brought before the Board for final
approval. The Board was not currently voting on a development deal but
rather voting on the concept of moving forward with getting a solicitation for
a master developer.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 26th,
2013 Board meeting.

Discussion:

Director Folska inquired if there was a master developer in
mind. Bill Sirois shared there have been discussions with
developers but that staff does not have a specific developer in
mind. Staff wants to go through RTD’s procurement process
to get the best candidate for the vision that both the City of
Lakewood and RTD have for the specific area.
Director Folska asked for clarification from Mr. Sirois when he
previously talked about federal monies. She questioned if he
was referring to FTA funds. Mr. Sirois confirmed that was
correct.
Director Folska noted that she does not have a problem with
the term TOC other than she thinks it should refer to
pedestrian oriented communities and would like the Board to
consider that moving forward.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

• Approval of Boundary Mapping Contract Option - Farnsworth Group
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
execute all documents necessary to exercise a two-year contract option to
Farnsworth Group for an extension of the existing boundary mapping
contract through 2015 in an amount not to exceed $70,900 in 2014 and

Packet Pg. 30

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 5, 2013 5:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

6.C

$72,700 for 2015 which would make the total contract amount, including
past year amounts, $438,700.
Motion:

Director Folska make the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 26th,
2013 Board meeting.

Discussion:

Bill Van Meter reviewed with the Board that in late
2009, RTD selected the Farnsworth Group to provide
boundary mapping services. As articulated in the
Board Report, some of the key things the Farnsworth
Group does are keep track of RTD’s district boundaries
to determine who should pay for parking and RTD sales
and use tax and with any redistricting or annexations.
Staff has found Farnsworth Group to be very
responsive, effective, and they were the lowest/best
value bidder at the time of their initial solicitation.
Staff recommends that the Board approve exercising
their 4th/5th option years; after those years RTD would
need to re-bid but staff is very pleased with their
services to date.

B. CAC Update
Hugh Wilson, Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Co-Chair, informed the Board
that the CAC met last night for a presentation done by RTD staff regarding the
North Metro proposal. He said that he wanted to share the CAC’s support of RTD
staff’s recommendation. Hugh Wilson congratulated RTD staff on a thorough and
inclusive process. He stated that the CAC is encouraged by the high level of
collaboration and stakeholder involvement which resulted in both RTD staff and the
stakeholder evaluation team independently reaching the same recommendation.
Hugh Wilson and the CAC commend RTD staff for seeking out innovations to
complete FasTracks as soon as possible. He provided the Board with a formal
letter from the Citizens Advisory Committee that is available in the November 14,
2013 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.

C. Public Participation - North Metro Line
Committee Chair Hoy read the following statement regarding public participation:
“As the Agenda states, we are now holding a special opportunity for public
participation concerning the North Metro Line. Normally committees like this don’t
have public comments; instead, we invite members of the public to provide
comments at full RTD Board meetings – not committee meetings - on RTD matters
that concern them, whether or not those matters are on the agenda.

6.D

So, we will ask you to limit your public comments to those subjects, because we
need to make sure everyone has time to talk about those issues and that we have
time to consider this issue tonight. Please save public comments on any other
topics for the next RTD Board meeting. Thank you.
With that understanding, I’m going to start calling on persons who have signed up
to provide public comments concerning the North Metro Line. “
Jack Hilbert, Douglas County Commissioner, thanked the Board for the opportunity
to speak. He shared that he comes to the Board wearing four hats: Douglas
County Commissioner, Vice-Chair for Denver Regional Council of Governments
(DRCOG) Board, I-25 TMA Chair and C-470 Corridor Coalition Chair. He believes
this is an incredible process that RTD has put together and a brilliant proposal.
Jack Hilbert feels this goes a long way in keeping the promise that RTD made to
the public when we had our election; it goes a long way to fulfilling that promise as
well as meeting an incredible transportation need for the North Metro corridor.
Jack Hilbert noted that he has been involved in transportation in this region for over
eight years. He stated that this is very exciting; the Board and staff should be
congratulated and very proud. He reiterated that this proposal as a whole is
excellent and he is looking forward to looking at all components; however, the
northern corridor is critical to regional connectivity and the timing could not be
better. Jack Hilbert stated that he highly recommends that the Board approve this
proposal and move forward.
Jim Gunning, Mayor of Lone Tree and Metro Mayor Caucus (MMC) Chair, said that
he has been a member of the MMC FasTracks Task Force for the last five years.
He thanked RTD for the opportunity to make public comments; he believes that
public comments are very important. Jim Gunning believes it is really noteworthy
that RTD continues to build out the system and exceed expectations. He thinks
building the North Line to 124th is tremendous. He said that this was fantastic
news to everyone in the metro area as the North Metro really needs transportation.
Jim Gunning shared that his partners that live in the North Metro have worked long
and hard on achieving that goal. He commended RTD Board and staff for
everything they have done to make that happen. Jim Gunning stated that he would
be remiss if he did not quickly get in a plug for the Southeast extension. He
commented that the Request for Proposal (RFP) process really gave the Southeast
confidence that RTD is trying to keep its commitment of finishing the system as a
Packet Pg. 35

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 14, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Tonight, however, because we want to provide additional opportunity for public
comment, we are having a special public participation session at this committee
meeting – limited to comments about the North Metro Line. In particular, we are
inviting comments from the public going to the merits of the recommended action
before this committee tonight: whether to forward from this FasTracks Monitoring
Committee to the RTD Board of Directors a recommendation for approval of a
contract award to Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors for the design and
construction of the North Metro Rail Line Project.

6.D

Erik Hansen, Adams County Commissioner and Chair of the North Area
Transportation Alliance (NATA), began by thanking Jack Hilbert and Jim Gunning;
the fact that they are here tonight speaking in support of this proposal says a lot
about regional cooperation. He has worked with them over the years and both
have been consistent in their massage that we need to move forward and get the
system done. Erik Hansen thanked the Board and other elected officials for looking
at the North Metro Line and making it a top priority. He noted that the North Metro
really needs transit and it will make a tremendous difference when that happens.
Erik Hansen shared that the North Metro Line has been on his mind for many years;
he has spent sleepless night thinking about this. Erik Hansen felt like he went
through the stages of grief over the North Metro Line: denial, anger, bargaining, and
acceptance. There was a time when he decided the line was not going to get done
which is why he is amazed and pleased that that is not going to be the case. He
noted that what is even more amazing is that it will be pretty much on time. Erik
Hansen read a letter to the Board from NATA that is available in the November 14,
2013 FasTracks Committee Agenda Packet.
Cary Kennedy, Denver Deputy Mayor, thanked the Board and other elected officials.
She stated that on behalf of Mayor Michael B. Hancock and his entire
administration, she is happy to be here to voice Denver’s support of this proposal.
Cary Kennedy said that building to 124th as a first phase makes complete sense.
She expressed that everyone on Mayor Hancock’s team is confident that RTD will
find a way to fund the rest of the line sooner rather than later. Cary Kennedy noted
that the City of Denver has a vested interest in all of the FasTracks projects being
completed because it is the integration of the whole system that will truly make an
interconnected, multi-modal transportation network for the entire region. She
stated that this line will not only drive economic development but also increase the
quality of life for all of our metro area residents and visitors; it will also continue to
make the region more globally competitive. Cary Kennedy commented that as
regional partners everyone has worked through many challenging issues and
celebrated many successes; collaborating to make the North Metro Line is among
those challenges and we are now on the cusp of realizing yet another mutual
success. She shared that during the evaluation process RTD incorporated a
stakeholder group that included a member of the City of Denver’s staff; Denver,
Commerce City, Northglenn, Thornton and Adams County were all at the table to
determine which proposal was best. The RTD staff and stakeholder evaluations
resulted in the same outcome that Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors
(GBBH) is the best overall proposal to expand to the North. Cary Kennedy stated
that this once again shows why our Denver Metro region is an example of regional
cooperation. She reiterated that on behalf of Mayor Hancock and the City of
Packet Pg. 36

whole. He thanked RTD for pursuing the New Starts grant as well as for the RFP
process and continued building in his area. He shared that as a corridor, the
Southeast always stands ready to partner with RTD to accelerate any build out that
they can. Jim Gunning reiterated that the Board and staff have done a tremendous
job in completing this system.

6.D

Denver she encourages the Board to move forward with this proposal from GBBH to
build the North Metro Rail Line.

Leonard Denigar, CU Sr. VP & Chief of Staff, read a letter from CU President Bruce
Benson in support of the GBBH proposal. Bruce Benson believes this proposal
provides a clear path for how to enhance our regional connectivity; it is important
that the whole region stay focused on the value that completing the FasTracks
program brings to everyone. This letter is available in the November 14, 2013
FasTracks Committee Agenda Packet.
Holli Riebel, Denver Metro Chamber (Chamber) COO, stated that the Chamber has
been a long supporter of FasTracks; in 2004 they put the first money into the
FasTracks campaign. She believes that to fulfill the promise to voters the system
must be finished. Holli Riebel noted that the economic development impact is
critical to the economy. Since 2004 FasTracks has injected over $2.8 billion in the
local economy, creating over 11,000 direct and indirect jobs. She said that the
Chamber applauds RTD for their innovation to complete the initial phase of the
North Metro Line as well as the commitment to completing the system. She stated
that for these reasons the Chamber recommends approval.
Mike Fitzgerald, Denver South EDP, commended General Manager Washington,
staff and the Board for the diligence, creativity, and can do attitude that has really
positioned the entire Front Range as a national model for transportation. He noted
that nothing that is being done in the region is as important as finishing FasTracks.
Mike Fitzgerald stated that he was encouraging the Board to support this proposal
and expedite the project. He reminded the Board that his organization served on
the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force so they were able to learn a lot about the
administration, finance, and operations of RTD as well as meet many of the staff
first hand. He shared that his organization was the group that initiated the idea of
T-Rex 15 years ago and have been ardent regional supporters of finishing this
complex system since then. He said that Denver South EDP supported the I-225
line, in 2010 they were the first and only business to commit to a .4% tax to finish
FasTracks, and they put up $500K for a campaign that never got going. He
reiterated that Denver South EDP is an ardent supporter and understands that the
system will not reach its full potential until it is done. Mike Fitzgerald shared that
Denver South EDP is concentrating on solving the last half mile issue as well as
completing the Lincoln extension. He stated that Denver South EDP’s
recommendation is to keep going.
Gene Putman, City of Thornton, explained that Mayor Williams and the City Council
send their regrets that they are unable to attend as they are out of town at a

Skip Noe, Aurora City Manager, shared that Mayor Hogan extends his apologies for
not being able to attend but he did want a letter read in support of the proposal as
well as his commitment to the completion of the entire FasTracks project. This
letter is available in the November 14, 2013 FasTracks Committee Agenda Packet.

conference; however, they wanted him to read a letter to the Board. He noted that
the letter that was passed out was not on small paper by heavy weight paper
because Thornton has been a strong supporter of FasTracks. Gene Putman shared
that when RTD projected the North Metro Line being completed in 2044, Thornton
was a little on the angry side but right now this is a happy time. He shared that
the letter states that Thornton is fully in support of the unanimous recommendation
of not only RTD staff but of the stakeholders group. Gene Putman said that one
council member even commented on how unique it is to have a unanimous vote.
He stated that Thornton also wants to work with RTD to finish the line as it was
originally approved by voters up to 162nd. Gene Putman encouraged the Board to
move forward with approving the GBBH proposal and said that Thornton will be
with RTD step-by-step until it gets done. This letter is available in the November
14, 2013 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.
Brook Svoboda, Northglenn Director of Planning and Development, explained that
Mayor Downing also apologizes for not being able to attend. He shared that
Northglenn was holding a special meeting for appointments that Mayor Downing
needed to attend. Brook Svoboda read a letter into the record on behalf of Mayor
Downing that is available in the November 14, 2013 FasTracks Monitoring
Committee Agenda Packet. Brook Svoboda noted that on a staff level as the
Director of Planning, he extended his thanks to the RTD staff. He believes it is
truly remarkable how much progress has been made in 18 months.
Michelle Halstead, Commerce City Director of Communications and Government
Affairs, shared that she was expressing support for the North Metro line. She read
a letter that is available in the November 14, 2013 FasTracks Monitoring
Committee Agenda Packet.
Brian McDonald, Charles Schwab, thanked the Board for the opportunity to speak.
He stated that the Southeast communities and businesses support the full build out
of FasTracks. He believes RTD has done an amazing job and shown great results in
what has been done so far. Brian McDonald stated that RTD’s leadership and
results have given Charles Schwab as an employer great confidence that RTD will
continue to do a great job. He also thanked the Board and RTD for continuing to
pursue the build out of the South East extension. He said that as an employer
Charles Schwab wants to emphasize how important the full build out of FasTracks
is to the company and its employees.
Don and Elaine Pohlman shared that they are residents of Thornton and live one
mile east of the planned 124th station location. They stated that there is a great
deal of congestion in this area already due to the many schools. They are
concerned about having 124th as the terminus for the North Metro Line due to the
additional congestion. They believe that 162nd is a better terminus as the highway
is better suited for lot of traffic. They hope that RTD will build the line to 162nd as
soon as possible.

Caitlin Quander, Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, stated that she is an attorney
representing Leroy Industrial, LLC that owns property along the proposed North
Metro Line. She explained that this property is unique as it contains a rail spur;
their tenet, Atlas Roofing, utilizes the rail spur on a regular basis. Caitlin Quander
shared that during several meetings with RTD it has been indicated that RTD may
take this land through right-of-way. She expressed that loss of the rail spur would
force Atlas Roofing to terminate their lease. She stated that while her client and
the tenet are open to work with RTD during construction it is their hope that RTD
will not take the land.
Karen Stuart, Smart Commute Metro North, shared that Smart Commute is a transit
management organization that serves the 13 communities that are close or adjacent
to I-25 north of I-70. Smart Commute is committed to providing information,
action and advocacy for transportation and transit improvements that increase
mobility options, reduce congestion and foster economic development and support
for our residents and businesses in the North Metro area. She stated that she was
speaking to the Board in support of RTD staff’s recommendation to move forward
with the proposal from GBBH to design and build the North Metro Line to 124th by
January, 2018. Karen Stuart applauded GBBH for early stakeholder outreach and
collaboration; they took the time to understand the stakeholder needs and listened
to their expectations. She thanked General Manager Washington and the staff for
their commitment to build the North Metro Line as part of the FasTracks system
that the North has been supporting since 2004. Karen Stuart also thanked the
Board of Directors for their leadership and consensus of purpose. She believes that
getting the North Metro Line to 124th is a great start. She thinks this will serve
many of the North Metro residents with a transit option that will help reduce the
congestion on I-25. Karen Stuart noted that the last two stations of the North
Metro Line, 144th and 162nd, will serve neighborhoods and employment centers that
currently have no transportation options of any kind. She encouraged RTD to find
funding to complete the line and benefit from GBBH’s agreement to hold the price
for these segments for 2 years. Karen Stuart commented that the North Metro
really appreciated the significant interest the RFP got from the private sector; they
feel encouraged that the remaining Northwest line will become an industry focus
next. Karen Stuart stated that with each step toward the goal of building
FasTracks in its entirety, RTD is fulfilling its promise for regional investment in a

Maureen Tarrant, Skyridge Medical Center, commended the Board for their efforts.
She has lived in Boston, New York, and Washington, D.C. so having public
transportation has been part of her every day existence. She believes it is a sign of
a great city. She noted that Skyridge Medical Center located in Lone Tree in the
hopes that someday RTD’s great progress would continue to the South. Maureen
Tarrant shared that every employee of Skyridge has an EcoPass. She stated that
they would love to have a station adjacent to their campus so that van service for
the last mile is no longer necessary. Maureen Tarrant thanked the Board for
continuing to support FasTracks throughout the metro area.

D. Recommended Actions
for the Design and Construction of the North Metro Rail Line Project
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors ("Board") authorize the General Manager to award the
design/build contract and negotiate final terms with Graham, Balfour Beatty,
Hamon Contractors (GBBH) to serve as the Contractor for the North Metro
Rail Line Project ("Project"). The Project consisting of the North Metro Rail
Line from Denver Union Station to 162nd Avenue with a Notice to Proceed to
124th Avenue, which will be constructed for a lump sum amount of US
$343.3 million. Acceptance of this proposal would complete the North
Metro corridor to 124th Avenue with options to extend to 162nd Avenue as
funds become available.
In addition, it is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors provide the General Manager or designee with
authority to enter into all contracts, and intergovernmental agreements for
the North Metro Project in the amount not to exceed the remaining project
budget to 124th Avenue of $633.8 million. This authority shall include the
ability to negotiate and execute all contracts; work orders; change orders
and contract modifications; and Intergovernmental Agreements that are
necessary or advisable to complete the North Metro Project to 162nd Avenue
within the scope of the North Metro Project budget and to accept grants or
other contributions and to increase the project budget in the amount of thirdparty contributions for project work. The General Manager will also be
granted authority to exercise the option to extend to 162nd Avenue and issue
a notice to proceed for that phase, should funding become available. This
option would be presented to the board through the annual budget
appropriation and with approval of financing provisions.
It is also recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors direct RTD staff to proceed with the submittal to the
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) of an amendment to the
2035 Regional Transportation Plan (2035 RTP) consistent with the Project
scope as described herein.
This contract provides major benefits to RTD, the FasTracks program and
the entire region.
 It demonstrates RTD’s commitment to the northern suburbs toward
completion of the FasTracks program.
 It provides a firm, fixed price commitment to complete a key part of the
FasTracks program. It also provides a fixed capital cost. The commitment
to this cost and scope is not likely to be available at a later time due to
time escalation of prices.

This proposal is consistent with the stated goals of the FasTracks
program to seek innovative approaches to delivering the program.
It is consistent with the RTD Board’s stated direction to the General
Manager (2013 GM Task Goal #1: Pursue collaborations and partnerships
with local, regional, state, and federal stakeholders; and Task Goal #2:
Actively and aggressively pursue all potential federal, state, local, private
sector, and other funding sources for FasTracks).
Completion of this North Metro Rail Line maximizes mobility for transit
dependents both temporary and long-term, to key job centers and
provides clean, safe, reliable, accessible and cost effective transportation
in keeping with RTD's overall mission.
The line provides access for northern residents to major employment
centers in downtown Denver and the Denver Tech Center.
The North Metro Rail Line connects Thornton, Northglenn, Commerce
City and parts of Adams County with all other rail lines via Denver Union
Station and provides regional connectivity to a major portion of the metro
area, including Denver International Airport.
Motion:

Director Solano made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 26, 2013
Board meeting.
Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Solano read the following statement regarding his
motion into the record:
“As you all probably know, when I was elected to the RTD
Board of Directors I was quite critical of how progress on the
North Metro Line had been slow and uncertain. The budget
issues confronting RTD at that time seemed insurmountable,
and it looked to us in the northern area like we had no choice
but to sit back and accept that we would not get our rail line
for many years. But we are now poised to change all that.
RTD staff, the RTD Board and all of our hard-working
stakeholders and elected officials continued to push forward
and seek innovative ways to move in a positive direction, and
we now have the North Metro Line contract proposal up for a
vote by the Board. This evening I am quite pleased to be able
to make the motion for RTD to move forward with
construction of the North Metro Rail Line by awarding this
contract. I am proudly supporting this item and I urge my
fellow Board members to do the same.”
General Manager Washington read the recommended action as
follows:

“It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors (“Board”) authorize the
General Manager to award the design/build contract and
negotiate final terms with Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon
Contractors (GBBH) to serve as the Contractor for the North
Metro Rail Line Project. The Project consisting of the North
Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to 124th Avenue,
which will be constructed for a lump sum amount of US
$343.3 million. Acceptance of this proposal would complete
the North Metro corridor to 124th Avenue with an option to
extend to 162nd Avenue as funds become available.”
General Manager Washington stated he wanted to read the
recommended action because that is what the Board and staff
are focused on; building the North Metro Rail Line from DUS to
124th with an option to extend to 162nd as funds become
available.
General Manager Washington noted that there had been some
questions from the Directors that he wanted to address.
1) Total Project Budget
General Manager Washington explained that the total
project budget is $633.8 million. This includes some prior
expenditures that RTD has made for the North Metro such
as purchasing extra vehicles, expanding the Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility, and purchasing Right-of-Way. He
stated that these items are included in the $633.8 million
cost to build the North Metro Line to 124th. General
Manager Washington noted that the $633.8 million also
includes the construction cost of $343 million that the
Board is being asked to approve tonight.
2) Repayment of Certificates of Participation (COPs)
General Manager Washington stated that the COPs will be
repaid from the .4% FasTracks Sales Tax revenue. This
will be a 30 year issue. He said that approximately $470
million will be needed for the construction fund to build out
the corridor.
3) Incremental Cost of North Metro to 124th of Operations
and Debt Service Over North Metro to 162nd
General Manager Washington said that staff is preparing
the comparison and will have it for the Board prior to the
November 26, 2013 Board Meeting.
4) Use of COPs on Additional Projects
General Manager Washington stated that COPs can be
used on other projects.

5) Extensions
General Manager Washington explained that the RFP asked
proposers to include pricing for all of the extensions. He
stated that while we may not have funds today the idea
was to get a price that would be good for two years. He
said that RTD does retain the option to put the extensions
back out for bid if we decide the prices are not good.
6) Fiber Optic Investments
General Manager Washington stated that we could do
some fiber optic investments along the North Metro Line to
help pay for DUS to 124th, 124th to end-of-line or anything
else in the FasTracks system.
7) DBE Participation
General Manager Washington said the contractors have
done very well on their DBE goals. He noted that one of
the primes, Balfour Beatty, actually doubled their DBE goal
on the West corridor. He stated that all of the primes have
committed to exceeding the project goals that were
outlined in the RFP.
8) Internal versus Bid Cost
General Manager Washington stated that the price given by
GBBH is within 3% of the internal estimates that were
prepared with the last annual program evaluation that was
done one year ago.
9) COPs and TABOR Debt Limit
General Manager Washington explained that COPs have no
impact on RTD’s TABOR limit.
10) Timing of Other Projects in Regional Transportation Plan
(RTP)
General Manager Washington noted that this project does
not have any impact on the timing of other projects
outlined in the RTP.
General Manager Washington commented that the Board had
been provided with a memo that breaks down the $633.8
million total project budget. He thanked the RTD staff for all
of their hard work. He noted that staff has been very
aggressively pushing this forward. He thanked the
Stakeholder Evaluation Committee for the yeomen’s work they
did; he also thanked all the elected officials and individual
stakeholders that came to speak to the Board.
Director Rivera-Malpiede thanked everyone that came to the
meeting. She said that one behalf of her constituents she is
thrilled to be supporting this recommended action.

Director Bagley commented that there is a reason this is called
the Regional Transportation District and that is because we
think regionally. He thanked the members from the Southern
part of the metro area that came out to support this
recommended action. He thinks this demonstrates that the
people in the South end are very interested in the entire
system; this is a supposed to be a regional system and it will
not be until much of it is completed. He believes the support
from the South if vital to completing FasTracks. He noted that
having an employer on the south end support this action
demonstrates that there is concern and willingness to make
sure this is a regional system. Director Bagley stated that he
is excited to be supporting this recommended action.
Director Daly believes the inclusiveness of the stakeholders
was brilliant. He hopes there is more stakeholder involvement
in future lines. Director Daly asked for clarification regarding
Atlas Roofing and Leroy Industries, LLC. He thought that we
were allowing one freight train per week to provide service
along the line. Jim Starling indicated that there was one
customer along the line, Atlas Roofing. He said we will need
to work to accommodate them through construction, but once
done the current agreement will allow for deliveries when RTD
is not running.
Director Solano stated that building North Metro to 124th as a
first phase makes it affordable for RTD to utilize our own
financing opportunities to get most of the project built now,
while continuing to find a way to fund the whole line up to
162nd. This also will serve most of the ridership of the corridor
as we continue to work toward completing the project to
162nd. He recognized that RTD has encouraged companies to
think outside the box and approach RTD with ideas to get
projects done sooner rather than later; we are now once again
reaping the benefits of that bold thinking. Director Solano

Director Lubow asked if the Board was only approving the
$343.3 million with this recommended action and then would
be approving the total project budget of $633.8 separately.
She also wondered if anything in the difference between
$343.3 and $633.8 was new or is it all things that have
already been approved or recommended. General Manager
Washington explained that in addition to approving the
construction budget of $343.3 million, this action also
authorizes the total project budget of $633.8 million.

Director Sisk shared that he appreciated very much the
involvement of stakeholders in this process. He stated that
many of the stakeholders had been working on this for such a
long time. He said that he was going to enthusiastically
support this action. Director Sisk commented that things
happen because of RTD staff taking the initiative; he shared
that he is proud to know them and be associated with them.
He noted that when the first financial plan was done in 2004
the estimate to build the North Metro Line from DUS to 162nd
was about $428 million while the expenditures getting to
124th and the Union Pacific Right-of-Way will actually be about
$700 million. He reminded the Board of questions they have
received of other lines, i.e. the Northwest, where people are
commenting that the line is more expensive than RTD first
said. He believes it is important for the Board to talk to
stakeholders and remind them that the figures were not set in
concrete in 2004. He feels this is a great opportunity to make
a significant improvement to the FasTracks system. Director
Sisk reiterated that he is going to enthusiastically support this
action. He said that he really appreciates the stakeholders
talking about wanting to complete the entire system as that is
why he is on the RTD Board.
Director Lasater noted the parallel of what RTD is doing today
and what the E-470 Board did years ago. He stated that it
was the same scenario of the south being built first and
everyone else wanting their portion finished. He said that
when they finally got the bonding capacity to build everything
it helped the economy, helped the flow of traffic in the area
and helped the flow of traffic to the airport. Director Lasater
thinks the Board is doing the same thing with RTD. He stated
that even though a Director is elected by their District,
everyone must look at this in a regional manner. He
commended RTD for what we are now able to do. Director
Lasater thinks it will be great when we are able to connect
north and south. He is very excited to see that as RTD and a
region we are able to make transportation in the metro area
more conducive.
Director James thanked staff for being creative in their efforts
to encourage the private sector to help RTD enhance mobility
in the area. He agrees with Directors Bagley and Lasater
about the importance of regionalism within the District. He
Packet Pg. 45

stated that tonight, we start down the path of progress that
will bring rail to our Northern area.

6.D

shared his motto of ‘Think Locally and Act Regionally’. He
believes this motto will benefit everyone. Director James
looks forward to working with all the Directors to enhance
mobility.

Director Folska thinks this is a very exciting time. She noted
that since discussing numbers in 2004 to actually getting this
line on the ground, things can change. She stated that thanks
to the vision and perseverance of General Manager
Washington and the staff we are able to move forward. She
will be voting in support of this recommendation on behalf of
her constituents.
Chair Anderson shared that she has worked on regional
transportation since before Guide the Ride but she said that
this recommendation is particularly satisfying because the RTD
staff found an innovative way to continue to build FasTracks
in light of all the setback of the past few years. She
commended the staff and General Manager Washington who
have all worked so hard to bring this action before the Board.
She also commended all of the regional governments who
have come out to support this wonderful occurrence. Chair
Anderson said she was very happy to vote in favor of this
recommendation. Chair Anderson recognized the work that
Committee Chair Hoy has done for the North Metro; he
stepped in when all of the Directors for the North Metro faded
away. She thanked him for the hard work he has done in this
corridor from the beginning.
Director Menten noted Chair’s request that Directors explain
why they are voting no on an item. She stated that she is
voting against this item for her constituents to restrict RTD’s
debt. She commented that there is a tremendous amount of
debt with this plan, nearly $600 million. Director Menten also
thinks that this is actually a violation of the taxpayer’s bill of
rights. She is concerned that RTD is already involved in a
lawsuit due to ignoring these regulations.
Committee Chair Hoy shared that when he was first elected
the heat was on; as Commissioner Hansen commented, people
thought they would never see the North Metro Line but now
he is one of our best supporters along with the other

B. Public Safety Update - Denver Police Chief - Robert White
Director Angie Rivera-Malpiede introduced Denver Police Chief Robert White and
Deputy Chief David Quinones who she invited to attend the evenings’ meeting
to talk to the Board about security around our stations. Director RiveraMalpiede commented that she and Director Deadwyler share district boundaries
at 30th and Downing. She felt that it would be a good idea to meet the
Denver’s Chief of Police and some of his staff, and to have them provide an
overview of how they work within our boundaries.
Chief White thanked the Board for inviting him and his staff to the Board
meeting. He noted that he was delighted to attend the meeting to share with
the Board some of the challenges and the importance of the partnership that we
have working with RTD. We have an ongoing relationship with Chief John
Tarbert, who hires many of Denver’s off-duty police officers. Those officers’
primary responsibility is to patrol the bus and light rail lines. In light of some of
the more recent events, specifically at 30th & Downing, he wanted the Board to
know that DPD reviews crime stats and calls for service every day. Relative to
violent crime for bus stops, Colfax and Broadway is the busiest stop. Relative
to overall crime 30th & Downing, 16th St Mall, 16 & Stout, 25 & Welton Street
are active lines for them. As the DPD looks at these statistics, they allocate
resources accordingly. Chief White turned the presentation over to Deputy Chief
Quinones to address particulars about some of the initiatives currently
underway.
Deputy Chief Quinones greeted the Board and noted that as Deputy Chief of
Operations, it is his responsibility to oversee all the operations of the police
department, the patrol units, detectives, and their support units. As Chief
White stated, Denver Police continuously work to reduce statistics with a
primary focus on transit routes because they recognize that they have had
issues on transit routes for many years. DPD has worked with the RTD security
teams, for example, on the 1400 block of Broadway. They made some
Packet Pg. 50

Deputy Chief Quinones shared that each week, Denver Police put their
commanders in the hot seat to have them explain their crime statistics. He
asked the commander in west Denver why they are not seeing the same crime
issues that are at some of the other light rail stops. The partnerships from the
design phase to the partnerships they are doing now with working with RTD
security have had positive impact, so they are trying to replicate those efforts in
other areas to add to the successes.
Regarding 30th & Downing, even though it is not the #1 crime light rail or bus
stop in the area, it has drawn a lot of attention lately because of the video that
hit the media. That particular light rail stop was recently transitioned from
District 6 to District 2, and is now under a new commander. This action brings
a fresh perspective, a fresh set of eyes to the situation. Denver Police are
working closely with John Tarbert and his team and our police will be getting
trained beginning next Tuesday, to cite for minor offenses, like fare evasion.
This is an important approach. For those of you that follow police work, if you
look back many years in New York, this approach helped police get crime under
control along the subways. They are enforcing the minor issues so we are
taking that approach. We are looking at things that have been found to work in
the past and we are trying to replicate successes using some of those same
principals. Chief Tarbert has people ride the light rail and certain bus lines.
Also, when time permits, Denver Police have officers who will take themselves
out of service, they will get on the rail at the Lakewood border, ride it down
into the next police district, and then they’ll ride back and return to service,
simply to provide visibility. A lot of times, visibility itself can prevent crimes.
It’s hard to measure how much crime it prevents, but we know it does. Denver
police focus on the stops. Certain routes will have more problems than others
like Colfax the Welton light rail. Then there are other stops that don’t cause
any problems so right now so they are looking at the whole big picture.
Chief White commented that if RTD staff felt it appropriate, as Deputy Chief
Quinones shared previously, every Thursday with rare exceptions, Denver Police
have a core meeting, which is a meeting about crime where the commanders
come in and we talk about crime, we use visual graphs so we can see where
crimes are occurring, showing patterns that are occurring, and we talk about
strategies, and obviously some of those strategies and crimes are around the
light rail system locations and around some of the bus stops. Chief White made
an open invitation to RTD Board members and staff to attend these meetings
which normally occur at 10:00 a.m. at Police Headquarters on the first floor in
the auditorium. Chief White committed to asking Chief Talbert to keep RTD
posted of any meeting changes.
Chief White asked if there were any questions.
Packet Pg. 51

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 19, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

environmental changes to the stops at that location to create a safer
environment. Deputy Chief Quinones reported that Denver Police even moved
one of the stops that helped tremendously in addressing some of the crime
issues. Denver Police do not just look at where there are problems; they look at
where there are successes and try to replicate those successes. A good
example is the Lakewood line.

6.E

Director Menten asked if Chief White could repeat the location and time of the
criminal meetings. Chief White would provide Chief Tarbert with the
information. He recommended calling first to ensure that the meeting for that
week was not changed or cancelled. Chief White and Deputy Chief Quinones
will leave business cards so that there phone numbers are available.

Deputy Chief Quinones stated that for example, if we look at light rail stops, the
way we measure crime is within either 150’ or 500’ of a location, so for light
rail stations, 16 & California, 16th & Stout, and 18th & California are all ahead of
30th and Downing in terms of crime activity. 30th and Downing is actually
number 4 on that list. If we look at bus stops, we look at 150’ occurrence
from a location; we’re back on the 16th Street Mall so Stout and 16th, Welton &
16th, Colfax and Broadway, and then we go out to 6200 block of Green Valley
Ranch and then we’re back on the mall at 16th & Market streets. Statistics
show a YTD date 2012 comparison to 2013, with a high of 79 crimes for the
number 1 crime location down to 25 crimes for the number 6 crime location.
Director Menten inquired if there would be a public document available to
support these statistics.
Deputy Chief Quinones replied that the data he shared was based on a request
he made for the data to bring and share with the RTD Board and staff
specifically for this meeting. However, Denver Police do have the capability to
pull information as needed, but do not want to stress the Data Analyses Unit
too much for outside agencies, but if we have an issue like the one at 30th &
Downing and want to pull history on a given location, we could request that
data.
Director Menten asked if she could have the copy that Deputy Chief Quinones
had brought with him for the meeting. Deputy Chief Quinones stated that he
would leave the information for Director Menten.
Director Menten asked to confirm that the range we use from a light rail station
is from 150 to 500 feet, bus stop only 150 feet away? Deputy Chief Quinones
replied that they pulled the data two different ways. The light rail stops we
pulled for within 500 feet and the bus stops we pulled for within 150 feet.
Director Lubow thanked Denver Police for making their presentation. She found
it very interesting fascinating to learn from their presentation that the West rail
line had some work done on it as it was being built in cooperation with police to
make it safer. Chief Quinones informed the Board that police use crime
prevention through environmental design. District 1 had some input with RTD
staff on some of the issues, such as fencing, lighting for existing buildings, new
builds, etc.

Director Menten commented that there was previous mention of other bus
stops where there is actually more activity and she wondered what examples
Denver Police have regarding these other bus stops.

Chief White noted that was one of the conversations that took place with the
District Commander. Looking at crime, Denver Police have been able to say to
Lakewood Police that they’ve been pretty successful as it relates to crime
around light rail system, so we’ve been able to ask what Lakewood is doing
that perhaps Denver can try to replicate at other locations. Police do that with
crime in general, looking at different neighborhood crime at different locations.
When police find that something is working in one area, police try to incorporate
that outcome in other areas. This is some of the discussion that occurs as a
part of the regular meetings we have each Thursday so police can monitor what
is working and try to replicate those productive strategies.
Director Lubow asked if Denver Police could share what some of those
productive strategies have been. She wondered where police have had
successes that you are thinking of trying at other locations like 30th & Downing.
Deputy Chief Quinones responded that in District 1, which is where the
Lakewood line runs, it runs along a bike path for a lot of parts of the line. So
the police district committed to providing a lot of bike patrols along the bike
path with frequent stops at the light rail stations. The officers, as noted
previously, will take themselves out of service, jump on the rail at Sheridan, ride
it all the way in and then ride it back. This provides a lot of visibility. If there is
graffiti, they jump on the graffiti right away to remove the graffiti. These may
not all be the same issues, different call loads at different parts of the city.
Some things may work one place and not another. The reason this popped up
on our radar, as Chief White alluded to, is because at one of our weekly
meetings we have maps that we look at that show hotspots. One of the things
that jumped out at us was the Lakewood’s light rail route had no hotspots. As
we noted this, we then had conversation about why police where not seeing
crime along this light rail area as we see in other rail areas. Police are putting a
lot of different efforts into 30th and Downing. It is not just the district; the gang
unit is also focusing a lot of attention there. We are doing numerous overtime
grants from various funding sources, specific to 30th & Downing. This area is a
concern to us and we are dedicating a great deal of resources to it.
Director Lasater questioned inter-jurisdictional cooperation, noting that he’s
seen situations where when core cities do active enforcement, the action
pushes the crime out. Director Lasater commented that RTD have a number of
municipalities and counties along the entire RTD District lines and he wondered
if police have shared or done any trending when they’re doing enforcement, to
track or report if activity is moving east, west, north or south; he wonders if we
work with other municipalities on this tracking.

Director Lubow shared her gratitude for the relationship between RTD and
Denver Police, noting that RTD is building out quite a lot and hopes that as we
continue to do so we will continue to work with and have collaboration with
Denver Police about ways to make our lines as safe as possible. In particular,
Director Lubow wondered if Denver Police discussions with Lakewood Police
gave some ideas to put into 30th and Downing that might help to make that
area safer.

Chief White responded that yes, police share inter-jurisdictional cooperation in a
variety of different ways. As the Chief of Police, he meets every month with all
the metro area Chiefs that are within a 100 mile area. Parts of our
conversations are about strategies. We share things that we’ve done that
might push crime in to another county, or things that police in another county
have done that might push crime in to the Denver area. At a more operational
level, Deputy Chief Quinones and his staff meets with individuals that are out
there doing the work, meeting with then on a regular basis and they have
conversations, especially as it relates to Aurora because that’s our largest
partner and probably the closest to us. We have ongoing conversations with
Aurora, Adams County, Jefferson County and other municipalities to make sure
that they are not infringing on our citizens and that we are not infringing on
their citizens. We all work on the same task forces addressing common issues
that impact all of us. Criminals don’t have any lines of demarcation; they go
where they feel they have opportunities.
Chief Tarbert reiterated what Chief White and Deputy Chief stated that police
do cooperate with everybody and with all the different agencies. Chief Tarbert
is on the metro chiefs meeting every month along with Chief White. Crime
Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) is our philosophy and always
has been at RTD. We deal with every agency where we have new construction
going through, not just police but fire departments too. It’s all part of a big
committee and we do all this stuff together all the time. At the Welton corridor,
security recently met with Commander Calo who is in charge of that district
now. Security has partnered with him and his impact teams. These are the
first teams we are going to train on fare enforcement and get them involved
doing the same things we are doing, but in a different way. We have already
reassigned all our plain clothes off-duty Denver police that work for us on a
daily basis to the Welton alignment to back them up.
Chief Tarbert commented that beyond that, security has community outreach
meetings. Security has gone to three so far in the last 2 weeks and we’ll
continue to do so as a partner with Denver and with other communities,
whether its Aurora or Lakewood. We do have contracts with Lakewood and
Aurora cops now working for us off-duty also. Chief Tarbert reported that he
started a bike team just about a month and a half ago on a security contract
which has twelve officers are out there, two at a time, 24-hours a day on bikes
that can be sent anywhere RTD operates. Right now they are riding in the
Welton Corridor quite often, but they do ride through Lakewood by the bike
path with starts in Denver but ends in Lakewood. They are making a significant
impact on finding a lot of bad guys because the bad guys don’t see or hear
them; it’s a little bit different than patrol cars. The partnerships are there, we
do as much as we can together, and if there’s another issue that rears its head,
we go after it, and that’s the best way to get it done.
Director Solano inquired if Denver Police are implementing new district lines at
30th & Downing.
Chief White responded yes, Denver has gone through reorganization within the
department, we are really intelligence driven. Every single day we look at
Packet Pg. 54

6.E

Director Solano questioned if Denver Police might have some inefficiencies
going on in the implementation process, such as planning, organizing, directing,
etc. He asked if there could there be a disconnect there.
Chief White reported that no, there are zero deficiencies. He reported that what
is going on there is some resistance to change, but there are zero deficiencies.
All the changes shared with you are a result of detailed analyses and the need
to go in that direction.
Director Solano commented that he though he heard earlier security are looking
at minor crimes, like fare jumpers, where people are trying to board the train
and ride for free. He wondered how that is working out in terms of trying to
alleviate other crimes being committed. Deputy Chief Quinones commented
that this is Chief Tarbert’s area, and that as mentioned previously, Chief Tarbert
will be training officers on how to issue those citations starting next week to
discourage them from being on the rail.
Chief Tarbert added that plain clothes Denver officers have made more arrests
doing plain clothes work doing fare enforcement, because that’s originally how
they contact the people, but we keep finding people that have warrants and
guns and drugs in their possession and they get arrested on the spot. This
action makes the public that is on the trains and also the operators feel more
comfortable because they see more bad guys being taken off in handcuffs.
Director Folska commended all the Chiefs and RTD security and thanked them
for all the hard work that goes into keeping our communities safe. She
mentioned that she attended, along with Director Tobiassen, the active shooting
seminar workshop that RTD Chief Tarbert offers for free. There were about 50
to 60 people in attendance at this class. It was a fantastic class; she really
appreciated the class and learned a lot. She reported that she is always
thinking wherever she is.
Director Folska shared that a concern at RTD as a Board has been partly due to
process. RTD’s communications department is incredibly on top of things but
she noted that one thing that caught the RTD Board members and staff off
guard is that recently, staff didn’t receive that information in a couple of
instances where our videos went to media before RTD staff where even
informed. Staff saw the events on Channel 9 news. Director Folska asked the
Denver Chiefs if they could address that issue.

crime, we look at various patters. We look at neighborhood integrity. It had
been 15-20 years since we had looked at those geographic boundaries and how
we allocated resources. Approximately 9 months ago, we determined we
needed to change the geographical areas, we went through a major
reorganization in an effort to put officers out when and where crime is
occurring. This is a significant change from how we’ve historically operated in
the area; a lot of things were previously managed based on seniority. We’ve
changed the days off and the district boundaries and we are also committed to
bringing integrity into the neighborhood.

6.E

Chief Tarbert addressed the phone application noting that he is currently trying
to reprogram a grant that he currently has to make sure that monies are used in
the best manner possible. One of the things we are looking at is a mobile smart
phone app that is free to the public that instantaneously contact our security
command center where you can send a photo, a video, you can text them, or
there is an extra button where you can instantly dial 911 immediately,
whichever they need to use if they are in the system. Chief Tarbert thinks this
type of mobile app is a great idea.
Chief White commented that as it relates to the video at 30th & Downing, he
just wanted to note that police maybe go to 400,000 calls a year and obviously
there are occasionally mistakes made along the way. We have to make a
decision on whether police are going to put out a video versus a crime alert. A
crime alert would be paper that would have very clear visual of the individuals
that are committing the crime, perhaps versus a video that has a lot of
information, shows the incident, but doesn’t clearly show the individuals that
are directly involved. To be candid, every single day we probably have
hundreds of videos from different incidents that occur. But when you look at
those videos, you see that there is really no benefit to the community because
it is not showing us anything that will help us make an arrest. If there’s
something that we think the community needs to be made aware of, we issue
out a paper crime alert and it will go out through the media. That video from
30th & Downing, in hindsight, probably would not have been released before a
crime alert. What was helpful as related to that case was to get a clear picture
of those individuals that had committed that particular crime; we were able to
get that as a result of other information that we received. The video did not
clearly address identity. There was a mistake on our part as it relates to that
and if in fact we were going to release the video it should have been released a
lot earlier than it had been. Chief White expounded that he thought he even
stated on TV that the video should have been released sooner. Denver Police
dropped the ball as it relates to the releasing of the video. More importantly,
the crime alert should have gone out even before the video because the crime
alert had much more detailed information.
Director Folska thanked Chief White for his explanation but noted that her
question has more to do with the process between Denver Police and RTD
Security. She commented that it is wonderful that police do all this great work
and that they put the information out there because it solves crimes, however;
she wondered about the process of sharing information between Denver Police
and RTD staff, and specifically about what may have changed or fell apart in
that regard, as it relates to the 30th & Downing incident.
Packet Pg. 56

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 19, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Secondly, Director Folska noted that perhaps in San Francisco the police
department is doing sort of a smart phone hotspot where you can know
instantly where clusters of crime might be being committed. She wondered if
Denver police know about that technology and what their opinion is of that type
of technology. Finally, Director Folska wondered if it would be useful for RTD
as a body to understand the things that security are doing on a quarterly basis,
such as the information about when you check for fare and end up making an
arrest on another matter.

Chief White reported that the instance can happen in one of two ways. An
incident could occur that would prompt Denver Police to request access to
video in an RTD location, or RTD could contact Denver Police advising us that
RTD staff have information for the police. That is the ongoing relationship that
we have. Sometimes other people might make a request for information and
Denver Police may not even be aware of that request. The process didn’t occur
in the manner it should have occurred, and it was Chief White’s opinion that
this was part of the problem as it relates to the video at 30th & Downing. He
noted that this is not something that occurs with any frequency. We do have
a process and is works very well. Normally, every time a crime occurs around a
location where RTD has a camera, our detectives will automatically contact
RTD and make a request to get video.
Director Folska thanked Chief White for his feedback and she acknowledged
how well the process normally works, noting that it works so well most of the
time that when the occasional one or two incidents occur outside the normal
process, it is a bit surprising to staff. Chief Tarbert reiterated that Denver
Police and RTD staff communicates all the time.
Director Daly inquired if there were any West corridor stations noted on that
list. Chief White responded that they didn’t notice any West line stations on
the list, but would leave the list for Director Daly to review.
Chair Anderson thanked Denver Police for being at the meeting this evening.
Chair Anderson was interested in getting a breakdown of crime statistics
between persons and property, and whether the victim/perpetrator is known to
each other, or if these crimes are random attacks.
Chief White replied that most of the crimes are property crimes, which is a
crime against property or theft. There are also some crimes against persons.
Chief White noted that the breakdown of this information would also be left for
RTD’s review. Chief White commented that the biggest challenge Denver
Police have as it relates to numbers is at the bus stop at Colfax & Broadway,
which is a major thoroughfare and the busiest intersection in the city as it
relates to violent crime at bus stops, it is the number 1 location. As it relates to
the rail system, it would probably be the 16th Street Mall. There are a lot of
other shops and activities located in this area so the crime on the 16th Street
Mall is not necessarily specific to the light rail stations. It could be related to
any number of things in the same area.
Chair Anderson noted that she was trying to find out regarding the crimes
against persons if the victim and perpetrator are known to each other or are
these attacks random.
Deputy Chief Quinones noted that it is all of the above. Some crimes are
random attacks on unsuspecting people. Some people walk down the street
holding their smart phone or tablet and they get just get assaulted for a
robbery. Some are known because maybe they are engaged in some activity
they shouldn’t be in and it doesn’t work. Some are between friends; it’s really

Director Deadwyler also wanted to thank the Denver Police for coming out
tonight and she apologized for missing the beginning part of their presentation.
Director Deadwyler noted that she would like to know more about the
redistricting boundaries for 30th & Downing as she stated the location is in her
district, District B, and there have been problems there for at least the last 40
years. What does redistricting mean?
Chief White reiterated his comments of earlier in the evening, that 30th &
Downing was in the 6th district and is now in the 2nd District. Every so often
most departments do or should look at their demographics, looking at
geographically how they allocate their resources. They look at where the
crimes are occurring, the types of crimes that occurring, the day of the week
they are occurring, if you look at the 6th district, which is a very very busy
district, you would determine to add more resources to that district are we need
to divide some of the challenges as it relates to this stats. As a result of that
internal audit, we moved that location to district 2, under the command of
Commander Calo. There is a litany of different strategies that we are trying to
utilize on this area. We are putting a significant amount of resources here as
compared to the past. We agree with you that there have been some really
unique challenges related to this area. We are utilizing a variety of different
strategies; we are adding a lot of resources. Time will tell how effective those
strategies are working.
Deputy Chief Quinones replied this question was answered previously for
Director Solano. The redistricting was something that hadn’t been done in at
least (28) years, we looked at the workload, the geographic makeup of the
district, we redistributed the workload and we redistributed the resources. As a
result in 2013, with 60 fewer officers on the department in 2013 than we had
in 2012, we had an increase of 41% of proactive police activity at 30th &
Downing alone. We see this all over the city. The productivity has virtually
doubled as a result of many of these changes that have been implemented since
Chief White arrived here in 2011. We are striving to be more efficient with the
limited resources we have to work with and we are seeing positive results from
these changes.
Chief White commented that for individuals that are saying that they are not
seeing a difference, he requested that staff have those individuals call him. He
welcomes hearing them and will put them in touch with the 2nd District
Commander, and will have him have a detailed conversation with you about
exactly what we have been doing, what we are currently doing and what we
still plan on doing as it relates to 30th & Downing.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 19, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

all over the board. Perpetrators are looking for people they can victimize easily
and escape from as quickly as possible. This is not unique to the Denver area.
Denver Police recently requested a report from the cops office in Washington
DC, which is community oriented police and symposium on street robberies
because we are finding street robberies are on a bit of an increase for us here.
When we look at street robberies and we look at locations where they might
occur, it is mass transit lines, entertainment districts and parking lots. This
activity is nationwide; it is not unique to Denver.

6.E

Chief White stated that he agreed 100%, and reiterated as he stated earlier that
as it relates to that specific incident; Denver Police could have managed that
particular situation much better. Chief White stated that Denver Police are
making changes to mitigate that issue to make sure it doesn’t occur again and
he advised Director Deadwyler that the police do put out crime alerts out on a
regular basis.
Director Deadwyler wondered how it was determined what information would
be shared with or release to RTD. Chief White responded that he didn’t’ know
how many different ways he could apologize as it relates to the incident at 30th
& Downing. Denver Police should have gotten out a crime alert much sooner,
and he noted that they dropped the ball as it relates to the timeliness in getting
that information out.
Director Deadwyler appreciated Chief White’s comments.
Director Rivera-Malpiede extended her deepest appreciation to Chief Tarbert,
Chief White and Deputy Chief Quinones, noting that she has worked with
Denver Police department longer than she cared to mention; however, she did
share that they are a great collaborator with the community. Director Malpiede
extended an invitation to any of the Board members to participate in District
Commander roundtable meetings and to be a viable part of the community. She
noted as citizens; we can do a ride along with patrol cars. Director Malpiede
shared that she has done that herself, just so she could understand how the
system works, what the call loads are like. There are a lot of proactive things
going on in our communities and there are things as Board members that we
can do.
General Manager Washington commended Chief White and noted that on behalf
of the RTD staff, we do appreciate Denver Police joining tonight’s meeting and
being our partner for these number of years. General Manager Washington
noted that Denver Police have been a great partner with our fare enforcement
generally and in helping us to manage crime in our areas.
Committee Chair Tobiassen echoed what General Manager Washington stated
and said that he and all the Board really appreciates the great cooperation

Packet Pg. 59

Director Deadwyler appreciated that and noted she would probably have some
suggestions. She asked Chief White if they could go back to talking about
process. Director Folska spoke about process and she wondered about what
we are doing especially as it relates to the two incidents that happened in that
area. We talk about the video cameras a lot and the concern is about being
proactive versus reactive. When video is held like that, it didn’t go well. My
question is why can’t we just put out a paper blurb so people will know they
need to be alert? A lot of people down there where really upset because they
didn’t know what was happening. In terms of process, this Board should be
notified first if it is happening on our property, we should always get this
information as quickly as possible.

between Denver Police and RTD. He looks forward to that continued
relationship in the future.
Chief White stated that the Denver Police is committed to continuing their
partnership with RTD and they understand the importance of working together.
Chief White made note that the Denver Police Department’s whole focus is
crime prevention, to keep crime from occurring. He stated that it is Denver
Police Department’s goal is to be in the very best position possible to provide
the best support to RTD and all of its districts and stations.

• Award Contract to Purchase Video Event Recorders for Bus Safe Driving
Management
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
award the contract to SmartDrive Systems of San Diego, CA, for the
purchase of up to 600 event recorder systems and five (5) years of managed
services to host and review data, provide event management in web
application and produce driving behavior reports to allow coaching of drivers
on safe driving and accident reduction.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 26, 2013
Board meeting.
Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel gave background that the event recorder system
is a system that staff have demonstrated at several of our
operating locations over the past several years. An event
recorder is a system whereby we have cameras placed in
the vehicles that look both outward and inward, the
cameras are connected in to a computer system, they are
triggered by G-Force so that when any sudden event
occurs, it will trigger the recorder to record for 15-20
seconds either side of the event, so something like a
sudden stop or an accident, the recorder would be
activated. The operator can also trigger the recorder. We
have found this to be a very effective coaching tool it
provides improved security and safety. We were very
pleased with the demonstrations. We put out RFP’s and we
received proposals from the firms that we are aware of in
this business. Tonight we request Board approval to move
forward with the acquisition.

Director Daly noted that he thought the privates do have
the recorders but wondered that RTD do not have any of
the recorders. Bruce Abel reported that Director Daly was
correct. The privates began deploying the recorders several
years ago. It’s something we’ve been working through the
strategic budget process and we have been successful in
identifying funds through the long range budgeting process
and funds are available now so we are requesting
authorization to move forward with this acquisition. Staff
found the recorders to be a very effective coaching tool,
both for operators and managerial staff.
Director Tobiassen mentioned that he did get to see the
recorders demonstrated out at the East Metro garage and
he shared that he considers the recorders to be an
extremely effective tool; they are good for the drivers, and
they protect the drivers, acting as a witness when things do
happen. It also allows management to counsel drivers
when they might have some risky behaviors. Supervisors
are getting reports next morning to address prior day
activities; these recorders work quite well, almost in real
time, and Director Tobiassen is happy to see them.
Director Deadwyler noted that she was looking at the table
and she was wondering how many buses RTD have. Bruce
Abel replied that we have a fleet of approximately 1025;
the private fleet has already been equipped through the
private contractors. The RTD fleet is approximately 600ish.

Director Solano inquired where the cameras would be
installed. Bruce Abel replied that the recorders would be
located on every bus.

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
enter into contracts for the provision of Access-a-Ride services using
dedicated (RTD owned) vehicles with MV Transportation, Horizon Coach
Lines, and Via Mobility Services. These contracts are for three years, with
two one-year options for a 5-year, with a cumulative not-to-exceed cost of
$145,700,972 for Access-a-Ride service and $28,125,117 for Access-aRide fuel, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $173,826,089. The contract
amounts by service provider are as follows:
MV Transportation $66,279,862 for service, $14,062,559 for fuel, for a total not-to-exceed
amount of $80,342,421; Horizon Coach Lines - $42,484,584 for service,
$7,031,279 for fuel, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $49,515,863; and
Via Mobility Services - $36,936,526 for service, $7,031,279 for fuel, for a
total not-to-exceed amount of $43,967,805.
The committee further
recommends that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or
his designee, to enter into a contract for the provision of Access-a-Ride
services with non-dedicated (contractor provided) vehicles with Veolia
Transportation on Demand. This contract is for three years, with two oneyear options for a total 5-year, not-to-exceed amount of $9,811,727. Fuel
for this contract is included in the total contract price. These proposals
represent the most responsive and responsible proposals received in
response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-DH-035, to provide Access-aRide Services.
Motion:

Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the November
26, 2013 Board meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel commented that as the Board is aware, accessa-Ride is our complementary paratransit service for
individuals with disabilities as mandated by the ADA. RTD
have been providing this access-a-Ride service since
approximately 1994. In our current model, we have a
number of contractors engaged to provide the service. First
Transit is our call center contractor, they take the calls from
our customers and they do the reservation schedule and
they provide the manifest and send these out to service
providers. We currently have 4 service providers under
contract to maintain and operate the vehicles to provide the
service itself. Those 4 contractors are:
MV Transportation, providing approximately 50% of our
service hours; VIA (previously known as Special Transit)

The contracts expire at the end of the year and RTD put out
an RFP providing opportunities for people to bid on either
half, a quarter, or a sixth of our service. This allows RTD
staff to evaluate the proposals and the costs to determine
what is the most cost effective packaging for the provision
of these services in terms of cost of serviced for RTD. Back
in the early years when the program was smaller, RTD had
only a single provider; subsequently that single provider
experienced some internal failures placing RTD in a bad
position and so since that time have employed a multiple
service provider model so that we always have a backup in
place should one of our providers experience difficulties.
The move from 5 providers to 4 providers 6 years ago
provided a more cost effective model. We were paying less
overhead, fewer management teams, and fewer facilities.
With the result of this procurement, we see that moving
from 4 providers to 3 providers will save RTD between $4.5
and $5 million. Our recommendation is to move forward
with 3 providers instead of 4 provider efficiencies paying
for fewer facilities and fewer management teams while still
providing the redundancy, the backups and safety nets in
terms of the provisions of service.
Director Folska wondered if RTD have been able to maintain
costs to provide the paratransit service, whether costs have
increased or if they have stayed the same.
Bruce Abel reported that costs continue to increase. Staff
has been able to slow the rate of growth, but growth does
continue and costs increase accordingly.
Director Folska inquired if Global Transportation has gone
away. Bruce Abel responded that Global will continue to be
a service provider until the end of this contract. Staff will
have a transition from 4 providers to 3 providers. Global did
not provide a proposal on the 25% alternative. Our cost
analysis showed that 3 providers with 50, 25 and 25% was
more cost effective than having more providers doing less
each. Global did not propose a 25% option.

Transportation is also providing approximately 1/6th of our
service hours; and Horizon Transportation providing
approximately 1/6th of our service hours.

Bruce Abel explained that Access-a-Cab is RTD’s paratransit
service. This service is what we refer to as cutaway
vehicles that carry about 14 people. Regarding Paratransit,
another acronym is demand response transportation. Bruce
Abel shared that staff really work in two worlds, one which
we call fixed route-fixed schedule; these are the big buses
that operate along pre-determined routes according to predetermined schedules. Paratransit service is where an
individual calls up and requests a ride and the ride is
scheduled is to pick them up at their curb at their arranged
time. A separate trip is scheduled for their return home.
Bruce Abel noted that when he refers to Access-a-Cab, that
is a complementary program, a user side subsidy program
where individuals who are certified to use Access-a-Cab,
(because it is a program for people with disabilities) they
can, if they choose, use a cab instead of the paratransit
service. They can call up and request a cab ride. These
riders pay the first $2, RTD pays the next $12, and the
customer pays anything over a $14 fare.
Director Folska then asked Bruce Abel to confirm if what
staff were really looking at was a cost to RTD of either $12
or $50 something. Bruce Abel confirmed that RTD are up
in 50’s for the paratransit service and the third component
that is part of this motion is what is referred to as nondedicated service, with Veolia Transportation On-Demand
(which is the owner of yellow cab) to provide cab service,
not as a user side subsidy, but on a contract basis so that
there is a flat fee and we would us the cabs to supplement
the core service so that we can meet the peaks and valleys
in a more cost effective way than having a vehicle sitting
out there when there is no one scheduled to use it.

Director Folska asked Bruce Abel if he could please provide
a review of what paratransit means. She noted that there
was a prior recommendation which referenced “not to
exceed” on certain cost amounts; she thought this
pertained to fuel. Director Folska wondered if this service is
mandatory complementary paratransit service, what the
consequences are. Director Folska asked for a description
of paratransit, Access-a-Cab and Access-a-Ride so everyone
is all on the same page.

Director Folska thanked Bruce Abel but did want to return
to the issue if they exceed the gas costs. Bruce Abel
replied that staff monitors these costs continually and
report back to the Board monthly and staff have indeed
slowed the rate of growth over the years, such that we’ve
come in under budget every year for about the past 4-5
years. Bruce Abel commented that if staff sees something
in the community where growth is exceeding staffs
projection, staff would come back during the budget
amendment process because the ADA does require that we
have a zero denial approach to the provision of service.
Director Deadwyler wondered with regard to fuel, if our
contractors operate on the same fuel rate as RTD, or do
they have to find their own fuel rates with their own
contracts.
Bruce Abel explained that contractors do not get the same
rates as RTD. On the fixed route side, we contract for
diesel fuel and that contract does include our fixed route
service contractors. On the paratransit world, Bruce Abel
shared that there are different levels of sophistication; some
contractors buy fuel at the pump because they are smaller;
some have their own facilities such that they can have fuel
delivered to them. Due to the nature of differences in size
and scale of the operations, not all of them have their own
fueling capacity on site. We reimburse their fuel expense,
but they do not participate in any contracts with RTD.
Director Deadwyler questioned that since we reimburse
their fuel, would it not be cheaper if they purchased their
fuel from RTD, or if RTD expanded our contract to include
access-a-Ride vehicles. Bruce Abel responded that RTD do
not even have a fuel contract. Staff competitively procure
our diesel and have a far more limited procurement of
gasoline, but again, the real bottleneck is that not all the
providers have capacity to have fuel to be delivered to
them because they are a smaller scale operation and do not
have the facilities to receive bulk fuel.
Director Deadwyler asked if the contractors could come to
RTD and fill up and Bruce Abel shared that contractors
cannot get their gasoline or diesel directly from RTD

because of tax implications. RTD is allowed to purchase
tax-free fuel, contractors for the paratransit services are
not.

Bruce Abel confirmed that the vehicles are owned by RTD
and leased out to the contractors to perform services on
behalf of RTD; the vehicles use gasoline fuel. Director
Solano also wondered about who pays for the maintenance
on the leased vehicles. Bruce Abel explained that
maintenance is part of the contract. The contractor pays
for the maintenance and it is part of their bid price to RTD.
Director Sisk asked for clarification on the contractor
percentages stating that RTD have 50% going to MV
Transportation, 25% to Horizon and 25% to Via Mobility,
but in fact Via Mobility service is about $5.5 million less
than Horizon? Bruce Abel confirmed that was true.
Director Sisk noted that would mean that Via Mobility is
providing the same service as Horizon for $5.5 million less
than Horizon; Bruce Abel confirmed this was true and
stated this was part of the procurement process. Staff
requests that contractors provide RTD their bids to provide
service and there are a variety of reasons underlying why
people have different cost structures. Director Sisk shared
that his point was parochial and noted that Via being a
Boulder entity, providing the same services for $5.5 million
less than Horizon.
Director Tobiassen asked if the Veolia’s non-dedicated
vehicles will be wheelchair accessible and is Yellow Cab.
Larry Buter stated that the RFP requested that 25% of the
vehicle fleet be wheelchair accessible.

Committee Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
amend the new ADA paratransit services contracts with MV Transportation
and Via Mobility Services (per solicitation #13-DH-035) for the provision of
Call-n-Ride services. The amendment to the MV Transportation contract is
for three years, with two one-year options and shall not exceed
$19,039,885 for the 5-year period for Call-n-Ride services. The amendment
to the Via Mobility Services contract is also for three years, with two oneyear options and shall not exceed $8,692,084 for the 5-year period for Calln-Ride services. In addition, these contracts will include a cost for fuel
which will be treated as a pass through expense. The total 5-year estimated
cost for Call-n-Ride fuel for MV Transportation is $3,333,539 and for Via
Mobility Services is $1,380,399. The total 5-year not-to-exceed cost for MV
Transportation is $22,373,424. The total 5-year not-to-exceed cost for Via
Mobility Services is $10,072,483.
Motion:

Director Sisk made the motion to move this item
to the full Board at the November 26, 2013
Board meeting
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel stated that staff is requesting an approval of an
amendment to the new ADA Paratransit services contracts
with MB Transportation and Via Mobility Services for the
provision of Call-n-Ride services. He explained that staff
included Call-b-Ride services in the Access-a-Ride services RFP
because past experience has shown that the cost of Call-nRide service is lower when combined with Access-a-Ride
service because of reduced overhead costs.
Director Folska asked if Call-n-Ride services help to solve the
last mile problem. She also wondered if RTD gets support
from businesses and the communities to help defer the cost of
the service. Bruce Abel commented that he hates to call is a
problem; this is a solution to help people fully utilize RTD’s
services. He said that staff has a history of securing financial

support from the communities. He stated that staff always
reaches out to the communities and municipalities with
varying results.

Director Deadwyler noted that there were not packages for
Denver or Aurora. She wondered if they were not able to get
Call-n-Ride. Director Deadwyler expressed concern over Green
Valley Ranch and their expansion. She shared that she has
been hearing from the citizens that they want Call-n-Ride in
their area until it can be served by fixed routes. Bruce Abel
explained that Call-n-Ride is oriented to areas in the District
where there is low population density and transit demand
meaning that fixed route service is not supportable. He stated
that Call-n-Ride service was in Denver and Aurora but over the
years the ridership grew developing into fixed route service.
Bruce Abel said that expanding into new areas is an issue that
RTD is constantly facing. Staff has to balance meeting the
challenges of facing expansion within RTD’s finite resources.
He stated that Green Valley Ranch is not the only community
asking for new or expanded service.

• Award Contract to Supply 125 – 40’ Low-Floor Transit Buses
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
award a contract to Gillig LLC for the purchase of 125 – 40’ low-floor
transit buses and associated spare components in the amount not to exceed
$51,800,000, with an option to purchase up to 307 additional 40’ buses
over a five year period.

Packet Pg. 68

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 19, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Solano asked if the packages were based on need in
specific areas. Bruce Abel said that implementation of Call-nRide was based on need but the packages were created to
provide logical service areas that minimize overhead costs.

6.E

Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the November 26,
2013 Board meeting.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel explained that RTD was at the point where we
needed to move through routine replacement of our 40’ subfleet. He stated that the useful life was generally 12 years
and staff has extended that to 13 or 14 years. He said the
financial plan now allows for RTD to begin replacement of this
fleet. Bruce Abel shared that an RFP was put out requesting
proposal for Clean Diesel, Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and
Hybrid buses so staff could have fact based analysis of the
different technologies. He stated that the Hybrid option was
easy to remove due to cost impacts, operating efficiencies and
fuel efficiencies.
Bruce Abel noted that the prices of CNG have come down
dramatically so it merited an in depth analysis between Clean
Diesel and CNG. He explained that in moving forward with
CNG there would need to be additional investments in various
improvements that would cost approximately $48 million.
Based on that capital cost and operational savings, staff base
a number of fact based assumptions to calculate the
breakeven point, which would be 13 years. Bruce Abel
pointed out to the Board that at this time within the industry
there is acknowledgement that there is very little difference, if
any, in the emissions between the two technologies. Bruce
Abel stated that based on this analysis staff is recommending
that RTD move forward with Clean Diesel. He said that even
if the 13 year breakeven was deemed acceptable, RTD has no
way of getting $48 million to invest in the necessary
improvements.
Director Deadwyler expressed concern over the capacity of the
vehicles. She noted that we already have an issue of space
for our disabled riders and passengers with strollers or other
large items. She believes we should be looking as expanding
our storage capacity as we purchase new vehicles. Bruce
Abel explained that capacity is a non-issue as we move to
answer the question of fuel source. He stated that RTD has
the ability to change our seating configuration regardless of
the vehicle we acquire. The seating configuration is really a
constant balancing act between overall ridership and people
with disabilities, strollers, etc.
Packet Pg. 69

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 19, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Daly seconded the motion.

6.E

Director Lubow noted that if we were purchasing vehicles
purely on air quality impacts it would be the same for either
technology. She said there used to be a lot of hoopla about
CNG being better but that is no longer true. Dean Shaklee
said that since about 2010 the technologies have been almost
the same.
Director Hoy wondered if the Board authorized the purchase of
125 new vehicles, would RTD park or sell 125 old vehicles.
He also wondered if this action was authorizing the purchase
of 125 or the option of an additional 307 as well. He asked if
at the time of the option CNG was determined to be the better
technology could the decision be made to switch.
Bruce Abel explained that the procurement policy is that when
RTD replaces a vehicle the old vehicle goes to auction. He
said in this situation we will buy 125 and retire about 115 as
staff wants to have a small spare ration. Bruce Abel stated
that if staff recommended moving forward with the option
that would also come back to the Board for approval. Dean
Shaklee said that the contract could always be modified to not
move forward with the option but there will be a cost
increase.
Director Hoy noted that the cost of CNG was going down. He
asked if this is just a blimp or a trend. Dean Shaklee said it is
a highly volatile technology. Bruce Abel stated that there has
been an increase in production which has led to a price
decrease.
Director Lasater expressed concern over selecting Clean
Diesel. He noted that diesel is historically tied to the
international market. It is extremely more volatile than locally
provided natural gas. He stated that natural gas is a local
commodity that we have here in Colorado that RTD can count
on. Director Lasater commented that if there are any more
global conflicts, gas and diesel will be dramatically more
volatile than anything that is locally available, like natural gas.
Director Lasater pointed out that the reports show diesel
fluctuating while natural gas continually going down. He said
Packet Pg. 70

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 19, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Solano asked if the buses will be used by contractors
or just as part of the RTD fleet. Bruce Abel said that staff
attempts to maintain a balance between RTD and contractors
in terms of age of fleet so they will be used by both.

6.E

Director Folska asked for a Study Session to understand the
balancing act for changing the seating configuration of the
buses. Director Folska wondered if there was a regular
percentage of vehicles that are in like shop being worked on.
Dean Shaklee stated that RTD has a better than 20% spare
ratio. He noted that there are always buses being worked on
whether this is preventative maintenance or vehicles being
hard down. Dean Shaklee commented that the only time RTD
does not have enough buses is for Monday or Thursday night
football games. Bruce Abel noted that the FTA gives guidance
as to the spare ratio RTD should maintain as well as the
replacement schedule. He said RTD always tries to comply
with industry best practices.
Director Deadwyler reiterated her concern for capacity. She
noted the 40’ buses we use today do not accommodate
people with disabilities or women and children. She believes
we should be looking at purchasing larger vehicles. Bruce
Abel stated that 40’ is the mainstay of our fleet. Dean
Shaklee noted that 45’ buses are not made; 40’ is as long as
we can go unless we go to a 60’ articulated bus. General
Manager Washington said that part of what must be taken into
account is financial ability. If RTD buys more 60’ buses we do
not have the budgetary capacity to purchase many of them.
He stated that RTD has the budget to purchase what staff is
recommending. He said that while RTD is concerned with the
disabled community there is also budgetary restraint.

that he also is skeptical of the equivalent life expectancy. He
noted that diesel deteriorates equipment more rapidly than
gas. Director Lasater agrees that electric is the way of the
future but he does not agree with some of staff’s assumptions
comparing diesel to natural gas. He stated that he is not
happy about this recommendation and will be voting no.
Director Lasater thinks CNG should be given stronger
considerations in staff’s evaluations.

Judy McMurphy shared that staff will also be looking to install additional
validators in the beginning of 2014. Staff will focus on Southmoor, 16th and
Stout, Orchard and 27th and Welton.
Judy McMurphy stated that staff just completed the Retail Point of Sales
(RPOS) testing. She said the test went very well and there were only two
things for the vendor to change.
Judy McMurphy noted that all the work with the subject matter experts in
done on the Website. Xerox had the document outlining the changes which
they are now working on.
Judy McMurphy said that the end of year process with CollegePasses and
EcoPasses was proceeding well.
Director Deadwyler asked if the cards could be demagnetized. Judy
McMurphy stated that if you put the card in the microwave it could be
demagnetized. She said that most frequently, people will have too many
cards in the badge holder which will prevent the card from reading. She
stated that otherwise staff has not heard of issues with the cards being
demagnetized.
Director Deadwyler asked about the schedule of installation for new
validators along the Welton corridor. Bruce Abel reiterated that 30th and
Downing will receive another validator by the end of this year while 27th and
Welton is scheduled to get one in 2014.
Director Sisk commented that he is thrilled with the Smart Cards and the
way it has been implemented. He asked when implementation would be

Judy McMurphy, Smart Card Project Manager, said that was music to her
ears. She noted that in the last meeting there were questions about work
being done with the platform validators. She shared that between now and
the end of the year staff will be working on network connectivity at Sports
Authority Field. She stated that staff has learned that hard wiring those
validators will allow better customer service. The bandwidth is being taken
up by all the cell phones so this should help to alleviate the problem. Judy
McMurphy said that staff will also be repositioning the validators and Colfax
and Auraria as well as doing an additional installation at 30th and Downing.

General Manager Washington noted that the situation in Chicago and some
other cities is the reason why staff is being very deliberate and prudent in
the phased installation. He stated that so many transit agencies have fallen
down on this technology and staff does not want that to happen at RTD.
The goal is to have no catastrophic failures when this system is brought
online. General Manager Washington thanked Judy McMurphy and her team
for doing such a great job.

 Update on DUS Service Change Meetings - No Back Up
Jessie Carter informed the Board that staff has already started the Denver
Union Station (DUS) public meeting process. He said the first meeting was
last Friday and about 30 people were in attendance. He noted that was a
great turnout for a Friday night meeting. Jessie Carter noted that Director
Tobiassen and Rivera-Malpiede were also in attendance. He stated that staff
would be continuing the process tomorrow with two additional meetings.
Jessie Carter shared that at this point most of the concerns center around
the introduction of two way bus traffic on 18th Street. He said that staff
hopes to hear from more of the commuters who will be affected by the
move from Market Street Station to DUS at the upcoming meetings.
Committee Chair Tobiassen informed the Board that Rob Rynerson is an
amazing walking encyclopedia. He really knows the history of RTD.
Director James shared with the Board that DDP is watching the two way
street process very carefully as they are concerned about the input from the
neighborhoods.

 DesignLine Update - No Back Up
Bruce Abel noted that as staff informed the Board in August, Design Line
filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. He said that staff has been working
through bankruptcy court to follow the proceedings. Design Line had until
October 31st to secure a potential purchaser. Bruce Abel stated that the
assets and intellectual property were purchased by Wonderland, a financial
investment company. He said that Wonderland did not purchase RTD’s
contract so staff thought we were in the clear with our outstanding
contract; however, the court advised RTD that Wonderland had an extended
period to consider contracts they wished to pursue. He explained that
Wonderland met with staff last week and indicated there are three contracts

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 19, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

from someone. Bruce Abel stated that staff was not aware of any but
would certainly go back out with an eye to that issue. General Manager
Washington stated that all of our stations are accessible. He has not seen a
validator that is inaccessible but staff will review.

6.E

they are interested in pursuing: New Jersey, Montreal and RTD. Bruce Abel
shared that staff had been advised by New Jersey and Montreal that
Wonderland has breached contract. He stated that RTD does not wish to be
their sole remaining contract but it must work its way through bankruptcy
court.

E. Other Matters

Bruce Abel said that the unveiling of the name was being released prematurely;
however, he wanted to provide a brief review of the surveys that were conducted
as part of the vehicle selection process.
Dennis Yaklich, Manager of Market Research, informed the Board that in order to
involve the customers in the selection of new vehicles, 3536 surveys were
distributed the week of September 5th on the BF, BMX, and BX routes that provide
the majority of service along the upcoming US36 BRT corridor. He said this
represents approximately one survey for each passenger on each runoff each flavor
of the route B. Dennis Yaklich shared that 933 customers, or about 28% of all
surveys distributed, responded to the survey. He noted that this is a great response
rate giving RTD highly accurate results. He explained that customers were
presented with an illustration of each bus type and a balance description of the
relative advantages and disadvantages of each type. Dennis Yaklich stated that
86% of customers prefer a coach, 10% prefer a low-floor and 4% indicated no
preference. He informed the Board that the vast majority of customers indicated a
preference for a coach no matter their demographic characteristics or usage
characteristics. He noted that customers were also asked to evaluate vehicle
characteristics or attributes independent of the overall vehicle selection that were
important to them. Customers were most strongly attracted to seat comfort, space
for belongings and shorter travel time. He commented that bike capacity was also
very important. Dennis Yaklich stated that Wi-Fi was evaluated as being more
attractive than a vehicle’s appearance or branding but less attractive than comfort
elements and space for belongings.
Bruce Abel stated that the essential question that was posed for the US36 BRT
corridor was customer preference for a coach bus that is operated on regional
routes today versus low floor that is common to other BRT routes today. He said
that staff wanted to get the customers perspective rather than rely on other transit
agencies data.
General Manager Washington told the Board that this information had just been
shared with the US36 technical team today. He explained that the reason staff is

Bruce Abel stated that information on the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) was being
released by the Boulder Camera. It had been staff’s intention to present this
information at the next Operations and Customer Service Committee but were
instead reviewing it now.

6.E

coming to the Board at this point is because the Board will have to make a decision
on the buses for BRT in the next few months.

Director Hoy shared that when he was greeting people at the Westminster Park-nRides he noticed how full the luggage compartments were with bikes. There would
already be 10 bikes in one compartment and people would be putting more bikes in.
He believes that you do not see this anywhere else in the system.
Director Sisk pointed out that tonight’s information was just meant to inform the
Board. He noted that the information is still being compiled and reviewed with
stakeholders and through the Northwest Area Mobility Study. He believes it is
important for stakeholders to be present when this is a formal discussion with the
Board.

Director Bagley asked for the percentage of riders that use bikes across the entire
system versus the US36 corridor. Dennis Yaklich stated that in general, the
proportion of customers that used bikes over the past 12 months was 7% while
along US36 it is about 17%. He said that in terms of overall boardings he does not
have that figure available; however, he said that those that use bikes do so
regularly. Director Bagley noted that 7% in 12 months is a small fraction of the
riders using bikes. Bruce Abel commented that there is a much higher percentage
of bike utilization in the US36 corridor than anywhere else in the system.

Jannette Scarpino, Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis,
reminded the Board that they began reviewing the 2014-2016
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) in April. It was approved in July
along with the expense and capital project plan. Jannette
Scarpino said that staff began the review process of the 2014
Recommended Budget in August and presented drafts in
September and October. She noted that the Board has had
the opportunity to comment and provide input throughout the
process.
Jannette Scarpino reviewed the Board Report and associated
attachments with the Board that are available in the November
19, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee
Agenda Packet.
Director Sisk noted that diesel is budgeted at $3.26 per gallon
and gasoline is budgeted at $3.54 per gallon. He requested
staff prepare figures that would reflect the prices if we did a
fuel lock today. He thought it would have an impact on the
budget. Jannette Scarpino stated that it would have a
favorable impact on the budget. She said staff would put the
numbers together.
Director Deadwyler commented that there are a lot of base
system reductions. She asked if that would mean there are
going to be service reductions in 2014. Jannette Scarpino
explained that these are largely one time changes that
occurred in 2013 but will not occur in 2014; they are not
necessarily a reduction in operating expense. She stated this
decrease is largely due to a $11 million Denver Union Station
contribution that was budgeted in 2013, reduction in DBA
expenses and reduction in grant pass through.
Director Tobiassen asked for clarification on the negative
adjustment of $9 million for the Downtown Circulator.
Jannette Scarpino explained that this is showing the
reconciliation between the amended budget from 2013 and
the recommended budget from 2014. She stated that the
project was likely over budgeted in 2013 but as we get further
into the projects staff gets better at the estimates/projections.

• Annual Report to the Board - Interest Rate Swap Policy
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approves the attached modifications to the RTD
Interest Rate Swap Policy.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 26, 2013
Board meeting.
Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Brenden Morgan, Manager of Debt and Investments, stated
that at this time staff is not anticipating the need to enter a
swap agreement at any point in the foreseeable future. He
said that based on this, staff is recommending that the Board
does not need to review the policy on an annual basis; the
Board will need to review the policy if the District is involved
in or planning to enter a swap agreement. Brenden Morgan
noted there are some additional language changes being
recommended to clarify the Policy and to reflect the
implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection that are outlined an the redline draft
included in November 19, 2013 Financial Administration and
Audit Committee Agenda Packet.
Director Tobiassen noted that not too long ago RTD got
burned by some interest rate swaps. He thinks it is good to
not get involved in swaps any time soon. Director Tobiassen

Director Solano asked why Stapleton was listed separately
under Attachment B, Reconciliation of Changes. Jannette
Scarpino explained that this is also a reconciliation from 2013
to 2014 in terms of new capital. This item was brought
forward for Board Approval to add $2.7 million to Stapleton
earlier in 2013.

6.F

Director Bagley said that the previous swaps that may have
gone against RTD were created during the downturn. He
stated that we are in a totally different environment today.
Director Bagley believes it is prudent to have this as part of
RTD’s policy; this permits staff to come back to the Board and
make a suggestion should it be necessary. Terry Howerter
stated that he agrees with Director Bagley. He recommends
keeping a swap policy in place. He said if staff should deem it
reasonable they would bring the policy and present proposal to
the Board at that time.
Director Sisk asked for staff to clarify in the policy that any
swap would be presented to the Board before it is entered.
Brenden Morgan stated that was the intent so staff would
review the language to make it clearer before the Board
meeting on November 26, 2013.

• 2014 Internal Audit Plan
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approves the proposed plan of internal audits to be
performed in 2014.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 26, 2013
Board meeting.

also noted that the E-470 Board also got into situations with
swaps that cost them a lot of money. He believes these seem
like one of the riskiest investments. Director Tobiassen
wonders why we might want to do interest rate swaps in the
future. Terry Howerter stated there are many reasons to do
interest rate swaps; for example, if RTD had a fixed rate that
was high and the market is low we may want to go to a lower
rate. He commented that all of RTD’s debt is at fixed rates
currently. Staff has refinanced all our debt to very low rates
so we would not want to do any swaps at this time.

6.F

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.
Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager of Internal Audit, noted that
staff had requested comments or suggestions from the Board
on the plan but no responses had been received.
Director Deadwyler asked if one of the audits was focused
around RTD’s computer equipment and software. She
wondered if that would be audited at all. Ann Marie IsaacHeslop said there were several audits that would touch on IT.
One would be CDW looking at the purchase of computer
equipment; there is also an audit of the Purchasing Cards and
check requests for the IT department. Director Deadwyler
stated that she is looking for an audit on the performance of
what RTD has already purchased. She said that she submitted
her request to the finance department. Terry Howerter said
that his understanding was that Director Deadwyler and Chair
Anderson were going to discuss this matter to let him know
how to proceed. Chair Anderson said that she has not heard
back from Director Deadwyler. She believes there is an audit
of Dataman USA LLC that might satisfy Director Deadwyler’s
request.
Director Lubow noted that in the presentation it states that
due to budget constraints there are no outside audits. She
wondered if this was standard operating procedure. Scott
Reed said that previously RTD might have used some external
auditors; however, previous budget constraints caused RTD to
begin conducting all audits internally. He noted that RTD
utilizes its internal audit department to do 20 per year. With
those audits and audits from various regulating agencies staff
believes there is sufficient oversight.
Director Solano asked if, based on the Background Information
Statement, the State of Colorado normally reviews RTD’s
audits. Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of
Communications, explained that during RTD’s most recent
audit with the state it was recommended that in addition to
the General Manager the Board also approve the internal audit
plan.
Director Hoy commented that the list of audits seems pretty
well fixed at this time. He wondered if there was a way to
add or modify anything. Scott Reed stated that the Board has

C. Updates

• Third Quarter 2013 Internal Audit Report
Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop stated that the reports were available in the
November 19, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda
Packet.
The Board had no questions.

• 2014 Ridership Goal Model
General Manager Washington reminded the Board that this model was sent
to them several weeks ago. He said staff wanted to briefly review the
process and answer any questions. General Manager Washington
recognized that there will need to be follow-up discussion on this; the Board
needs to decide if they will accept this methodology for the already
approved 2014 ridership goal or leave it as it was originally approved at a
2.8% increase.
Lee Cryer, Project Manager for Planning, shared that this was a team effort
among several departments. He explained that the statistical model that
best explains historical changes in RTD ridership uses a combination of hours
of service, employment and gas prices. This model forecasts an increase in
ridership of 1.3% from 2012 to 2013 and 0.6% from 2013 to 2014. Lee
Cryer stated the low increase for next year is due to the expectation that
gas prices will decrease.
Director Folska thinks this work is wonderful and appreciates the
interdepartmental cooperation. She believes RTD is moving away from the

Packet Pg. 86

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 19, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

not yet approved the plan; if there was something specific the
Board wanted to add or modify there would still be time. He
asked that the Board keep in mind that if the internal audit
team does find other areas of concern as they proceed through
the plan staff can always expand the audits or make
adjustments as needed.

6.F

Director Hoy shared that he uses regression analysis in his business on a
daily basis and recognizes it is not something you can hang your hat on. He
wondered what other variables staff considered but did not use in the
model. Lee Cryer shared that one variable was unemployment rate as the
number of jobs was a better variable. He said another variable staff looked
at but did not use was fare paid. Staff calculated the average fare paid
across all services and types of media; the average fare paid has been going
up and so has ridership, which seems counterintuitive.
Director Lubow thanked staff for putting this together. She noted the
projected ridership increase of 2.8% but a more precise evaluation shows
that it is really lower. She wonders what consequences there are for the
differences and how the Board deals with these new projections. She also
wonders if it will have any impact on the budget. General Manager
Washington stated it was up to the Board to decide how to proceed. There
is an approved ridership goal that was not based on good methodology. He
said the Board has to decide to move forward with the goal that was
approved or a new goal that is based on better methodology. General
Manager Washington informed the Board that this does not affect the
budget.
Director Lubow reiterated that is does not seem like the ridership goal was
based on reality in the past. General Manager Washington noted that this is
one goal out of 81, so while this goal may have been off it is not fair to say
all the goals are not good. He stated that staff would still strive to do what
they can to increase ridership.
Director James commented that it is useful to distinguish between a goal,
which is something RTD can aspire to, versus a projection. He noted that
the Board just approved moving forward the 2014 Recommended Budget
that has farebox revenue increasing by about 3% whereas ridership is
projected to increase by 0.6% based on the new model. Director James
asked for an explanation of the difference between ridership and fare box
revenue. It is his understanding that ridership is the number boardings.
General Manager Washington agreed with Director James about goals and
projections. He said that over the years ridership was projected without
proper methodology. General Manager Washington stated that now RTD
has proper methodology so it is up to the Board to determine what we do
Packet Pg. 87

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 19, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

silo effect that so many organizations struggle with. She asked if staff
would consider adding weather to the model. Director Folska said that she
knows when the weather is good a lot of people do not ride the Mall shuttle
so she thinks this is important to look at. Lee Cryer stated that staff is not
aware of a direct correlation between weather and ridership. He said that
adding weather as a variable is something staff can look into.

6.F

with it. Lee Cryer stated that Director James was correct about ridership
and fare box revenue.

Chair Anderson thinks this predictor could be used in times of tight budgets;
however, if RTD is looking at aspiring to build ridership the goal can be
whatever the Board wants it to be. She stated that she has no feelings one
way or the other as to changing the ridership goal for next year.
Director Lasater commented that the model is really talking about things that
are external to RTD while a goal is something RTD controls. He does not
think a projection should change RTD’s goal setting process. RTD Needs to
affect what happens by promoting better service, introducing new buses,
etc. Director Lasater cautioned the other Board members not to get too
concerned about external controls versus the goals of the agency that can
be affected.
Director Folska commented that the number of riders is important since
often times it is tied to RTD’s funding from FTA, DOE, etc.; RTD cannot get
funding if we cannot show we have the ridership. She believes increasing
ridership will also help RTD with funding. General Manager Washington
stated that these were two different things. When building a rail line and
completing the EIS staff is looking at projected ridership over many years,
not just looking at increased ridership for 2014.
Director Tobiassen noted that the only variable controlled by RTD is vehicle
hours. He said he is surprised with all the vehicle hours that have been
added with the West line the model only shows an increase of 0.6%.
Director Tobiassen also does not see fare being a determining factor when
other models have shown ridership dropping as fares were raised. Lee Cryer
reiterated that the price of gas being forecasted to go down is really a
driving factor. Terry Howerter stated that the last time RTD had a fare
increase there was also in increase in the cost of fuel. He shared that he
has always through fuel and ridership were more correlated than anything
else. Bruce Abel said that as part of the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force’s
elasticity models many theories were thrown out the window because
ridership was more highly correlated with fuel than fares.

Director James encouraged staff to look at reconciling ridership and fare box
revenue. He wonders how staff plans to achieve our aspirational goal.
General Manager Washington stated that one tactical plan is the Fare Task
Force to simplify media. Another is making sure people know how to ride
the system. He said there are a number of things staff can do. Terry
Howerter noted that ridership is based on the number of boardings while
there are many variables that go into the fare side.

6.F

Director Bagley commented that in reviewing the dashboard that will be
presented next, year-to-date bus ridership is down 1.1% and light rail is
down 1.8%; however, in looking at the total revenue service boardings it is
up 1.6%. He said that as we open the East, Gold, North Metro and I-225
lines these will be major aspects that drive ridership up further because it
will provide more, and different, service. Director Bagley stated that this
one out of 81 performance measures. He thinks it is great what staff has
done to look at this statistically but thinks the Board should leave the
process as is for the time being and monitor the model compared to actual
ridership on a quarterly basis. He does not want to make any grandiose
changes in what the Board and staff are doing until everyone has had a
chance to analyze this more.
Committee Chair Walker stated that he is not crazy about the goal of
increasing ridership because he does not think that is RTD’s mission; it is to
provide good service to the community. He said he does admire Lee Cryer’s
work. Committee Chair Walker share that he had done modeling in the past
and understands that it is difficult to measure because there are so many

B. Recommended Actions

• Recommendation for Adoption of ADA Program Plan
It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) Program Plan. By this
action, the Board of Directors affirms that it is a priority of RTD to provide
equal access enterprise-wide for people with disabilities in accordance with
the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable laws. The purpose
of the ADA Program Plan is to provide guidance, policies, procedures, and
monitoring to further this policy direction.
Discussion:

Kenn Hardin, Senior Manager of Civil Rights, stated that the
action tonight is requesting the Board adopt the foundation for
the ADA program that has been discussed over the past few
months. This item inventories the services provided by RTD
and addresses the need to coordinate those services. Kenn
Hardin noted that ADA falls into four categories or
components with regards to employment, communication,
facilities and service. He explained that this is a foundational
plan that he will then use to develop the specific components
to allow RTD to provide the best services for people with
disabilities.
Director Hoy asked for clarification about what this policy
changes. He thought that RTD was already complying with
ADA requirements. Kenn Hardin explained that this created a
coordinated effort that RTD did not have previously. It

Director Hoy noted that the Board would not be setting up
committees; the Board is simply affirming that the Board is in
support of the ADA laws of the Government. He said that
RTD does that now but this is just reaffirming the
commitment. Marla Lien explained that this is actually going a
step beyond that. ADA requirements are prescriptive; they
say how to design buses, design facilities, grade curbs, etc.
She stated that this is an overall policy that will take RTD a
step beyond the prescriptive requirements of the ADA laws.
Director Hoy asked if RTD does not have this program today.
Marla Lien said that RTD complies with ADA but this will
hopefully take the agency beyond looking at the prescriptive
requirements to have a more holistic approach.
Committee Chair Deadwyler commented that when she first
saw this item she was also a little confused; however, this is
the first time the agency has stated it is one of RTD’s
priorities. She noted that while RTD complied with ADA, we
never assured the public it was a priority.
Director Tobiassen stated that this is a huge step forward. He
said that for the last five years he has run into issues with
ADA and RTD where we did not take the next step, for
example the website or Board packets not being accessible.
He recognized that RTD has been working in this direction but
thinks formalizing a policy is great. Director Tobiassen noted
that staff is more than happy to work to improve RTD but this
makes it easier to look at those hurdles.
Director Folska thanked Kenn Hardin and all the staff for their
enterprise wide efforts. She believes this is an important
move. Director Folska is excited to see the shift from silos to
a fully integrated system.

Packet Pg. 93

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 19, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

identifies an ADA Coordinator from the Civil Rights Division
that was not in place previously. He said that right now RTD
has functional ADA activities, everyone is doing some level of
compliance, but there is no oversight of the activity. General
Manager Washington noted that in addition the Board is
affirming that ADA is a priority for RTD. He stressed that the
main point of this action is to send a message to the disabled
community that this is a priority.

6.G

Committee Chair Deadwyler thanked Kenn Hardin and staff as
well. She believes this will make people feel more secure now
that RTD has indicated that ADA is a priority.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 26, 2013
Board meeting.

Other Matters


General Manager Washington shared they are working an issue on the US 36
related to the BRT bus. According to a recent survey, 86% of the riders stated
they prefer an over the road bus similar to the MCI bus; however, the stakeholders
are advocating for a different bus or to take an RFP out for bid. No decision has
been made but he expects this will be a hard discussion. Director Bagley asked for
clarification on the discussion. Is the discussion that the stakeholders would prefer
a RFP for a different type of BRT bus rather than exercise the option that we have
for the MCI bus? General Manager Washington responded yes. Chair Anderson
noted she had lunch with one of the members on the US 36 and had heard about
these concerns.

Director Daly asked if there is ignorance in the public on what BRT is. General
Manager Washington responded that in the survey, participants were asked about
the type of vehicle that they prefer. Director Daly inquired if the public understands
a low-floor vehicle for BRT may have it struggle in a location like Boulder due to the

Director Daly noted we need to educate the stakeholders on pre-paid media.

Chair Anderson asked if we can get the users and stakeholders in a common
environment for this discussion on BRT vehicles. Director Walker added that
perhaps we can set up a focus group of riders and stakeholders so they will hear
the same thing.
Director Daly inquired about the fare taskforce and asked if staff will accept
questions from the Board. General Manager Washington responded yes. Director
Hoy added that whether or not Board members would become participants, he
thinks the taskforce need to provide updates to the Board on what the taskforce is
doing, when they meet, etc. General Manager Washington responded they will
provide an update in January, 2014.
Director Bagley indicated that he had seven comments under other matters:
o He met with Tami Door and Elba Wedgeworth and think it may be a good
idea to invite them here to talk about the collaboration between Downtown
Denver Partnership and RTD.
o He does not want to receive the IT advisory e-mails-this should not include
Board members
o For the December 4 Board Effectiveness workshop, he is happy that about
80% of the Board members plan to attend. He thinks we should focus on
meeting protocols.
o He does not believe that a Board member calling into a meeting should be
able to make a motion.
o The dates for the next series of GM Oversight meets are November 26,
December, 3, 10 & 17. He encourages members of the Executive
Committee to attend.
o He took a ride on the D-line along with Detective John Perry and Jessie
Carter. They discussed some of the safety and signaling issues. Both of
them did a great job. They encountered a couple of challenges along the
way having to do with the door not shutting and signaling issues at Park
West. It is interesting to see how a few challenges can have a ripple effect
through the whole system. There is a history with some of the issues and

General Manager Washington indicated they are talking to the manufacturer about
the possibility of rear door to address some of the concerns. Director Hoy asked if
the spacing between the fare box and the bulkhead is a little narrower on the newer
buses and if that could be addressed. He thinks this could also address some the
concerns expressed by the stakeholders.

Director Walker indicated that he attended one of the DUS scheduling meetings.
The primary concern was two-way parking and concern over bus traffic impact
along 18th St.
Director Walker stated he did not understand what all the concern was about on
the 30th & Downing station. Several people expressed their opinion about this
including the fact that according to DPD, this is not the site with the largest
amount of crime. Director Hoy felt the “emotionalism” and “sensationalism”
that the media sometimes gives to these events attribute to the responses.
Director Bagley shared an incident that happened about two years ago in
Littleton and indicated this can happen anywhere.
Director Daly announced the ATU Election Board is December 2, 2013.

Public Participation






Richard Castro, Denver Health and administrator of the Eastside Public Health
Center, advocated on behalf of the 29th and Welton Station. He indicated this clinic
serves the elderly, the pregnant, families with children and otherwise disadvantaged
and disenfranchised. Transportation is a key issue for his clients and they are
heavily dependent on public transportation. He sees approximately 300-350
patients per day, 2-300 for the pharmacy and they rely on the light rail to get them
to the clinic. He feels discontinuing this stop will be a hardship on the clients and
would be detrimental to the community and healthcare.
Joel Nobel from the Curtis Park neighborhood which is adjacent to this location
indicated that the on-time performance has improved since the closing of the
station; the data and rider experience are clear that this test has been successful.
He said that when viewed narrowly, the results would suggest that the station
needs to be closed; however, there are other issues to be resolved there. It is still
only 66% on-time so this still needs to be looked at. He noted that when his group
polled the neighborhood to see if they used the station and why, they heard that
many people did. They believe this is good stop spacing and feel safe at this
location. There is another legitimate concern about what happens to the station.
They do not want it to become blight within the community. He stated that people
do not feel safe at the 30th & Welton station. He said they had many problems
with lights being out, a situation that he had appealed to RTD earlier and this has
only gotten fixed after Denver police intervention.
Tracy Winchester, Executive Director of the Five Points Business District which is a
non-profit organization representing business and property owners in the Welton
Street Corridor, thanked RTD for working with them and in creating a world-class
transportation modal center. She expressed that her purpose for being here was to
address the concerns over the permanent closure of the 29th & Welton Station.
She stated that before a decision is made, there needs to be more than the criteria
of on-time performance to close the station. RTD and the community need to look
at economic development and safety. Safety is the number one issue as to why her
community would like to see the station re-opened. She also feels that the
economic development needs to be considered. The light rail gives permanence
and credibility to developers that want to come in and revitalize the area. She
believes that closing a station and leaving it as a blighted area in the community
really has a chilling effect for any developers. She requested RTD to hold off on
making a permanent decision until the safety issue is resolved at 30th & Downing
which gives residents an opportunity to get off at 29th and Welton Station where
they feel safe. She also asked the Board to keep the Central Corridor Mobility
Study in consideration as they make their decision.
Doug Gragg also complimented RTD on the implementation of the audio system on
the buses. He asked to speak with someone regarding a technical question. He

shared that he had a wonderful time coming down to the meeting on the RTD
system because he experienced very good service. His driver was Lisa and she did
not know that he was coming to attend a Board meeting. Doug Gragg stated that
she exhibited remarkable personal ability through many trials and tribulations from
very challenging customers; she gave what he would call A+ service.
Ricky Martinez, RMR, said that he has been threatened with legal action by Jim
Martinez, President of RMR. He stated that after being treated poorly on the job
site it is uncomfortable to endure this kind of treatment. He feels the Board should
be aware of these incidents.
Josh Garcia stated that he owns Unification Point, a business near the 29th and
Welton Station. He asked the Board to give more consideration to re-opening the
station. There are four brand new businesses in the area, three of which have open
door policies. He said this is the first year his company has been in business; he
believes it would greatly benefit his business if this station remained open. Josh
Garcia said that he has also had several clients express concern about their safety
at the 30th and Downing Station.
Brady Bratcher from Peoria, stated that he and another gentleman went to the
offices of RMR to get an OSHA report. He said that while they were there they
decided to apply for work. Brady Bratcher stated that just because they were
affiliated with the union Jim Martinez called the police. He noted that the National
Labor Relations Board found merit on the charges that were filed against RMR while
Jim Martinez informed the Board the exact opposite. Mr. Martinez agreed that he
would not violate federal law and was required to inform employees of their rights.
Brady Bratcher commented that most of the time unfair labor practices are
committed by front line supervisors but all of the unfair practices of RMR are
committed by Jim Martinez himself.
Jim Toweill, Ironworkers Union, stated that he needed to respond to comments
that were made by RMR’s owner. He noted that Jim Martinez made the claim that
he made some mistakes regarding prevailing wages; however, Jim Toweill pointed
out that there are dozens of instances of RMR having to make restitution in 2010,
2011 and 2012. He said that it is very difficult for him to believe that these are
mistakes and will not happen again. Jim Toweill believes that unless there are
some prequalifications this will continue to happen. He commented that Jim
Martinez told the Board that people were wearing t-shirts that said RMR abuses
workers while in fact his group was wearing t-shirts that say Respect our Rights.
Jim Toweill also noted that this is not just about Jim Martinez but the many other
people involved with the company.
Reverend Daniel Klawitter said that he is the Chairperson of the Interfaith Workers
Justice Committee. His organization is a small group of clergy that believes that all
workers should be treated with dignity and respect. Reverend Klawitter stated that
when he heard the concerns of the workers he agreed to lead an effort to speak

with RMR. He said that at RMR’s office he was able to speak briefly with Tom
Ward through a door. Reverend Klawitter noted that despite the fact that he was
in his clergy collar and gave him his card he was immediately threatened with
arrest. He noted that he was left feeling that if he was treated that way how must
the workers be being treated.
Louis Apolinar, RMR, reiterated the comments of Ricky Martinez. He stated that
Jim Martinez threatened to sue them as striking workers. Louis Apolinar said that
they complained to the NLRB that Jim Martinez intimidated and harassed workers
and the NLRB found merit to the charges. He noted that rather than have the NLRB
take official action Mr. Martinez agreed to put up posters. Louis Apolinar shared
that he was a witness to many abuses on RMR projects where they forced
employees to run with rebar and seek water from Kiewit.

Chair Anderson reported that a number of Board members had attended the
Rail~Volution conference and this was a great conference. They had a chance to
visit the different transit properties. She noted one of the differences between the
RTD agency and Seattle is RTD is one regional transit whereas there are several
min transit working together in Seattle.
Chair Anderson reported that she and Director Sisk had completed their town halls.
Approximately 25,000 people dialed in for hers. She had received very positive
feedback from the constituents who had participated in the town hall. More town
halls to follow.
On November 2, there will be a celebration of the Pine Junction Grand opening.
Director Daly will be speaking. She encouraged other Board members to attend.
November 8 from 11:30-12:30 will be the annual Veteran’s Day Luncheon. We
cannot commend enough what the Veterans have done for this country and we
especially applaud the RTD veterans. Several Board members are scheduled to
attend.

He said that there was a technical tour that went to Denver Union Station (DUS).
Everyone was very impressed the development and multi-modal nature of DUS.
General Manager Washington shared that the Transportation Research Board (TRB) had
a luncheon at the AASHTO Conference that was well attended. The Chair of the TRB
Executive Committee was the Keynote Speaker, Deb Jones. He said that she spoke
about how the railroads work. General Manager Washington thought it was very
interesting, especially as RTD goes through some of the issues with the North West
Rail.
General Manager Washington will be giving a presentation on FasTracks November 1st
to the University of Denver’s Law School Land Use Leadership Alliance Group run by
Susan Daggett.
General Manager Washington stated that he was happy to say that RTD will be
resuming bus service to Lyons. Lyons was very isolated due to flood but staff worked
with CDOT and the Colorado State Highway Patrol so that service can be resumed on
November 4th.
General Manager Washington shared that on November 14th RTD will be visited by a
delegation from Boston. This delegation, headed by Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority CEO Beverly Scott, will be coming to learn about how RTD manages our
Capital Programs so we can bring them in under budget and ahead of schedule. They
will also be learning about the Workforce Initiative Now program.
General Manager Washington said that as the Board is aware, there has been a lot of
discussion about certain controversial bus and rail ads. He noted that staff will bring
this subject back to the Board next month for discussion. There are various options as
to how these ads are handled and the Board will need to make that decision.
General Manager Washington shared that last week RTD lost two long term
employees. This was a tremendous loss to the District; these were two ladies who
were truly outstanding in their work. He said that there is a lot of grieving going on
throughout the agency. The two employees are Jackie Stiggers and Sandy Duran who
collectively had more than 68 years of institutionalized knowledge.

Chair Anderson asked General Manager Washington to pass on the condolences of the
Board to their families and co-workers.

Discussion:

Chair Anderson called on the General Manager for his
comments.
General Manager Washington began by providing the Board
the background of why RTD closed the 29th and Welton
station. He stated that approximately one year ago staff
looked at the service RTD is providing along the Welton Street
Corridor. General Manager Washington reminded the Board
that this area is a single track with on-time performance
issues. He noted that as the Board may be aware, there are
three stops within a four block area: 27th and Welton, 29th and
Welton, and 30th and Downing. General Manager Washington
stated that in looking to see how we could become more
operationally efficient one of staff’s ideas was to close one of
the stations and the middle station seemed more likely.
General Manager Washington shared that the community
requested a trial closure of the station to see if we would gain
the operational efficiencies expected. After the trial period
staff found that we did achieve those efficiencies so the
permanent closure was included in this service change
package.
Jessie Carter commented that on-time performance is 66%
when looking at the Welton segment by itself; looking at the
line as a whole it has moved up to 89%.
General Manager Washington noted that these efficiencies
impact the entire system; the entire system realized the
operational efficiencies that staff was seeking.
General Manager Washington stated that security is an issue.
Staff is working with the Denver Police Department (DPD) to
ensure safety at 30th and Downing, just like they work with
local police throughout the system. He reiterated that staff
works with the local authorities to stamp out crime and will
continue to do so. General Manager Washington commented
that the statement made by a speaker that RTD was forced to

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Packet Pg. 122

8.A

General Manager Washington said that the Central Corridor
Study is currently underway and set to be complete in August.
He noted that if the study identifies a different mobility option
we would not be able to use the infrastructure that is there.
General Manager Washington stated that if the Board approves
the permanent closing of the station he would direct staff to
demolish the infrastructure all together so there is no blight.
General Manager Washington pointed out that there is already
huge economic development in the area even with the station
closed.
General Manager Washington indicated that it is the Board’s
prerogative to keep the station open but stressed that we will
lose operational efficiency in the whole system.
Bruce Abel reinforced General Manager Washington’s
comments. He commented that in some respects the term
operational efficiencies seems impersonal; what staff is really
trying to do is improve RTD’s customer service. He said the
goal of this is so our customers can catch the train when they
expect and make their connections. This will improve service
for the entire system. Bruce Abel noted that staff agrees with
the comments that there is continued room for improvement
which they plan to pursue; staff’s ultimate objective is to
continue to improve customer service.
Director Deadwyler stated that she would like to see the
station remain status quo which would be temporarily closed.
She feels there are many things in the Welton Corridor that
have not been decided. Director Deadwyler believes this will
give the community the opportunity to determine if this is
even the appropriate station to be closed. She is concerned
that RTD has not discussed with the citizens if this is the
station they would like closed as it is very important to the
community.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 29, 2013 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of October 29, 2013)

replace lights at a station is not accurate. Staff looks around
our system very frequently and makes those State of Good
Repairs quickly.

Packet Pg. 123

Director Folska stated her support for Director Deadwyler’s
motion. She wondered when the station was opened and why
staff was just now recommending that it be closed. She also
wondered if RTD would see higher efficiencies if an additional
station were closed. Jessie Carter stated that it was opened
in 1994. He noted that it is important to know the number of
boardings at each station. 30th and Downing sees about
3,200 boardings per day, 29th and Welton saw about 200
boardings per day before it was closed, and 27th and Welton
sees about 300 boardings per day. Jessie Carter said that if
we closed 27th and Downing we would see additional
operational efficiencies but closing the terminal would make
operation very difficult so closing 30th and Downing is not an
option. Director Folska stated that there was another attack
at 30th and Downing on October 30th. She commented that
the station that is causing the most trouble is the station that
will remain.
Director Folska believes we should wait to close the station.
She stated that the RTD Board serves at the pleasure of the
citizens. Those citizens paid to have the station put there and
they came to the meeting to tell the Board how important it is.
Director Folska also hopes that RTD will listen to what the
studies have to say before making a decision.
Director Walker wondered the time-frame for being able to
remove the station. He also wondered if the temporary
closure could be extended; he asked if there are funds
associated with keeping the station as-is in its temporary
status. General Manager Washington stated that the station
could be removed in as little at 45 to 60 days, if not less. He
said that we could continue to bypass the station and it does
not cost much to maintain. Director Walker commented that
in Seattle and Cleveland where lines run through dense areas
the stations are miles apart. He expressed that it has puzzled
him as to why these stations are so close. Jessie Carter noted
that the 29th station is 470 feet away from 30th and Downing
and 750 feet away from 27th.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 29, 2013 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of October 29, 2013)

8.A

Director Lubow indicated that she is inclined to support the
motion. She believes staff has made a compelling case that

Packet Pg. 124

there is some efficiency gained by bypassing the station but
she thinks the public participants raised a reasonable doubt
that this is something that should be irreversible. Director
Lubow wants to give this decision more time so the
community can come forward and see if there is a better way
to handle this.
Director Rivera-Malpiede said that she also supports the
motion. She wants to see what is going to come of the
studies that are currently on the table. She believes the
closure should remain temporary until the Board and staff
know what is being recommended by the studies.
Director Sisk asked for additional information regarding the
lights being out at the 30th and Downing station. He noted
that if we do not have standards and are not responding
quickly it is important to know. Director Sisk feels that it is
important for RTD to support the community. He believes the
action is premature at this point.
Director Menten asked if a subcontractor would be responsible
for the station removal if it was permanently closed. She also
wondered if RTD would continue to maintain the station until
it is demolished. General Manager Washington stated that
removal would be a combination of in-house and
subcontractors. He said that RTD would absolutely continue
to maintain the station until it is removed.
Director Deadwyler noted that while Jessie Carter says it is
only a short distance between the stations there is a safety
issue. She has a daughter that used to use the 29th station
and now she has to walk to 30th. There is no visibility going
around the corner making it doubly unsafe to make the walk.
Director James wanted to clarify that if the amendment is not
approved then the station would be classified as permanently
closed in contrast to its current status as temporarily closed.
He asked if the removal of the station components would be a
consequence of the reclassification.
General Manager
Washington stated that Director James was correct. Director
James wondered what consequences there would be in terms

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 29, 2013 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of October 29, 2013)

8.A

Packet Pg. 125

of cost if the station remained temporarily closed. General
Manager Washington explained that if the amendment is
approved the physical infrastructure will stay in place but RTD
will continue to temporarily bypass the station. He said that
there are some maintenance costs associated with upkeep of
the station to make sure it does not go into a state of blight.
General Manager Washington noted that regardless of the
outcome of the Central Corridor Study, RTD will likely not use
that infrastructure again. If Light Rail is the mode that comes
out of the study, staff’s recommendation will still be to close
the station for operational reasons. If another mobility option
comes out of the study the infrastructure cannot be used. He
stated that staff would then again recommend that the
infrastructure be torn out.
Director Hoy reiterated that since the station has been
temporarily closed on-time performance of the entire line has
improved. He believes that the chances of the Board making a
decision in the future to reopen the station and slow down the
entire line are zero. He said that he would not come back and
say he thought that was a good idea. Director Hoy stated that
he will vote no on the amendment.
Director Folska noted that the amendment put forth by
Director Deadwyler is to maintain the station at 29th as closed
on a temporary basis until RTD receives the details of the
study. She commented that if the study comes back and
recommends a street car then all of the line will need to be
ripped out. She thinks it would be more effective to demolish
it all at once taking advantage of economies of scale than in
bits and pieces. General Manager Washington stated that the
idea that the study will come back in August and RTD will
have money to build the Central Corridor in September is not
realistic; it may be years before RTD can do any of the
recommendations.
Director Bagley commented that as Jessie Carter mentioned,
overall efficiency has gone to 89-91% on the D-Line; the
station closure affects the whole D-Line. He stated that he
will never vote for maintaining the full operation of the station

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 29, 2013 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of October 29, 2013)

8.A

Packet Pg. 126

whenever the vote comes up.
He will support staff’s
recommendation. Director Bagley noted that this decision may
be put off for some time but when it comes down to deciding
what will happen it needs to be permanently closed from his
perspective as a D-Line Director based on what he hears from
his constituents.
Director Daly asked Austin Jenkins why these back-ups are
now an issue. Austin Jenkins said that he thinks staff has laid
out the issues pretty clearly. He noted that he is agnostic
about the station; he cares more about the system as a whole.
He explained that the impact happens at 16th and Stout every
day because every train that comes through the mall is
dependent on the most unreliable portion of the line. Austin
Jenkins stated that clearly we are a system and we need to
recognize that everything affects something else.
Chair Anderson stated that she will be voting against the
amendment.
She is concerned that all of the public
participants have an expectation that the station will open
again.
Chair Anderson does not want to raise the
community’s expectations that the station will be reopened if
it is put on temporary life support. She reiterated what
General Manager Washington said that it does not make any
difference whatsoever as to the mode of transportation that
the study recommends. Chair Anderson pointed out that in
fact, GM Washington said that if the station is opened it will
destroy efficiencies throughout the whole system.
She
highlighted that this is about one block between stations.
Chair Anderson said that she has also heard the concern about
crime in the area but to her that is a totally different issue. If
30th and Downing is dangerous then that station needs to be
fixed by the DPD. Chair Anderson reiterated that RTD needs
to make sure we run our system efficiently and get people to
where they need to go on-time.
Director Lubow noted that she is not convinced that the 27th
Street station is off the table for being closed as an
alternative. She feels that can be explored fairly quickly so
she still supports the amendment.

Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that she agrees with all the
Directors comments. She said that she believes crime has
always been an issue; this is a community issue for the City
Council, DPD and RTD. Director Rivera-Malpiede is voting to
find out what will come out of the study. She thinks that
when working with communities of diversity RTD needs to
take a step back and not do anything at this point. She wants
to go one step at a time.
Director Solano stated that he sees both arguments. He
wondered if any type of forecasting will be done to determine
the population growth in the area that might indicate a need
for the station in the future. He thought it might make sense
to temporarily leave the station until we have these forecasts.
Director Walker commented that it seems like under no
circumstances will the station be opened if light rail continues
to operate in that corridor. It also seems like under no
circumstances will the station be viable if a new technology is
installed. Director Walker stated that he fully intended to
support the amendment but he does not think it makes sense
now. He feels it will be better to remove the station than hold
out false hope that the station might be reopened.

BACKGROUND
In accordance with State law, the District submitted its proposed budget to the governing body
by October 15, 2013. By legal notice, the governing body presented the proposed 2014
Requested Budget for public review on October 13, 2013. A public hearing to solicit formal
public comment is scheduled for the November 26, 2013 regular meeting of the Board of
Directors.
DISCUSSION
The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2014 Recommended Budget (combined
Base and FasTracks) is $1,726.4 million. This includes an operating budget of $529.5 million
including interest expense of $99.4 million, capitalized interest of $45.0 million, new capital
expenditures of $870.3 million, debt payments of $61.5 million, FasTracks contingency reserve
of $30.0 million, FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $21.4 million, Board appropriated fund
of $26.5 million, capital replacement fund of $19.3 million, and estimated unrestricted fund
balance of $23.4 million. The previously approved capital (capital carry forward) is $1,063.2
million. The sum of the budget appropriation and capital carry forward is $2,789.6 million.
Overview of the 2014 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues on a combined basis of $996.5 million are expected to increase $43.3 million (4.5%)
in 2014 over the 2013 Amended Budget. The increase is composed primarily of increases in
fare revenue of $5.6 million and sales/use tax revenue of $37.4 million, offset by a small
decrease in grant revenue of $3.8 million.
Total Base System grants are projected to decrease by $3.9 million, including new and carry
forward amounts. Drawdowns on Base System grants totaled $85.0 million in 2013; new grant

Packet Pg. 134

11.A

funding of $81.1 million is projected for 2014. FasTracks grants will essentially remain flat from
2013 due to same level of FFGA funding for the Eagle project, increases in corridor grants for
the US 36 project and the Downtown Circulator, and carry forward funding for the West Line.
Farebox revenues are budgeted to increase $5.6 million or 4.7% based on 2.8% growth in
ridership coupled with a full year of West Line operations in 2014. Sales and use tax revenues
are expected to increase 5.9% over the 2013 projected level according to the most recent
September quarterly forecast by the CU-Leeds School of Business.
Operating expenditures on a combined basis will be down by $25.2 million overall in 2014 from
the 2013 Amended Budget. The decrease is largely due to: 1) completion of FasTracks projects,
2) higher capitalization of FasTracks project salaries, 3) decline in contract maintenance in
FasTracks due to project completion, carryforward, or expense/capital transfers, and 4) reduction
of $11.0 million for a one-time 2013 DUS contribution, offset by: 5) full-year of West Line
operations, and 6) expense projects carry-forward from 2013 totaling $14.1 million. The
expense project carryforward to 2014 is $12.2 million for Base operations and $1.9 million for
FasTracks.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at $3.26 per gallon, which is the same price that was locked in 2013 for
no incremental change. Gasoline is budgeted at $3.54/gallon, which is the same price that was
budgeted in 2013 for no incremental change.
The major changes in operating expense comparing the Recommended Budget to the previous
Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the Requested
Budget are the expense projects carry-forward.
Interest expense in 2014 is budgeted at $99.4 million which is an increase of $19.9 million over
the 2013 Amended Budget. Of the interest expense amount, Base system interest will decrease
$3.0 million due to full year impact of refundings of existing debt at lower interest rates
completed in 2013 offset by new COPs issued in 2013. FasTracks interest expense will
increase $22.9 million due to full-year payments on the I-225 corridor revenue bonds and
estimates for interest expense on new debt issued (see Principal payments below). Capitalized
interest (combined) will increase by $3.9 million to $45.0 million due to continuing completion of
FasTracks construction. Capitalized interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for interest
payments in 2014.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $61.5 million. This is an increase of $15.0 million
over the 2013 Amended Budget due to 1) issuance in the second half of 2013 of FasTracks
revenue bonds for I-225 expansion and Base System COPs for fleet purchases and 2) issuance of
new debt in 2014. Debt proceeds of $720 million are anticipated in 2014 from new debt for
FasTracks consisting of $400 million in revenue bonds for the North Metro rail line, $240 million
in GARVEE interim debt, and $80 million in TIFIA loan draws for the Eagle Project construction.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2013 (previously
approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2014. The
capital carry-forward will be $1,063.2 million made up of $181.0 million on the Base System
and $882.1 million on FasTracks.
New capital spending on a combined basis will increase $103.0 million from the 2013 Amended
Budget due mainly to project construction in FasTracks. New capital spending for FasTracks will

Packet Pg. 135

11.A

increase $129.9 million to $773.1 million in 2014 due to project construction on I-225, North
Metro, and the Eagle project. For the Base System, new capital spending will decrease $26.9
million to $97.2 million. Of this amount, the Base system will spend $10.3 million less in capital
support projects in IT, security, and operations, $19.8 million less on fleet
modernization/expansion, and $6.6 million less on capital support equipment including reductions
in vehicles and maintenance equipment and 16th Street Mall repair local dollars. These
reductions will be offset by $4.8 million more on park-n-ride projects primarily Stapleton, $5.1
million more on LRT transit projects including crossover work, track maintenance equipment,
event recorders, and ADA highblock replacement, and $0.4 million on DUS bus box emergency
barriers.
New capital expenditures for 2014 and the change in new capital in the 2014 Recommended
Budget over the previous 2014 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget Plan are shown in
Attachment B. The capital carry-forward expenditures for 2014 and the change in the capital
carry-forward in the 2014 Recommended Budget over the 2013 Amended Budget are shown in
Attachment C.
Notable designated reserve fund changes include an increase over the 2013 Amended Budget in
the Base System year-end unrestricted fund balance, which is projected to increase $3.7 million
to $18.1 million in line with the SBP. Also on the Base System, the Board-appropriated fund is
projected to increase by $5.0 million to $21.2 million, and the capital replacement fund is
projected to increase by $5.0 million to $14.0 million. While the SBP targets called for an
increase of $3.0 million in each fund, it is proposed that the contribution be raised to $5.0
million to each fund in 2014 due to the additional dollars generated from the higher sales and use
tax forecast.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to remain essentially flat at
$23.4 million. The $3.7 million increase in the Base System’s unrestricted fund balance is offset
by a decrease of $3.3 million on the FasTracks side from the reduction in fund balance from
three months of operating expenses to two months. Both the Board-appropriated fund and the
capital replacement fund on a District-wide basis are projected to increase by $1.7 million each.
These increases are in minimum accordance with fiscal policies for each of the District entities
(Base System, FasTracks Projects, and FasTracks Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.
The FasTracks Construction Reserve is budgeted to decrease $59.4 million in 2014 from the
2013 Amended Budget as a result of the accrual of DTP (Denver Transit Partners) finance
charges and the use of funds for construction purposes. FasTracks contributed capital of $49.8
million, consisting of concessionaire contributed capital and third-party betterments on the Eagle
construction project, will decrease $52.4 million due to DUS project completion in spring 2014.
The 2014 budget reflects continued maintenance of the FasTracks contingency reserve at a
balance of $30 million.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2014 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado
General Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA
farebox revenues divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures
and expenditures incurred for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure)
exceeds the annual target of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.

Packet Pg. 136

11.A

Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2014 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated
fund, a capital replacement fund, and an undesignated working capital fund (the remaining
unrestricted year-end fund balance) for both the Base System and FasTracks. The objective is
for the total of these three funds to equal approximately three months of operating expenses
excluding depreciation for the Base System and two months of same for FasTracks. The 2014
budget reflects continued maintenance of the FasTracks contingency reserve at a balance of $30
million. This reserve has been carried at $30 million since 2010.
The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2014 is projected at $69.3 million on a Districtwide basis, comprised of 1) the Board appropriated fund of $26.5 million, 2) the capital
replacement fund of $19.3 million, and 3) an undesignated working capital fund or remaining
fund balance of $23.4 million. The Base System portion of the three fund balances for 2014 is
projected to total $53.3 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two
exceptions:



Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
Attachments

As noted above, please refer to the attached Fiscal Year 2014 Recommended Budget and Fiscal
Year 2014 Recommended Budget-Fund Balance (Exhibit I) which shows the operating/nonoperating sources, debt and reserves, and capital sources as well as operating uses, capital
expenditures, and fund balances of the District, and a reconciliation of net assets. Also attached
is the Program Capital Summary including previously approved capital, an Operating Budget
Changes Since Posted Budget summary (Attachment A), a New Capital Projects summary
(Attachment B), and Capital Carryforward Expenditures (Attachment C).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2014 Recommended Budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Revise the 2014 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed revisions.
3. Do not adopt the 2014 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended since the District
will not be in compliance with State regulations that require the District to adopt a budget by
December 31, 2013. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2013, State
statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations and maintenance
purposes and objects is deemed reappropriated."

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: October 31, 2013

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

October 30, 2013

Board Meeting Date: November 26, 2013

Subject:

Approval of Tenth Year (2014) Contract
Amendment to Jacobs Engineering for
FasTracks Program Support Consulting

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the tenth year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in the
amount of $23,462,562 for Program Support Services Consulting (PSC) for FasTracks for the year
2014. Funds for the award are contained in the 2014 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks
capital program in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
BACKGROUND
On May 24, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to CarterBurgess (later purchased by Jacobs Engineering) for Program Support Consulting Services at an
initial 2005 Contract amount of $2,360,000, and a Notice to Proceed of July 5, 2005. - Subsequent
contract amendments approved by the RTD Board, along with contract adjustments to reconcile the
contract approvals to actual billings, have brought the current Contract Not-to-Exceed price up to
$127,520,164. The Contract Not-to-Exceed price through the end of 2014 with this contract
amendment would be $150,982,726.
The PSC team provides program management support and specialized technical staff support to
augment RTD FasTracks Team staff. Key PSC staff members are co-located with RTD Staff at the
RTD FasTracks offices. The PSC functions as an extension of RTD staff. This approach adds value,
cost-effectively, by allowing RTD to tap the PSC’s specialized resources in planning, environmental,
design, engineering, construction management support, program control, and related disciplines on
an as-needed, often part-time, basis.
Further, as the focus of the FasTracks program has shifted from planning and design to construction,
the staff resources required for support of the program shift similarly. The PSC role has changed,
and will continue to change, to meet the evolving needs of the FasTracks program. This flexibility
allows RTD to retain the core staff required for implementation of the FasTracks program, without
having to continually (and inefficiently) staff up and then staff down in the planning, design, and
construction management disciplines.
Some of the key deliverables and assistance, in process or received, from the Jacobs/PSC team in
2013 included:




Participation in the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) that resulted in the revised financial plan
that was presented to the Board in February 2013.
Provided key construction management support for the DUS, I-225, US 36 and Eagle Projects.
Provided day-to-day management of the Eagle P3 project, including preparing amendments to the
original contract, project coordination, construction audits, railroad coordination, and coordination
with outside agencies.








Supported the preparation of the Request for Proposal (RFP) for the North Metro Project.
Provided design oversight of the I-225 Project.
Provided ongoing support in Planning, Engineering, Project Controls and DBE/SBE support.
Participated in the FasTracks Environmental Resource Group (FERG), which includes verifying
mitigations from environmental clearance documents.
Maintained the project controls functions including cost, schedule, estimating, change
management, and document control.
Supported ROW design, survey, mapping and acquisition of all projects.

DISCUSSION
The Program Support Services Contract was specified for a term of six years with a six-year option,
to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work tasks. The option was approved by the RTD
Board in November 2011.The purpose of the annual re-negotiation of the contract is to ensure that
specific tasks and deliverables respond to the evolving needs of the FasTracks Program.
The PSC serves as an extension of RTD staff. RTD staff provides overall management and control of
the FasTracks program and administration of this contract. The PSC provides key personnel to a
number of tasks. These assignments are based on focusing the PSC effort to:






Areas of specialized expertise or experience.
Part-time assignments.
Shorter duration efforts.
Positions that are difficult for RTD to fill.
Limit the number of RTD positions that may need to be re-assigned when current projects are
completed.

Each position in the FasTracks organization is evaluated individually to determine whether that
position falls within the above criteria for using a consultant. In addition, before a consultant is
actually brought into the FasTracks program, an assessment is made as to whether the position is
still needed, and an interview is conducted with the appropriate RTD manager(s).
The major program activities in 2014 include the following:





Construction of the Eagle P3 project.
Integrated testing and startup of the DUS project.
Final design and construction of the North Metro Line.
Final design and construction of I-225.

During 2014, the PSC contract identifies the following specific tasks in support of FasTracks:
Program Management
 Provide the full-time support of a Project Controls Manager for the FasTracks Senior management
Team.
 Provide the support of specific project controls positions in schedule, cost co ntrol, estimating and
document control. Provide tracking and monthly schedule and cost updates to each project
manager.
 Provide support of general planning, operations planning, quiet zones, traffic planning, and
noise/vibration mitigation.
 Manage the public comment database.

RTD has established a 7% DBE goal for this Contract. The latest DBE report indicates that the PSC’s
cumulative DBE percentage through year-end 2013 will be 18.5%. For 2014, the PSC has committed to
23.9% DBE participation, well in excess of the 7% goal, which would bring the projected DBE
percentage through year-end 2014 to 19.4%. Additionally, while not in their contract, the PSC has
committed to continuing their participation in the WIN program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the PSC contract from 2005 through 2014 would be
$150,982,726 with this amendment. Funds for the 2014 contract award in the amount of
$23,462,562 are included in the 2014 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in
the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the eighth year
contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in the amount of $23,462,562 for Program Support
Services Consulting (PSC) for FasTracks for the year 2014. Funds for the award are contained in
the 2014 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where
PSC support would be utilized.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
eighth year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering. Rather, perform all the work in -house
with RTD staff. This is not recommended as RTD does not have the staff to provide a sufficient
level of expertise in a cost-effective approach to manage the FasTracks Program (As described in
the Background section, the PSC team can provide the technical specialties on an as needed
basis).
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Re-solicit this work to another consulting team. This is
not recommended as the PSC is satisfactorily performing its work assignments and providing
valuable technical and project management assistance to the RTD team.
Selection of alternatives two or three would delay the implementation of the FasTrack s Program as
there would be a major loss of continuity on the program.

Approval of Contract Amendment to Front
Range Systems Consultants (FRSC) for
FasTracks Systems Engineering Consultant
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks monitoring committee that the Board of Directors approve a
Contract Amendment with Front Range Systems Consultants (FRSC) in the amount of $10,566,646 for
the year 2014, bringing the total contract authorization to $64,309,557. Funds for the contract award
are included in the 2014 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects
where FRSC support would be utilized.
BACKGROUND
In April 2005, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for professional services for a Systems
Engineering Consultant for the overall FasTracks Systems Engineering Services. On September 20,
2005 the RTD Board approved the selection and award to FRSC for the Systems Engineering work for a
six year term and an option for another six years. The RTD Board approved exercising the six year option
in November 2012
FRSC has successfully performed the stated tasks outlined in the original Scope of Work. Specific
systems design and support scope in their contract includes traction electrification system (TES)
including overhead contact system (OCS) and traction power substations (TPSS), train control,
communication and central control system, corrosion control, systemwide electrical, rail vehicles, and
operation planning support. FRSC has worked with RTD staff in a number of areas:







Provided construction management support for the West Corridor Project
Provided Systems Engineering & Construction Management Support on the Eagle Project
Provided construction management support on the Substation Programmable Logic Controller
Upgrade Project
Completed the design documents for the I225 Project Provided Systems Engineering Support on
the On-Call Systems Engineering Contract
Provided construction management support for the Denver Union Station Project
Provided Systems Engineering Support for the North Metro Project

DISCUSSION
The RTD selected a single Systems Engineering Consultant for the entire FasTracks Program for
consistency and standardization of design. This approach will save the RTD cost and will facilitate the
operation and maintenance of the system. The initial contract award was for the final design services
for the West Corridor and evaluation of commuter rail vehicle type. The work effort is consistent with
the work required to move each corridor forward and maintain the FasTracks schedule. In particular,
FRSC will support RTD’s Systems Engineering staff on managing SE Extension, DUS, I-225, North
Metro, and Eagle Projects. The agreed upon Scope of Work for the Contract Amendment and associated
deliverables are as follows:

RTD began negotiations with the Front Range Systems Consultants on September 9, 2013. We have
successfully concluded the negotiations with a contract price of $10,566,646 for the work to be
completed in 2014.
The DBE goal for this contract was set at 10%. To date FRSC has achieved a 15.7% DBE goal. Front
Range Systems Consultants has proposed a 15.4% DBE goal for the 2014 work, exceeding the RTD
proposed goal of 10%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the contract award are included in the 2014 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital
program.

Approval of Tenth Year (2014) Contract
Amendment to Delcan for FasTracks Quality
Management Consultant Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the tenth year Contract Amendment for Delcan in the amount of
$1,700,000 for Quality Management Consulting Services for FasTracks for the year 2014. Funds for
the amendment are contained in the 2014 RTD FasTracks Budget.
BACKGROUND
On June 28, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to Delcan for
Quality Management Consulting Services at an initial 2005 contract price of $418,539, and a Notice to
Proceed of August 1, 2005. This contract was set up to run for an initial six-year term, re-negotiated

On November 17, 2009, the RTD Board approved a sixth year contract amendment for 2010. The
actual cost proposal for the 2010 workscope was $1,400,000; but because of cumulative budget
underruns from previous years, the total Contract Not-to-Exceed price only needed to be increased by
$600,000 in order to deliver the 2010 work.
On November 23, 2010, the Board approved a seventh year contract amendment for 2011 in the
amount of $1,550,000, and authorized a six year option included in the original contract.

for FasTracks for the year 2014. Funds for the amendment are contained in the 2014 RTD
FasTracks Budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
tenth year contract amendment to Delcan. Rather, perform all of the work in-house with RTD staff.
This is not recommended, as RTD doesn’t have certain skills required to fully develop the Quality
Management program.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
tenth year contract amendment to Delcan. Rather, re-solicit and award this work to another
consulting team. This is not recommended, as Delcan is satisfactorily performing its work
assignments and providing valuable quality management assistance to the RTD team.
4. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to award the tenth
year contract to Delcan. Rather, transfer this work scope to the Program Support Consultant. This is
not recommended, as the Quality Management Consultant was originally established separately from
the Program Support Consultant to provide a level of independence.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the 2014 Contract Amendment for Kumar and Associates, thereby
exercising the first of five (5) one-year options and extending the contract term through December 31,
2014.
BACKGROUND
On July 15, 2008, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to Kumar and
Associates at a Not to Exceed price of $5,000,000 and a Notice to Proceed of August 1, 2008. The
initial Period of Performance ran through December 31, 2013, with the provision of five option years to
be exercised at RTD’s discretion. This contract is re-negotiated and amended annually, based on the
needs of the program.
Although the original Not-to-Exceed price has not yet been reached, the initial Period of Performance
will end December 31, 2013. Therefore, this amendment is necessary to extend their services for
another year. The Not-to-Exceed price shall remain at $5,000,000.
Some of the key deliverables and assistance received from Kumar and Associates during the initial Period
of Performance include:


Verification testing of construction materials testing, contractor audits, and special inspections
for:
o West Rail Line
o Wadsworth Parking Structure
o Sheridan Parking Structure
o Denver Union Station
o East Corridor
o Gold Line
o Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility
o Northwest Rail Electrified Segment
o US36 – Table Mesa pnR

DISCUSSION
The Construction Materials Testing and Inspection Services contract was specified for an initial term of
five years, with five one-year options, to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work scope.
The purpose of the annual re-negotiation of the contract was to ensure that specific tasks and
deliverables responded to RTD’s capital program needs. For 2014, Kumar will provide Verification or

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the 2014 Contract

the Strategic Budget Plan.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to exercise the
contract option and approve the 2014 contract amendment to Kumar and Associates. Rather,
perform all of the work in-house with RTD staff. This is not recommended, as RTD doesn’t have the
facilities or technical skills required to operate a certified materials testing laboratory.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to exercise the
contract option and approve the 2014 contract amendment to Kumar and Associates. Rather, resolicit and award this work to another consulting team. This is not recommended, as Kumar and
Associates is satisfactorily performing its work assignments and providing valuable quality
management assistance to the RTD team. Also, Kumar and Associates has avoided seeking work
with RTD’s project contractors, in an effort to avoid conflicts of interest.

2014 FasTracks Public Information Consultant

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the second one-year option to the Virtegic Group Incorporated as
the FasTracks Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the
period of performance through 2014. The scope of work is negotiated annually between RTD and the

This contract amendment is for an amount not to exceed $487,308.80 for the year 2014. Funds for
the award are contained in the 2014 FasTracks Budget.
BACKGROUND
In October 2011, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for a Public Information, Communications a nd
Public Outreach Consultant to serve as an extension of staff in the implementation of the FasTracks
Public Information Program. Following a comprehensive evaluation process, Virtegic Group
Incorporated, a certified SBE firm, was selected for this contract award.
The procurement was set up as a one-year contract award with four one-year options, negotiated
annually by RTD and Consultant Staff and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors. This gives
RTD the opportunity to assess and address the public information and outreach needs of the
FasTracks program on an annual basis as the program evolves. The services needed through this
contract may be reduced or embellished from year to year depending on the future financial situation
and changing needs of the FasTracks program.
Virtegic began its work effort in January 2012 and put forth an extensive effort to become oriented
with RTD, the FasTracks program and the Public Information Team in a timely manner. The RTD
Board approved the first of four one-year options and awarded a contract to the Virtegic Group for
2013. In the two years of working as the FasTracks PIC so far, the Virtegic team members have
satisfactorily performed their work assignments.
DISCUSSION
The initial contract to Virtegic for 2012 was in the amount of $451,459.20. The first one-year
option for 2013 was $485,167.20. The second one-year option for 2014 is $487,308.80 bringing
the total on this contract to $1,423,935.20.

100 percent of the work effort on this contract is SBE-performed given that Virtegic is a
certified SBE.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for this second one-year option are included in the 2014 FasTracks budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the second one -year
option to the Virtegic Group Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information, Communications

not to exceed $487,308.80 for the year 2014. Funds for the award are contained in the 2014
FasTracks Budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the Public Information Consultant approach.
This is not recommended as RTD doesn’t currently have the staff to provide a sufficient level of
resources to meet the public information, communications and public outreach needs of the
FasTracks program. This alternative would delay and negatively impact the effective
implementation of the FasTracks Public Information Program.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
second one-year option to Virtegic Group. Issue another Request for Proposals for professional
services for Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach for the FasTracks Program
and award a contract to another consulting team. This is not recommended as the Virtegic team
is satisfactorily performing its work, and this alternative will delay and negatively impact the
successful implementation of the various strategies and activities associated with a
comprehensive and multi-layered communications effort.

North Metro Rail Line Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) with the City of Commerce
City

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the City of Commerce
City (C3) and the Regional Transportation District. The agreement includes specific terms defining C3’s
local agency contribution, coordination, and the rights and responsibilities of each party within the
Commerce City boundaries.
BACKGROUND
As part of the FasTracks Plan, RTD proposes to construct the North Metro Rail Line, consisting of
electric commuter rail transit connecting Denver Union Station with Adams County, the City and County
of Denver, the City of Thornton, the City of Northglenn, and the City of Commerce City, identified in the
FasTracks Plan and more fully described in the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Project
dated January 2011 as approved by the Record of Decision for the Project signed by the Federal Transit
Administration on April 22, 2011 and the final design plans.
The FasTracks Financial Plan assumes and requires a two and one-half percent (2.5%) local agency
contribution from local jurisdictions in the RTD district in consideration for the construction of transit
improvements that will benefit the City and its citizens and the other governmental entities along the
NMRL.
DISCUSSION
This IGA between C3 and RTD establishes the local agency contribution amount for C3 and how that
local agency contribution will be met. The IGA sets forth the commitments from RTD and C3 regarding
financial obligations, responsibilities, coordination, and cooperation between both agencies with respect
to the North Metro Rail Line within the City’s boundaries.
Local Agency contribution
The total local agency contribution shall not exceed two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the cost of the
Project. The cost of the Project for the purposes of establishing the local agency contribution is Nine
Hundred and Nine Million Dollars ($909,000,000) in year of expenditure dollars. Therefore, the total
local agency contribution is Twenty-Two Million Seven Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars
($22,725,000), to be shared by and between by Adams County, the City and County of Denver, and the
Cities of Thornton, Northglenn, and Commerce City and, accordingly, the City’s local agency
contribution is Four Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,700,000).
The IGA stipulates that the $4.7M will be covered by one or more of the following:
1. A lump sum cash payment.
2. Annual cash payments.
3. The value of project permits and fees for plan review.

Packet Pg. 183

12.G

4. The value of City staff time required to perform necessary activities associated with planning,
design, construction and inspection of the Project.
5. The value of utility relocation credits due to the City if relocation of public utilities is necessitated
by construction of the Project.
6. The fair market value of real property interests owned or controlled by the C3 that are identified
by RTD and the C3 as required to implement and operate the Project and granted or conveyed to
RTD by the C3. The value of customary fees including storm water utility fees and water tap fees
and sales/use taxes that are legally required to be paid by RTD or the contractors that may be
rebated by the City.
7. The cost of mutually agreed construction projects that are necessary for the NMRL from funding
sources secured by the City (exclusive of Betterments).
Commerce City shall complete the Local Agency Contribution to RTD no later than the first day of NMRL
commuter rail revenue service to the 72nd Avenue Station.
Additional items included in the IGA include:
 Permitting, design plan review, construction review and inspection processes.
 Utility relocation responsibilities and processes.
 Design criteria requirements and design review responsibilities are identified including, but not
limited to, transit system elements, storm sewer, water quality, parking and traffic mitigation,
quiet zones, and station aesthetics.
 RTD will design and construct emergency access on the north side of the 72 nd Avenue station
park-n-Ride so as to not preclude future vehicular public access to the station. Any
improvements to 72 nd Avenue, including bridge replacement for signalization will not be the
responsibility of RTD.
 Process for project betterment determination and funding.
 RTD will petition to annex RTD property into the City of Commerce City.
Summary
IGAs are required with the City of Commerce City, as with other jurisdictions along the North Metro
corridor, in order to define the respective rights and responsibilities of each party, and to define the local
agency share credit. The recommendation is to authorize the General Manager to execute this agreement
defining those rights and responsibilities of RTD and Commerce City with respect to the North Metro Rail
Line project. The signed IGA defines coordination between RTD and the City of Commerce City for the
North Metro project and demonstrates that right-of-way and other coordination responsibilities have been
defined.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial elements of the IGA are funded in the project budget for the North Metro Rail Line project.
The $4.7 million local agency contribution is a part of the project financial plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) between the City of Commerce City (C3) and the Regional Transportation District.

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This could cause delays in project implementation as well
as budget impacts of $4.7M. In addition, an IGA is required to provide for FasTracks-required local
match determination, property acquisitions from C3 needed for the project, and responsibilities and
coordination. This action is not recommended.

local agency contribution is Twenty-Two Million Seven Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars
($22,725,000), to be shared by and between by Adams County, the City and County of Denver, and the
Cities of Commerce City, Northglenn, and Thornton and, accordingly, the City’s local agency
contribution is Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000).

improvements that will benefit the City and its citizens and the other governmental entities along the
NMRL.
DISCUSSION
This IGA between CON and RTD establishes the local agency contribution amount for CON and how that
local agency contribution will be met. The IGA sets forth the commitments from RTD and CON regarding
financial obligations, responsibilities, coordination, and cooperation between both agencies with respect
to the North Metro Rail Line within the City’s boundaries.
Local Agency Contribution
The total local agency contribution shall not exceed two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the cost of the
Project. The cost of the Project for the purposes of establishing the local agency contribution is Nine
Hundred and Nine Million Dollars ($909,000,000) in year of expenditure dollars. Therefore, the total
local agency contribution is Twenty-Two Million Seven Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars
($22,725,000), to be shared by and between by Adams County, the City and County of Denver, and the
Cities of Commerce City, Northglenn, and Thornton and, accordingly, the City’s local agency
contribution is Two Million Five Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars ($2,520,000).
The IGA stipulates that the $2.52M will be covered by one or more of the following:
1. A lump sum cash payment.
2. Annual cash payments.
3. The value of Project Permits and fees for plan review.

Packet Pg. 189

12.I

4. The value of City staff time required to perform necessary activities associated with planning,
design, construction and inspection of the Project.
5. The value of utility relocation credits due to the City if relocation of public utilities is necessitated
by construction of the Project.
6. The fair market value of real property interests owned or controlled by the CON that are identified
by RTD and the CON as required to implement and operate the Project and granted or conveyed
to RTD by the CON.
7. The value of customary fees including storm water utility fees and water tap fees and sales/use
taxes that are legally required to be paid by RTD or the Contractors that may be rebated by the
City.
8. The cost of mutually agreed construction projects that are necessary for the NMRL from funding
sources secured by the City (exclusive of Betterments).
The City shall complete the Local Agency Contribution payment to RTD no later than the start of NMRL
commuter rail revenue service to the City.
The following items are also addressed in the IGA:
 112th Ave. to Irma Drive Roadway Improvements: The City has designed, and plans to construct
in 2014, roadway improvements that are consistent with the Base Project traffic mitigations
measures. Upon completion and dedication of the roadway improvements, the City will receive
credit toward the Local Agency Contribution in the amount of RTD’s mitigation responsibility for
roadway improvements.
 Permitting, design plan review, construction review and inspection processes are identified.
 Utility relocation responsibilities and processes are identified.
 Design criteria requirements and responsibilities are identified including, but not limited to,
transit system elements, storm sewer, water quality, parking and traffic mitigation, quiet
zones, and station aesthetics.
 Process for project betterment determination and funding are identified.
SUMMARY
IGAs are required with the City of Northglenn, as with other jurisdictions along the North Metro corridor,
in order to define the respective rights and responsibilities of each party, and to define the local agency
share credit. The recommendation is to authorize the General Manager to execute this agreement
defining those rights and responsibilities of RTD and Northglenn with respect to the North Metro Rail
Line project. The signed IGA defines coordination between RTD and the City of Northglenn for the North
Metro project and demonstrates that right-of-way and other coordination responsibilities have been
defined.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial elements of the IGA are funded in the project budget for the North Metro Rail Line project.
The local agency contribution of $2,520,000 from the City of Northglenn is part of the project financial
plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) between the City of Northglenn (CON) and the Regional Transportation District. The
agreement includes specific terms defining the City of Northglenn’s local agency contribution,
coordination, and the rights and responsibilities of each party within the Northglenn boundaries.

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This could cause delays in project implementation as well
as budget impacts of $2.52M. In addition, an IGA is required to provide for FasTracks-required local
match determination, property acquisitions from CON needed for the project, and responsibilities and
coordination. This action is not recommended.

North Metro Rail Line Intergovernmental
Agreement
(IGA)
with
the
Colorado
Department of Transportation (CDOT)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the Colorado
Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the Regional Transportation District (RTD). The agreement
includes specific terms defining the coordination between CDOT and RTD and the rights and
responsibilities of each party associated with the construction of the North Metro Rail Line especially
regarding interface with the state highway system.
BACKGROUND
As part of the FasTracks Plan, RTD proposes to construct the North Metro Rail Line, consisting of
electric commuter rail transit connecting Denver Union Station with Adams County, the City and County
of Denver, the City of Commerce City, the City of Thornton, and the City of Northglenn, identified in the
FasTracks Plan and more fully described in the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Project
dated January 2011 as approved by the Record of Decision for the Project signed by the Federal Transit
Administration on April 22, 2011 and the final design plans.
The Parties have previously executed a Master Intergovernmental Agreement dated April 20, 2004 (the
"Master IGA") which addresses the need for CDOT and RTD to cooperate and coordinate regarding the
design, funding and construction of improvements to major transportation corridors that are a part of
RTD's FasTracks mass transit program so as to enhance all modes of transportation in those major
transportation corridors. Pursuant to the Master IGA, the Parties have committed to execute specific
intergovernmental agreements for each major transportation corridor that is part of RTD's FasTracks
program. The intergovernmental agreements for each major transportation corridor are intended to
address impacts of RTD's FasTracks mass transit improvements on existing or planned CDOT highway
improvements within each corridor. The specific IGAs for each corridor must address:
o physical, operational, safety, regulatory, and design impacts of RTD's transit facilities on
existing or proposed CDOT highway facilities in the major transportation corridor;
o design and construction management staff for each of the Parties that also identifies
responsibilities for overseeing the design and construction of improvements in the major
transportation corridor;
o terms and conditions upon which RTD utilizes existing CDOT-owned rights-of-way for its
mass transit improvements; and
o funding obligations and adjustments among the Parties for improvements being
constructed that affect the parties proposed or future planned transportation
improvements.
This IGA is one of the corridor specific agreements contemplated by the Master IGA and sets forth the
rights, duties and responsibilities of the Parties with respect to the design, construction, operation, and
maintenance of the Project and the crossings of, and impacts to, CDOT facilities and property.

Packet Pg. 192

12.J

DISCUSSION
The planned alignment for the North Metro Corridor is adjacent to, and in some cases within, CDOTowned right of way within the state highway system (“CDOT ROW”). The alignment crosses under
Interstate Highway 70, runs alongside Brighton Boulevard (State Highway 265), and crosses Interstate
Highway 270, Interstate Highway 76, 74th Avenue (State Highway 224), and 160th Avenue (State
Highway 7) (collectively, the “Interstate Crossings” or the “Crossings”). If CDOT is satisfied that the
Crossings will not impair the function, operation or safety of CDOT facilities, CDOT may request
authorization from the Federal Highway Administration (“FHWA”) for RTD to use the Interstate
Crossings and will itself authorize use of the other Crossings. RTD acknowledges that 23 C.F.R. Part
810, Subpart C requires CDOT to obtain authorization from the FHWA to allow RTD to use CDOT ROW
at the Crossings, and that such FHWA authorization is premised upon CDOT’s determination that RTD’s
proposed use will not impair the safety of highway users or future proposed or planned highway
improvements identified in the 2035 RTP. If RTD facilities or operations are expanded beyond what is
identified in the EIS, RTD will be responsible for additional analysis, and may be responsible for
additional improvements or mitigations and additional approvals as a result. Once RTD satisfies CDOT’s
concerns, CDOT will seek FHWA authorization for any additional use of CDOT ROW. Upon receipt of
such authorization, CDOT will promptly notify RTD that the Crossings may be utilized for construction,
operation, ownership, and maintenance of the Project.
The Project alignment for the Corridor includes screening on the Interstate Highway 70, Interstate
Highway 76, and State Highway 224 bridges to protect against contact with commuter rail electrified
elements, and crash walls at Interstate Highway 76, which have been constructed as part of a previous
project. Crash walls will also be required at SH 224 if and when the Project in this area includes double
tracking. Based on final design, additional screening or crash walls may be required along the project
limits pursuant to CDOT design standards and may require FHWA authorization.
Other items included in this IGA include but are not limited to:
o The contractors’ responsibility to remain within the identified project envelope and the
contractors’ responsibility to coordinate with CDOT and comply with all regulations if a variance
is requested;
o The responsibility and obligation for CDOT and RTD representatives and contractors to coordinate
and cooperate on all design and construction elements where CDOT properties are affected;
o The responsibility and obligation for all parties to follow federal and state laws and regulations
regarding upgrading of existing CDOT facilities to new standards;
o The rights and responsibilities of the parties regarding CDOT right-of-way, and permanent and
temporary access agreements;
o CDOT’s responsibility for funding discretionary changes requested by them;
o Roles and responsibilities for CDOT design review, construction inspection, auditing, permits,
construction management;
o CDOT staff required to review all plans and specifications related to state highway impacts
through final design and construction and related financial responsibility;
o RTD’s responsibilities regarding a safety and security management plan and public information
plan;
o Roles and responsibilities for following CDOT design criteria regarding CDOT facilities and process
for final inspection and acceptance of CDOT permitted project elements;
o The roles and responsibilities of the parties regarding operations, maintenance, bridge inspections,
insurance and following the statewide contract management system.

Summary
IGAs are required with the CDOT, as with other jurisdictions along the North Metro corridor, in order to
define the respective rights and responsibilities of each party. The recommendation is to authorize the
General Manager to sign and execute this agreement defining those rights and responsibilities of RTD
and CDOT with respect to the North Metro Rail Line project. The signed IGA defines coordination
between RTD and CDOT for the North Metro project and demonstrates that right-of-way and other
coordination responsibilities have been defined.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial elements of the IGA are funded in the project budget for the North Metro Rail Line project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) between the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the Regional
Transportation District (RTD). The agreement includes specific terms defining the coordination
between CDOT and RTD and the rights and responsibilities of each party associated with the
construction of the North Metro Rail Line especially regarding interface with the state highway
system.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This could cause delays in project implementation. In
addition, an IGA is required to provide for property acquisitions from CDOT needed for the project,
and responsibilities and coordination. This action is not recommended.

Federal Liaison Services Contract Renewal

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the RTD Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement (for federal liaison services) with Patton Boggs
LLP to exercise a one-year option (February 1, 2014 through January 31, 2015) to extend Contract No.
19-DX-001, at a cost of $258,000. Funding for this contract is included in the 2014 budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Federal Liaison Services was issued on October 20, 2009. Eight
responsive proposals were received, and they were evaluated by a Board Ad Hoc Committee and
subsequently referred to the Executive Committee on December 10, 2009. The Executive
Committee unanimously recommended that Patton Boggs LLP be offered a new contract which
provided for a one-year base price with four one-year option periods. The referenced extension
covers the period from February 1, 2014, to January 31, 2015, and is the fourth and final option in
this contract. In addition to constant monitoring of Congressional and Executive Branch activities,
status reports are issued and special reports are prepared when required by the Board of Directors or
the General Manager. Annually, or as required, meetings with the Board of Directors are also held.
DISCUSSION
Constant monitoring of federal legislative activities that relate to RTD is required, and RTD’s interests
must be conveyed to appropriate members of Congress, including the Colorado delegation and other
key Congressional committee members. When RTD has a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) in
place as it now does (Eagle P3 Project), the annual appropriations process requires intense attention
to committee hearings and to the status of the Congressional budget process.
The current transportation funding bill, MAP-21, went into effect on October 1, 2012. The
regulations and rules for implementing this funding bill are still being drafted and implemented.
Patton Boggs will play a key role in advising RTD as to the contents of the bill and monitoring the
rule-making process. As drafts are circulated, special attention must be paid to the impacts to RTD.
With the buildout of FasTracks, the lobbyists will monitor discussions regarding the new funding bill
and will be especially attentive to the federal financing needs for the new corridors and potential
grant opportunities.
In addition, as the US Department of Transportation offers more discretionary grant opportunities,
extensive contacts with the Colorado Congressional delegation, as well as Executive Branch staff,
are required, including the Department of Transportation (the Federal Transit Administration and the
Federal Railroad Administration). The federal lobbyist group provides guidance and assistance in
applying for and receiving these federal funds from the Department of Transportation and other
agency grants for which RTD qualifies as an applicant.
The annual cost for this fourth year option is $258,000.

Packet Pg. 195

12.K

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Government Relations Committee’s Recommended Action to exercise a one-year
option (February 1, 2014 through January 31, 2015) with Patton Boggs LLP.
2. Continue the contract on a month-to-month basis, if amenable to the current Contractor
(Patton Boggs LLP). This option is not recommended because continuity and stability in
liaison services is an important consideration.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and issue a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for
Federal Liaison Services. This option is not recommended because the RFP process was
properly utilized for this procurement.

Local Government Liaison Services Contract
Renewal

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager to enter into an agreement for Local Government Liaison services with CRL Associates,
Inc. (CRL) to exercise a one-year option (January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014) to extend
Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a cost of $116,496. Funding for this contract is included in the 2014
budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Local Government Liaison services was issued on October 20, 2011.
Eight responsive proposals were received for evaluation. Three of the teams were interviewed by a
procurement panel, and a recommendation was subsequently referred to the Executive Committee on
December 15, 2011. The Executive Committee unanimously approved the recommendation that CRL
Associates, Inc. be offered a contract which provided for a one-year base price with four (4) one-year
option periods. The referenced extension covers the period from January 1, 2014, to December 31,
2014, and is the second option in this contract. CRL will also provide Citizens Advisory Committee
(CAC) liaison services. The Government Relations Committee will make future annual recommendations
to the Board of Directors at the end of each contract period regarding the exercise of future option
periods.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the elected officials and
staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and
economic development organizations. This team has a broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns,
as well as an extensive network of relationships with local governments, elected officials, and
stakeholders along the Front Range.
As part of the Local Government Liaison services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and the
Chairman of the Board to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and
county levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular
outreach to the business community and economic development organizations in the Metro area to
develop partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues of concern.
CRL will represent RTD at meetings at the local level of government and provide professional advice,
counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local government activities as they relate to RTD. CRL will also
provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for this one-year contract award ($116,496) are included in the 2014 Adopted Budget for the
FasTracks program.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement to exercise
a one-year option for Local Government Liaison services with CRL Associates, Inc. (January 1,
2014 through December 31, 2014).
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to enter into an
agreement to exercise a one-year option for the Local Government Liaison services. A new
Request for Proposals could be sent to interested parties, and a new Local Government Liaison
firm could be retained. This action is not recommended because CRL Associates, Inc. has been
very effective in assisting RTD with local government matters in the past, and this group is very
familiar with RTD’s issues and policies.

Approval of Boundary Mapping Contract Option
- Farnsworth Group

Assistant

Date: October 30, 2013
General

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 26, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to exercise a two-year
contract option to Farnsworth Group for an extension of the existing boundary mapping contract through
2015 in an amount not to exceed $70,900 in 2014 and $72,700 for 2015 which would make the total
contract amount, including past year amounts, $438,700.
BACKGROUND
The contract was awarded to Farnsworth Group in late 2009 following a competitive bid of 5 submitted
proposals. Farnsworth provides RTD with boundary mapping services. These services include tracking
annexations by jurisdictions along the District’s boundaries, and the corresponding changes to the
respective Director Districts, as well as ensuring RTD is up to date with the appropriate precinct rolls by
county for each Director District.
The contract included five option years; this requested action would be to exercise the fourth and fifthyear options. The Contract Not-To-Exceed amount for 2014 is $70,900 and for 2015 it is $72,700 for a
total of $143,600 for the two-year period.
DISCUSSION
The contract support is critical to RTD so that staff is able to maintain an accurate, up-to-date boundary
map which allows RTD to determine which residents and businesses are in or out of the District thereby
assuring accurate RTD’s sales tax collections. Also, the boundary map is used to determine who should
be awarded in-District parking privileges and who should be required to pay out-of-District rates.
Additionally, counties within the District often modify precinct boundaries. It is imperative for RTD to
have the most up-to-date precinct boundaries whenever a general or special election is required so that
RTD can certify the precinct list for the respective Director District.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Cost to the District to exercise the option from Farnsworth Group is for an amount not to exceed
$70,900 in 2014 and $72,700 in 2015 for a total of $143,600 over the two-year period. Sufficient
funding has been included in the Planning 2014 expense budget for the 2014. Funding for 2015 will be
included in the Planning 2015 expense budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute
all documents necessary to exercise a two-year contract option to Farnsworth Group for an
extension of the existing boundary mapping contract through 2015 in an amount not to exceed

Packet Pg. 204

12.N

$70,900 in 2014 and $72,700 for 2015 which would make the total contract amount, including
past year amounts, $438,700.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the option to extend the contract with
Farnsworth Group. This action is not recommended for the following reasons:
i.
RTD will not be able to determine when annexations have occurred by local jurisdictions
along the District boundary and will thereby lose sales taxes generated in newly annexed
areas; and
ii.
RTD will not be able to accurately determine who should be awarded in-District parking
privileges and who should be required to pay out-of-District rates; and
iii.
RTD will not have an accurate list of County precincts and will not be able to certify
precinct lists for Director Districts for regularly scheduled or special elections thereby
compromising the election process.

Award Contract to Purchase Video Event
Recorders for Bus Safe Driving Management

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to award the contract to SmartDrive Systems of San
Diego, CA, for the purchase of up to 600 event recorder systems and five (5) years of managed services
to host and review data, provide event management in web application and produce driving behavior
reports to allow coaching of drivers on safe driving and accident reduction.
BACKGROUND
The safe driving management system is made up of onboard recording equipment and back office data
review and evaluation. The onboard equipment consists of an event recorder mounted on the bus
windshield with outward and inward facing cameras controlled by an onboard computer. The system
records video, audio, GPS location, speed, and accelerations in all three axes. The system saves data 15
seconds before and 15 seconds after an event. An event is triggered either automatically by preset
parameters, like g-forces being out of normal range signifying an impact or unusual maneuver of some
sort, or by the driver manually initiating the recording. Data for these events are uploaded to the service
provider each night and reviewed for the cause and severity of the event. The information is filtered,
prioritized and then fed back to RTD to enable effective coaching with the drivers.
Driver coaching based on data from video-based data recorders has been shown to reduce risky driving
behaviors. Poor behaviors can be addressed and good behaviors reinforced. The coaching process to
reduce poor driving behaviors will result in fewer accidents, more comfortable rides, and safer buses. In
addition, the system has been shown to provide objective data to document the cause of accidents for
reducing false claims.
The Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued on June 11, 2013 for the procurement of a Video-Based
Fleet Safety Management Solution.

DISCUSSION
Proposals were received from two (2) companies: SmartDrive Systems and DriveCam. The proposals
were rated according to their proposed costs and company technical ability. SmartDrive was the lowest
cost proposal. It also showed compliance with RTD's technical requirements, to include the provisions
for connecting systems to our onboard mobile router for data transfer to WIFI cloud available in each of
the bus garages, and interfacing with RTD's new CAD/AVL system to retrieve driver assignment data.
DriveCam's system is lacking the WIFI transfer. It uses a cellular connection for data transfer, which
requires recurring cellular phone fees and contributes to their higher proposed cost. In addition, their
proposal did not detail how they would document driver bus assignments.

RTD has used two approaches to reduce the cost of this system. First, RTD requires the integration
with the existing onboard mobile router for daily data transfer via WIFI cloud, thus eliminating recurring
cellular fees. Second, RTD will use in-house personnel for the equipment installations.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

This contract is for the purchase of up to 600 sets of onboard equipment and five years of managed
services to host and review event data, manage the events in a web application, and provide reports and
program reviews. The funding for the equipment purchase is approved and available in the District's
2013 Adopted Budget. Funding for year one is included in the District's 2014 Proposed Budget and the
following years will be included on an ongoing basis. Total not to exceed costs are $268,055 for the
equipment and $201,600 per year for five (5) years of managed services.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There was no DBE requirement for work performed under this contract.

ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager to award a contract to SmartDrive Systems for the purchase of up
to 600 event recorder systems and for five (5) years of managed services to host and review data,
provide event management in web application and provide reports. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Award the contract to the DriveCam, the second high rated proposal. This is not the recommended
action as it would contradict with RTD's procurement practice.
3. Do not authorize the award of the contract. This is not desirable as it would not provide the expected
safety benefit to our drivers, passengers and communities.
4. Do not authorize the award of the contract and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would
result, at the very least, in a delay in the expected benefits and may increase the cost of the project.

Award of Access-a-Ride Services Contracts

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into contracts for the provision of Access-aRide services using dedicated (RTD owned) vehicles with MV Transportation, Horizon Coach Lines, and
Via Mobility Services. These contracts are for three years, with two one-year options for a 5-year, with
a cumulative not-to-exceed cost of $145,700,972 for Access-a-Ride service and $28,125,117 for
Access-a-Ride fuel, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $173,826,089. The contract amounts by
service provider are as follows: MV Transportation - $66,279,862 for service, $14,062,559 for fuel,
for a total not-to-exceed amount of $80,342,421; Horizon Coach Lines - $42,484,584 for service,
$7,031,279 for fuel, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $49,515,863; and Via Mobility Services $36,936,526 for service, $7,031,279 for fuel, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $43,967,805. The
committee further recommends that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his
designee, to enter into a contract for the provision of Access-a-Ride services with non-dedicated
(contractor provided) vehicles with Veolia Transportation on Demand. This contract is for three years,
with two one-year options for a total 5-year, not-to-exceed amount of $9,811,727. Fuel for this
contract is included in the total contract price. These proposals represent the most responsive and
responsible proposals received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-DH-035, to provide
Access-a-Ride Services.
BACKGROUND
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that public entities operating a fixed route system
also provide paratransit service to individuals with disabilities that is comparable to the level of service
provided to individuals without disabilities. RTD adheres to the U.S. Department of Transportation, Part
37 regulations (Transportation for Individuals with Disabilities) which regulate paratransit services. All
policies regarding services were developed in concert with a citizen advisory committee comprised of
individuals from the disabled community. The original design of the Access-a-Ride program was adopted
by the RTD Board of Directors and was forwarded to the Federal Transit Administration for their
approval.
The current Access-a-Ride structure consists of one Call Center Contractor and four Service Provider
Contractors. First Transit operates the Call Center while Global Transportation, Horizon Coach Lines,
MV Transportation, and Via Mobility Services provide the service. In addition, all paratransit eligibility
functions are handled under contract with Easter Seals of Colorado. The current Access-a-Ride service
provider contracts are currently scheduled to expire December 31, 2013.
On August 16, 2013, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals
to provide Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services. Proposers had the option of bidding on 50%, 25%,
or 16.6% of the Access-a-Ride service and up to two packages of Call-n-Ride service. This service
represents the re-bid of service currently provided by Global Transportation, Horizon Coach Lines, MV
Transportation, and Via Mobility Services. The RFP was available on the RTD external website for public

Packet Pg. 209

12.P

download. In addition, announcements were placed in transit publications. Proposals were due on
September 20, 2013.
DISCUSSION
Twelve (12) proposals were received in response to RFP 13-DH-035 for the Provision of Access-a-Ride
services. Proposals were received from Apple Bus Company, First Transit, Global Transportation, Horizon
Coach Lines, McDonald Transit Associates, MV Transportation, Ride Right, SCR Medical Transportation,
Trinity Transit, Veolia Transportation and Veolia Transportation on Demand (separate proposals for both
dedicated and non-dedicated vehicle service), and Via Mobility Services (formerly known as Special
Transit).
It is the recommendation of the evaluation committee formed to evaluate proposals received in response
to RFP 13-DH-035, that RTD award contracts for the Access-a-Ride service provision to MV
Transportation (50% of the revenue hours), Horizon Coach Lines (25% of the revenue hours), and Via
Mobility Services (25% of the revenue hours). This recommendation is based upon the evaluation of the
proposals according to the evaluative criteria as set forth in the RFP for this procurement. The
evaluative criteria established for this procurement were: a) understanding/approach and organization for
implementation (40%); b) experience of firm and individuals proposed for key positions and disciplines
(25%); c) Small Business Enterprise (SBE) Submittal / Compliance (5%) and d) price (30%).
The evaluation team consisted of Larry Buter, Manager, Paratransit Services; Maria Christian,
Technician, Contracted Services; Steve Gieske, Assistant General Superintendent, Maintenance; Kenn
Hardin, Senior Manager, Civil Rights; Pat Heye, Senior Alternative Service Planner / Scheduler; Brian
Matthews, Manager, Special Services; Chris Sills, Paratransit Safety and Training Compliance Officer;
Joy Volz, Paratransit Quality Assurance Supervisor; and Mac Weeden, Senior Quality Control Inspector.
The members of the evaluation team individually reviewed the technical proposals submitted by the
twelve proposers. Each team member evaluated the proposals on how well the proposal met the
evaluative criteria set forth for the procurement and assigned a score for “Understanding and Approach”
and for “Experience and Proposed Key Positions.” “SBE Submittal and Compliance” was evaluated and
scored by the Civil Rights Division. The score for the “Cost” element of each proposal was calculated
by the RTD procurement staff and was then added to the technical score and the SBE score of each
proposal to determine the overall score or rating of each proposal.
The key strengths of each proposal are as follows:
Apple Bus Company – previous experience with a similar sized system.
First Transit – previous experience, proposed installation of DriveCam system, comprehensive training
and maintenance program.
Global Transportation – incumbent, good training program, no start up.
Horizon Coach Lines – incumbent, good maintenance program, no start up.
McDonald Transit Associates – good maintenance program and quality control systems.
MV Transportation – incumbent, proposed new technologies to monitor service, good maintenance and
training program.
Ride Right – previous experience with a similar sized system.
SCR Medical Transportation – previous experience, good training and quality control systems.
Trinity Transit – previous experience with Access-a-Ride Project Management.

Packet Pg. 210

12.P

Veolia Transportation (dedicated vehicle) – previous experience, good maintenance plan, good training
program.
Veolia Transportation on Demand (non-dedicated vehicle) – existing provider, limited start up, offers
scheduling flexibility.
Via Mobility Services – incumbent, strong maintenance and training, no start-up.
The key weaknesses of each proposal are as follows:
Apple Bus Company – proposal failed to address all operational requirements.
First Transit – requires start up activities.
Global Transportation – proposed Maintenance Manager, not acceptable to RTD, maintenance plan
undeveloped.
Horizon Coach Lines – expansion to 25% service levels would require facility relocation.
McDonald Transit Associates – several key personnel did not meet minimum requirements.
MV Transportation – high turn-over rate.
Ride Right – proposal failed to address all operational requirements.
SCR Medical Transportation – proposal failed to address all operational requirements.
Trinity Transit – proposal failed to address all operational requirements.
Veolia Transportation (dedicated vehicle) – proposed Maintenance Manager has limited experience at the
25% service level.
Veolia Transportation on Demand (non-dedicated vehicle) – limited quality control.
Via Mobility Services – operational logistics concerns at the 25% service level.
The total overall scores regardless of the proposed service model, including SBE rating and cost rating
were as follows:
MV Transportation –
Via Mobility –
First Transit –
Horizon Coach Lines –
Veolia (dedicated) –
Global Transportation –
McDonald –

Veolia was the only proposer to bid on the non-dedicated vehicle option.

An evaluation of the total program cost was made by identifying the firms that scored in the competitive
range and then comparing the proposed prices for the 50%, 25%, and16.6% service levels. The service
model deemed most advantageous to the District in terms of both quality and cost resulted in a
combination of one 50% provider (MV Transportation) and two 25% providers (Via Mobility and Horizon
Coach Lines). It was the consensus of the evaluation team that these firms presented the best proposals
in terms of the understanding of the project, proposed management team, proposed organization,
approach to deliver the requested service, attainment of SBE goals and proposed price.
The evaluation team also considered maintaining the current four provider model. Using the costs
provided by the lowest priced service provider for the 50% service level plus the lowest prices of the

Packet Pg. 211

12.P

three service providers in the competitive range for the 16.6% service level, resulted in an overall
program cost increase of $4.5 million dollars over the five-year contract term. However, the evaluation
team had questions regarding changing the service model from four contractors to three and increasing
the proposed providers from a 16.6% to a 25% service level. Oral presentations were conducted with
the firms in the competitive range for the provision of 25% service model: Horizon Coach Lines, Veolia
Transportation (dedicated vehicle), and Via Mobility Services. The purpose of the oral presentations was
to offer these firms an opportunity to further articulate their operating plan and to respond to the
questions of the evaluation team. Furthermore, Veolia Transportation on Demand (non-dedicated
vehicle) was invited to provide clarification on the non-dedicated vehicle approach to providing Access-aRide services. At the conclusion of the oral presentations, the evaluation team again met and concluded
that the three provider service model represented the best model for the District and our passengers.
Therefore, the recommendation of the evaluation committee was to contract with MV Transportation to
provide 50% of the revenue hours, Horizon Coach Lines to provide 25% of the revenue hours, and Via
Mobility Services to provide 25% of the revenue hours; and to contract with Veolia Transportation to
provide non-dedicated-vehicle Access-a-Ride service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The recommended action is based upon the evaluation committee’s determination that the recommended
firms’ proposals represent the most responsive and responsible proposals received in response to the
RFP issued by the District. This determination is based upon the evaluation of technical, SBE and price
issues consistent with the evaluative criteria established by RTD and communicated in the RFP
document.
An RTD internal financial analysis indicated that the estimated cost to provide these services would be
higher than the prices offered by the recommended service providers. The estimated cost was based on
current and projected wage rates and other operating expenses. The financial comparison of the top
three proposals at the 50% and 25% service levels to the top four proposals at the 50% and 16.6%
resulted in the three provider model yielding a $4.5 million dollar savings to the District over the fiveyear contract term.
Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the 2014 requested
budget. There are no proposed start-up costs, and therefore, there is no start-up cost impact on the
2014 budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years.

ALTERNATIVES:
1)
2)

3)

Award contracts to Horizon Coach Lines, MV Transportation, and Via Mobility Services,
and Veolia Transportation on Demand as recommended.
Maintain current levels of service, one 50% service provider and three (3) 16.6% service
providers for an additional cost of $4.5 million dollars. This is not recommended as it does
not reflect the outcome of the evaluation team’s evaluation process.
Resolicit the RFP. This is not recommended as the proposal process has resulted in a
responsive and responsible proposal and is less expensive than the RTD internal cost
estimate (ICE).

Paratransit Service Extension and Funds

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to extend contracts with Horizon Coach Lines and Global Transportation
for the provision of Access-a-Ride services and with Via Mobility Services and MV Transportation for the
provision of Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services for a period of three (3) months at the following notto-exceed costs. For Access-a-Ride services: Horizon Coach Lines – service $1,385,003, fuel
$207,513, total $1,592,516; Global Transportation – service $1,343,251, fuel $207,513, total
$1,550,764; Via Mobility Services – service $1,386,102, fuel $207,513, total $1,593,615; MV
Transportation – service $3,676,213, fuel $622,543, total $4,298,756. For Call-n-Ride services: Via
Mobility Services – service $358,632, fuel $60,444, total $419,076; MV Transportation – service
$824,052, fuel $150,659, total $974,711. The cumulative total not-to-exceed costs are as follows:
Access-a-Ride service $7,790.570, Access-a-Ride fuel $1,245,081 and Access-a-Ride total
$9,035,650; and Call-n-Ride service $1,182,685, Call-n-Ride fuel $207,356 and Call-n-Ride total
$1,390,040.

BACKGROUND
In June of 2012 the RTD Board of Directors approved a one (1) year extension to the Access-a-Ride
service contracts with MV Transportation, Global Transportation, VIA Mobility, and Horizon Coach
Lines.
The extension also included the Call-n-Ride services which were assigned to MV
Transportation and Via Mobility. The extension was approved, in part, to allow staff to fully analyze
the benefits of utilizing non-dedicated vehicles for a portion of the Access-a-Ride service.
Approximately two years ago, several Board Members requested that an evaluation be conducted
with respect to a relatively new concept of offering paratransit services via non-dedicated vehicles.
While the usage of non-dedicated vehicles has been a viable form of transportation within the taxi
and human services arena, their use within the strictly enforced parameters of ADA paratransit had
not yet been fully demonstrated or analyzed. During the last two years, staff had been critically
assessing new service delivery models to include the possibility of incorporating non-dedicated
vehicles as a resource.
Non-Dedicated Service operates with vehicles that do not provide
transportation exclusively for a particular service such as Access-a-Ride, but are also used to
transport other passengers when not engaged in providing paratransit service. These drivers and
vehicles are in essence, hired for a particular time and when released, continue to use their vehicles
for other matters.

DISCUSSION
Subsequent to the recent procurement of the Access-a-Ride service and the recommendation by staff
to move from four (4) dedicated vehicle providers to three (3) dedicated vehicle providers and one (1)

Packet Pg. 214

12.Q

non-dedicated vehicle provider, an extension of three (3) months is being requested in order to
facilitate a smooth transition to the new service model. Two of the dedicated-vehicle providers will
be increasing their service level from 16.6% of the Access-a-Ride service to 25%. This will require
increases in driver, mechanic and staff levels and modifications to operating facilities. A three (3)
month extension to the existing Access-a-Ride contracts will provide adequate time for the
contractors to accomplish these tasks.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no budgetary impact as these funds have been budgeted for in the 2014 requested budget.

Annual Report to the Board - Interest Rate
Swap Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached modifications to the RTD Interest Rate Swap Policy.
BACKGROUND
The District’s Interest Rate Swap Policy (the “Policy”), attached, serves to direct the implementation and
management of interest rate exchange agreements (“swaps”) entered into between the District and
qualified swap counterparties. The Policy requires review by the Board at least annually.
An interest rate swap is a financial contract in which two parties agree to exchange a stream of cash
flows according to pre-arranged terms for a fixed period of time. Swaps may be utilized to produce
interest savings, to limit or hedge variable rate payments, to alter the pattern of debt service payments,
to lock in a current or future fixed borrowing rate, to create additional variable rate exposure and/or to
facilitate asset/liability management.
DISCUSSION
The District is not counterparty to any outstanding swap agreements at this time and staff is not
anticipating the need to enter a swap agreement at any point in the foreseeable future. Also, all
outstanding and currently planned debt of the District has a fixed interest rate. Should opportunities
arise in the future to utilize swaps to produce savings or present other economic benefits to the District,
staff will inform the Board in that regard.
Staff is recommending that the annual review requirement of the Policy be changed so that the Board
does not need to review the Policy on an annual basis unless the District is involved in or planning to
enter a swap agreement.
Some additional language changes are also being recommended to clarify the Policy and to reflect the
implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
The attached redline draft of the Policy reflects changes recommended by staff, most notably the
change to the policy that would only require the Board to review the Policy annually so long as the
District is involved with or planning to enter a swap agreement.

ATTACHMENTS
As noted above, please refer to the attached redline copy of the Interest Rate Swap Policy which
identifies the changes recommended by staff.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Policy presents no negative financial impacts to RTD.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the revised Interest Rate Swap Policy. This is the recommended action.

Packet Pg. 216

2. Revise the Interest Rate Swap Policy and adopt with Board-directed revisions.
3. Make no changes to the existing Interest Rate Swap Policy and adopt it in its current form.

Regional Transportation District
Interest Rate Swap Policy
I.

Introduction:
The purpose of the Interest Rate Swap Policy of the Regional Transportation District
(RTD) is to establish guidelines for the use and management of interest rate swaps.
The Interest Rate Swap Policy is intended to provide general procedural direction
regarding the use, procurement and execution of interest rate swaps. The Policy is
intended to relate to various interest rate hedging techniques, including the
contractual exchange of different fixed and variable rate payment streams through
interest rate swap agreements (for purposes of this policy, the term “interest rate swap
agreements” is intended to encompass, to the extent permitted by law, interest rate
swaps, caps, collars, floors, rate hedges for future issuances, basis swaps, and certain
other financial products used by municipal entities when accessing the capital
markets) and is not intended to relate to other derivative products that RTD may
consider.

II.

Scope and Authority:
This Interest Rate Swap Policy shall govern the RTD’s use and management of all
interest rate swaps. While adherence to this Policy is required in applicable
circumstances, the RTD recognizes that changes in the capital markets, District
programs and other unforeseen circumstances may from time to time produce
situations that are not covered by the Policy and will require modifications or
exceptions to achieve policy goals. In these cases, management flexibility is
appropriate provided specific authorization from the Board is obtained.
The Interest Rate Swap Policy shall be reviewed and updated at least annually and
presented to the Board of Directors for approval when the District is a party to or is
soliciting proposals for a financial transaction where an interest rate swap may be a
component. Day-to-day responsibility for management of interest rate swaps shall
fall within the responsibilities of the Chief Financial Officer.
The District shall be authorized to enter into interest rate swap transactions only with
qualified swap counterparties. The Chief Financial Officer, in consultation with the
District’s bond counsel and financial advisor, shall have authority to select the
counterparties, so long as the criteria set forth in the Interest Rate Swap Policy are
met.

III.

Approach and Objectives:
Interest rate swaps are appropriate interest rate management tools that can help RTD
meet important financial objectives. Properly used, these instruments can increase
RTD’s financial flexibility, modify interest rate exposure, provide opportunities for

Attachment: REVISED 11-19-13 Interest Rate Swap Policy-revised 2013 REDLINE (1769 : Annual Report to the Board - Interest Rate Swap

12.R.a

Packet Pg. 218

interest rate savings, hedge or mitigate interest rate risk for future financings and help
RTD manage its balance sheet through better matching of assets and liabilities. Swaps
should be integrated into RTD’s overall debt program and should not be used for
speculation.
Swaps are appropriate to use when they achieve a specific objective consistent with
RTD’s overall financial strategies. They may be used, for example, to lock in a
current or future market fixed rate or create additional variable rate exposure. They
may also be used to produce interest rate savings, to limit or hedge variable rate
exposure, to alter the pattern of debt service payments or for asset/liability matching
purposes.

Conditions for Use of Interest Rate Swaps:
A. General Usage:
In connection with the use of any interest rate swap agreement, the RTD’s Board of
Directors shall make a finding that the authorized interest rate exchange agreement(s)
will be used to alter, hedge or reduce interest rate risk and/or alter the cost of
borrowing in a beneficial manner, and when used in combination with to-be-issued,
new or outstanding bonds, will enhance the relationship between risk and return or to
achieve other policy objectives of the District.
B. Maximum Notional Amount:
The RTD will limit the total notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps based
on criteria set forth in this Interest Rate Swap Policy regarding the proper
management of risks, calculation of termination exposure, and development of a
contingency plan. The total “net notional amount” of all swaps related to an
individual bond issue should not exceed the outstanding or expected par amount of
the related bonds. For purposes of calculating the net notional amount, consideration
shall be given to multiple swaps on the same series of bonds which have a layering,
offsetting, or mitigating effect.
C. Maximum Maturity:
RTD shall determine the appropriate term for an interest rate swap agreement on a
case-by-case basis. In connection with the issuance or carrying of bonds, the term of
the swap agreement between RTD and a qualified swap counterparty shall not extend
beyond the final maturity date of related bonds.
D. Liquidity Considerations:
RTD shall consider the impact of any variable rate bonds issued in combination with
an interest rate swap on the availability and cost of liquidity support for other variable
rate programs. The RTD recognizes that there may be at any point in time a limited

2

12.R.a

Packet Pg. 219

supply of letter of credit or liquidity facility support for RTD variable rate bonds, and
the usage of liquidity support in connection with an interest rate swap may result in
higher overall costs for the District.
E. Call Option Value Considerations:
When considering the relative advantage of an interest rate swap to fixed rate bonds,
the RTD will consider the value of the call option on fixed rate bonds. The value
derived from the ability to call bonds at a future date may be foregone when using a
swap for the remaining term of the bonds unless the swap is customized to
incorporate a cancellation option on behalf of the RTD. While fixed rate RTD bonds
are typically structured with a call provision at a certain time, after which the bonds
may be refunded, this opportunity may be lost through the utilization of a long-dated
swap, impairing the District’s ability to reap economic savings.
V.

Interest Rate Swap Features:
A. Interest Rate Swap Agreement:
RTD will use terms and conditions as set forth in the International Swap and
Derivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”) Master Agreement or such other swap
documentation which may be appropriate. The swap agreement between RTD and
each swap counterparty shall include payment, term, security, collateral, default,
remedy, termination, and other terms, conditions, provisions and safeguards as the
RTD, in consultation with its legal counsel, and financial advisor deems necessary or
desirable.
Subject to the provisions contained herein, the terms of any RTD swap agreement
shall use the following guidelines:
1.
2.
3.

4.

5.

RTD’s downgrade provisions triggering termination shall in no event be
worse than those affecting the counterparty.
Governing law for swaps will be New York.
The specified indebtedness related to credit events in any swap agreement
should be narrowly defined and refer only to indebtedness of the RTD that
could have a materially adverse affect on RTD’s ability to perform its
obligations under the swap.
Collateral thresholds for the swap provider should be set on a sliding scale
reflective of credit ratings of the swap provider or guarantor and the RTD.
Collateral posted by RTD should be held by an independent third party.
Eligible collateral should generally be limited to U.S. Treasury obligations
and other obligations the principal and interest of which are backed by the
full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Eligible collateral shall be
limited to those investment obligations which are legal investments for
RTD.

Packet Pg. 220

6.

Termination value should be set by a “market quotation” methodology,
unless RTD deems an alternate appropriate.

B. Interest Rate Swap Counterparties:
1.

Credit Criteria:
RTD shall make its best efforts to work with qualified swap counterparties
only if, at the time the transaction is entered into: (a) the long-term debt
obligations of the counterparty or its credit support provider or guarantor
are rated within one of the two highest rating categories by one or more
nationally recognized securities rating agencies which regularly rate such
obligations; or (b) the obligations under the agreement of the counterparty
are either (i) guaranteed by a party whose long-term debt obligations are
rated in one of the two highest rating categories by one or more nationally
recognized securities rating agencies which regularly rate such
obligations; or (ii) collateralized by obligations which are legal
investments for the RTD and which maintain a market value of not less
than one hundred percent of the principal amount upon which the
exchange of interest rates is based. The nationally recognized rating
agencies are Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s Corporation
and Fitch Ratings.
In addition, qualified swap counterparties must have a demonstrated
record of successfully executing swap transactions as well as creating and
implementing innovative ideas in the swap market.

C. Counterparty Termination Exposure:
In order to diversify RTD’s counterparty credit risk, and to limit its credit
exposure to any one counterparty, the RTD will compute the “Maximum Net
Termination Exposure” prior to executing a swap with any counterparty. No
counterparty may exceed the Maximum Net Termination Exposure outlined
below.
“Maximum Net Termination Exposure” is the aggregate termination payment
exposure, net of the value of collateral posted or that would be posted in
accordance with the swap agreement with such counterparty, for all existing and
projected swap transactions with an individual counterparty. For purposes of this
calculation, the aggregate termination payment is equal to the expected worst-case
net termination amount for the existing transactions and the proposed transaction
over the life of all existing and proposed transactions. The expected worst-case
termination payment shall be calculated assuming interest rates, as measured by
the appropriate swap market yield curve, increase (or decrease) by two standard
deviations from the on-market forward swap rate over the term of the swap
portfolio with the counterparty.

D. Collateral Requirements:
As part of any swap agreement, the RTD may, based upon credit ratings of the
counterparty, require collateralization or other forms of credit enhancement to
secure any or all swap payment obligations. As appropriate, RTD, in consultation
with its counsel and financial advisor, may require collateral or other credit
enhancement to be posted by any swap counterparty if the long-term unsecured
credit rating of the counterparty or parent falls below the A category by any one
of the organizations rating agencies that regularly rate such counterparties.
Additional collateral for further decreases in credit ratings of each counterparty
shall be posted by each counterparty in accordance with the provisions contained
in the collateral support agreement to each counterparty with the District.
Threshold collateral amounts shall be determined by the RTD on a case-by-case
basis. The RTD will determine the reasonable threshold limits for the initial
deposit and for increments of collateral posting thereafter. Collateral shall be
deposited with a third party custodian, or as mutually agreed upon by the RTD
and the counterparty. A list of acceptable securities that may be posted as
collateral and the valuation of such collateral will be determined and mutually
agreed upon during the negotiation of the swap agreement with each swap
counterparty. The market value of the collateral shall be determined on a daily
basis.
E. Swap Insurance
If, after a cost/benefit analysis, it is determined that it would be beneficial to
insure the interest rate swap, swap insurance will be pursued.
F. Security and Source of Repayment:
The District will generally use the same security and source of repayment
(pledged revenues) for the interest rate swap as is used for the related bonds issue
unless circumstances exist which require the use of an alternate security or
repayment source .

12.R.a

Packet Pg. 222

G. Prohibited Interest Rate Swap Features:
The RTD will not use interest rate swaps that are: (i) speculative or create
extraordinary leverage or risk, (ii) lack adequate liquidity to terminate without
incurring an extraordinary bid/ask spread, (iii) provide insufficient price
transparency to allow reasonable valuation, or (iv) are used as investments.
VI.

Evaluation and Management of Interest Rate Swap Risks:
Prior to the execution of any swap transaction, the District’s Chief Financial Officer,
financial advisor and bond counsel shall evaluate the proposed transaction and report
the findings to the RTD Board. Such a review shall include the identification of the
proposed benefit and potential risks. As part of this evaluation, the RTD shall
compute the Maximum Net Termination Exposure to the proposed swap
counterparty.
A. Evaluation Methodology:
RTD will review the following areas of potential risk for new and existing interest
rate swaps:
Type of Risk

Description

Evaluation Methodology

Basis Risk

The mismatch between actual
variable rate debt service and
variable rate indices used to
determine swap payments.
The risk created by potential tax
events that could negatively
affect swap payments.

The RTD will review historical
trading differentials between the
variable rate bonds and the index.

Tax Risk

Counterparty Risk

The risk that the counterparty
fails to make required payments.

Termination Risk

The risk that the transaction is
terminated in a market dictating
termination payment by the
RTD.

Rollover Risk

The mismatch of the maturity of
the swap and the maturity of the
underlying bonds.

Liquidity Risk

The inability to continue or
renew a liquidity facility or
Letter of Credit.

6

The RTD will review the tax
events
in
proposed
swap
agreements. It will also evaluate
the impact of potential changes in
tax law on LIBOR indexed swaps
and the expected savings from
retaining tax risk.
The
RTD
will
monitor
counterparty ratings, exposure
levels, ratings thresholds and
collateralization requirements.
RTD will periodically compute its
termination exposure for all
existing and proposed swaps at
market value and under a worstcase scenario.
RTD will determine its capacity to
issue variable rate bonds that may
be outstanding after the maturity
of the swap.
RTD will evaluate the expected
availability of liquidity support
for swapped and unhedged
variable rate debt.

B. Managing Interest Rate Swap Risks:
1.

Annual Report to the Board:
Staff will evaluate the risks associated with outstanding interest rate
swaps at least annually and provide a written evaluation to the Board
of Directors. This evaluation will include the following information:
i.

ii.

iii.
iv.

v.

vi.
vii.

A description of all outstanding interest rate swaps, including
related bond series, types of swaps, rates paid and received by
RTD, existing notional amount, average life and remaining
term of each swap agreement and the current termination value
of outstanding swaps.
Separately for each swap, the actual debt service requirements
versus the projected debt service on the swap transaction. For
any swap used as part of a refunding, the actual cumulative
savings versus the projected savings at the time the swap was
executed.
The credit rating of each swap counterparty, parent, guarantor
and credit enhancer insuring the swap payments, if any.
Actual collateral posting by swap counterparty or RTD, if any,
per swap agreement and in total by swap counterparty and
RTD.
Information concerning any material event involving
outstanding swap agreements, including a default by a swap
counterparty, counterparty downgrade or termination.
An updated contingency plan to replace, or fund a termination
payment in the event an outstanding swap is terminated.
The status of any liquidity support used in connection with
variable rate bonds related to interest rate swaps, including the
remaining term and current fee.

RTD shall review the Interest Rate Swap Policy with the Board at least
annually when the District is a party to or is soliciting proposals for a
financial transaction where an interest rate swap may be a component.
2.

Contingency Plan:
The RTD shall compute the termination exposure of each of its
swaps and its total swap termination payment exposure at least
annually and prepare a contingency plan to either replace the swaps
or fund the termination payments, if any, in the event one or more
outstanding swaps are terminated. The RTD shall assess its ability to
obtain replacement swaps and identify revenue sources to fund
potential termination payments.

12.R.a

Packet Pg. 224

C. Terminating Interest Rate Swaps
1.

Optional Termination:
RTD may structure interest rate swaps to include optional
termination, which would allow the District to terminate a swap prior
to its maturity if it is determined that it is financially advantageous to
do so. The District may also purchase cancellation options which
would allow cancellation of the swap on a specified date or dates
without having to make a termination payment.

2.

Mandatory Termination:
In the event a swap is terminated as a result of a termination event
such as a default or credit downgrade of either counterparty, the
RTD will evaluate whether it is financially advantageous to obtain a
replacement swap or, depending on market value, make or receive a
termination payment.
In the event RTD makes a swap termination payment, the RTD shall
attempt to follow the process identified in its swap contingency plan.
The RTD shall also evaluate the economic costs and benefits of
incorporating a provision into the swap agreement that will allow the
RTD to make termination payments over time.

VII.

Procurement:
RTD will not have a fixed guideline with respect to swap procurement. Rather, it will
assess the benefits of competitively bidding financial products that are nonproprietary or generally available in the marketplace. On a product-by-product basis,
RTD may choose to negotiate the procurement of financial instruments. Qualified
swap counterparties are financial institutions meeting the credit criteria outlined in
this Policy. Counterparties may be institutions not included in RTD’s underwriting
pool.
In determining whether a swap procurement will be negotiated or competitive, RTD
staff shall consider, among other things, the then existing market for the type of
transaction expected to be entered into, counterparty diversification, the availability
of counterparties for the type of transaction expected to be entered into, the size of the
transaction, the costs and expenses associated with a negotiated versus a competitive
undertaking, and the proprietary nature of the proposed transaction or application
thereof and the service provided by the counterparty in developing an idea or strategy
that benefits the RTD. In the event that the transaction is to be negotiated or
competetitive, the RTD staff shall retain the services of an independent,

8

Attachment: REVISED 11-19-13 Interest Rate Swap Policy-revised 2013 REDLINE (1769 : Annual Report to the Board - Interest Rate Swap

Packet Pg. 225

knowledgeable individual or firm to advise the Authority District as to the fairness of
the pricing of the transaction.
In the event it is determined that the payment agreement will be competitively bid,
the RTD staff reserves the right to limit the (a) number of qualified counterparties that
may participate in a single swap agreement bid and (b) notional amount of swap
agreements with any counterparty, either for any individual swap or in the aggregate.
VIII.

Disclosure and Financial Reporting:
RTD will take steps to ensure that there is full and complete disclosure of all interest
rate swaps to the RTD Board of Directors, rating agencies and in disclosure
documents. Disclosure in marketing documents shall provide a clear summary of the
special risks involved with swaps and any potential exposure to interest rate volatility
or unusually large and rapid changes in market value. With respect to its financial
statements, the RTD will adhere to the guidelines for the financial reporting of
interest rate swaps as set forth by the Government Accounting Standards Board.

Regulatory Compliance
Pursuant to the authority of Section 731 of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank”), which includes
amendments to Section 4s(h) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the “CEA”) regarding
over-the-counter derivative instruments, regulations were published by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission that define business conduct between swap
dealers or major swap participants and their counterparties. In accordance with
Section 4s(h) of the CEA, as amended by Dodd-Frank, RTD staff shall designate its
Swap Advisor as the Designated Evaluation Agent that is capable of independently
evaluating any proposed Swaps and associated investment risks on behalf of RTD.

Glossary of Terms
Asset/Liability Matching: Matching the term and amount of assets and liabilities in
order to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates.
Bid/Ask Spread: The difference between the bid price (at which a market maker is
willing to buy) and the ask price (at which a market maker is willing to sell).
Call Option: The right to buy an underlying asset (e.g. a municipal bond) after a
certain date at a certain price. A call option is frequently embedded in a municipal
bond, giving the issuer the right to buy, or redeem, the bonds at a certain price.
Collateral: Assets pledged to secure an obligation. The assets are potentially subject
to seizure in event of default.
Downgrade: A negative change in credit ratings.
Forward Starting Swap: Interest rate swap that starts at some time in the future. Used
to lock-in current interest rates.
Hedge: A transaction that reduces the interest rate risk of an underlying security.
Interest Rate Exchange Agreement: An agreement detailing the contractual exchange
of interest payment streams between counterparties. Often the exchange of a fixed
and a floating interest rate between two parties. Also called an interest rate swap.
Interest Rate Swap: An agreement detailing the contractual exchange of interest
payment streams between counterparties. Often the exchange of a fixed and a floating
interest rate between two parties. Also called an interest rate exchange agreement.
Liquidity Support: An agreement by a bank to make payment on a variable rate
security to assure investors that the security can be sold.
LIBOR: London Interbank Offered Rate. Often used as an index to compute the
variable rate paid on an interest rate swap.
Maximum Net Termination Exposure: The aggregate termination payment for all
existing and projected swap transactions that would be paid by an individual
counterparty. For purposes of this calculation, the aggregate termination payment is
equal to: (i) the termination payment based on the market value of all existing swaps
as of the first day of the month prior to the execution of any proposed transaction,
plus (ii) the expected worst-case termination payment of the proposed transaction.
The expected worst-case termination payment shall be calculated assuming interest
rates, as measured by the appropriate index (typically the Bond Buyer Revenue Bond
Index or Bond Market Association), increase (or decrease) by two standard deviations
from the sample mean over a period of time corresponding to the term of the swap.

2014 Internal Audit Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the proposed plan of internal audits to be performed in 2014.
BACKGROUND
The annual internal audit plan has historically been approved by the General Manager. As a result of the
recent State of Colorado examination, it was agreed that the Board of Directors would also approve the
internal audit plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached plan includes the calculated number of days available for auditing, as well as the audit
plan, the title of the auditor assigned, and an estimate of the days allocated for each audit. A total of
twenty (20) audits are planned. Due to budget constraints, there are no outside audits scheduled for
this year.
The plan is based on estimates of the time required to complete the audits. As in past years, it utilizes
every available business day. If other audits arise during the year, we will request the input of the Board
as to which audits are to be eliminated to accommodate the added audit/audits.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: November 13, 2013

From:

Kenn Hardin, Senior Manager, Civil Rights
Division

GM

Date:

November 13, 2013

Board Meeting Date: November 26, 2013

Subject:

Recommendation for Adoption of ADA Program
Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the Americans with
Disabilities Act (“ADA”) Program Plan. By this action, the Board of Directors affirms that it is a priority of
RTD to provide equal access enterprise-wide for people with disabilities in accordance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable laws. The purpose of the ADA Program Plan is to
provide guidance, policies, procedures, and monitoring to further this policy direction.
BACKGROUND
The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 794, was the precursor to the ADA and
protects qualified individuals from discrimination based upon a disability. Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act applies to entities that receive federal assistance including RTD.
The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12601 et seq., was passed in 1990, and
amended in 2008 pursuant to the ADA Amendments Act (PL110-325). The sections of the ADA
applicable to RTD are the first two titles. Title I applies to employment practices and Title II applies to
public services. Part B of Title II, 42 U.S.C. § 12141 et seq. specifically covers public transportation
provided by public entities. This law prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, requires the
provision of paratransit service, and sets standards for transportation facilities and vehicles.
The Department of Justice regulates and enforces Section 504 and the ADA, except that the
Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and the Federal Transit Administration (“FTA”) administer the
mass transportation provisions of Section 504 and the ADA, and DOT has issued implementing
regulations at 49 C.F.R. Parts 27, 37 and 38.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s Senior Leadership Team believes that providing equal access to its programs and services for the
people with disabilities community is an important priority for RTD. Because of the diverse ways in
which RTD is affected by and impacts people with disabilities community, RTD needs to designate a
single individual who is responsible for directing a plan to achieve the policy directive. The Senior
Manager, Civil Rights, has sufficient visibility within RTD and the relevant resources to effectively
develop the ADA program.1 Accordingly, the Senior Manager, Civil Rights, should be designated as the
RTD ADA Coordinator; in that role, the Senior Manager, Civil Rights can implement an ADA Program
Plan. The ADA Program Plan defines RTD’s policy priorities and creates a framework by which RTD
1

When the ADA was initially passed, RTD had designated the Senior Manager, Human Resources as the ADA Coordinator.
Since that time, RTD has established a Civil Rights division and created the position of Senior Manager, Civil Rights, which is a
more appropriate position to take on the duties of ADA Coordinator.

employees, consultants and contractors will continue to work together to provide equal access
enterprise-wide for people with disabilities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no additional financial impact at this time.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) Program Plan. By this action, the Board
of Directors affirms that it is a priority of RTD to provide equal access enterprise-wide for people with
disabilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable laws. The
purpose of the ADA Program Plan is to provide guidance, policies, procedures, and monitoring to
further this policy direction.
2. Designate Another Individual as ADA Coordinator. The Board could designate another individual or
individuals as ADA Coordinator. This is not recommended because no other individual is as uniquely
suited to address this civil rights issue as the Sr. Manager, Civil Rights, although other members
within the organization will be responsible for implementing certain aspects of the ADA Program
Plan.
3. No Action. The Board of Directors may take no action. This is not recommended because providing
equal access to its programs and services for people with disabilities community is an important
priority for RTD, and adopting the ADA Program Plan is consistent with that priority.

RESPONSIBILITIES

RTD’s Senior Leadership Team is responsible for ensuring that their staff understand and
comply with RTD’s ADA Program Plan and its objectives. All RTD staff, consultants, and
contractors must take responsibility for implementation of RTD’s ADA Program Plan.
In accordance with 49 C.F.R. § 27.13, the Senior Manager Civil Rights Division has been

LEGAL FRAMEWORK

The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 794, was the precursor to the
ADA and protects qualified individuals from discrimination based upon a disability.
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act applies to entities that receive federal assistance
including RTD.
The ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12601 et seq., was passed in 1990, and amended in 2008
pursuant to the ADA Amendments Act (PL110-325). The sections of the ADA applicable
to RTD are the first two titles. Title I applies to employment practices and Title II applies
to public services. Part B of Title II, 42 U.S.C. § 12141 et seq., specifically covers public
transportation provided by public entities. This law prohibits discrimination on the basis
of disability, requires the provision of paratransit service, and sets standards for
transportation facilities and vehicles.
The Department of Justice regulates and enforces Section 504 and the ADA, except that
the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and the Federal Transit Administration (“FTA”)
administer the mass transportation provisions of Section 504 and the ADA, and DOT has
issued implementing regulations at 49 C.F.R. Parts 27, 37 and 38.

EMPLOYMENT

RTD prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in regard to job application
procedures, hiring, advancement or discharge of employees, employee compensation, and
other terms, conditions and privileges of employment.
Although all RTD employees have a responsibility to maintain a workplace environment
free of unlawful discrimination and harassment, RTD’s Equal Opportunity (“EO”) Office (a
subdivision of RTD’s Civil Rights Division) is responsible for investigating and resolving
complaints of discrimination and harassment in violation of RTD’s EEO policy. Complaints
should be made to a supervisor or the EO Office. Verbal complaints must be followed up
with a complaint form. Formal complaint forms are available in the EO Office (x2190) or
on the Intranet; questions and complaints can be sent to EqualOpportunity@rtddenver.com.
RTD also intends to make reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental
impairments of qualified individuals with a disability, as defined by the ADA, unless
undue hardship or a direct threat would result. Individuals seeking a reasonable
accommodation should immediately make the request known to a supervisor or the
Senior Manager, Human Resources, who is empowered to act on behalf of the ADA
Coordinator specifically for requests for reasonable accommodations for employment
purposes. In this role, the Sr. Manager, Human Resources will be responsible for
investigating and responding to the request and engaging in the interactive process. The
Sr. Manager, Human Resources may delegate this responsibility from time to time to the
Labor Relations Office for requests made by employees in the bargaining unit.
In the event that an internal complaint or request for reasonable accommodation is not
satisfied, an individual may file a charge with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission or the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies, Division of Civil Rights.
The EO Office and the Senior Manager, Human Resources are responsible for developing
guidance manuals, best practices tools, and training to ensure that RTD staff, consultants
and contractors understand and implement RTD’s ADA employment objectives.

6.0

TRANSPORTATION

RTD prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the provision of its transportation
services. The ADA implementing regulations also require the provision of paratransit
service and set standards for transportation facilities and vehicles.
Although all RTD employees have a responsibility to provide equal access enterprise-wide
for people with disabilities, the ADA Coordinator (Sr. Manager, Civil Rights) is responsible
for investigating and resolving complaints of discrimination and harassment from
passengers and the public. Formal complaints should be made to the ADA Coordinator at
(303)299-2221 or email to ADACoordinator@rtd-denver.com. Verbal or informal
complaints must be followed up with a complaint form. RTD may forward certain
complaints from disabled passengers made to RTD’s Telephone Information Center,
through RTD’s website or email complaints system, or social media if the individual
making the complaint can be identified, to the ADA Coordinator for tracking and/or
resolution.

The Federal Transit Administration (“FTA”), through its Office of Civil Rights, may
conduct audits concerning RTD’s ADA complementary paratransit service or RTD
compliance with applicable DOT regulations or other requirements. Individuals also may
file a complaint with the FTA. See http://www.fta.dot.gov/civilrights. In the FTA
complaint process, the FTA analyzes whether the complainant's allegations include
possible ADA deficiencies, presents that information to the transit provider, and offers
assistance to correct the inadequacies within a predetermined timeframe. The FTA also
may refer the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice for enforcement.

Subject:

Approval of Contract Award to Graham,
Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors for the
Design and Construction of the North Metro
Rail Line Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors ("Board")
authorize the General Manager to award the design/build contract and negotiate final terms with
Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors (GBBH) to serve as the Contractor for the North Metro Rail
Line Project ("Project"). The Project consisting of the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to
162nd Avenue with a Notice to Proceed to 124th Avenue, which will be constructed for a lump sum
amount of US $343.3 million. Acceptance of this proposal would complete the North Metro corridor to
124th Avenue with options to extend to 162nd Avenue as funds become available.
In addition, it is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
provide the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts, and
intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Project in the amount not to exceed the remaining
project budget to 124th Avenue of $633.8 million. This authority shall include the ability to negotiate
and execute all contracts; work orders; change orders and contract modifications; and Intergovernmental
Agreements that are necessary or advisable to complete the North Metro Project to 162nd Avenue within
the scope of the North Metro Project budget and to accept grants or other contributions and to increase
the project budget in the amount of third-party contributions for project work. The General Manager will
also be granted authority to exercise the option to extend to 162nd Avenue and issue a notice to proceed
for that phase, should funding become available. This option would be presented to the board through
the annual budget appropriation and with approval of financing provisions.
It is also recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct
RTD staff to proceed with the submittal to the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) of an
amendment to the 2035 Regional Transportation Plan (2035 RTP) consistent with the Project scope as
described herein.
This contract provides major benefits to RTD, the FasTracks program and the entire region.
 It demonstrates RTD’s commitment to the northern suburbs toward completion of the FasTracks
program.
 It provides a firm, fixed price commitment to complete a key part of the FasTracks program. It also
provides a fixed capital cost. The commitment to this cost and scope is not likely to be available at a
later time due to time escalation of prices.
 This proposal is consistent with the stated goals of the FasTracks program to seek innovative
approaches to delivering the program.
 It is consistent with the RTD Board’s stated direction to the General Manager (2013 GM Task Goal
#1: Pursue collaborations and partnerships with local, regional, state, and federal stakeholders; and
Task Goal #2: Actively and aggressively pursue all potential federal, state, local, private sector, and
other funding sources for FasTracks).

Completion of this North Metro Rail Line maximizes mobility for transit dependents both temporary
and long-term, to key job centers and provides clean, safe, reliable, accessible and cost effective
transportation in keeping with RTD's overall mission.
The line provides access for northern residents to major employment centers in downtown Denver
and the Denver Tech Center.
The North Metro Rail Line connects Thornton, Northglenn, Commerce City and parts of Adams
County with all other rail lines via Denver Union Station and provides regional connectivity to a major
portion of the metro area, including Denver International Airport.

BACKGROUND
As part of the RTD FasTracks Plan, the full North Metro Corridor is an approximately 18.5-mile-long
Commuter Rail line extending from Denver Union Station through the City and County of Denver, the
Cities of Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn and parts of Adams County. RTD has been working
closely with stakeholders in these jurisdictions to identify ways to expedite construction of this corridor.
Quarterly meetings are held and RTD and the stakeholders have been working collaboratively towards
this goal.
The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was conducted for the North Metro Rail line between 2006
and 2010. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) issued a Record of Decision (ROD) for the North
Metro Rail Line in April 2011. RTD is constructing the project without federal funds. The RFP for the
Project incorporated the environmental mitigation measures identified in the EIS and these mitigation
measures will therefore be included as contractual obligations. Since that time, RTD has identified and
moved forward with early action items related to the North Metro Rail Line. These included acquisition of
six EMU commuter rail vehicles; design and construction of an expansion to the Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility to house an additional 30 EMU vehicles ultimately required for 2035 ridership;
installation of duct bank at DUS for the North Metro line; contracted with AECOM to design the rail line
from DUS to 72nd Avenue; began the acquisition process for necessary properties between DUS and 72nd
Avenue; began the utility relocation process between DUS and 72nd Avenue; and performed work at the
Bambei-Walker Reservoir. These early action items saved considerable future costs to the project.
Most importantly, RTD concluded an agreement with the Union Pacific Railroad for acquisition of the
Boulder Industrial Lead, which is the right-of-way being used north of 72nd Avenue. The cost of this
acquisition was $117.8 million in 2009, which was a significant commitment of funds to this corridor.
RTD has also negotiated intergovernmental agreements with regard to North Metro with the City and
County of Denver, Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn, Adams County and CDOT.
RTD also has taken actions to provide funding for construction as it becomes available. In June, 2010,
the RTD Board programmed $90 million for the construction of the North Metro Rail Line from DUS to
the National Western Stock Show (NWSS) Station out of the $305 million pool in FasTracks funds
remaining from the Eagle P3 bids that were received below budget. In February, 2013, the Board
approved refinancing three outstanding debt issuances, and committed to use the future savings from
these refinancings to finance construction of the North Metro Rail Line from the NWSS Station to 72 nd
Avenue.
The current recommended action to build to 124th Avenue would not have been possible without those
RTD Staff recommendations and those prior approvals by the RTD Board. Approval of this action will
also require RTD to submit an amendment to the DRCOG 2035 RTP reflecting both the extended North
Metro Rail Line construction and operation and the significant schedule acceleration. Specifically, as

Packet Pg. 259

13.U

previously authorized by the RTD Board of Directors in February 2013, the 2035 RTP currently reflects
construction of the North Metro Rail Line only to 72nd Avenue by 2018. This action will significantly
accelerate and extend the North Metro Rail Line compared with the financial projections from February
2013. Further, this is being accomplished without impact to any of the other RTD FasTracks or base
system projects committed to in the current DRCOG 2035 RTP as adopted by the RTD Board of
Directors.
Over the past couple of years, RTD has publicized the agency's desire to seek out innovations from the
industry to complete the FasTracks program as soon as possible. In 2011, RTD held an industry forum,
Transformation Through Transportation (T3). RTD's goal was to encourage and attract "out-of-the-box"
thinking that would generate innovative industry solutions throughout the District. As part of the T3
process, RTD revised and published its unsolicited proposal policy. The policy and effort as it relates to
the FasTracks program of projects has the objective of seeking innovation from the private sector that
will enable RTD to complete more of the FasTracks program, sooner than what is currently programmed.
In February 2013, RTD received an Unsolicited Proposal from Graham Contracting Limited related to the
North Metro Rail Line. In accordance with RTD's Unsolicited Proposal Policy, each submitted proposal is
reviewed and evaluated to determine whether the proposal has merit and is consistent with the
unsolicited proposal policy criteria.
In March 2013, following RTD staff review and evaluation of the Graham Contracting Limited proposal,
it was determined that it did have technical merit and the competitive process was initiated. The RTD
staff completed development of a design/build and financial solutions Request for Proposals (RFP), which
was advertised on June 28, 2013. The RFP was written in three phases:
 Phase 1: Design/Build from DUS to 72nd Avenue
 Phase 2: Design/Build on four individual segments from 72nd Avenue to end of line at 162nd
Avenue (72nd–88th, 88th-104th, 104th-124th, 124th-162nd), and offer financial solutions
 Phase 3: Design/Build and offer financial solutions for any or all of the three extensions (Central,
Southwest and Southeast Rail lines), or other potential projects
This effort is consistent with our Mantra to “Build as much as we can, as fast as we can, until it’s all
done”. The private sector has taken our Mantra seriously and has responded. The T3 process and this
unsolicited proposal effort for the North Metro corridor are also consistent with the guiding principles for
FasTracks.
 Ensure every step contributes to the full vision
 Focus money available to the greatest good
 Spend public money wisely
 Maximize outside funding before going to taxpayers
 Deliver key investments in all corridors
DISCUSSION
Following an advertisement period of approximately twelve weeks, RTD received four competitive
proposals for the project on September 23, 2013, from the following teams:
1. Bechtel/Herzog Joint Venture which includes AECOM and financial partner Societe General
2. Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors (GBBH) which includes Stantec Design, Parsons
Brinckerhoff and financial partner BMO Capital Markets
3. North Metro Transit Solutions (NMTS), a Kiewit/Stacy and Witbeck joint venture which includes
Atkins Design, Mass Electric, and financial partner RBC Capital Markets

Packet Pg. 260

13.U

4. URS Energy and Construction, Inc. which includes Lawrence Construction, Aldridge Electric and
financial partner Piper Jaffray
The RTD staff evaluated the four competing proposals based on the best value criteria established for
this procurement:
Financial
1. Design/Build Cost Proposal – DUS to 72nd Avenue
2. Design/Build Cost Proposal – 72nd Avenue to 162nd Avenue, scored by segment as defined above
3. Financial Innovation/Creativity
Technical
1. Technical Innovation/Creativity
2. Technical Approach
3. Management Organization, Experience and Approach
4. DBE/SBE/WIN Approach
RTD established review teams to evaluate the technical and financial parts of each proposal. In addition
to the technical and financial review teams, key stakeholders (City and County of Denver, Cities of
Commerce City, Northglenn and Thornton, Adams County and the Colorado Department of
Transportation) also participated in the evaluation. The technical, financial and stakeholder teams
presented the results of their evaluation to the Evaluation Committee.
Following the evaluation and scoring, the Evaluation Committee worked collaboratively and unanimously
recommended to the General Manager to select GBBH for negotiation of a contract.
GBBH submitted a proposal for the North Metro Rail line to 162nd Avenue, broken out by the segments
defined above. Based on financial capacity at this point in time, RTD is recommending awarding the
contract from Denver Union Station to 124th Avenue. Given this information, GBBH provided a BAFO
price for a consolidated contract to 124th Avenue, reducing its bid price by $20.5 million from the
original proposal to issue Notice to Proceed (NTP) for individual segments. GBBH also provided an
option, with the price to be held for two years, that could be exercised to complete the North Metro
project to 162nd Avenue when funding becomes available. GBBH also provided option prices for the
Southeast, Southwest and Central extensions, subject to an escalation clause defined in the RFP;
extension of the North Metro line to Longmont; extension of the Northwest Line to 88th Avenue. These
options can be evaluated when funds become available.
The design/build contract initial Notice to Proceed will include the following elements from Denver Union
Station to 124th Avenue:
 Design, construction and testing of all Civil and Systems elements including the following
stations:
o National Western Stock Show station and park-n-Ride
o 72nd Avenue station and park-n-Ride
o 88th Avenue station and park-n-Ride
o 104th Avenue station and park-n-Ride
o 112th Avenue station and park-n-Ride
o 124th Avenue station and park-n-Ride
 Interface, integration and coordination with the Eagle Project in design, fabrication and installation
of traction electrification systems, train control and PTC systems, SCADA and Security and
Communications systems
 Demolition of structures identified for removal

Packet Pg. 261

13.U



Right of way (ROW) management between 72nd Avenue and 124th Avenue.

The following basic components are included in the contract:
1. Payment Agreement for the Lump Sum Contract.
2. RTD set a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goal of 23% for design and 21% for
construction, which applies to the total value of all work performed under the contract. The
contractor has committed to exceeding these goals by an additional 1% each. The contractor also
has presented a plan to include a minimum of 1% SBE participation.
3. The Project hiring goals for Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) graduates are as follows:
a.
Professional Service – Goal 4%: Participants may perform professional services such as
design, quality control, quality assurance, surveying, contract administration, easement
acquisition, and public information duties.
b.
Skilled Craft – Goal 8%: Participants should perform skilled construction related activities
such as carpentry, masonry, iron worker, equipment operator, mechanic work, or similar
skilled construction work. Laborer activities will only be allowed if incidental to a higher
skilled journey worker status.
4. Davis Bacon and Buy America Requirements - The contractor will be required to use Davis-Bacon
wage rates and comply with Buy America regulations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
After review of the financial proposals, staff determined that it would be in RTD’s best interest to
finance construction of the North Metro Rail Line through RTD issuance of Certificates of Participation
(COP) with the North Metro Rail Line as the collateral. Staff modeled financial alternatives to determine
how much of the North Metro Rail Line could be built and operated within RTD’s current projected
financial capacity. The financial projections considered the contractors bid, RTD’s internal costs for
items such as ROW, vehicles, and construction management, future costs to operate the line, and debt
service on the COPs. In addition, the projections considered the impacts of an increase in COP interest
rates due to a potential ratings downgrade on RTD COPs. This analysis determined that RTD would
have the capacity to build and operate the corridor to 124th Avenue while maintaining the Board 1.2
times net revenue, bond test, and allowing fund balance policy.
Funding for this contract and the associated RTD cost of construction will be provided through the staff
identified and Board approved $90 million from the Eagle project savings, use of existing fund balances,
potential use of the FasTracks Internal Savings Account, and issuance of COPs to provide $430 million
in construction funds. Separate Board actions will be presented for issuance of the COPs, and for a
reimbursement resolution if needed.
Funding of the North Metro Rail Line will not affect the planned financing or construction schedule for
other FasTracks projects. RTD currently has limited remaining TABOR capacity to issue sales tax bonds
or enter into other types of loan agreements. The North Metro Corridor is unique in that it meets the
criteria for RTD to use it as collateral for a COP at this time. As a result, RTD is able to finance this
corridor and conserve TABOR capacity for other opportunities that do not qualify for COP financing.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors ("Board") authorize the General Manager to award the design/build
contract and negotiate final terms with Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors (GBBH) to serve
as the Contractor for the North Metro Rail Line Project ("Project"). The Project consisting of the

Avenue, which will be constructed for a lump sum amount of US $343.3 million. Acceptance of this
proposal would complete the North Metro corridor to 124th Avenue with options to extend to 162nd
Avenue as funds become available.
In addition, it is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors provide the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts, and
intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Project in the amount not to exceed the remaining
project budget to 124th Avenue of $633.8 million. This authority shall include the ability to negotiate
and execute all contracts; work orders; change orders and contract modifications; and
Intergovernmental Agreements that are necessary or advisable to complete the North Metro Project
to 162nd Avenue within the scope of the North Metro Project budget and to accept grants or other
contributions and to increase the project budget in the amount of third-party contributions for project
work. The General Manager will also be granted authority to exercise the option to extend to 162nd
Avenue and issue a notice to proceed for that phase, should funding become available. This option
would be presented to the board through the annual budget appropriation and with approval of
financing provisions.
It is also recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
direct RTD staff to proceed with the submittal to the Denver Regional Council of Governments
(DRCOG) of an amendment to the 2035 Regional Transportation Plan (2035 RTP) consistent with the
Project scope as described herein.
This contract provides major benefits to RTD, the FasTracks program and the entire region.
 It demonstrates RTD’s commitment to the northern suburbs toward completion of the FasTracks

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead direct staff to negotiate a lesser scope with the
recommended proposer. This is not recommended. There is no guarantee that the reduced scope will
result in a similar reduction in cost as it would require a significant change in the proposer’s entire
approach. This option would not encourage building as much as we can, as fast as we can.

3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve a new
contract award to Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors. This is not recommended as we
would be giving up a firm, fixed price commitment from a contractor to complete a key segment of
the FasTracks program that is not likely to be available in the future.

North Metro Budget Authority

I have received questions from Board members regarding the recommended action in
regard to the budget and budget authority.
The total remaining budget is $633.8 million. This is the budget needed to build the line
from DUS to 1 24th Avenue. The $343.3 million GBBH contract is part of this total budget.
The breakdown of the total budget consists of the following categories:

Construction Contract GBBH
Other Construction
Right-of-Way
Vehicles
Project Management
Contingency
Total Project Budget
-

$343.3
76.1
72.6
50.7
57.3
33.8
$633.8

The recommended action provides for approval for the GBBH contract in the amount of
$343.3 and the budget from DUS to 124th Avenue of $633.8. As seen in the table above,
the $343.3 contract is part of this total budget.
The recommendation action also provides authority to the General Manager for the total
budget of $633.8 million. RTD has successfully implemented this approach on all our
previous corridor projects even prior to FasTracks.

We have always committed to keeping the board informed on key project decisions and
financial status and the board has trusted the staff’s ability to manage these prolects
without requiring approvals for each element. It should be noted that if we need to spend
any amount above the $633.8 million for the project we would need further board
approval.

Fortunately, we have never had a need to seek additional funds for a major project and are
committed to that goal on North Metro. This approach is one of our key lessons learned
for project management and we hope that the board will continue this approach.
It should also be noted, that legally we are required to receive a separate, formal board
approval for right-of-way parcels to be acquired. We will be coming to the board
periodically in 2014 for these approvals.

Amendment of ADA Contracts for Call-n-Ride
Service Awards

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend the new ADA paratransit services contracts
with MV Transportation and Via Mobility Services (per solicitation #13-DH-035) for the provision of Calln-Ride services. The amendment to the MV Transportation contract is for three years, with two one-year
options and shall not exceed $19,039,885 for the 5-year period for Call-n-Ride services. The
amendment to the Via Mobility Services contract is also for three years, with two one-year options and
shall not exceed $8,692,084 for the 5-year period for Call-n-Ride services. In addition, these contracts
will include a cost for fuel which will be treated as a pass through expense. The total 5-year estimated
cost for Call-n-Ride fuel for MV Transportation is $3,333,539 and for Via Mobility Services is
$1,380,399. The total 5-year not-to-exceed cost for MV Transportation is $22,373,424. The total 5year not-to-exceed cost for Via Mobility Services is $10,072,483.
BACKGROUND
On August 16, 2013, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals
to provide Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services. Call-n-Ride services were included in the Access-aRide services RFP because these services had been assigned to and were operated by ADA paratransit
service providers under the existing contracts. Past experience has shown that the cost of Call-n-Ride
service is lower when combined with Access-a-Ride service because of reduced overhead costs.
All of the existing Call-n-Ride services (with the exception of the Evergreen CNR) were divided into three
(3) service packages and proposers were allowed to bid on one or two packages. Proposers were
required to bid on Access-a-Ride service in order to also bid on Call-n-Ride service (Call-n-Ride service
was not a “stand alone” service option). Proposers were not required to submit a separate proposal for
Call-n-Ride service, but they were required to detail how they would address the unique operational
requirements of the service.
The Call-n-Rides included in each package are as follows:
Package A
Arapahoe
Belleview
Dry Creek
Highlands Ranch
Lone Tree
Meridian
North Inverness
Orchard
Parker

Package B
Belmar
Golden
Green Mountain
South Jeffco

Package C

Packet Pg. 293

13.V

South Inverness
The new contracts for ADA paratransit service include the option for the assignment of Call-n-Ride
service so that Call-n-Ride service can be assigned to those contracts.
DISCUSSION
Subsequent to the evaluation of the Access-a-Ride RFP responses and recommendation for contract
award, the Call-n-Ride proposals were evaluated. Only proposers that were recommended to provide
Access-a-Ride service were considered to provide Call-n-Ride services. The Call-n-Ride proposals were
evaluated on the following criteria: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation
(40%); b) experience of firm and individuals proposed for key positions and disciplines (25%); c) Small
Business Enterprise (SBE) Submittal / Compliance (5%) and d) price (30%).
Via Mobility Services, formally known as Special Transit, has operated Call-n-Ride service for
approximately twelve years. The management team is well experienced in the provision of Call-n-Ride
service. Via Mobility currently provides Call-n-Ride service from a facility in the Boulder area and a
facility in the Denver area. This allows a quicker response time in case of vehicle maintenance problems
and cuts down on excessive deadhead mileage and fuel expenses.
MV Transportation has operated Call-n-Ride service for approximately ten years. MV Transportation
proposed a team comprised of experienced Call-n-Ride managers and drivers, and it has provided quality
Call-n-Ride service throughout its tenure. The MV Transportation facility is located in the south metro
area which provides good access for the Call-n-Rides in service packages A & B.
Horizon Coach Lines does not have any experience operating Call-n-Ride service for RTD. Horizon’s
initial RFP response provided pricing for Call-n-Ride package C. During the follow up interview with the
Horizon team, the organization identified that it had intended to bid on package B, not package C. In
addition to this oversight, the Horizon proposal provided very limited discussion on the operation of the
Call-n-Ride and the proposed Call-n-Ride Supervisor had limited experience managing this type of service.
The evaluation of the Call-n-Ride service proposals and pricing resulted in a recommendation to assign
Call-n-Ride Packages A and B to MV Transportation under the ADA paratransit contract and Call-n-Ride
Package C to Via Mobility Services under the ADA paratransit contract. The contracts to provide these
services are scheduled to be effective April 1, 2014.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the 2014 requested
budget. There are no proposed start-up costs, and therefore, there is no start-up cost impact on the
2014 budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years.

ALTERNATIVES:
1)

Assign Call-n-Ride service to MV Transportation and Via Mobility as recommended. This is
recommended as both contractors’ personnel have Call-n-Ride experience and can provide
the direct supervision for a smooth contract transition.

Packet Pg. 294

13.V

2)

Assign Call-n-Ride service to another ADA paratransit contractor. This alternative is not
recommended as the other contractor will be experiencing an increase in their Access-aRide revenue hours and this will be a new service for them. This would also contradict the
results of the evaluation process.

Award Contract to Supply 125 – 40’ LowFloor Transit Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager, or his designee, to award a contract to Gillig LLC for the purchase of 125 – 40’ low-floor
transit buses and associated spare components in the amount not to exceed $51,800,000, with an option to
purchase up to 307 additional 40’ buses over a five year period.
BACKGROUND
RTD’s existing 2000 Series Orion 40’ transit buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years or 500,000
miles. The buses are coming up to 14 years old and have accumulated on average 585,000 miles of stop-andgo transit service. They have become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service.
The bus manufacturer, Orion Bus Industries, went out of business a few years ago. Many components for bus
repair have become difficult to obtain. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) calls for the replacement of
the 2000 Series buses over the next three years, 125 buses in 2013, 110 buses in 2014, 64 buses in 2015 and
10 buses per year afterward.
The Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued on May 24, 2013 for the procurement of 40’ transit buses. The
RFP solicited proposals that offer buses in different power configurations: clean diesel, CNG and hybrid
electric. Proposals were received on September 4, 2013.
DISCUSSION
Proposals were received from four companies: Gillig, New Flyer, Nova Bus, and North American Bus Industries
(NABI).
The proposers submitted their costs as follows.

Bus
$412,662

13.W

NABI

$473,066

$512,269

No Bid (Series Hybrid)
$665,570 (Parallel Hybrid)

Staff has performed a life cycle cost analysis of the different power configurations to determine the most cost
effective and efficient propulsion power system for the new buses.
The hybrid buses are $166,565 (for the series hybrid) or $191,419 (for the parallel hybrid) higher in unit cost
than the diesel buses. Accordingly, RTD would only be able to purchase 85 to 89 hybrid buses for the available
budget instead of the 125 replacement vehicles desired.
Based on RTD’s experience of 20% better fuel economy for the hybrid buses and its current diesel fuel
purchase price, it would take between 31 and 36 years to reach the break-even point on the capital
investment for hybrid buses. This far exceeds the twelve (12) year useful life of the vehicle. Accordingly, hybrid
vehicles were eliminated from further consideration.
The CNG buses are $47,960 higher in unit cost than the diesel buses. Accordingly, RTD would only be able
to purchase 112 CNG buses for the available budget instead of 125 replacement vehicles desired.
In order to convert to CNG operations, RTD must also invest in new CNG stations and safety modifications
of existing maintenance and parking facilities. Since the 40’ buses will be distributed to all three RTD’s
divisions and four private operators’ divisions, all seven divisions would have to be modified for CNG. The
CNG stations required for fueling CNG vehicles at seven divisions are estimated to cost upward of $17.3
Million. The facility modifications to these divisions to bring them into compliance with fire codes for safe
operations of CNG fuel are estimated to cost up to $31.4 Million. The total facility upgrades for the seven
divisions are estimated to result in a $48.7 million investment. No funding has been identified to finance
these necessary capital improvements.
Currently, CNG fuel cost is equal to about 50% of diesel fuel cost. Based on the RTD’s average year to date
purchase prices of $3.26 per gallon of diesel and $1.62 per diesel gallon equivalent of CNG, together with
the assumption that the price differential between diesel fuel and CNG fuel would stay the same
throughout the future years under this analysis, it would take 13 years to reach the break-even point on
the capital investment for CNG buses and required facility upgrades.

The CNG analysis by staff indicates:

Savings in CNG fuel cost will be more than offset by the higher cost of bus purchase and
upgrading the maintenance and parking facilities.

Prices of natural gas and diesel fuel have been historically extremely volatile. There is no
guarantee that the current pricing advantage of natural gas over diesel fuel will continue into the
future. Examples of the price volatility are shown below.


There are no significant air quality impacts to convert from diesel to CNG operations. Both new
clean diesel and new CNG buses have significantly lower emissions than the older buses they replace.
The emissions of new clean diesel and CNG buses are considered to be the same.

The CNG facility upgrade will take at least two years to implement. Going with CNG buses will
delay the bus procurement process at least two years.

In the past CNG buses showed higher maintenance costs than diesel buses. However, in the
last several years, CNG engine technology has improved. Even though CNG buses require certain new
costs for CNG related maintenance such as CNG engine sparkplug replacement and high pressure fuel
system maintenance, staff has assumed CNG and diesel maintenance costs to be equivalent.

The reliability and durability of CNG engines are still questionable at high altitude and cold
weather conditions, coupled with the usage of low energy natural gas available in Denver metro area.
High altitude conditions cause loss of engine power and hotter engine operating temperature. Cold
weather causes CNG engine starting problems. Denver’s natural gas has lower energy content than the
rest of the country. Low energy gas causes engine operating issues.

CNG is a combustible gas at very high pressure (3,600 pounds per square inch of pressure).
Safety and security for the operation of CNG are of concern.

The high cost CNG stations and associated facility upgrades may become obsolete in 12 years at
the end of life of the buses under this procurement. Electric vehicle technology appears to be the
preferred technology of the future. A number of electric buses are currently in production or under
demonstration by bus manufacturers. As electric bus technology is still in its infancy, it currently has
issues such as high purchase cost and low operating range. In the upcoming years, it is expected that
the technology will advance and production processes will improve, allowing the bus cost to come
down and the operating range to increase.
There are risks that the very large investment in CNG facility upgrades and CNG buses may not pay off; that
the savings on CNG fuel may not be realized due to commodity price fluctuations; that the CNG technology
may become obsolete to better engine technologies currently being demonstrated such as electric vehicles;
and that CNG operational difficulties may be experienced under RTD’s high altitude, cold climate and low
energy natural gas usage. In addition, no funding has been indentified to finance the CNG facility upgrades.

Based on the above considerations, staff has recommended that RTD stay with clean diesel technology as a
good public policy.
The proposals were also rated according to their proposed costs and company technical ability.
Gillig submitted the lowest cost proposal, which is also rated highly for its technical ability. Gillig’s proposal is
the most responsive, responsible, lowest cost and best value proposal. Gillig meets and exceeds RTD technical
specification requirements. Gillig has the experience and qualification in the manufacture of transit buses,
being one of the oldest and most financially stable manufacturers in North America. Gillig offered a lifetime
warranty against bus structure corrosion damage. Gillig proposed a delivery schedule that meets RTD’s 12month delivery schedule requirement.
The 40’ buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be equipped with a
wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance. Their clean diesel engines will
meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up to 90% from the level of the existing
buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger count system and a security digital camera
system. The 40’ buses will have two passenger doors and 36 passenger seats.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This current contract is for the purchase of 125-40’ low-floor transit buses and associated spare components
in the amount not to exceed $51,800,000. The funding for this contract is approved and available in the
District’s 2013 Adopted Budget, and also identified in 2014 Requested Budget.
The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 307 additional buses over a five year period. Pricing for
additional option buses will be based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price adjustment
computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is published monthly.
Additional buses to be purchased from the options will require separate authorizations from the RTD Board of
Directors.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required proposal
submittal documents, Gillig has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES


To authorize the General Manager to award a contract to Gillig for the purchase of 125 clean diesel 40’
low-floor transit buses and associated spare components. This is the recommended alternative.



Award the contract to Gillig for a smaller quantity of CNG 40’ buses (112 buses) with the available
budget. This is not the recommended action as it would delay the bus purchase from one to two years
due to the long process to construct the CNG fuel stations and modify the maintenance and parking

facilities. CNG requires higher bus purchase costs and multi-million dollar facility costs, which will
offset the CNG fuel savings. There are risks of operational difficulty for CNG buses in RTD’s high
altitude and cold weather conditions, in addition to the availability of only low energy natural gas in
Denver metro area. In addition, no funding has been identified to finance the necessary capital
improvements.


Do not authorize the award of the contract and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would result,
at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the project.
