Retiree Awards
There were no retirees present for the retiree award. Chair Anderson acknowledged June
Eckwall, Administrative Assistant for Safety, Security and Facilities, for her 19 years of
service.
Special Recognition – American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC) Awards
Chair Anderson noted that RTD has a great staff and that we are frequent recipients of
various awards honoring our staff. She turned it over to General Manager Washington and
Ricke Clarke who introduced these awards.
Ricke Clark shared that RTD was the recipient of two engineering excellence awards
presented by the American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC). The awards were
presented at ACEC awards luncheon on November 18. The Table Mesa pedestrian bridge
project received a merit award. The new Table Mesa pedestrian bridge connects the
existing parking structure on the north side of US36 with a new bus stopping area on the
south side. This saves our buses approximately three to five minutes per trip. Civil
Engineering Manager Stan Szabelak along with design partner, Huitt-Zollars, accepted the
award . The West Rail Line project received an honors award. The West Rail Line is a
new 12.1 mile, $707 million Light Rail line that opened ahead of schedule and within
budget in April 2013. The project presented numerous engineering challenges including

limited right-of-way, numerous at-grade crossings, alignment through a park and
neighborhoods, major structures and numerous property acquisitions. The project Design
Manager, Paul Von Fay along with design partner, David Evans and Associates, accepted
the award.

V.

Public Participation
Al Moghtader shared with the Board that he received a fine for parking at the Alameda and
I-225 light rail station. He learned when parking there that his license plate is not
registered in the District. Al Moghtader stated that he lives in Roxborough and is only 15
minutes from the C and D lines. He is hoping there is something he can do to be
exempted from the parking fees without having to move. Chair Anderson indicated staff
will followup with him.
Doug Gragg stated that he had three talking points this evening. He wonders what the
reasoning was behind not including limited or express capability on RTD’s light rail system.
He noted that people have told him that parking is needed at the Red Rocks Station. Doug
Gragg also asked if there will be fountains at Denver Union Station; the picture depiction
shows fountains but so far he has not seen any.
William McMullen, former RTD Board Member, stated that he was fat and happy this
evening. He shared that when he ran for the RTD Board in 2004 he ran for FasTracks. He
told constituents that if they did not want FasTracks they should not vote for him.
William McMullen stated that coming from the South where they allegedly have it all he
says no we do not. The South will not have it all until the full system is built out. He
commented that RTD is still on time for the most part. William McMullen stated that RTD
has taken advantage of economic downturns to save hundreds of thousands of dollars on
the light rail. He said that he is not surprised to see RTD getting and those awards mean
something. William McMullen stated that when you go to other places around the country
you see that they are completely mismanaged while RTD is at the top of the Peak. He
thanked the Board for doing a great job.
Kathy Hodgson, City of Lakewood, thanked the Board for the opportunity to speak. She
congratulated RTD on the award for the W Line. Kathy Hodgson shared that she was at
the meeting to speak to the City’s support of Item M, Support of Lakewood Master
Developer Solicitation for Federal Center TOD Pilot. She said that on behalf of the Mayor
and City Council, they really appreciate the designation of a TOD pilot project in
Lakewood. Kathy Hodgson thanked all the staff that has worked so hard on this program
from both RTD and the City. She stated that General Manager Washington has exhibited
amazing leadership and great integrity. She also expressed appreciation of the great work
done by Bill Sirois. Kathy Hodgson noted the large area of almost 70 acres comprising this
project and how well three government entities have worked together. She reiterated the

excitement of the Mayor and City Council for this project; this will be a beautiful
community that really reflects the sentiments of the community.

Chair's Report




Chair Anderson noted that on November 5, 2013, the Board received a report from
General Manager Washington regarding the recommendation from staff and the
stakeholder committee to choose Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors
(GBBH) as the preferred contractor. She said that one year ago when the Board
was approving the I-225 Light Rail, no one thought it would be possible to entertain
the thought of a contract on North Metro; this happens because of dedication,
innovation and hard work of a team of people wanting to build a transit system for
our area. Chair Anderson commended General Manager Washington and his
capable staff, the Board of Directors past and present, along with local
governmental stakeholders who have worked together in good and bad times to get
this done. Chair Anderson noted that the North Metro line involves the Districts of
five Board members. She said last month she asked Director Solano to move the
recommended action forward at the FasTracks Monitoring Committee meeting and
for Director Lubow to second. Chair Anderson explained that this evening when it
comes time to move she would like to have Director Hoy make the motion and
Director Rivera-Malpiede second. Chair Anderson stated that this gives each of the
Directors along the line a chance to be part of this momentous occasion.
Chair Anderson shared that the Pine Junction Park-n-Ride Grand Opening was held
on November 2, 2013 with Director Daly speaking. Directors Bagley, Hoy and
Lasater were also in attendance.
Chaired Anderson thanked all veterans for their service. She noted that on
November 8, 2013 there was a Veterans’ Day Luncheon attended by Directors
Daly, Hoy, Rivera-Malpiede, Sisk and Tobiassen.
Chair Anderson attended the Last Mile Connection Symposium on November 20,
2013. She shared that both Directors James and Rivera-Malpiede were panelists.
Chair Anderson thought it was a great event and very successful
Chair Anderson reminded the Board of the Board Effectiveness workshop being held
on December 4, 2013.
Chair Anderson encouraged the Directors to donate to Operation Give-a-Gift. She
noted that there were boxes around Blake for people to donate. She stated that

there will be an Operation Give-a-Gift event at the Aquarium on December 16,
2013.
Chair Anderson reminded everyone that the Board office is having a fundraiser for
former Director Matt Cohen as he fights the battle of his life against Multiple
Myeloma. There will be a meet and greet with the Board members and a hot lunch
will be served. She noted that the cost is $10 and all proceeds will go directly to
the Matt Cohen Family Support Fund.

General Manager Washington reported to the Board that he was asked to be on the
2014 Military Service Academy Nomination Panel with Director Rivera-Malpiede.
The Panel interviewed young people that are applying for Service Academy slots.
He stated there were some very outstanding young people. General Manager
Washington said that he felt safer already knowing these young people will be
going to our military academies.
General Manager Washington shared that Monday, December 2, 2013, a delegation
from Salt Lake City will be visiting RTD. He said that originally staff through it
would only be staff from the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) headed by their CEO;
however, General Manager Washington shared that he just found out they will also
be brining several Board members as well as the Mayor. He explained the purpose
of the visit was to visit Denver Union Station and learn how the project was done,
specifically the financing.
General Manager Washington informed the Board that RTD’s Multi-Agency
Exchange Program (MAX) was just selected to receive a prestigious award and
honor from the National Transit Institute at Rutgers University. He reminded the
Board that the MAX program is an exchange program that RTD created with other
agencies around the country to learn best practices.
General Manager Washington invited the Board to the Grand Illumination Event on
November 29, 2013 at Denver Union Station where Chair Anderson will introduce
Director Rivera-Malpiede for comments.

Public Hearing for 2014 Recommended Budget
Chair Anderson called the public hearing on the 2014 recommended budget to order and

“I am quite proud to have put forward this motion in
committee for formal action by the Board. As a long-time

resident of the north area, this means a huge amount to me
and to all the residents this line will serve. To quote the
excellent editorial in Sunday’s Denver Post that urged the
Board to vote for this motion tonight, “What a difference a
few years makes.” Just when things were looking nearly
impossible, the leaders in the north area didn’t just complain
about the situation, they united with RTD staff and the RTD
Board, and with our elected officials and stakeholders to work
together to find a way to make this happen. I thank you all for

XIV. Old Business
Director Folska reminded everyone that RTD was a joint recipient of a Transit Alliance
award on November 8 for the Peoria Street Crossing. Director Bagley accepted the award
on behalf of the agency. Chair Anderson added that the City of Denver and the City of
Aurora were also part of the joint award. Altogether she believes there were about 8
different entities involved.

XV.

New Business
Director Rivera-Malpiede shared with the Board that she spoke with Terri Cohen regarding
former Director Cohen. She said that Terri Cohen extends her thanks to everyone that has
been so supportive. Former Director Cohen went through a stem-cell transplant very well.
Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that the upcoming week would be tough for him but asked
everyone to keep him in their prayers.
Director Menten shared that in light of recent discussion regarding the safety of the D Line
along the Welton Corridor, she rode the line to the 30th and Downing station after last
Tuesday’s meeting. She began her trip at about 9:30 p.m. Director Menten said that she
planned to wait at 30th and Downing for a while but it was just too plain quiet. She
decided to walk to 27th and Welton and did speak with several ladies who were out for the

evening. Director Menten commented that she spoke to them about the concerns they
had. She said that the women did not feel there was anything in their area to be more
concerned about than in other metro areas. Director Menten noted the women also were
surprised that so many stations were built in such a short distance. Director Menten
commented that while she walked she did not encounter any problems and felt the lighting
was sufficient.
Director Bagley said that last Thursday on a snowy day, he too went with John Perry and
Jessie Carter to ride the D Line to the end. He recommends that every Director ride the
Line to understand what is going on in the corridor. Director Bagley noted that the driver
of the train was on his first week but he conducted himself extremely well. Director
Bagley stated that because the corridor is single track there can be big issues if there are
any problems; while he was riding the train there were doors that could not be closed.
This created approximately a 20 minute delay. He said it demonstrated how problems
could really be magnified if this happened during rush hour. Director Bagley believes this
demonstrates that the closing of the station at 29th and Welton is imperative in keeping
the system running on-time.
Director Deadwyler stated that she is thankful and grateful that Board members are paying
attention to what is going on in this corridor. Director Deadwyler said that even though
Director Menten did not have any encounters, if people visit more they will get a better
flavor of what is going on.
