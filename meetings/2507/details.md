#### 3. 2016-013 : Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget

It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ____, Series of 2016 to amend the 2016 Amended Budget for the Base System for the inclusion of 1) de-appropriation of debt, 2) reduction of estimated interest expense, 3) use of the Board-Appropriated Fund, 4) use of the Capital Replacement Fund, 5) reduction to the estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance; and amend the 2016 Amended Budget for FasTracks Project for the inclusion of 1) reduction of budgeted operating expense, 2) reduction to the Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance.

Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect the Base System only are detailed as follows:

1)      De-appropriation of new financing proceeds of $50.0 million.  Originally appropriated in the 2016 Amended Budget, the planned debt issuance for fleet purchases is rescinded to be replaced by use of the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital Replacement Fund.

2)      Reduction to estimated interest expense of $0.45 million.  As a result of #1 above, estimated interest expense will be reduced in 2016.

3)      Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund of $14.8 million.  In place of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Board-Appropriated Fund be reduced by $14.8 million to support planned fleet purchases in 2016.   Use of fund balances instead of debt is necessary to preserve on-going debt service coverage.  Net of a previously scheduled contribution of $3.0 million to this fund at year-end, the actual fund usage is $11.8 million.

4)      Reduction to Capital Replacement Fund of $18.0 million.  In place of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Capital Replacement Fund be reduced by $18.0 million to support planned fleet purchases in 2016 in combination with #3 above.  Use of fund balances instead of debt is necessary to preserve on-going debt service coverage.  Net of a previously scheduled contribution of $3.0 million to this fund at year-end, the actual fund usage is $15.0 million.

5)      Reduction to unrestricted fund balance of $1.4 million.  As a result of the above changes, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to decline $1.4 million to $2.1 million at year-end 2016.

Other estimated (not appropriated) revisions to the 2016 Amended Budget affecting the Base System include:

1)      Increase to other income of $9.0 million.  It is proposed that TABOR reserves in the amount of $9.0 million be released in exchange for providing the Blake building as collateral.

2)      Increase to investment income of $0.39 million.  A revision to estimated investment income is made due to higher market interest rates.

Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect FasTracks Project only are detailed as follows:

1)      Reduction of $8.8 million in budgeted operating expense in Capital Programs.  This revision is necessary to correct a request made in the Amended Budget in error which resulted in overstatement of budgeted operating expense in Capital Programs of $8.8 million.

2)      Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and unrestricted fund balance of $0.5 million each.  The reduction to each of these funds is a direct result of the reduction to operating expense and is not a use of these fund balances.

The result of these revisions is a decrease in the District-wide appropriation of $45.0 million to $2.299 million as summarized below from the attached Exhibit I.

Operating and non-operating revenue estimates are revised as detailed below:
