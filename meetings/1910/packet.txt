Recommendation for Contract Award to
Triunity-Hill Joint Venture for the FasTracks
Construction Management Support Consultant
Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to award a contract to the Triunity-Hill Joint Venture, the most qualified firm based
on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the amount not to exceed $15,150,000 for Construction
Management Support Consulting work for FasTracks for the years 2014-2020. Funds for the award are
contained in the RTD FasTracks capital budget for each project to which they will be assigned.
BACKGROUND
Since the start of FasTracks, RTD has utilized the expertise of various management support consultants
to provide specialized program management expertise, fill short term staffing needs, and augment the
RTD FasTracks staff. Most of these multi-year contracts, like RTD’s current Program Support
Consultant, will reach the end of their contract terms in 2017. However, with the start of the North
Metro corridor project and the potential for future projects, RTD’s program support needs will extend
beyond 2017. Therefore, RTD decided to pursue a new consulting contract to provide ongoing support
for North Metro and future projects.
In February 2014, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Construction Management Support
Consulting Services for the FasTracks program, with an initial focus on the North Metro project. This
contract term would extend for six years, negotiated annually, with four (4) one-year options. On March
12, 2014, four excellent, written proposals were received, listed here in alphabetical order:





Kleinfelder
LS Gallegos and Associates, Inc.
RockSol/CH2M HILL
Triunity-Hill Joint Venture

A five-member evaluation team was formed to review these proposals and select the best qualified
team, based on the following evaluation criteria from the RFP:
A. Understanding of Project Objectives .......................................... 25%
B. Technical and Management Approach ....................................... 30%
C. Capabilities and Experience ...................................................... 30%
D. DBE/SBE Approach, WIN Program Approach, and Creative
Strategies to Ensure Diversity and Inclusion ............................... 15%
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 4

1.C.1

After reviewing and scoring the proposals individually, the five-member evaluation team met and scored
the written proposals as a team. While there were differences in ranking the third and fourth proposals,
the reviewers had consistently ranked the top two proposals, with unanimous consent on the
recommended proposer. Additionally, both the individual and consensus scores provided enough of a
gap that a best-qualified choice was evident.
During the consensus review meeting, the proposal evaluation team discussed strengths and
weaknesses of each proposal, compared scoring, and developed a consensus score and ranking for each
firm. The Triunity-Hill JV scored the highest ranking within the criteria and was the consensus selection.
Triunity is a locally based DBE company.
The Triunity-Hill JV, which includes a certified DBE as 51% managing partner, has committed to meeting
RTD’s initial DBE Goal of 27% for this Contract, and has set their own goal of 34%. Additionally,
Triunity-Hill JV has committed to meeting or exceeding RTD’s 10% WIN Program Goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the contract award are included in the FasTracks budget for each project that the firm will be
assigned.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award a contract to the Triunity-Hill
Joint Venture, the most qualified firm based on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the
amount not to exceed $15,150,000 for Construction Management Support Consulting work for
FasTracks for the years 2014-2020. Funds for the award are contained in the RTD FasTracks capital
budget for each project to which they will be assigned.
2. Reject all submittals and re-solicit for new proposals. This is not recommended as the evaluation
criteria was in accordance with the Brooks Act requiring a qualifications based selection. Triunity-Hill
JV’s proposal was fully responsive to the selection criteria. Also, the evaluation team was
unanimous in its recommended selection of Triunity-Hill JV; a significant endorsement of this
proposal.
3. Reject all submittals and reconsider the current program management approach. This is not
recommended as RTD doesn’t currently have sufficient staff available to manage the North Metro
project, and does not desire an increase in RTD staffing headcount at this late point in the program.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: May 8, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: May 13, 2014

Subject:

Approval of the
Evaluation (APE)

2014

Annual

Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee the Board of Directors approve the 2014
Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The APE provides a comprehensive financial blueprint for all
FasTracks capital projects completed, underway or planned through the year 2019.
BACKGROUND
RTD has been conducting an Annual Program Evaluation since 2007. Given the challenges of managing
a multi-billion dollar capital program, it is desirable to perform a complete analysis of the cost of the
program. The APE captures all project expenses to date and all planned expenses through the year
2019 on a project-by-project basis. It essentially provides a baseline capital budget for board-approved
projects currently underway or planned in the near future.
Since so many of the FasTracks projects are now in construction, the major effort has shifted from
developing accurate estimates of costs to one of managing the projects within the Board-approved
budgets for those projects. The staff provides the Board with regular updates on the FasTracks projects
throughout the year.
On April 1, staff provided an update on the 2014 APE to the FasTracks Monitoring Committee with the
intention of bringing it to the Board at a later date for approval. That presentation is attached. There
have been no changes to the project information since that presentation.
DISCUSSION
The project-by-project cost along with the amount spent through 2013 is shown in the attached
presentation. The total FasTracks budget through 2019 is approximately $5.3 billion, and approximately
$3 billion of this total was spent through the end of 2013.
Since most of our projects are complete or under construction and are being managed within the Boardapproved budgets, the changes to this APE are relatively small. The changes primarily reflect updates to
the project scope and accounting as shown on the attached presentation. A summary of these changes
for the 2014 APE capital budget is:


Incorporation of the US36 BRT scope as approved by the Board in September 2013; with the
exception of the Broomfield parking structure and the north/west-bound Church Ranch platform
which will be completed after 2019;



I-225 storage tracks approved by the Board in April 2014;



Incorporation into the capital budget of the additional (4) Eagle vehicles approved by the Board in
December 2013;

Packet Pg. 6

1.C.2



Purchase of BNSF right-of-way, west of Ward Road on the Gold Line approved by the Board in
2010.

This APE is a key input to the overall, long-term financial plan that is part of the Senate Bill (SB) 208
Baseline Report that is scheduled to be reviewed by the RTD Board and submitted to DRCOG in the
summer of 2014. The SB 208 and related Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) amendment will include a
comprehensive financial plan that includes all costs and revenues for both base system and FasTracks
through the year 2040.
Future implementation of projects not included in the current APE, must identify the necessary changes
to the financial plan and be submitted to the Board for approval before they could proceed. Therefore,
the APE is a dynamic tool, which is updated as projects move towards completion and any changes
approved by the Board are incorporated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The acceleration of the US 36 BRT project scope through 2018 totals $17.45 million. Of this total,
$1.25 million would be funded through a FASTER grant received in 2014, and the balance of $16.2
million would be funded through the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).
The remaining
changes would be funded within the cash flow of the financial plan adopted by the Board of Directors in
November 2013.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee the
Board of Directors approve the 2014 Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The APE provides a
comprehensive financial blueprint for all FasTracks capital projects completed, underway or planned
through the year 2019.
2. Do not approve the 2014 APE. This is not recommended as FasTracks would not have an updated,
capital budget to manage the program through the year 2019.
