This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:

• Wagon Road PnR/144th FlexRide
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
enter into a 4 (Four) year contract with Smart Commute Metro North
Transportation Management Organization for the implementation and
ongoing grant administration of the new Wagon Road PnR/144th FlexRide.
The grant includes $1,600,000 in initial funding and $400,000 in local
match for a total grant amount of $2,000,000. The total not to exceed RTD
contribution to this grant is $150,000.
It is also recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to amend the current ADA paratransit/FlexRide services contract with Via
Mobility Services (contract #16-DH-047) to allow RTD to distribute grant
funds to VIA Mobility Services to operate the new Wagon Road/144th
FlexRide. The contract increase for the new FlexRide service is $303,161
for year 1; $317,099 for year 2; and $331,927 for year 3. In addition, RTD
will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to
be $36,840 for year 1; $37,945 for year 2; and $39,050 for year 3. The
fourth year cost for the Wagon Road/144th FlexRide service will not be
included in this amendment since contract 16-DH-047 will be rebid during
2022. The initial 3-year not-to-exceed amount for service is $952,186; and
fuel is $113,835.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
