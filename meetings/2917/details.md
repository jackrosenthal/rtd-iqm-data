#### 2. Wagon Road PnR/144th FlexRide

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a 4 (Four) year contract with Smart Commute Metro North Transportation Management Organization for the implementation and ongoing grant administration of the new Wagon Road PnR/144th FlexRide.  The grant includes $1,600,000 in initial funding and $400,000 in local match for a total grant amount of $2,000,000.  The total not to exceed RTD contribution to this grant is $150,000.

It is also recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend the current ADA paratransit/FlexRide services contract with Via Mobility Services (contract #16-DH-047) to allow RTD to distribute grant funds to VIA Mobility Services to operate the new Wagon Road/144th FlexRide.  The contract increase for the new FlexRide service is $303,161 for year 1; $317,099 for year 2; and $331,927 for year 3.  In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be $36,840 for year 1; $37,945 for year 2; and $39,050 for year 3.  The fourth year cost for the Wagon Road/144th FlexRide service will not be included in this amendment since contract 16-DH-047 will be rebid during 2022.  The initial 3-year not-to-exceed amount for service is $952,186; and fuel is $113,835.

This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:

Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
