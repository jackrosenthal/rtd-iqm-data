Subject:

Station Naming Plan for U.S. 36 Bus Rapid
Transit

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors accept and
approve the proposed U.S. 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Station Naming Plan, codifying final name and
nomenclature changes for the U.S. 36 BRT Line as follows:
a.
b.
c.
d.

Boarding locations shall be referred to as “stations” for U.S. 36 BRT.
The current U.S. 36•Westminster Center station shall be renamed to US 36•Sheridan station.
The current Table Mesa station shall be renamed to U.S. 36•Table Mesa station.
All other station names shall remain the same as existing (U.S. 36•Church Ranch; U.S.
36•Broomfield; U.S. 36•Flatiron; and U.S. 36•McCaslin)

BACKGROUND
This action meets the 2015 RTD General Manager goals of Advancing/Completing FasTracks and
Improving Service Delivery. In advance of the opening of the U.S. 36 BRT, staff recommends the
following modifications to the existing naming and nomenclature of the corridor stops, consistent with
the RTD Board Station Naming Policy (attached). Establishing the names will allow the project team to
move forward with the sign fabrication and installation to coincide with the completion of the station
work in fall 2015. There are two components to this staff recommendation: first, to change the
nomenclature for the boarding areas and second, a change to the names for two stop locations in the
corridor. The U.S. 36 BRT Station Naming Plan was discussed with the U.S. 36 stakeholder group on
November 25, 2014, and there was general consensus and support from the stakeholders for the
recommendations.
Staff Recommendation: Rename BRT stops “stations”
Staff recommends referring to the BRT passenger boarding areas “stations” to remain consistent with
RTD practice on other rapid transit lines, which happen to currently be rail technology.
Station names are recognized destinations for RTD patrons. This enables travelers to easily identify
station locations and destinations, and to efficiently complete trips. RTD’s standard naming protocol
defines the name of a station, Park-n-Ride (PnR) or transfer center based on its geographic location.
Along U.S. 36, these names have historically been based either on the nearest major road such as
Church Ranch Boulevard, Flatiron Crossing Drive/96th Street, McCaslin Boulevard and Table Mesa Drive,
or on locations such as Broomfield and Westminster Center. These names have been used on plans, fact
sheets and the RTD web site.
In the past year, the stations along the U.S. 36 highway have had “U.S. 36” added to their names: U.S.
36•Westminster Center, U.S. 36•Church Ranch, U.S. 36•Broomfield, U.S. 36•Flatiron and U.S.
36•McCaslin.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Staff is recommending name changes for two of the U.S. 36 stations.
Staff Recommendation: Rename Table Mesa Station to U.S. 36•Table Mesa Station
Staff recommends renaming the Table Mesa Station to the U.S. 36•Table Mesa Station for both clarity
and consistency with the standard naming protocols. There are several PnR’s along Table Mesa. The one
associated with the U.S. 36 BRT should be denoted as such by following the same naming convention
as the other BRT stations in the corridor by having U.S. 36 as part of the name.
Staff Recommendation: Rename U.S. 36•Westminster to U.S. 36•Sheridan Station
Staff recommends renaming the U.S. 36•Westminster Center Station to the U.S. 36•Sheridan Station.
When stations and transit centers have the same or similar names it can be confusing. For instance, the
new station for the Northwest Rail Line is under construction and will be called the Westminster Station.
Having a Westminster Station and a Westminster Center Station will lead to additional confusion. By
renaming the Westminster Center Station as the “U.S. 36•Sheridan” Station, it will be named based on
its geographical location. It is easily recognizable and makes sense to the customer.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD has already established a project budget in the FasTracks program to place new signage at the
stations for the implementation of the new BRT service. Any changes to the station naming will be
incorporated into this effort. It is expected that these all of the recommended changes can be done
within the established budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors accept and approve the proposed U.S. 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Station
Naming Plan, codifying final name and nomenclature changes for the U.S. 36 BRT Line as follows:
a.
b.
c.
d.

Boarding locations shall be referred to as “stations” for U.S. 36 BRT.
The current U.S. 36•Westminster Center station shall be renamed to US 36•Sheridan station.
The current Table Mesa station shall be renamed to U.S. 36•Table Mesa station.
All other station names shall remain the same as existing (U.S. 36•Church Ranch; U.S.
36•Broomfield; U.S. 36•Flatiron; and U.S. 36•McCaslin)

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead, leave the names as is. This is not recommended as
the Table Mesa station name would not be consistent with the other BRT station names in the
corridor. Also, it would not address the issue of multiple stations in Westminster. Additionally, if the
passenger boarding areas are continued to be called “stops,” it would not be consistent with the RTD
practice of calling passenger boarding areas “stations” for RTD’s rapid transit lines.
