#### 1. Station Naming Plan for U.S. 36 Bus Rapid Transit

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors accept and approve the proposed U.S. 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Station Naming Plan, codifying final name  and nomenclature changes for the U.S. 36 BRT Line as follows:

a.       Boarding locations shall be referred to as “stations” for U.S. 36 BRT.

b.       The current U.S. 36•Westminster Center station shall be renamed to US 36•Sheridan station.

c.       The current Table Mesa station shall be renamed to U.S. 36•Table Mesa station.

d.       All other station names shall remain the same as existing (U.S. 36•Church Ranch; U.S. 36•Broomfield; U.S. 36•Flatiron; and U.S. 36•McCaslin)

Motion:              Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the January 20, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Nadine Lee, US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project Manager, stated that this action relates to the nomenclature for each boarding area as well as two potential name changes along the US 36 BRT Line.  She said that the first component requests that boarding areas be referred to as “stations”.  This follows RTD’s naming philosophy of all other high capacity corridors while “stops” are typically used along services like local bus routes.  She noted that the second part requesting renaming two stations is to provide clarity.  There is a Westminster station planned along the Northwest Rail Line so changing the current US 36 • Westminster Center station to US 36 • Sheridan station prevents confusion.   Additionally, there are several Park-n-Rides along Table Mesa.  Renaming this station to include US 36 clarifies that this is the BRT station.

Nadine Lee explained that this recommendation was being brought to the Board now so that they could proceed with sign fabrication, providing enough lead time for the fabrication to be done by opening day.  She noted that this action has no financial impact; the project budget already includes funding to fabricate the signs.  The only impact would be if signs had to be re-printed at a later date.

Nadine Lee stated that staff has presented this to stakeholders and received a general consensus and support for the proposal.

Committee Chair Hoy noted that he confirmed with the City of Westminster that they were supportive of the renaming of their station.

Chair Sisk thanked Nadine Lee, Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, and Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager, for their efforts in working with the stakeholders to form a consensus.  He reiterated how important it is for RTD to continue to build trust with our stakeholders on all our projects.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

##### a. 2011-05-17 Station  Facility Naming Policy Board Report

#### 1. US 36 Bus Rapid Transit Update

Nadine Lee reviewed a Power Point Presentation with the Board that is available in the January 6, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.  She also provided a US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Reference Guide.  She explained that the reference guide provides important background information on the project as well as highlighting some major features.  Nadine Lee offered to meet with any Board member that would like to review the project in greater detail.

Nadine Lee outlined the notable US 36 BRT/Express Lanes Progress as follows:

- Phase I (Federal Blvd to 88th Street)

o        Over 86% complete

o        6 bridges complete

o        Eastbound mainline paving and slip ramps complete

o        Eastbound Broomfield platform complete

- Phase II (88th Street to Table Mesa)

o        Over 44% complete

- Programmatic BRT Activities

o        Branding identity complete – Flatiron Flyer

o        Issued Notice to Proceed for opening day vehicle procurement

Committee Chair Hoy commented that the Board should be very pleased that Nadine Lee is working on this project.  He said she does such an amazing job though her enthusiasm and dedication to working with the stakeholders.  He thanked her for all her hard work.

Chair Sisk extended his appreciation to the entire project team.  He shared that he just attended a US 36 Commuting Solutions breakfast at which General Manager Washington gave a very informative presentation.  He said that people are very excited about what is happening; the thought of having US 36 BRT in operation this year is pretty amazing.

Chair Sisk indicated that he is often asked when there will be a switch from HOV2+ to HOV3+.  He recognizes this is a CDOT question but hopes it can be something RTD begins to educate the stakeholders about with CDOT’s assistance.  Nadine Lee stated that the change will happen by 2017 at the latest but she did not have an exact date.

Chair Sisk inquired if the canopies at the stations would have real time information.  Nadine Lee said that each station has a programmable display that will have the schedule information on opening day.  General Manager Washington explained that the infrastructure at the stations will be in place for real time information as soon as the technology becomes available.

Director Bagley pointed out that the intersection at US 36 and McCaslin Boulevard will be a diverging diamond interchange.  This type of interchange is different than any other interchange in the RTD system as well as the first of its kind in the region.  He thinks it might be worthwhile for the Board to have another presentation about how the interchange works.  Nadine Lee shared that there is a fact sheet that was prepared by CDOT as well as a video.  She said she will get the Board some additional information.

General Manager Washington stated that a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) has been issued for custom buses that better meet the criteria for true BRT (i.e. low floor, two doors, quick loading, etc.); RTD received five proposals that are currently in the review process.  He said that staff would keep the Board updated on the process and if any Requests for Proposals (RFPs) are issued.

General Manager Washington commented that another important piece of the project is the education and outreach that CDOT will be doing in conjunction with RTD.  He said the Board would begin to see these activities in the coming months.

General Manager Washington noted that the last piece staff was working on was the Grand Opening of the BRT with CDOT.  He explained that RTD will have the buses in October, 2015, but Phase II of the managed lanes will not yet be complete.  He shared that he recognizes that CDOT wants to have a Grand Opening but it does not make sense for RTD to be running the BRT buses for two or three months and then have the Grand Opening.  He recognized that it will be important for RTD to coordinate this with CDOT and the contractor.
