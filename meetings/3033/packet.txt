Manager, Capital Programs

Subject:

of
Amendment

General

Board Meeting Date: September 29, 2020
Rescue

Vehicle

Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or the designee, to execute all documents necessary to amend the
contract with Wiese Rail Service for the North Metro corridor rescue vehicle modifications to increase
the contract not-to-exceed amount by $178,658.39, for a total not-to-exceed contract amount of
$1,036,093.39. Funding for this contract amendment is included in the 2020 Adopted budget for the
North Metro Corridor Mobilization project.
This action addresses 2020 Strategic Priority Goal #4 – Increase Ridership, Improve Rider Experience.
BACKGROUND
In 2018, RTD Staff, as part of the North Metro Rail Corridor emergency preparedness process, examined
potential hazards, mitigations, and contingency needs for the corridor. This process identified risks and
mitigation strategies that were an integral part of RTD’s proposal to internally operate and maintain the
North Metro Rail Line. Throughout this extensive risk evaluation process, the potential of stranding one
or more passenger trains in the event of power failure was identified. This risk was analyzed in detail for
segments of the North Metro corridor that are single track, especially the Skyway Bridge location. This
risk has been mitigated through the acquisition of a diesel-powered rescue vehicle.
On August 14, 2018, at the Operations and Customer Service Committee, RTD Staff presented details
of the rescue vehicle. The recommended 2019 Budget, which included North Metro mobilization and
operations costs, was presented to the Finance, Administration and Audit Committee on November 13,
2018. On November 27, 2018 a Public Hearing was held for the 2019 Recommended Budget and the
resolution to approve the budget was passed by the Board.
RTD pursued a competitive bidding process and issued an RFP (#18DR003) to acquire an FRA compliant
rescue vehicle. RTD’s internal cost estimate for the acquisition and delivery of the rescue vehicle was
$1.8 million. The proposals received were higher than the internal estimates and had a very long lead
time for a vehicle delivery. RTD did not select any of the proposals.
The RTD team explored alternative rail technologies to address the rescue demands of the corridor. RTD
decided to acquire Trackmobile’s Rail Car Mover model, Atlas, from Wiese Rail Service through a Sole
Source contract procurement because of the unique design and operation features offered. The Atlas
model unit offered two modes of operations - Rail and Road. On the mainline tracks, Atlas operates on
steel wheels, and on the roads, it operates on rubber tires. Additionally, Atlas meets the weight
requirement by FRA to haul a double married pair with a crush load capacity - a weight equivalent of
approximately 712,000 pounds. On Thursday, June 20, 2019, a standard Purchase Order (#187609) in

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

the amount of $857,435 was issued to Wiese Rail Service for the acquisition and shipping of the rescue
vehicle. This cost compared favorably with our internal cost estimate to acquire this vehicle: $890,000.
DISCUSSION
Since December 2019, RTD staff members and FRA representatives have made multiple field visits at
Weise’s office in Brighton CO to monitor the progress of modifications in order to deliver the rescue
vehicle. During these visits, the RTD consultant and resident RTD vehicle expert required several
modifications for hauling passenger trains on the mainline tracks in the event of power failure over
grades exceeding 4%. The modifications fell into three (3) categories: the installation of transit couplers
that are compatible with the current commuter rail fleet, the addition of 75-80 KW Head-end Power
(HEP) Generator with the associated ballast box to secure it, and changes to the vehicle body and
machine. RTD’s internal cost estimate for the rescue vehicle modification was $167,533.00 and the
final negotiated price with the vendor is $178,652.39.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The rescue vehicle modifications will increase the contract by $178,652.39, creating a total contract
amount, including this amendment, of $1,036,093.39. Staff is seeking contract authority, not budget
authority, as the funding for this vehicle and the required modifications is included in the approved 2020
Amended Budget for the North Metro Corridor Mobilization project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or the designee, to
execute all documents necessary to award this Contract Amendment to ensure passenger safety
and operational readiness of the North Metro corridor.

CEO

Date: September 16, 2020

From:

Michael S. Meader, CSO/AGM,
Security & Asset Management

GM

Date:

September 16, 2020

Subject:

Approval of 2021 Public
Agency Safety Plan (PTASP)

Safety,

Board Meeting Date: September 29, 2020
Transportation

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the 2021 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) as required by 49 CFR Part 674
State Safety Oversight Regulations.
The recommended action proposed supports the following GM Goals:
Task Goal #1 Enhance Safety and Security
DISCUSSION
The FTA created a new State Safety Oversight regulation 49 CFR Part 674 in 2016 and the State Safety
Oversight - Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) Safety Program standard was certified in April
of 2018 making the new ruling effective in August 2018. The new regulation requires Rail Transit
Agencies to develop a Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) based on a Safety
Management System (SMS) framework that is signed by the Agency Accountable Executive (General
Manager and CEO) approved by the Board of Directors and then submitted to the CPUC/State Safety
Oversight Agency for certification annually.
However, the FTA released the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan regulation 49 CFR Part 673 in
2018 which requires agencies to develop and be compliant with a PUC approved PTASP by July 20,
2020. As a result of the mismatched timing of the regulations, we are in a transitional period, still
technically under Part 659 SSPP as an Agency, but also technically beholden to the new Part 674 State
Safety Oversight regulation. Therefore, we are submitting a PTASP in the SMS Framework that is still a
bridge document that includes all required PTASP and SMS elements. We are asking for your approval of
this 2021 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan, understanding that it meets all requirements of the
CPUC 49 CFR Part 674 State Safety Oversight requirements. This 2021 PTASP is very similar to the
2020 PTASP the board approved in November of 2019, with a few minor edits to format, event
notification and the safety reporting process.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Financial Impact – There is no financial impact.
ALTERNATIVES

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.2

1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the 2021 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) to ensure compliance with 49 CFR
Part 674 State Safety Oversight regulations.
2. Do not approve the 2020 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) and RTD will not be in
compliance with 49 CFR Part 674 State Safety Oversight Regulations potentially forfeiting government
funding.

Issued to:

Light Rail Transportation Controllers/Supervisors
Light Rail Maintenance Supervisors
Safety

Current Issue:

01/17/2020

____________________________________________
Assistant General Manager, Rail Operations

I.

PURPOSE
The investigation of an incident/accident must produce information that leads to
corrective actions that prevent or reduce the number and severity of future
incident/accidents, if possible. The more complete the information, the easier it will
be to take the proper corrective actions.
For purposes of incident/accident prevention, investigations must be for fact finding,
not fault finding. This is not to imply that responsibility may not be fixed where
human error has caused an incident/accident or that persons should be excused from
the consequences of their actions. Rather, the investigation should be concerned only
with the facts.

II.

DEFINITIONS
Field Investigation Team (FIT) Investigation
The Field Investigation Team is a group of representatives from Light Rail Operations,
Safety, Claims, and Media Relations. The FIT is activated as required by the
investigating supervisor on the scene. Generally, the Team will be activated to
investigate incident/accidents that are serious in nature; however, personal injury and
extent of damage will not be the sole criteria. Department Managers are responsible
for providing Control with a current list of representatives for notification.
The investigating supervisor is responsible for requesting activation of the Team.
Light Rail Central Control is responsible for notification of Team members.
Notification of Team members may be delegated by Central Control to other
operations or safety personnel. The Senior Manager of Safety and Environmental
Compliance or designee is responsible for coordination of the investigation. When
activated, the Field Investigation Team will:

Executive Summary

In 2016, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) mandated ‘Transit Asset Management Plans’ for all
federally-funded transit agencies in the United States by October 2018. The FTA is concerned about
the sustainability of transit assets when the backlog of renewals is estimated at $90 billion
nationwide. The Federal Government’s Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) said
the time had come to change focus from construction to longer term stewardship (2012).
This Regional Transportation District (RTD) Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan is a formal report
that meets the FTA TAM requirements under MAP-21.
A Transit Asset Management Plan (TAMP) is the cornerstone of asset stewardship. It is the public
case for investment in the assets, to justify the use of tax dollars and fares to meet community
requirements. It aims to demonstrate the best use of funding to deliver services now and into the
future.
Accordingly, this document summarizes:
•

The principles RTD uses to make asset decisions aligned to Agency priorities

•

What assets RTD owns

•

The current state of those assets

•

How RTD makes asset investment decisions

•

The proposed capital investment plan for the period 2020-2025

•

Actions to further improve asset management decision making

•

How this plan will be evaluated for continuous improvement

RTD, like all transit agencies, is highly asset-intensive. In the past fifteen years, RTD has spent $5.1
billion on expansion, including new rail and bus rapid transit lines.
When MAP-21 was passed in 2012, RTD appointed dedicated staff to focus on asset management and
began to review both its asset inventory data (the details of what assets RTD owns and manages) and
the condition of these assets, using the principle of State of Good Repair (SGR). Both of these are
now requirements from the FTA.
RTD then made the decision to move beyond FTA minimum requirements and commit to
implementing established international good practice in the form of ISO 55000 certification. This is
focused on better decision-making across the asset portfolio for asset optimization. By 2017, RTD
had put in place the first steps towards an integrated process to prioritize all capital investment by
agency objectives. This has further been refined to categorize all investment proposals by
Compliance, Renewal, or Expansion, and generally fund them in that order to ensure good
stewardship. This ensures investment to maintain existing assets is sustained before funding new
asset or non-asset projects.
This process forms the basis for this TAM Plan, along with RTD’s commitment to continue to develop
its asset management practices.
RTD is actively involved in transit asset management thought-leadership, through the American Public
Transportation Association (APTA) and Transportation Research Board (TRB). RTD examples were
used by the FTA in its TAM Facility Performance Measure Reporting Guidebook (U.S. Department of
Transportation, 2018). RTD believes that a shift in culture is needed towards improved stewardship
of assets using better information and decision tools.
RTD’s long-term strategy is to make consistently good decisions across RTD’s asset portfolio and asset
systems to deliver customer needs in a financially sustainable and safe way, using the ISO 55000
framework. This effort has led to the implementation of an investment planning process for planning
and budgeting, as well as the target to achieve ISO 55000 certification by the end of 2020.
The Asset Management System (AMS) in RTD is being developed in close coordination with the safety
management system, and both informed by a developing corporate risk framework to understand
and manage risks to agency objectives. The aim is to move towards international good practice riskbased prioritization.
RTD exists to move people effectively and efficiently, and the focus here is to ensure effective
stewardship of the assets that deliver this purpose. The cities RTD serves should know what
investments are made and how they are prioritized to make the best use of limited resources. This is
done through transparency in decision processes to sustain the condition and performance of the
assets.

3. DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS

What tools and
processes does RTD use
to prioritize funding
around those assets
described in its
inventory?

On an annual basis, RTD executes a process which prepares and updates a six-year
Mid Term Financial Plan including projected capital construction and
improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the
capital and operating programs. Part of the process includes prioritizing the
projects into three funding categories: Compliance, Renewal, and Enhancement.



4. PRIORITIZED LIST OF INVESTMENTS

What is the result or
output of those decision
support tools and
processes?

The output of the annual Mid Term Financial Plan process is two primary lists of
projects; Capital Projects & Capital Maintenance Projects. Each list is subdivided
into three funding categories: Compliance, Renewal, and Enhancement.



5. TAM AND SGR POLICY

What are the guiding
principles for asset
management efforts at
RTD?

RTD adopted an Asset Management Policy in June 2014 and most recently
updated July 2019.
The intent of the policy is to improve how RTD manages assets from now on - it is
therefore forward-looking in nature and represents the Agency’s vision and
shared commitment for good Asset Management at RTD. The Asset Management
System applies to the entire organization and directs the short, medium, and longterm plans for assets to achieve the Agency purpose of moving people.

1.B.2.a

How is RTD going to
execute the TAM plan?

RTD has chosen ISO 55000 as the framework to build its Asset Management
System. As part of that choice, RTD underwent a gap assessment to determine
the necessary tasks needed to achieve ISO 55000 certification.



7. LIST OF KEY ANNUAL ACTIVITIES

What activities does RTD
perform to maintain its
TAM system?

RTD identifies two types of asset management activities: those ongoing asset
management activities that RTD performs as part of ‘business as usual,’ and those
activities specific to achieving ISO 55000 certification. TAM activities are the
subset of these ISO activities targeting specific TAM elements.



8. IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES

What resources are
needed to execute RTD
TAM plan activities?

Personnel from across the Agency are involved in RTD’s Asset Management
activities, including the CEO/GM, the Senior Leadership Team, the Asset
Management Division (AMD), Bus Operations, Rail Operations, Capital Programs,
Finance and Administration, Communications, Planning, and General Counsel.



The AMD has expertise that enables the Agency to mature asset management
practices. From 2012 through 2016, the AMD added additional staff in two key
areas: physical asset business analysis and data science.
9. EVALUATION PLAN

What is the Agency
doing to ensure that the
TAM plan delivers the
intended results?

There are two primary areas of the Evaluation Plan; the TAM Plan itself and ISO
55000.
The current TAM Plan provides the baseline for evaluating future TAM Plans
produced by the Agency. RTD intends to regularly review its asset management
maturity, setting maturity targets in its Strategic Asset Management Plan.
RTD intends to evaluate the degree to which it is meeting the requirements for
ISO 55000, and therefore its readiness for an ISO 55001 certification audit,
through the following measures:
• ISO spot checks
• ISO health check
• ISO mock audit
• ISO audit
• ISO surveillance audits

1 Introduction
1.1

Background

On June 29, 2012, Congress passed MAP-21. In accordance with section 20019 of this law, the
Federal Transit Administration established standards that transit providers shall follow. The final rule
was published on July 26, 2016 in the Federal Register with an effective date of October 1, 2016
(Transit Asset Management; National Transit Database, 2016). RTD is a Tier I Agency, so all the
requirements apply.
The FTA requirements for a Transit Asset Management Plan are as follow:
Tier

Element
1. An inventory of
assets

Brief Description
A register of capital assets and information about those
assets.

2. A condition
assessment of
inventoried assets

A rating of the assets' physical state; to be completed for
assets an agency has direct capital responsibility for;
should be at a level of detail sufficient to monitor and
predict performance of inventoried assets.

3. Description of a
decision support tool

An analytic process or tool that (1) assists in capital asset
investment prioritization and/or (2) estimates capital
needs over time (does not necessarily mean software).

4. A prioritized list of
investments

A prioritized list of projects or programs to manage or
improve the SGR of capital assets.

5. TAM and SGR policy

A TAM policy is the executive-level direction regarding
expectations for transit asset management; a TAM strategy
consists of the actions that support the implementation of
the TAM policy.

6. Implementation
strategy

The operational actions that a transit provider decides to
conduct, in order to achieve its TAM goals and policies.

7. List of key annual
activities

The actions needed to implement a TAM plan for each year
of the plan's horizon.

8. Identification of
resources

A summary or list of the resources, including personnel,
that a provider needs to develop and carry out the TAM
plan.

9. Evaluation plan

An outline of how a provider will monitor, update, and
evaluate, as needed, its TAM plan and related business
practices, to ensure the continuous improvement.

Figure 3: RTD TAM Plan Alignment

Future generations of this TAM Plan will directly align with RTD’s Asset Management Policy and the
Strategic Asset Management Plan (Regional Transportation District, 2019).

1.7

Asset Management Policy

A TAM policy is a documented commitment to achieving and maintaining a state of good repair for all
capital assets. The FTA has defined state of good repair as “The condition in which a capital asset is
able to operate at a full level of performance” (Transit Asset Management; National Transit Database,
2016).
RTD’s Asset Management Policy was updated on July 31, 2019. The policy describes a forwardlooking commitment to good asset management practice, intended to optimize investment across
the entire asset portfolio to maximize its value. Value means delivering on the agency objectives, two
of which are safety and reliability. Asset management performed according to this policy will result in
assets that are in a state of good repair.

2 RTD and its Assets

The Regional Transportation District provides transportation services to 3.08 million people located
within its 2,400 square mile service area, including bus, rail, shuttles, ADA paratransit services,
demand responsive services like FlexRide, and special event services. Using these assets, RTD delivers
43 million service miles, across 141 routes, including 86 local bus, 8 light rail and 3 commuter rail
routes.

2.1

The RTD Story

RTD was created in 1969 by the 47th session of the Colorado General Assembly. Efforts
in these early years focused on regional transportation planning. In 1973, voters
approved a 0.5% sales tax initiative to finance a multi-modal transit system. At this
time, RTD acquired privately owned bus companies, improved service frequencies, and
expanded routes in numerous counties throughout the metro area. By 1976, ridership
grew to 35 million rides annually.

RTD celebrated its first light rail opening in October 1994. The 5.3-mile D Line attracted
hundreds of thousands of riders when it began operations with just eleven light rail
vehicles. Now, eight light rail lines service 57 stations along 7 individually constructed
corridors.
In November 2004, region voters approved the FasTracks transit tax for region-wide
expansion of transit service. The 0.04% sales tax provides funds to build RTD’s FasTracks program,
122 miles of new commuter rail and light rail, 18 miles of bus rapid transit, and bus stations. The
program consists of six new rapid transit corridors and three existing corridor extensions, and
expands and enhances service for easy, convenient bus/rail connections across the eight-county
district.

2.2

RTD Service Area

The RTD service area comprises eight counties including all of Boulder, Broomfield, Denver and
Jefferson counties, parts of Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas Counties, and a small portion of Weld
County.

At the turn of the millennium RTD had approximately 77 million passenger trips (U.S. Department of
Transportation, 2000), and is on course to have nearly 100 million passenger trips in 2019, over a 20%
increase in boardings. Over the same period, per the Colorado State Demography’s Office, the
Denver Boulder region has increased from approximately 2.4 million residents to approximately 3.2
million residents, a 31% increase (2019).

RTD Assets

RTD is an asset-intensive organization. RTD’s Statement of Net Position notes that total capital assets
sum to nearly $8.9 billion (Regional Transportation District, 2019). Much of this total expenditure
resulted in assets in the scope of Transit Asset Management. This section provides further details on
RTD’s asset inventory and condition for assets in-scope of TAM.
As assets are operated, their condition degrades over time and their risk of failure increases. Failures
can manifest themselves in a variety of ways, including those having an impact on safety. Asset
condition is therefore a leading indicator for safety risks, and so understanding asset condition today,
and how quickly it might degrade in the future, is an important aspect of good asset, safety and risk
management. Organizations that know their assets’ deterioration rates can also make more
informed decisions on renewal frequencies and their approach to preventive maintenance.
For the purposes of this TAMP, RTD has categorized its assets in accordance with FTA guidelines:
revenue vehicles, equipment, facilities and infrastructure, using the logic depicted in Figure 5 below,
which ensured repeatable results and an improvement in inventory data quality.

1.B.2.a

RTD’s revenue vehicles comprise 1,448 buses and 185 light rail vehicles.
Buses include fixed route standard transit buses which are 40 feet long and carry 40 passengers; fixed
route articulated buses with 33% greater capacity than standard buses; regional intercity coaches,
such as the Flatiron Flyer, built for longer trips at highway speed which are typically 45 feet long and
have a seated capacity of 55 passengers; and cutaways which are made by second stage
manufacturers, using the chassis of full size vans, and used to provide on-demand service for some
ADA passengers (Access-a-Ride) and in areas where ridership does not support fixed route service
(FlexRide).
RTD buses are procured from a variety of manufacturers including: Gillig, BYD, New Flyer, MCI,
Goshen, Eldorado, and Startrans. Approximately 50% of standard and articulated (fixed route) buses
are operated and maintained by RTD, with the operations and maintenance for the remainder
outsourced 5 to two external partner companies (First Transit and TransDev). All intercity coaches are
operated and maintained by RTD, and all cutaway buses are operated and maintained by third-parties
(Via Transportation, MV Transportation and Evergreen Senior Center).

Light rail vehicles (LRV) are electrically-powered using a 750-volt DC overhead catenary system.
Individual vehicles can be coupled together to form up to four cars per consist, with a seated capacity
of 64. LRVs can carry up to 236 passengers per car utilizing the standing room. All light rail vehicles
are manufactured by Siemens and are acquired, owned, operated and maintained exclusively by RTD.

Figure 10: Light Rail Vehicle (Siemens SD-160)

All commuter rail vehicles are delivered under the FasTracks program, and their ongoing operation
and maintenance is outsourced to a third-party, Denver Transit Operators (DTO). RTD owns the
commuter rail vehicles and will assume ownership at the end of the contracted period of
performance (30 years). Commuter rail vehicles are considered out-of-scope until such time as RTD
assumes capital responsibility for the operation and maintenance of these vehicles.

RTD has historically managed its revenue vehicle inventory based on age: the vehicles are procured,
maintained in a state of good repair for a specified number of years through a preventative
maintenance program, and then replaced. This approach is adopted for revenue vehicles maintained
by third-parties, including bus and commuter rail.
The table below presents the total number of revenue vehicles, along with their Useful Life
Benchmark (ULB), which is the expected duration in years that an asset will remain in service
according to RTD’s standards and the average condition based on its age. The condition range is from
1 to 5, where 1 indicates the vehicle is significantly beyond its useful life benchmark and 5 is
considered brand new. A vehicle that has reached the end of its useful life benchmark is scored at 2.5
and from that point onwards is considered in backlog.
Revenue vehicles can be kept operating reliably and safely beyond their useful life benchmark, but
costs start to increase at that point. The table provides backlog for each vehicle type. RTD uses the
FTA definition for revenue vehicle backlog, which is the percentage of revenue vehicles that have met
or exceeded their useful life benchmark (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2016).
RTD’s bus fleet has been a focus of renewals, however some transit buses are now considered to be
in backlog. Based on a combination of vehicle performance, condition, and cost of maintaining rather
than replacing vehicles, some transit buses will be operated in backlog and will be replaced at 18
years.

For the purposes of this TAMP, RTD has: 3 administrative facilities where RTD administrative
functions take place; 11 maintenance facilities where maintenance work takes place; 112 public
facilities which includes stations, buildings and other structures where riders can board or disembark
from an RTD transit vehicle; and 96 conveyances (elevators and escalators), installed within other
facilities but are treated here separately based on National Transit Database (NTD) reporting
requirements.
All administrative, maintenance and public facilities that are not used in the provision of contracted
services are owned, operated and maintained by RTD, although some services, such as cleaning and
snow removal at certain facilities, are contracted to third-parties. Conveyance manufacturers include
Kone and Thyssenkrupp and their maintenance is outsourced to third-parties.

Figure 17: Bus Maintenance Facility

RTD has historically managed its facilities (and their related equipment) on a reactive basis, i.e.,
maintain or replace the assets when they fail. The more critical facility elements, such as
underground storage tanks and boilers, have redundancy built in to minimize service interruptions
when they fail to perform as designed. RTD fully complies with all regulations relating to safety
inspections for certain facility assets (Regional Transportation District, 2016).
From 2015 onwards, RTD has performed in-house assessments to determine the condition score of
individual elements of each facility. As such, facility condition scores are assessment-based.

Figure 18: Light Rail Maintenance Facility

Figure 19: Public Facility

The condition score of each of the elements that exist at an Administration or Maintenance facility is
averaged to provide the condition score of the facility. Currently, each extant facility element is
weighted equally. The following table presents the elements of each facility that are assigned an
individual condition score. Not all facilities have all listed elements.

scores are linearly mapped to age, with brand new conveyances assigned a score of 5.0, conveyances
between 25-30 years old assigned a score of 2.5, and conveyances older than 37 years assigned a
score of 1.0.

Light rail infrastructure is purchased or constructed by a variety of manufacturers, and is exclusively
owned, operated and maintained by RTD. All commuter rail infrastructure is delivered under the
FasTracks program, and its ongoing operation and maintenance is outsourced to a third-party, Denver
Transit Operators. RTD owns the commuter rail infrastructure and will assume ownership at the end
of the contracted period of performance (30 years). Commuter rail infrastructure is considered outof-scope until such time as RTD assumes capital responsibility for the operation and maintenance of
the commuter rail infrastructure.
Seventy light rail vehicle bridges are owned and maintained by RTD.
RTD has historically managed light rail infrastructure assets based on age but performed condition
assessments of right-of-way light rail infrastructure for three years which better established the asset
types and inventory, determined condition scores for each type of asset and refined the anticipated
renewal frequencies for some assets. In doing so, RTD determined that age-based condition scores
provided similar levels of accuracy as assessment-based condition scores, and so has stopped
performing condition assessments. As such, light rail infrastructure condition scores are age-based
(Regional Transportation District, 2017).
Light rail vehicle bridges are inspected biannually by an independent third-party contractor per state
law. The inspection reports received by the inspection agency describe the condition of seven bridge
elements: abutments, caps, deck, girders/beams, head/wing walls, PPC (pillars, piers, columns) and
railings. The inspection report condition data is turned into an SGR score from 1 to 5 for each
element. All the element scores are averaged together to give an SGR score for the bridge (Regional
Transportation District, 2016). As such, condition scores for bridges are assessment-based.
The Table 8 below presents the total number of infrastructure assets, along with their ULB and agebased condition score.
The table also presents a backlog score for which RTD uses the FTA definition for infrastructure
backlog, which is the percentage of guideway directional route miles (DRM) with performance
restrictions by class. However, RTD anticipates that the guideway under performance restriction may
not be an adequate measure of condition for rail infrastructure assets in the future (U.S. Department
of Transportation, 2017).
There are many reasons why rail infrastructure assets would be under a temporary performance
restriction: routine maintenance, inspection personnel in the right of way, police activity at or near
crossings. These reasons give no indication of the condition of the assets. Additionally, track assets
that are in very poor condition but exist in a high-density urban environment may not have a
performance restriction because the design speed is so low to begin with. This case also fails to give
any indication of the condition of the assets. The age of these assets along with physical inspections
will likely be more useful for investment decisions.

3 Current Capital Investment Decision Process

The Capital Improvement Policy of RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement states that “On an annual basis, RTD
will prepare and update a six-year Mid Term Financial Plan including projected capital construction
and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating
programs” (Regional Transportation District, 2016).
The Mid Term Financial Plan also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit
funding through the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional
Council of Governments (DRCOG). The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region
that receive federal funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying Mid
Term Financial Plan projects are included in the TIP.
The 2020-2025 Mid Term Financial Plan includes projects funded from the base system’s 0.6% sales
and use taxes. Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2020-2025 are
presented separately in the FasTracks financial plan (Regional Transportation District, 2016).
The process used to prioritize investments for the 2020-2025 Mid Term Financial Plan is built upon a
legacy project prioritization process. The process is shown in Figure 25 below, and detailed in
Appendix C.
For some years, RTD has been improving the sophistication of its investment prioritization system.
RTD has moved from a process that was primarily the product of professional judgement to a more
standardized method of evaluating capital projects.
Significant effort has recently been placed into the development of an investment planning process.
The intent of this process is to align all investment with the Asset Management Policy, Agency
Objectives, and Strategic Asset Management Plan.
An important additional element of an investment planning process is an evaluation step. This step
will determine the degree to which projects came in at budget and on-time, as well as if they
delivered stated outcomes. Stated outcomes will be part of a required business case that describes
the intended effect of the capital project on the agency objectives. This will better allow RTD to
continuously improve its investment prioritization process.
One key step implemented toward the next generation process is classifying and prioritizing capital
projects based on three categories:
1. Compliance
2. Renewal
3. Expansion
Generally, capital projects will be funded in this order. The aim is asset-focused investments to
prioritize sustainable management of existing assets over expansion of the transit system. An
investment planning process will serve as one of RTD’s decision support tools.

5 Improving Asset Management Capabilities at RTD

As a relatively young agency, RTD has not experienced the decaying infrastructure or immediate
funding shortages that many older and larger transit systems have. Historically, RTD had the
necessary funding in place and the professional expertise to maintain its transit assets in a state of
good repair while keeping up with the growing demand for service.
RTD’s asset management maturity improvement initiative is not driven by a growing set of decaying
assets, but by the expansion of the asset base in recent years. Beginning with the T-REX project and
continuing with the current FasTracks project, over the past 15 years RTD has spent over $5.1 billion
on new rail and bus rapid transit lines, more than doubling its asset base.
The funding for the most recent expansion projects did not make provision for the long-term
maintenance and capital renewal of the new assets. Without a solid, long-term renewal plan in place,
with funding earmarked, the risk of a growing backlog of renewal projects without adequate funding
is too great. A growing backlog increases risk to safety, service, and future sustainability. It feeds a
pattern of expensive reactionary repair and remediation tasks.
RTD’s bold increase in the scope of its transit system requires a more rigorous management process
than in the past if it is to maximize value from the assets. To avoid the asset condition backlog that
plagues some agencies, RTD intends to take the path toward good whole-life asset management
while the assets are relatively new.
RTD is preparing an Asset Management Plan (AMP) that addresses future funding needs for existing
assets, prioritizing renewals over enhancements. The original cost of assets is less useful to the
Agency than projected future costs, therefore RTD’s efforts emphasize creating accurate and
increasingly precise estimates of what investments are needed over the coming budget planning
cycle.
The AMP is the combined output of individual Asset Class Strategies that focus on what will need to
be renewed, when it will need to be renewed, and the expected costs of renewals. The AMP will
populate the renewal bucket of the investment prioritization process. The projected funding needs
over the period 2020-2026 are illustrated in the graphs that follow.

Strategic Asset Management Plan

RTD aims to comply fully with MAP-21 requirements for transit asset management and beyond. It
has developed an overall Strategic Asset Management Plan to summarize its strategy to improve
asset management over the next period.
From 2004, with the publication of BSI PAS-55, and then ISO 55000 in 2014, organizations have been
able to exploit a standardized good practice framework for implementing an aligned Asset
Management System.
Typically, organizations have started with a focus on asset information: particularly the inventory of
all their assets, and assessing asset condition. This information supports clearer planning, because
now the organization knows what assets it has and what state they are in. But the aim is not just a
clear plan to cover all the assets, but a prioritized and optimized plan based on understanding the
risks to objectives, and using this to make the best use of limited resources.
RTD has invested heavily in both its asset inventory and asset condition measures over the past five
years, and started on its journey to an integrated planning process that will optimize its asset base.
The current strategy is to achieve certification to ISO 55000, and use this as the foundation to align
the management of its assets to the Agency purpose and objectives.

In 2017, RTD commissioned an external gap assessment comparing current practices to the ISO 55000
standard. The results of the gap assessment were used to create an Asset Management Roadmap for
the Agency to achieve certification to the ISO standard (AMCL, 2017). The Roadmap is included in
Appendix D.

Figure 32: Gap Assessment Results

Key Annual Activities

RTD identifies two types of asset management activity: those ongoing asset management activities
that RTD performs as part of ‘business as usual,’ and those activities specific to achieving ISO 55000
certification. TAM activities are the subset of these targeting the specific TAM elements, and these
are pulled out into a third section here.

Business As Usual Asset Management Activities
As an asset-intensive organization, RTD already performs a number of asset management activities on
a routine basis, and these will continue and improve through the plan horizon of this document.
This section summarizes those ‘business as usual’ activities, using The Institute of Asset
Management’s Conceptual Model for Asset Management to categorize into six main blocks (2015).
This should not be interpreted to imply these ongoing activities are all necessarily well aligned or
integrated at the moment.

Figure 34: The Institute of Asset Management (IAM) Conceptual Model for Asset Management

The RTD Planning Department periodically conducts demand analysis for its
transit service and uses this to support long-term strategic planning for system
optimization, expansion and enhancement. Strategic planning for capital
renewals and maintenance volumes is not currently formally performed, however RTD anticipates
enhancing its capabilities in this area through the development of Asset Class Strategies and an Asset
Management Plan (see next section for details). Although not yet a ‘business as usual’ activity, in
undertaking the development of this TAM Plan, RTD has started on Asset Management Planning.
RTD’s current approach to capital investment decision-making is described in
Section 3, and this activity is performed annually to develop RTD’s Mid Term
Financial Plan. Operations and maintenance decision-making is performed
within each asset owner group, but does not currently formally consider or align with agency
objectives.
Ongoing activities include capital project processes for asset acquisition,
which is split between Capital Programs for Commuter Rail (FasTracks) and
Facility assets, and Operations for Rail, Bus and Rail Infrastructure assets.
Compliance with appropriate technical standards and legislation is ensured within the capital projects
and operations/maintenance functions, with some basic configuration management principles

applied to in-house engineering designs. Maintenance delivery occurs for each major asset class and
includes preventive and corrective maintenance, along with condition assessments. Some asset
classes have a larger focus on preventative maintenance, while others have more emphasis on
corrective maintenance and maintain assets when they fail. Most maintenance delivery is performed
by RTD staff, with some being outsourced. Asset operations is a significant part of RTD’s ongoing
activities, and includes bus, rail, equipment and infrastructure operations, some of which is also
outsourced. Basic resource management principles are applied to ensure enough operational
resources are available as needed. RTD also performs shutdown and outage management of its
assets to enable maintenance access. As assets develop operating faults, RTD implements its fault
and incident response plans in accordance with agreed methods.
RTD uses several asset information systems to manage its Asset Information,
including Trapeze EAM for asset inventory and maintenance management,
and the Oracle Enterprise Business Suite for related financial information.
There are several basic data and information management processes in effect, including regular
reporting to the National Transit Database (NTD), and regular data quality assessment and cleansing
processes for Trapeze EAM information. RTD’s Asset Management Division employs a Data Science &
Analytics team to handle collection of non-physical data, perform data assurance tasks on corporate
data and perform all FTA TAM Reporting.
RTD applies some procurement and supply chain management principles for
its outsourced asset management functions. These include the capital
delivery of its FasTracks program, along with some ongoing operations and
maintenance of the assets the program delivers. The operation and
maintenance of approximately half of RTD’s bus services is outsourced among two service providers,
and the maintenance of certain facility assets, such as elevators is also outsourced.
RTD’s Financial group uses standard accounting practices to perform asset
costing and valuation, including their valuation and deprecation over time.
Some informal stakeholder management principles are applied for engaging
and managing key external stakeholders.

ISO 55000 Activities

In addition to the ongoing asset management activities described above, RTD also has activities
defined as part of its plan towards ISO 55000, or its Asset Management Roadmap.
The central requirement for ISO 55000 is to design, implement, maintain and continually improve an
Asset Management System based on Plan-Do-Check-Act principles. Once certification is achieved,
ongoing ISO 55000 activities will continue to occur indefinitely to maintain and continually improve
the AMS, while many of the ISO 55000 practices will transition to become ‘business as usual.’
The Roadmap and associated detailed activities are held in the ISO 55000 Gap Assessment and
Roadmap report, but a summary is provided below:

Resourcing Strategy

This section describes the resourcing strategy and plans to support the annual activities described
above.
Resources from across the Agency are involved in RTD’s Asset Management (AM) activities, including
the CEO/GM, the Senior Leadership Team, the Asset Management Division, Bus Operations, Rail
Operations, Capital Programs, Finance and Administration, Communications, Planning, and General
Counsel.

Business As Usual Asset Management activities

The resourcing strategy for the ‘business as usual’ annual Asset Management activities is to continue
with the current strategy, i.e. resourcing the activities through the Agency departments that currently
provide perform or are involved in them.

As ISO 55000 and TAM activities become ‘business as usual’ over time, it is anticipated that changes
to the current resources may arise.

ISO 55000 Strategy Activities

ISO 55000 requires the establishment of a functioning, effective, sufficiently-resourced management
system for assets. The resourcing strategy is to establish clear accountability and responsibility for
the Asset Management System, with the authority to direct and allocate resources being granted to
the accountable group. The diagram below illustrates the accountability structure and other
contributors.

Figure 35: ISO 55000 Contributing Resource Groups

In late 2011, RTD assigned two people the task of building an Asset Management Division (AMD). The
Division would be responsible for improving the management of assets and building an Agency-wide
Asset Management System.
It was important to the senior leadership team that to ensure the most accurate, non-biased
information possible, the AMD should be independent of the asset delivery functions.
As Chris Lloyd, asset management leadership and culture expert says, “Strategic Asset Management
calls for risk-based decision making, cross-functional working, and long-term thinking. It needs clarity
on competence requirements and accountability and honesty about performance” (Johnson & Lloyd,
2012).
The AMD was placed alongside the Safety Division, with both reporting to the Chief Safety Officer
(CSO). The nexus between asset condition and safety and their management system frameworks
made this a sensible structure.
To avoid creating an asset management silo, the AMD would be experts that would serve as an
enabling function to the Agency. From the passage of MAP-21 in 2012 through 2016 when the final
rule came out, the AMD added additional staff in two key areas: physical asset business analysis and
data science. These teams were recruited both internally and externally. Internal hires were proven

problem solvers from across the organization, with experience in maintenance in each of the asset
classes. This expertise and experience added credibility across the Agency. External candidates were
recruited where no internal candidate was available with the right blend of knowledge, skills, abilities,
drive, fit and balance. More details are in Appendix F.
The AMD will continue to attract and retain the best talent to deliver asset management expertise at
RTD. The AMD recruiting process emphasizes a culture of excellence. The Division continues to build
AM competencies through training and practical application.

TAM Activities

The resourcing strategy for the TAM activities is not only to define an Accountable Executive for all
TAM requirements but to assign TAM responsibilities to the Asset Management Division. Supporting
resources from other RTD departments will be utilized and consulted or informed on an as-needed
basis. Details of both the Accountable Executive and the Asset Management Division are in
Appendix F.

6 Evaluation Plan
6.1

TAM Plan Evaluation

The TAM Plan will be evaluated on degree of compliance when RTD receives its next triennial audit.
However, it is intended to do more than meet compliance. It is a statement of intentions and
commitment to deliver the culture, policy, and procedural changes necessary for the improved
efficacy and efficiency of transit agencies that is implied in the regulations.
This TAM Plan provides a baseline for evaluating future TAM Plans produced by the Agency. RTD
intends to regularly review its asset management maturity, setting maturity targets in its Strategic
Asset Management Plan. This document will also serve as a basis of comparison to peer agencies,
allowing RTD to learn from other TAM Plans to identify where improvements can be made.
RTD will annually evaluate its performance against the previous cycle’s TAM Plan improvement goals
and agency objectives with documentation and explanation of progress (Regional Transportation
District, 2019). The RTD agency objectives are in Appendix G.

6.2

ISO 55000 Performance Evaluation and Improvement

6.3

ISO 55000 Certification Evaluation

RTD has committed to achieving certification to the asset management standard ISO 55000. This
requires the implementation of a management system for assets, based on Plan-Do-Check-Act
principles with specific elements for performance evaluation and improvement. These are still in
development in RTD, but will be implemented within the plan horizon and described in a future
annual update.
RTD intends to evaluate the degree to which it is meeting the requirements for ISO 55000, and
therefore its readiness for an ISO 55001 certification audit, through the following measures:

3. ISO mock audit – prior to the ISO audit, RTD intends to conduct a ‘mock audit’ to evaluate its
readiness for an actual ISO audit. Results from the mock audit will be used to determine the
appropriate time for the actual audit, along with any gaps that still exist
4. ISO audit – formal assessment by an approved ISO auditor of RTD’s Asset Management
System against the requirements of ISO 55000
5. ISO surveillance audits – once certified, RTD is required to conduct periodic ‘surveillance
audits’ to retain its certification status

Appendix B: SGR Master Condition Rating Definitions for RTD
RTD follows the FTA guidance on condition ratings. This rating is based on how close an asset or
component is to replacement or major overhaul. Scores will not have a greater granularity than a half
point.
An asset is in a State of Good Repair if the score is greater than (2.5). Refer to individual asset group
Inspection Standards Documents for confidence in reliability and specific examples.

Confidence in Reliability = Remaining Useful Life

5.0) New or like new, 95% to 100% confidence in reliability; no visible defects, no damage,
cosmetically looks new. An asset is only new once, after rebuild some old parts are not new and
therefore the highest score after rebuild is (4.5).
4.5) The inspector is 90% to 95% confident in the reliability of the component / asset.
4.0) The inspector is 80% to 90% confident in the reliability of the component / asset. Shows
minimal signs of wear, no major defects, and some minor defects with only minimal signs of
deterioration.
Cosmetic defects/minor wear.
3.5) The inspector is 70% to 80% confident in the reliability of the component / asset.
3.0) The inspector is 60% to 70% confident in the reliability of the component / asset. Some
moderately defective or deteriorated components; expected maintenance needs. Cosmetically
‘fair’ but all devices are functioning as designed.

Small repairs or minor refurbishment.

2.5) The inspector is 50% to 60% confident in the reliability of the component / asset.
2.0) The inspector is 40% to 50% confident in the reliability of the component / asset. Asset
near overhaul or retirement, but in serviceable condition. Asset has increasing number of
defects or deteriorated component(s).

Significant or multiple repairs needed.

1.5) The inspector is 30% to 40% confident in the reliability of the component / asset.
1.0) The inspector is less than 30% confident in the reliability of the component / asset. Asset is
in need of major repair or refurbishment, multiple minor defects or major defects. Evidence of
corrosion may be apparent; major or numerous minor areas of damage or structural issues.
Safety concern, critical damage, close to or time for overhaul or replacement.
0) Not safe to use, multiple major repairs or asset set for disposal / retirement.

Appendix C: RTD Process for Mid Term Financial Plan
1. Annual call for projects.
2. Projects are submitted for consideration on an annual basis based on individual departmental
Decision Criteria.
a. Revenue Vehicle submits project requests based on ULB.
b. Non-Revenue Equipment submits project requests based on primarily age.
c. Rail Infrastructure submits projects requests based on the immediate need.
d. Facilities submits projects requests based on the immediate need.
e. Enabling departments submit project requests based on the immediate need.
3. Projects that have a considerable technology component are redirected to Information
Technology and their Technology Architecture Steering Committee (TASC) for a Risk
Assessment.
a. The TASC Risk Assessment is comprised of basic technology and operational risk
components.
4. Projects are approved by each department head.
5. Asset Management Division prioritizes by Request Type:
a. Compliance – The primary intent of a Compliance project request is to address
specific legal requirements or to mitigate RTD liabilities, approved by General
Counsel.
b. Renewal – The primary intent of a Renewal project request is to address existing
assets and systems. Backlog is also addressed in this request type.
c. Enhancement – The primary intent of an Enhancement project request is to expand
RTD’s ‘footprint’, enhance the value of the current service being provided, and/or
procure additional assets.
i. The aforementioned steps in the Mid Term Financial Plan Process were
underway when additional TAM requirements were released by the FTA. To
provide a process that would more closely align to future requirements of the
TAM, RTD added an additional step of classifying projects being evaluated for
investment according to their status as either Renewal or Enhancement. This
was done to provide information on future investment prioritization
requirements to the RTD’s Senior Leadership Team.
6. Initial list of projects are reviewed by the Budget & Financial Analysis Division.
7. Project requests are scored on established Scoring Criteria which includes items in RTD’s
mission statement and basic business unit benefits.
a. Mission Statement Criteria includes the following areas:
i. Accessible Service: Improve accessibility to bus and rail services for our
passengers by improving ADA on-time performance, improving ADA
availability or improving ADA courtesy.
ii. Clean Service: Improve the ability to provide clean bus and rail service and
clean public facilities by improving promptness of graffiti removal,
promptness of bus and rail interior and exterior cleaning and promptness of
shelter cleaning.
iii. Cost-Effective Service: Provide efficiencies in operations or support functions
which enable RTD to increase levels of bus and rail service by increasing

vi. Reliable Service: Increase the reliability of bus and rail service by improving
on-time performance, reducing road calls and reducing missed trips.
vii. Safe Service: Improve the physical safety of passengers and/or employees by
reducing vehicle and/or passenger accidents, improving preventable
maintenance.
b. Supplemental Information
i. To aid in informing project raters about the condition of an asset, a State of
Good Repair (SGR) Report including an assessment of an asset being
considered for renewal or replacement was included at the initiator’s
request.
8. Budget & Financial Analysis reviews the prioritized list of projects against current Funding
Requirements.
9. The prioritized list of projects are then evaluated by SLT who considers a number of
additional factors, including but not limited to the annual goals set by the RTD Board of
Directors, the projected available funding, grant and/or private funding availability for a
project, and strategic importance to regional objectives.
10. A recommended list is then submitted to the RTD Board of Directors for evaluation and
approval.
11. The RTD Board of Directors considers the prioritized list of projects as a component of the
annual budget. The budget is either approved or modified before being ratified by vote of
the 15 elected members of RTD’s Board of Directors.

Appendix E: TAM Resources
It is anticipated the following specific resources will be required for TAM activities for the duration of
the plan horizon:
•

•

•

Staff resources
o One accountable executive
o Seventeen FTEs from the Asset Management Division, who will split their time
between TAM and ISO 55000 implementation
o FTE requirements for other RTD resources necessary for TAM activities are not
defined in this generation of the TAM Plan
Technology resources: the technologies are used to support AM across the Agency. RTD’s
aim is to use the tools it already owns, rather than invest in new ones at this time.
o Hardware and Software necessary to support:
 Multiple source software systems – e.g. Trapeze EAM, Oracle EBS

Appendix F: Asset Management Roles & Responsibilities
1. Accountable Executive – a single position with ultimate accountability for Asset Management
and the Asset Management System within RTD.
2. Asset Management Accountability Team (AMAT) – this group has formal accountability
delegated from the Accountable Executive for the delivery, embedding, review and continual
improvement of the Asset Management System. The group is comprised of RTD’s Chief
Financial Officer, Chief Operations Officer, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs
and the Assistant General Manager for Asset Management, Security and Safety, and the
Senior Manager for Asset Management Division.
3. Asset Management Division – the AMD is responsible for the design, delivery, embedding,
review and continual improvement of the Asset Management System’s products, processes
and information, as well as preparing for and undertaking the ISO 55001 certification audit.
It is anticipated that the Asset Management Division will have the following roles and
responsibilities for ISO 55000 during the plan horizon:
The organization chart for the Asset Management Division is shown below.

The Asset Management Senior Manager reports to the Chief Safety Officer, which is the
Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management.
4. Other RTD resources – as needed, other RTD resources will be utilized, consulted or informed
regarding the Asset Management System. This could include operations, maintenance,
finance, human resources, communications, IT, legal and procurement staff. The Asset
Management Accountability Team will allocate these resources directly when within their
reporting line, or via a request to other members of the Senior Leadership Team when they
are not.
5. External resources – RTD will also utilize external expertise to develop the internal asset
management competencies of both the Asset Management Division and other RTD resources
involved with the Asset Management System. The alternative to this is to be continually
reliant on an external entity to supply expertise indefinitely. Selecting both an established
asset management framework and interactions with consultants, RTD intends to cultivate an
Asset Management Division capable of acting as an internal consulting service to the Agency.
The intention is to ‘own the process, not the product’ as it relates to functions and
competencies that will become annual activities for the AMD. Additional external resources
will also be utilized to deliver aspects of the Asset Management System, specifically the
operations and maintenance of approximately half of the bus fleet.

Appendix G: RTD Agency Objectives
The figure below is a representation of RTD’s purpose and objectives, adopted June 2019. RTD’s
purpose is to move people (Regional Transportation District, 2019). This purpose provides direction
for the Agency that activities can be aligned towards. The phrase that “a three-quarter full bus is
better than a one-quarter full bus, all else held equal” captures RTD’s intention of increasing the
effective and efficient utilization of assets in carrying out activities. This is a shift in how the Agency is
conceptualized, wherein previous efforts were focused on completion of the FasTracks expansion
effort and an emphasis on increasing available service hours and geographic coverage, rather than
utilization.
RTD’s efforts to improve the movement of
people are attained through improving its
ability to attract and retain customers by
enhancing Leading Indicators, and the
optimization of service within Constraints.
RTD has adopted both performance and
maturity targets for each of these concepts
and is in the process of managing to these
targets.

I POLICY
The first element of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan is Safety Policy. This is at its most
simple, the safety policy developed, approved and signed by the District. However, this element also
describes RTD’s commitment to safety, its objectives and safety goals and the organizational structure
established, and plans written to obtain these goals and objectives.
RTD is a multimodal agency comprised of bus, light rail, commuter rail, and special services.
RTD's mission is to meet its constituents’ present and future public transit needs by providing safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective service throughout the District. In accordance with the
directives of Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, (MAP-21) and Fixing America’s
Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, RTD undertook the conversion of the System Safety Program Plan
(SSPP) into the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) in 2018. The PTASP consists of a
series of policies and procedures, which must be undertaken to ensure the safety of its customers,
employees, emergency responders, and the general public. Development of the PTASP was completed in
accordance with Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Chapter 53, Colorado Public Utilities
Commission (PUC) State Safety Oversight (SSO) Program Procedures and Standards 49 CFR Part 674;
Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) and Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) rules and
regulations. The PTASP is the system-wide governing safety document for all transit modes operated by
RTD.
The RTD PTASP has adopted a Safety Management System (SMS) approach to administering safety
throughout the organization. SMS is flexible and scalable and consists of four elements as described in
the following table.
SMS Element
Safety Policy
Safety Risk Management
Safety Assurance
Safety Promotion

Description
Definition of safety policies, procedures and
organizational structure
Formal process for management of hazards to an
acceptable level of risk
Establishment of process measures, assessments
and controls to assess the effectiveness of risk
control strategies
Safety training and risk communication practices to
promote a culture of safety

Described throughout the PTASP are: RTD’s safety policies and procedures; safety risk management in
the form of RTD’s hazard management program; safety assurance mainly accomplished through RTD’s
internal safety review program; training and practices to support safety promotion.

Authority

1.B.2.b

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) is a special transportation district of the State of Colorado
and authorized under Colorado Revised Statutes Title 32, Article 9. As such, the District has its own
taxing power and operates within the counties of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver,
10
Packet Pg. 213

Douglas, and Jefferson. The District is managed by a fifteen-member elected Board of Directors who are
required, along with the RTD General Manager to develop and implement a comprehensive and
integrated Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan. To that end, the General Manager, by signature
authority of the District’s Safety Policy Statement, has authorized the RTD Chief Safety Officer,
Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management to develop and implement a Public
Transportation Agency Safety Plan as an operating document of the District for all modes of operations
including commuter rail, light rail, and bus/paratransit. RTD’s contractors, including RTD’s commuter
rail operator – Denver Transit Partners - are also governed under this Public Transportation Agency
Safety Plan as applicable, and is not intended to conflict with or supersede FRA regulations.
In April 2005, the U.S. Congress expanded the FTA regulatory role by granting authority to develop state
safety oversight programs, as defined by 49 CFR 659 - Final Rule, Rail Fixed Guideway Systems; State
Safety Oversight.
The FTA recognizes Colorado PUC, as the state safety oversight agency for RTD. PUC-SSO is FTA's
certified safety oversight agency, working cooperatively to regulate RTD's light rail transit, by ensuring
compliance with state and federal requirements, regulations, and guidance, as applicable.
The FTA functions as both an administrator of funds for capital projects and as a federal regulator as
defined by 49 CFR 674, 670 and 673. The FTA conducts regular reviews of the state safety oversight
agency (PUC- SSOA), to determine the SSO's and RTD's compliance to the FTA's general requirements.
RTD's light rail service is regulated by the FTA, and PUC SSO agencies.
RTD's commuter rail service is fully regulated by the FRA and is not regulated by the PUC- SSO
(excepting at-grade crossings), or the FTA.

Establishing and measuring our safety performance against realistic, data-driven safety
performance indicators and targets
Continually improving our safety performance through management processes that ensure
appropriate actions are taken and assuring effectiveness
Ensuring externally supplied systems and services meet RTD’s safety performance standards.

RTD utilizes a Safety Management System (SMS) to prevent accidents, to reduce risk of injury and
minimize damage to property and equipment. We will work proactively towards identifying and reducing
the existence of hazards and risks in the workplace and in our system.
As the Accountable Executive for all operations and activities I will ensure that resources are available to
ensure our SMS is robust and successful. RTD management will take steps to prevent workplace
incidents, injuries, and illnesses and will provide support of safety program initiatives. They will consider
employee suggestions for achieving a safer, healthier workplace; keep informed about workplace safety
and health hazards, and regularly review the company safety programs.
RTD managers and supervisors are responsible for supervising and training workers in safe work
practices. They are expected to reinforce safe work and behaviors and compliance with company safety
rules and work to eliminate hazardous conditions. Managers and Supervisors will lead safety efforts by
example.
All RTD employees are expected and encouraged to participate in safety activities including reporting
hazards, reporting unsafe work practices, near misses, and accidents immediately to their supervisor or a
safety committee/department representative. All employees will wear required personal protective
equipment (PPE) and participate in and support safety activities. Employees will serve as Safety
Ambassadors by working safely, complying with requirements and serving as an example to others.
Disciplinary action will not be taken against an employee who acts to prevent an injury or who reports
any accident, incident, concern or hazard. All employees are required to abide by the standards and
procedures set forth in the SMS policy and the Public Transit Agency Safety Plan (PTASP). Behaviors,
such as illegal activity, negligence, acts of willful misconduct, or undue care and attention shall be
considered outside the scope of this policy.
The SMS Program is managed under my authority by the Chief Safety and Security Officer who reports
directly to me. All levels of management and all employees are accountable for the delivery of the highest
level of safety performance, starting with the General Manager and CEO.

Goals and Objectives

The RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) establishes formal structure and
processes to be used by RTD to identify, assess, track, control, minimize, and resolve hazards
associated with RTD bus and rail systems. The PTASP will be used as a means of preventing
injuries, incidents, system disruption, accidents, environmental damage, and other losses. It
demonstrates RTD's commitment to safety and compliance through loss prevention programs.
The plan is consistent with federal, state, and local regulations, and it sets forth procedures to
comply with standards and conditions of industry, 49 CFR Part 674, PUC's SSO Program
Standards, and applicable FRA rules and regulations applicable to Commuter Rail as contained in
49 CFR.
The PTASP applies to the planning, design, procurement, construction, activation, operations,
and maintenance services of the bus and rail system. The PTASP is approved by the RTD Board
of Directors and General manager /CEO and implemented under the direction of the Chief Safety
Officer, the Senior Leadership team, and Executive Safety and Security Committee (ESSC). RTD
embraces and participates with the Colorado Department of Transportation in achieving the state
wide goal of “Zero Fatalities” program. “This is a goal that everyone can live with”.
RTD's annual objectives for 2020 are:
• Zero fatalities in RTD operating systems; Bus, Light Rail and Commuter Rail
• Preventable accident rate per 100,000 miles:
o Bus less than 1.0
o Light Rail less than 1.0
• 10% reduction in Bus preventable accidents
• 10% reduction in Light Rail preventable accidents
• 10% reduction in Commuter Rail accidents
• 25% reduction of lost time employee injuries
• 15% reduction of OJIs
o 25% reduction of Slip and Fall injuries
o 25% reduction of injuries from strains
• Measure and hold to current levels of performance for system reliability without decline
in reliability or increases in costs as described in the current Transit Asset Management
Plan (TAMP).
The overall consideration in the development of the RTD PTASP is to provide safe and reliable
movement of passengers throughout the transit system. The passengers and the general public
must be confident that the RTD transit system is a safe system. To achieve this, it is necessary to
design, construct and maintain a system that is free from recognized hazards with the safety of
employees, passengers, and the general public in mind. RTD’s objectives will be met by drawing
information from system observation, local and state codes, federal guidelines, and specific RTD
requirements into a unified document to ensure a safe transportation system.

Goals

The goal of RTD's PTASP is to utilize and achieve the highest practical level of safety in order to
protect passengers, employees, emergency responders, contractors, invitees, and property. At a
minimum, the PTASP ensures the following processes are incorporated into RTD's system safety
programs, plans, processes, and practices to achieve its goals to:
• Define the physical, functional, and operational characteristics of its transit system with
its potential impact to people, equipment, infrastructure, facilities, and its operating
environment.
• Identify hazards or undesired events by examining historical data, causes, and
contributing factors.
• Provide a level of safety that is consistent with transit bus and rail standards.
• Assess risks by balancing the potential frequency of a hazard occurring against the
severity of the event and quantify the event into acceptable or unacceptable categories.
• Eliminate, mitigate, or control unacceptable or undesirable hazards to acceptable levels.
• Determine if RTD's goals and objectives were achieved.
• Monitor hazard resolution effectiveness and determine if there are unexpected hazards.
• Comply with federal, state, and local rules and regulations.
• Continually improve and evaluate the Safety Management System and the processes that
support the SMS.
• Ensure that all customers perceive the system is safe and secure by maintaining a high
level of safety comparable to other transit systems as measured by maintaining a good
safety record, and by maintaining the visual aspects of the system in good repair
The Chief Safety and Security Officer is responsible for the development of goals for the PTASP.
The Chief Safety and Security Officer is responsible to report directly to the Accountable
Executive/CEO/GM and the ESSC on compliance with the PTASP. The PTASP's intent is to:

I 2.3

Integrating Safety into all Aspects of RTD

The objective of safety at RTD is the continual improvement of our processes and operations to
maximize safety to the highest practicable level. This effort is undertaken by providing continual
opportunities for employees to be reminded of safety, incorporate safe practices into their
operations, and multiple means for each employee to identify potential hazards.
We accomplish this through Safety Moments at RTD meetings, Safety committee meetings,
weekly Safety messages, safety poster campaigns, identification and mitigation of hazards,
proactive reviews and inspections to identify potential hazards.
Within the different departments, multiple means of incorporating safety are presented. As
examples:
• Safety is part of the Planning Departments planning meetings to plan for safety in new
projects at the earliest opportunity.

I 3.1

RTD Board of Directors and Executive Staff

RTD was created in 1969, by the 47th Colorado General Assembly for the purpose of providing a
public mass transportation system for RTD communities and began operation in 1972. A 15member elected board of directors, which is the legislative body for RTD and determines all
questions of overall governance policy for RTD. RTD's board of directors appoints the General
Manager and chief executive officer (GM/CEO), who is ultimately responsible for safety.
The CEO has full charge of the acquisition, construction, maintenance, and operations of the
system and facilities of RTD, and of the administration of RTD business affairs. The CEO
supervises executive staff of chief department officers and Assistant General Managers. Included
in these officers, the chief operations officer is responsible for bus and rail transit operations. The
chief safety and security officer has the responsibility for corporate safety. The safety department
reports monthly to the GM/CEO and executive staff during meetings of the Executive Safety and
Security Committee (ESSC)
The Executive Safety and Security Committee is the safety and security authority for the District
and has the following authority and responsibilities: to set and implement policies; to review and
approve rules and procedures; to assure the District’s safety and security goals and objectives are
achieved; approve and assure implementation of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan
(PTASP); and to review and advise on reports from RTD’s Asset Management and State of Good
Repair division. As such, the Committee recommends action for safety and security policy
development, reviews and approves policies, and has final decision-making authority regarding
safety and security issues. The Committee also serves as the District’s authority on management
of change/configuration management and safety and security certification processes. The
following policies will assure that safety goals and objectives are achieved.

Management—Key Role in Safety Overview

RTD's safety management systems will be incorporated into every aspect of transit services, by
rail and bus service managers. Safe operations of bus and rail units are the responsibility of the
Assistant General Managers (AGM). Each operating division has an appointed AGM, who along
with managers and supervisors are responsible for implementing policies and procedures for safe
operations. The assistant general managers of the rail and bus units have charged their
management teams to effectively manage safety, and to develop safety programs, plans,
procedures, training, policies, and rules to govern safety; and to fully comply with the PTASP.
Bus and rail maintenance facilities are staffed with a manager of maintenance responsible for the
safe operation of the facility and are supported by shift supervisors and maintenance workers
during their performing maintenance, servicing, and inspection. It is RTD’s policy to comply
with OSHA and FRA regulations. RTD develops policies and procedures for occupational safety
and health in compliance with OSHA and applicable FRA regulations.
Supervisors' responsibilities place them at the forefront of RTD's rail and bus services safety
efforts. A significant portion of their duty is to serve as frontline safety specialists; monitoring,
ensuring, and emphasizing safety performance, rules compliance, and promoting a strong safety
climate. All employees are charged with adhering to safety, but supervisors are RTD's key to
improved safety-related behavior, and positive safety outcomes. Supervisors have the

RTD safety and health are managed at the lowest levels. Each employee is trained in safety, job
duties, and given responsibility for their own safety and the safety with whom he/she works. All
employees have the authority to halt an operation if it is deemed to be unsafe. RTD's system
safety processes emphasize open and fair dialog between leaders and subordinates to increase the
commitment to safety at all levels.
In an oversight role, transit safety specialists report to the Manager of Safety, who reports to the
Senior Manager, Safety and Environmental, who reports to the chief safety officer. Transit safety
specialists have a role in executing the functions necessary to ensure safety, to include the
following:
• Coordinate safety activities of the agency
• Compile safety data and perform analysis to identify and assess operational risk
• Assist in the investigation of accidents and incidents as appropriate
• Evaluate hazard resolutions proposed by departments
• Perform analysis to identify and resolve hazards
• Evaluate proposed system modifications from a safety perspective
• Conduct safety reviews and inspections
• Provide safety support such as field and laboratory testing
• Regulatory Reporting, including creation and submittal of PUC required Corrective
Action Plans and updates
The Safety Department will conduct regularly scheduled internal safety reviews to evaluate
compliance and conformance with RTD's PTASP, PUC-SSO Program Standards 49 CFR Part
674; and 49 CFR 673. Transit safety specialists serve as alternates to each other. Transit safety
specialists work closely with management and employees, through various processes and
committees, and have authority to determine compliance. When warranted, transit safety
specialists may issue corrective action plans (CAP), and ensure appropriate departments
implement those plans. Transit safety specialists are the designated contacts to regulatory
agencies and serve as alternate contacts to the PUC-SSO oversight agency.

Climate / Geography

The Denver Metro region normally has a semi-arid continental climate with four well-defined
seasons. Summers are characterized by hot, dry weather, but the high temperatures are usually not
oppressive since the relative humidity is generally low and the nights usually cool. August is the
hottest month with temperatures reading 90– 100 degrees F. Winters are cold, but usually not
severe. The average annual snowfall is less than 65 inches at the Denver airport but much higher
amounts fall in foothill locations. Precipitation is generally light during the summer and early fall
but may be heavy in the spring when storms from the Pacific Ocean are moving through the area
more frequently than at any other season of the year.
The RTD transit services extend throughout the Front Range Area approximately 60 miles wide
(East-West) between Pine Junction, Denver, and Denver International Airport. The area also
ranges from Longmont on the north to Lone Tree on the South, a distance of 70 miles. Service
areas include the foothills situated along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. Elevations
range from approximately 4,850 feet above sea level to greater than 9000 feet above sea level in
the foothills.

I 5 TRANSIT SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
I 5.1

Light Rail System Description

The RTD light rail system was designed as the first piece of a planned regional rapid transit
system. In 1989, the Colorado Supreme Court declared that the Denver metro area Regional
Transportation District was eligible to collect a Use Tax that enabled the District to accumulate
funding of $67 million for construction of a rail system.
The project was approved by DRCOG (Denver Regional Council of Governments) in 1991 and
construction on the initial 5.3-mile rail system and a functional operations facility began without
Federal funding or an increase in local taxes in October of 1992.
Safety Certification and Construction of the light rail system was completed by the end of
September 1994 and the system opened for revenue service with eleven light rail vehicles on
October 7, 1994. Additional lines, facilities and vehicles were added in subsequent years with
voter support. This will be detailed below.

I 5.1.1 Scope and Service
Regular service of the light rail system is regulated by timetables and varies between peak (AM
and PM commuter times) and off-peak hours, weekends and weekdays, and special events, such
as conventions, sports, and parades. Light rail transit carries over 80,000 riders daily. Trains
operate as one, two, three, or four-car consists. Revenue service is generally available 21 hours
per day.
The Regional Transportation District’s objective is to operate the Light Rail Transit System
safely, reliably and efficiently and to integrate the light rail’s operation with bus service for the
greatest convenience to the public. This is the means by which the integration of transportation
services could assist the region in meeting clean air standards, alleviating traffic congestion, and
improving the overall quality of life of the area.
Light rail service operates on the existing 5.3 mile Central Corridor, the 8.7 mile Southwest
Corridor the 1.8 mile Central Platte Valley Spur, the 19 mile Southeast Corridor, and the 12.1
mile West Rail Corridor, the 10.5 mile I-225 Corridor, and the 1.6 mile Southeast Rail Extension
(SERE). The system has eight operating lines: C, D, E, F, H, L, W and R.

I 5.1.2 Organizational Structure
The Light Rail Transit safety specialist’s office is located at the Elati Light Rail Operations and
Maintenance center. Thus, the lines of communication between Safety and Light Rail Operations
are effective. Key positions with Light Rail Operations are:
• Assistant General Manager, Rail

All these key positions have access to the Light Rail Transit safety specialist.

I 5.1.3 Light Rail Corridors
Central Corridor
Passenger service on the Central Corridor Light Rail system began October 7, 1994. The system
is operated by Denver’s Regional Transportation District as part of a fully integrated mass transit
system which includes local bus routes, express bus routes, regional bus routes, shuttle bus routes,
and demand-response service for disabled customers.
The Central Corridor is comprised of 5.3 miles of trackway with 13 stations including three parkn-ride locations. The Central Corridor operates at grade level except for one fly-over structure
for grade separation at Kalamath and Santa Fe. An initial fleet of eleven light rail vehicles
(LRVs) were procured for the operation of the Central Corridor. Shortly after opening for
service, six additional LRVs were ordered.
The Central Corridor begins at I-25 and Broadway on the southwest end and terminates at 30th
Avenue and Downing Street. The corridor provides direct connections between the I-25 and
Broadway Station transfer facility, Broadway Marketplace, Auraria Campus, Colorado
Convention Center, and the 16th Street Mall (Market Street, Civic Center and Union Station
transit stations), Five Points, and many major hotels and businesses in between.
Major attractions within a short walking distance of the Central Corridor stations or the 16th
Street Mall shuttles include; the Denver Center for the Performing Arts Complex, Federal
Courthouse, 17th Street Financial District, U.S. Mint, Tabor Center, State Capitol, Denver Art
Museum, Denver Public Library, Colorado History Museum, Larimer Square, and Coors Field.
Light rail vehicles are operated manually. Automatic block wayside signals, traffic signals, radio
communication, operational procedures and train orders govern operators regarding all
movements of the vehicles. Appropriate street traffic signals, speed limit signage and wayside
signals assist the operator in selecting proper movement sequence and speeds. City operations are
by line of sight. All city street crossings are governed by coordinating adjacent street intersection
traffic signals while the at-grade crossings at 13th Avenue and at Bayaud are governed by gates
with flashers and warning bells. The crossings at 13th Avenue and at Bayaud are jointly used and
maintained by the Union Pacific Railroad and RTD.

Station platforms are unattended and utilize Automated Fare Equipment for ticket sales and ticket
validation. Transit Security Officers (TSO) monitor the proof of payment honor system. Roving
Rail Supervisors, contracted security officers and local police departments provide platform
security.
A 2.5-acre yard and the Light Rail Mariposa Facility is located adjacent to the Southern Pacific
Railroad switching yard near 6th Avenue at 655 Mariposa Street. Powered switches on the
double track mainline provide access to and from yard leads at either end of the storage yard,
allowing access from ladder tracks into the shop. The Light Rail Mariposa Facility includes a
yard for vehicle storage and a maintenance facility for vehicle maintenance and system support
maintenance. Central Control is located on the second floor of the facility and is the operational
governing authority for all mainline vehicle movement. Central Control personnel
(Controller/Supervisors) direct, control and monitor revenue-service operations using radio,
telephone, and public address communications. Mainline operations are controlled by a schedule
timetable and directed by Central Control in accordance with established operating schedules,
rules and procedures. Controllers implement all corrective actions necessary to maintain service
schedules and to minimize adverse impacts of equipment failures, emergency situations, or
weather-related problems. In addition, some unit repair, facility maintenance and non- revenue
maintenance occurs at RTD’s District Shops.
The corridor begins on the south end with the I-25 and Broadway station. Broadway stations
provides a major bus/light rail transfer point and is a junction for the Southwest, Southeast and
Central corridors. From Broadway proceeding north a short distance is Alameda station. After
leaving Alameda station, trains pass through Bayaud crossing and then ascend the Santa
Fe/Kalamath flyover structure, returning to grade the alignment passes the Mariposa facility
before entering Osage Station. From Osage trains pass through 13th Avenue crossing and then
either take the track to downtown (Central Corridor) or the track to the CPV corridor. Continuing
northeast on the Central corridor is the Colfax at Auraria passenger station. Continuing northeast
on the Central Corridor is the Colfax at Auraria passenger station. It is near the Auraria Campus
allows direct access to the campus via a plaza as well as a bus transfer point. After leaving the
Colfax at Auraria station, the double track alignment proceeds across Kalamath Street and Speer
Boulevard, crossing a bridge structure over Cherry Creek along Stout Street to the Convention
Center Station near 14th Street and Stout. At 14th Street, the inbound track turns east and then
north to travel along California Street. The outbound track runs along Stout Street between 14th
and 19th Streets. There are two passenger stations located on Stout, one at 16th and one at 18th
Streets. The inbound track along California travels in an automobile traffic contra-flow direction
from 14th to 19th Street servicing the 16th Street and California passenger station located on the
bus mall then continuing on the single track northeast bound to the next passenger station at
18th Street on California.
The alignment turns southeast on 19th where it joins the track to Welton and where the double
track now travels east on Welton Street to the 20th Street passenger station located between 19th
and 20th on Welton. The double track alignment continues as it crosses over to the south side of
Welton near 20th Street to 24th Street. Between 24th and 25th the double track configuration
transitions into single track. The single-track alignment is retained as it continues northeasterly on
Welton and next proceeds into the 25th Street passenger station located at the nearside of 26th
Street. Still traveling northeasterly along the alignment, the trackway approaches the 27th Street
mini station located between 27th and 28th Streets, the alignment then transitions back into a
double track configuration as it enters the 30th Avenue/Downing northern terminus station.

The Southwest Corridor opened for revenue service in July 2000. It is an 8.7 mile extension of
the Central Corridor light rail system from I-25 and Broadway in Denver to the end of line station
at Mineral Avenue and Santa Fe Drive in Littleton. There are five light rail stations at the
following locations: Evans Avenue Station; Englewood Station near Hampden Avenue; Oxford
Avenue Station; Littleton Station (downtown Littleton); and Mineral Avenue Station. Each
station location has an associated Park-n-Ride with the exception of the Oxford Station.
The Southwest Corridor is a double track alignment operating in high-speed territory at a
maximum speed of 55mph. The corridor consists of mixed-use operations including three freight
railroad mainline tracks, two light rail tracks, and Santa Fe Drive on the west side of the corridor.
The entire corridor is grade-separated with the exception of a pedestrian-freight spur crossing at
the Evans Avenue Station. Traditional active grade crossing equipment and signals including
warning bells, lights, and gates control this crossing. The light rail tracks parallel the freight
mainline tracks throughout the corridor. To enhance patron use, the light rail corridor resides on
the east side of the freight rail corridor from I-25 and Broadway to Tufts Avenue, and on the west
side of the freight corridor from Tufts Avenue to Mineral Avenue. Two flyover structures
accommodate grade separation between freight railroad and light rail tracks; one near Tufts
Avenue where the east/west transition occurs, and one near Iowa where the light rail tracks cross
the Iowa freight spur track.
Leaving the I-25 and Broadway station southbound (outbound) the tracks cross over Mississippi
Ave on a bridge and continue south to cross over Iowa Ave on another bridge. Shortly after
crossing Iowa Ave the alignment rises on the Iowa flyover structure to pass over a freight rail
spur track coming from the mainline on the west side of the light rail tracks. Once the trackway
returns to grade the tracks pass under Evans Ave and enter the Evans Station. Continuing south
from Evans station the mainline right of way passes the Elati Operations Facility and yard before
crossing a bridge over Dartmouth Ave and into Englewood Station. Trains leave Englewood
Station southbound and cross the bridge over Hampden Ave and continue to Oxford Station.
From Oxford Station south the alignment passes over Oxford Ave and then climbs the Tufts
flyover structure that transitions light rail from the east side of the freight track mainline to the
west side. Descending off the flyover the alignment passes over Belleview Ave on a bridge before
entering a below grade cut and the Littleton Downtown Station. Continuing south from the station
the track climbs from the cut to grade and continues to the end of line Mineral Station.
An additional fourteen light rail vehicles were added to the existing fleet to accommodate the
extension. The light rail vehicles are Siemens Duewag SD100 and SD160 models, the same used
for the Central Corridor. The Mariposa maintenance facility was expanded to accommodate the
fleet size increase. All operational characteristics for the Southwest Corridor are similar to the
existing operational characteristics of the Central Corridor. Since service origination of the
Southwest Corridor, eighteen additional SD 100s have been placed into revenue service.

Central Platte Valley Spur

Attachment: 2021 RTD PTASP Final (4334 : Approval of 2021 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

Southwest Corridor

The Central Platte Valley (CPV) Spur is approximately 1.8 miles in length, linking the existing
Central Corridor light rail line at Colfax Avenue to the Denver Union Station. This is a doubletrack alignment along the entire corridor including the CPV junction.
35
Packet Pg. 238

The CPV Spur begins at approximately Colfax Avenue and Rio Court (at the location where the
existing Central Corridor light rail lines curves to the east under the Colfax Avenue viaduct). The
alignment generally follows Curtis Street from Colfax Avenue to west of 5th Street, on the
western edge of the Auraria Campus. At this point, the alignment turns north and parallels 5th
Street and enters Auraria West Station. From there, the alignment crosses Walnut Street and
enters Empower Field at Mile High Station. From there the alignment parallels the Consolidated
Mainline (freight), to the Pepsi Center/Elitch Gardens Station, then continues North and ends at
the Denver Union Station. Stations are located at the new Administration Building of the Auraria
Campus (Auraria West); near the existing "Sports Walk" that serves Empower Field at Mile High
Station near the Stadium; at the pedestrian bridge serving the Pepsi Center and Elitch Gardens;
and Denver Union Station.
The alignment has two at-grade crossings: 5th Street and Walnut Street, which include active
warning devices for control and safety considerations to mitigate impacts to traffic and
pedestrians in these areas.
During major events, such as professional sports games and concerts at the Pepsi Center, Coors
Field and Empower Field at Mile High Stadium special service will be provided with trains
running as frequently as every four to five minutes between the event venue and the Southwest
and Southeast Corridors. Some of these special events trains may terminate at the I- 25/Broadway
station while other will continue to the Mineral Avenue and Ridgegate end-of-line stations.

Southeast Corridor
The Southeast Corridor began revenue service in November 2006. The Southeast Corridor
consists of 21miles of double-tracked light rail transit, beginning at the existing Broadway station
and ending at Ridgegate Station. This includes an alignment along I-225 in the median, from I-25
to Nine Mile Station at Parker Road. There are 16 stations: Louisiana; University; Colorado;
Yale; Southmoor; Belleview; Orchard; Arapahoe; Dry Creek; County Line; Lincoln; Skyridge;
Lone Tree Transit Center; Ridgegate Parkway; Dayton; and Nine Mile. All facilities, including
RTD trains, stations, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and other design elements, are in full
compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
With the Southeast Corridor expansion, the Elati Light Rail Operations facility and yard were
constructed at 2701 S. Elati St. This was a necessity to accommodate the more than doubling of
light rail vehicles and associated support needs that accompanied the system expansion. North
and south yard leads were cut into the existing Southwest corridor mainline track just north of
Dartmouth on the south and a short distance south of Evans station on the north. In January of
2006 the Elati facility became the new operations center and the Mariposa facility became a
heavy maintenance and repair shop, while still maintaining the Control Center on the second
floor.
In May 2019 the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) was opened for revenue service. This
extended double track rail service from the old Lincoln End of Line 1.6 miles to the new end of
line Ridgegate Station. Two other stations, SkyRidge and Lone Tree City Center are located on
the extension.

Broadway Rail Station. This connection allows LRT vehicles from the Southeast Corridor to
access both the Southwest Corridor and existing LRT line to central downtown. Following the
wye tracks, the LRT alignment rises above grade to pass over Broadway on an aerial structure.
After crossing Broadway, the alignment turns to the south along the southbound I-25 on ramp and
drops down to match the grade of I-25 and into Louisiana station. This allows the LRT alignment
to pass under the cross streets maintaining a 17-foot vertical clearance above the top of rail.
Through the Narrows (Broadway to University) the LRT alignment parallels I-25 between I-25's
collector distributor road and Buchtel Boulevard. The tracks generally pass behind the abutment
of the highway bridges through a separate LRT bridge structure and enter University station.
At the University interchange, the LRT alignment moves away from I-25 and runs along the
outside edge of the University off-ramp and rises up to pass over University on the aerial
structure. After crossing University, the LRT alignment continues along the outside edge of the
University on-ramp, returning to an alignment adjacent to the I-25 shoulder and at the same grade
as the highway.
Colorado to Evans
At Colorado, the LRT alignment follows the Colorado Boulevard off-ramp and travels under
Colorado Boulevard in a short tunnel section. After passing under Colorado, the LRT alignment
remains below grade, in an open trench section and enters Colorado station and again parallels I25. After leaving the station it passes under Evans in a tunnel section.
Evans to Union
After passing under Evans, the LRT alignment rises to return to the highway grade running
adjacent to the highway into Yale station. At Yale Avenue, the LRT alignment runs along the
edge of the Yale ramps and passes over Yale on an aerial structure.
South of Yale, the LRT alignment follows along the west side of I-25, to Hampden Avenue. At
Hampden, the LRT alignment enters a very short tunnel section under Hampden and then returns
to the I-25 grade on the south side of Hampden and enters Southmoor station.
Continuing south the alignment passes under Quincy and then travels along the western edge of
the I-25/I- 225 freeway interchange. Special track-work at this location allows for a wye
connection to the LRT alignment located along I-225. These connecting tracks are primarily atgrade and pass below the I-25/I-225 interchange.
Union to Arapahoe Road
Proceeding south from the I-225 wye connection, the LRT alignment passes under Union Avenue
along the west edge of I-25. After passing under Union Avenue, the LRT alignment continues
south into Belleview station. After leaving the station it travels along the ramps and over
Belleview on an aerial structure. Continuing south from Belleview, the LRT alignment runs
adjacent to I-25 to Orchard station where it again shifts out along the ramps and then over

Creek on an aerial structure. After passing Dry Creek, the LRT alignment returns to the I-25
shoulder to County Line Road where it rises up to pass over two ramps and County Line Road on
an aerial structure. After passing County Line Road and the ramp in the southwest quadrant of the
interchange, the LRT alignment runs along the west edge of I-25 into County Line station. South
of the station the alignment enters the C-470/E470 interchange.
Through the C-470/E470 interchange, the LRT travels under the ramps in short tunnels and over
C470, around the western side of the interchange ramps and then adjacent to I- 25, where it
continues south into Lincoln station. After leaving Lincoln station the alignment continues south
and passes over Lincoln Ave on an aerial structure and then turns east into SkyRidge station. At
the south end of SkyRidge station is the lone at grade crossing on the Southeast Corridor,
Trainstation Circle crossing. The alignment then crosses over I-25 on an aerial structure and turns
south into Lone Tree City Center station. From the station it continues over Ridgegate Parkway
on an aerial structure and into end of line station Ridgegate.
I-225 from I-25 to Parker Road
The LRT alignment along I-225 begins at the I-25/I-225 interchange, where it connects to the I25 alignment through a wye connection, allowing LRT vehicles to connect to both the
northbound and southbound lines on the I-25 LRT alignment. After the wye connection, the LRT
alignment travels in the I-225 median at the highway grade. The LRT alignment continues in the
I-225 median into Dayton station. From Dayton station the alignment continues east into Nine
Mile station at Parker Road.
The Corridor operates with similar characteristics as existing corridors including traction power
substations and signal systems. A SCADA system is included in the Southeast Corridor project
and is retrofitted into the existing system. Additionally, an automatic trip stop system was added
to stop trains if they bypass a red signal.

West Corridor
The West Rail Line is a 12.1-mile light rail transit corridor that began revenue service in April
2013 extending from Denver Union Station (DUS) to the Jefferson County Government Center.

I-225 Rail Corridor
39
Packet Pg. 242

The I-225 project added 10.5-miles to the Light Rail System within the city of Aurora that
provides key regional connections to the East and southeast rail lines. It was part of FasTracks,
RTD’s voter-approved plan passed in November 2004 to expand transit service across the Denver
metro region. Construction on the full line began in 2013. This light rail line opened for service to
the public featuring eight stations, Florida, Iliff, Aurora Metro Center, 2nd, and Abilene, 13th
Avenue, Colfax, Fitzsimmons, and Peoria, as the R line in February 2017. This corridor extends
Light Rail service North from Nine Mile Station to the Peoria station where customers can
connect to the Commuter Line to Denver International Airport.

I 5.1.4 Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
The RTD Light Rail System includes a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system. The SCADA system provides two types of general functions: control over certain system
elements from the Central Control center; and system monitoring and status information to the
Central Control Center. The SCADA system allows light rail controllers certain capabilities such
as remote control to power down sections of the alignment and control over power track switches.
It also provides information to the light rail controllers on the status of certain elements of the
light rail system and train information. SCADA information includes train locations, switch
alignments, power status, signal status and a variety of additional system information.

I 5.1.5 Light Rail Vehicles
The RTD light rail vehicle fleet consists of two models from Siemens: the SD 100 and the SD
160. The vehicles are very similar and have two main differences. The SD 160 has an AC
propulsion system and sliding plug doors where the SD 100 has a DC propulsion system and bifold doors. An initial fleet of eleven light rail vehicles (LRVs) was procured for the operation of
the Central Corridor. Shortly after opening for service, six additional LRVs were ordered. As
ridership grew so did the system beyond the Central Corridor and triggered orders of new LRVs.
The SD 100 model is the original RTD vehicle and there are 49 of these vehicles in the fleet. The
SD 160 was originally ordered for the Southeast Corridor extension: 68 were delivered with an
additional 55 vehicles ordered for FasTracks, the first of which arrived in August 2009. An
additional 29 SD 160 vehicles were ordered in July 2018.RTD now has a total fleet of 201
vehicles. The LRVs are 6-axle, single articulated, double ended, bi-directional, high floor
vehicles. They are 6-axle, single articulated, double ended, bi-directional, high floor vehicles.
They are approximately 80 feet in length, 8 feet and 9 inches in width, 13 feet high and operate
on a standard railroad track gauge of 4 feet and 8 ½ inches. They are powered from an overhead
wire by 750 volts direct current and capable of speeds up to 55 MPH. Each vehicle can seat 48 to
56 passengers and will accommodate up to an additional 61 standing passengers at normal loads.
Additional standees may be accommodated at a crush load capacity. Exhibits shows the vehicle
layout and critical exterior measurements to maximize the level of comfort with which the
passenger is afforded for their trip. In addition, the LRV is equipped with HVAC and good
lighting configuration.

I 5.1.6 Operations
The Operations Control Center, which underwent a major remodel to accommodate the system
expansion and SCADA, governs the operation, control, and dispatch of light rail vehicles. Control
maintains contact with the train operators by means of a radio located in each light rail vehicle
cab. Light rail operators also carry a portable radio to be used in case they have to leave the cab

or radio failure. Controller/Supervisors rove throughout the system during operations. Their role
is to provide support and coordination between Central Control and light rail vehicle operators
during an emergency or upset in the system that may require a manual block operation, bus
bridge, evacuation, or accident response and investigation.
Current operations consist of eight lines, the C, D, E, F, H, L, W and R. The C line serves from
Mineral Avenue to Denver Union Station. The D line serves from Mineral Avenue to 18th and
California. The E line serves from Ridgegate to Denver Union Station. The F line serves from
Ridgegate to 18th and California. The H line serves from Florida to 18th and California. The L
line is a downtown loop between 14th and Stout and 30th and Downing. The W line serves from
Jeffco Government Center to Denver Union Station. The R Line, which opened February 2017,
serves from Ridgegate to Peoria Station. Typical headways vary from 5 to 15 minutes during
peak operations with increased service operated for certain special events. Early morning or late
night headways on weekends and holidays are typically 30 minutes.
In the case of an accident or breakdown of the system, the Control Center controls train
movement using a manual block system. When necessary, buses are used in a “bridging”
procedure to move passengers around a trouble area.

I 5.3

BUS OPERATIONS SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

The Regional Transportation District was created by an act of the Colorado General Assembly in
1969 and became an operating unit on July 1 of that year. The purpose of creating this agency
was to provide a regional approach to public transportation.
On January 1, 1974, RTD began collecting the half percent sales tax and became fully
operational. RTD initially inherited 321 buses from Denver Metro Transit.
Many of these vehicles were over 20 years old. Total bus mileage was nine million miles per
year, with fewer than 20 million riders annually.
Only one maintenance and storage facility existed for buses. There was little or no maintenance
capacity for buses in the small system operating in the District. These systems served several
local areas and there was a private Denver-Boulder bus line.
RTD began building a modern bus fleet and its needed support facilities. In 1975, the six
fragmented bus systems that had provided service to different areas of the District were integrated
into a single, unified system. New and improved service became the focal points for future
growth.
The improved service included the extension of routes, new local and express routes; more
frequent service; new nighttime service on many routes; increased service to the mountain areas
of the District; exclusive bus lanes and the inauguration of special service for the elderly and
disabled. Meeting special needs made RTD the first transit system in the nation with a
comprehensive bus program to service the needs of the elderly and disabled. All of these factors
led to a significant increase in ridership.
To support and encourage new riders, RTD also launched a program to establish Park-n- Ride
facilities. Additional bus maintenance and storage facilities were acquired to accommodate the
growing bus fleet.
The Mall bus service became operational in 1982. This was the first step in a unique transit
concept, which would pull 50 percent of the buses off downtown streets during peak hours and
provide opportunities for additional suburban service.
The District has evolved into a transit system that has a service area of 2,348 square miles. It
serves 40 municipalities in 8 counties. The system is comprised of 148 routes. The fleet currently
has 1011 buses of which 434 are leased to private carriers. There are currently four maintenance
and storage facilities District wide, 77 Park-n-Rides and 6 transfer stations.

1.B.2.b

Regular service of the bus transit system is regulated by timetables and varies between peak and
off-peak hours, weekends, weekdays, and special events. The bus system transports an average of
344,339 weekday boarding’s. Denver Union Street Station and Civic Center Station are the main
transfer stations in the downtown Denver area.

I 5.3.2 Organizational Structure
The Bus Transit safety specialist’s office is located at the 1660 Blake Street office. Key positions
with Bus Operations are the Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, Deputy Assistant
General Manager of Bus Operations, General Superintendent of Bus Transportation, Manager of
Bus Transportation, General Superintendent of Bus Maintenance, Manager of Bus Maintenance,
and Manager of Street Supervision. All of these key positions have daily contact with the Bus
Transit safety specialist.

I 5.3.3 Bus Transportation Operations
Dispatch governs the operation, control and dispatch of buses and other RTD vehicles. Dispatch
maintains control with bus operators by means of two-way radios, standard telephones, and the
Global Positioning System. Street Supervisors also carry portable radios in the event of a system
failure. Street supervisors rove throughout the system during operations. Their role is to provide
support and coordination between Dispatch and bus operators during an emergency, accident
response and investigation, rerouting, or other bus-related issues.
Transportation Operations is responsible for providing safe, reliable and efficient service to all
areas served by our mass transit system. This is accomplished by scheduling bus service from
three divisions with 910 full-time and 133 part time bus operators. Service is provided seven days
a week over approximately 21 hours of each day.
Street Supervisors monitor service and performance of bus operators to insure the safe, efficient,
on-time delivery of scheduled bus service. The District also provides continuous evaluation of
routes, schedules, bus stops, shelters and facilities to determine the effectiveness and condition of
the service and amenities.
Effective, two-way radio communication is provided to all revenue and non-revenue vehicles.
Information is received and relayed to the proper sources to provide assistance and coordination
for bus operations. Communication is provided through the radio system, telephones, and a stateof the art tracking system.
The District also monitors bus service provided by private contractors, who operate
approximately 50% of RTD’s fixed route service. Assistance is provided to customers at transit
centers, transfer stations and the Telephone Information Center. The District also coordinates
special community events planning. In the event of a transit emergency, Dispatchers and Street
Supervisors will coordinate bus activities.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The
SSP is considered sensitive security information (SSI) per 49 CFR 15 and 1520, with distribution
controlled to only those with a need-to-know. The SSP complies with DHS guidance including
the National Response Framework, National Incident Management System (NIMS), and National
Preparedness Goal. For response to terrorism or natural disaster incidents, RTD Emergency
Management Plan is based on partnerships with the Urban Area Security Initiative working
group, and first-responder organizations of cities and counties throughout RTD's service area.
For traditional security functions as well as terrorism prevention, RTD's plans are based upon a
formally-adopted policy of awareness, observation and reporting by all employees, especially
front-line personnel, combined with effective responses by both RTD Security Operations
Command and first-responder law enforcement and emergency management organizations. RTD
riders are also asked to report suspicious behaviors or packages to employees, the RTD Security
Command Center, via the RTD Transit Watch App for mobile phones, or call 9-1-1 in the event
of an incident. RTD's Transit Police Division works in partnership with Police and Sheriff’s
departments throughout RTD's service area for high responsiveness to calls for police assistance
on the transit system, for application of the RTD Code of Conduct throughout the RTD service
area, and for effective criminal investigations and prosecutions. In support of security awareness
and reporting by transit system employees, RTD design criteria for new service projects applies
Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles, and provides Closed
Circuit Television and other equipment throughout the system to enhance security.

Emergency Management

The ability to respond quickly and in an organized manner is vital to the continuation of transit
service during a special event, emergency, or during the recovery from a catastrophic incident,
including but not limited to:
• Earthquake
• Fire
• Flooding
• Hazardous material spill
• Medical emergency
• Severe weather
• Pandemic
• Transit related accidents
• Acts of Violence
• Acts of terrorism

A more extensive discussion of RTD emergency management activities is contained in the RTD
Emergency Preparedness Plans, and the Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP), which are being
developed/revised for RTD. Each mode within RTD has the requirement to develop their specific
emergency response plan. Light Rail Emergency Response Plan, Commuter Rail Emergency
Response Plan and Bus Emergency Preparedness Plan. These plans detail activities and
responsibilities for Rail Service personnel and are the responsibility of the Safety Department.
This plan (along with the safety program documents and SSP) also describes coordination of the
following emergency preparedness/management activities:
• Incident management – RTD management of an emergency event or incident is based on
the principles of NIMS and the Incident Command System (ICS). Using National
Incident Management System (NIMS) principles allows emergency response agencies to
communicate with RTD Field Supervisors and/or the RTD Security Command Center
(SCC). The structure of the ICS can be as simple as a single RTD Field Supervisor
responding to an incident or may require the activation of a field Incident Command Post
or the RTD Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
• Coordination with external agencies – the RTD Chief of Police and Emergency
Management is principally responsible for the coordination of incident management
resources with various emergency service agencies to provide for effective interaction
between RTD and those agencies. Liaison with law enforcement agencies is primarily
the responsibility of the Chief Safety Officer, with assistance from the Chief of Police
and Emergency Management
• Emergency response planning and mitigation – RTD establishes a Fire/Life Safety and
Security Committee for each new rail extension or significant transit facility project. The
committee is comprised of safety and security staff; RTD operations, maintenance, and
engineering representatives; and police, fire, emergency medical, and other area
emergency response agency representatives. The committee reviews transit system
designs and recommends fire protection, life safety and security measures, and
procedural response and training needs related to the new extension or facility project.
• Emergency planning – As a critical transportation provider in the Denver metropolitan
area, RTD is a member of the Regional Emergency Management COOP and Urban Area
Security Initiative (UASI). It is RTD’s intent to develop a task force with regional
Emergency Management agencies responsible for emergency preparedness, response,
recovery, and mitigation planning and coordination among the counties and cities in the
metropolitan area, emergency response agencies, RTD, utility companies, and other
critical groups. RTD, with assistance from the Fire/Life Safety and Security Committee,
has developed emergency management operating plans and procedures to address a wide
range of emergency incidents and events, including criminal activity, earthquakes, fire at
transit stations and along the rights-of-way, hazardous materials releases, medical
emergencies, severe weather, terrorism, transportation mishaps, and other emergency
situations occurring within the RTD transit system.
• Emergency preparedness exercises – a minimum of one emergency tabletop or field
exercise is planned and conducted annually to ensure the adequacy of emergency plans
and procedures; readiness of RTD personnel to perform under emergency conditions;
effective coordination between RTD and emergency response agencies; and coordination
of regional emergency exercises that are facilitated through Use of the TERA Software or
other means. All exercises are followed by after-action analyses and reports to document
lessons learned and actions needed to improve RTD’s emergency operations capabilities.

Emergency response training – All front line RTD transportation and maintenance
personnel will undergo emergency response training to ensure they have a full
understanding of their role and responsibility during an emergency incident. The level of
training will be based on their anticipated role during the incident. At a minimum,
training is provided on the emergency plans and procedures that the employee may be
required to implement. Training to familiarize fire, rescue, and other emergency service
personnel with special transit system requirements is coordinated through the Fire and
Life Safety Committees and Safety and Security staff with assistance from the
Transportation and Maintenance Departments, as appropriate.

I 7 Hazard/Risk Management Overview
The hazard management program is developed and implemented by the Safety and
Environmental Division. Under the direction of the RTD Chief Safety and Security Officer,
Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management, the Senior Manager of
Safety and Environmental is responsible for managing this program. RTD utilizes the American
Passenger Transportation Association (APTA) guidelines and Military Standard 882E regarding
the identification and classification of hazards based on severity and probability. The hazard risk
index matrix is used to determine the overall hazard risk index. Hazard identification and
notification is accomplished in a variety of ways. Any employee may report potential hazards to
the Safety and Environmental Division by: use of the RTD safety issue/hazard reporting systems
that include Safety Committees, Safety Concern Reporting (HUB), Safety Hotline, Safety
@RTD-Denver.com, and Safety Suggestion boxes, or by contacting any of the Safety Division
staff or their immediate supervisor. Many hazards are reported and managed through the safety
committee process. Hazards will also be reported through formal mechanisms such as facility and
equipment inspections, internal safety reviews, system modification proposals, design review,
safety open items lists, integrated testing, and safety and security certification. This is an
integrated, system-wide approach to hazard management.
Once identified and reported, the Safety and Environmental Division will conduct a formal
hazard/risk analysis. All identified hazards will be tracked by the Safety and Environmental
Division and documented in the RTD Hazard/Event system or risk register. Regarding hazard
control and elimination, the hierarchy of controls will be applied to achieve tolerable residual
risk.
The State Safety Oversight rules require that transit agencies with fixed rail guideways develop
and implement a hazard management program. The requirements include that the program
identify minimum thresholds, using RTD system data for the notification and reporting of hazards
to the oversight agency. For RTD’s program, hazards defined as meeting the minimum threshold
as reportable to the Public Utilities Commission (which utilizing Mil. Stan. 882E will be hazards
of hazard risk assessment matrix “High/unacceptable” – 1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, and 3A) will be
reported to the PUC as soon as practicable, but not later than 24 hours from the time of
occurrence or discovery. Hazard investigation reports will be provided to the PUC within 45 days
of the initial report date and include all PUC required information including a corrective action
plan and schedule for implementation. RTD will provide the PUC with quarterly progress reports
for hazards defined as reportable to the PUC. Refer to section 3.3.2 for additional information on
hazard management program. Hazards that do not fall into the “High/Unacceptable” category
will be reported to the PUC in monthly reports and will have all corrective action plans created

Safety Assurance Overview

Safety Assurance is accomplished through implementation of safety oversight and risk
monitoring activities. As RTD implements its SMS, several activities will be initiated and tools
will be developed to support these safety oversight and risk monitoring activities. Safety
assurance includes safety reviews, evaluations, reviews, and inspections, as well as safety data
collection, tracking, and analysis, from various sources, including investigations; and
development of Key Safety Performance Indicators and Targets.
Safety Assurance also requires RTD to describe safety performance measures, and RTD will
initially focus on areas based on existing data delivered to the National Transit Database (NTD),
as the following:
• Fatalities – total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles
by mode
• Injuries – total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by
mode
• Safety Events – total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles
by mode
• System Reliability – mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode
These safety performance measures are used to select improvement targets for these four
measures and each mode of transit, in order to encourage improvements and monitor safety
performance of delivering transit services. In addition, RTD will select additional performance
measures, both leading and lagging, to insure continual improvement of our Safety Management
System.

I 8.1

Management of Change

Change Management is critical to an effective Safety Assurance program. The primary purpose of
change management, system modification, and safety and security certification is to ensure that
changes to the baseline/existing or significant capital projects for the transit system are reviewed
for conformance with existing RTD standards and to identify and assess potential hazards before
making changes to documents, equipment, facilities, or transit routes. Safety critical operational
documents, bus and rail fixed facilities, revenue and non-revenue vehicles equipment, and transit
routes are subject to change management and formal document control procedures. They include,
but are not limited to, agency policies standard operating procedures, emergency operating
procedures, safety and operating rules, training materials, drawings, and engineering reference
information.
These documents are subject to review or revision as a result of (not exclusive):
• Incidents or mishaps
• Major service changes, excluding routine schedule adjustments

Attachment: 2021 RTD PTASP Final (4334 : Approval of 2021 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

Policy changes

In 2019, RTD created the Infrastructure Change Review Committee. The management of change
will be managed by the Infrastructure Change Review process. Details of this change
management process and the safety and security certification process can be found in the Safety
Assurance Section of the PTASP. In addition, the RTD Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan
and State of Good Repair efforts are managed separately but are inputs to the SMS processes.

I 8.2

Continuous Improvement

Continuous improvement is defined by FTA as a process by which a transit agency examines
safety performance to identify safety deficiencies and carry out a plan to address the identified
safety deficiencies. RTD will use the management review cycle along with performance data for
the Safety Management System to identify and prioritize continuous improvement of each
process. This method is consistent with safety management systems principles and allows for the
resourcing and prioritization of RTD’s SMS efforts.

I9

Safety Promotion Overview

Safety promotion includes safety culture, safety-related lessons learned, and reporting systems,
recommendations based on safety metrics, data, and safety training. The intent of safety
promotion is to foster a positive safety culture in which RTD employees receive ongoing training
and updates of safety progress; feel comfortable reporting safety issues or concerns; and
understand why safety is important and how staff actions or inactions impact safety. Through
safety promotion, the Leadership Team broadcasts its commitment to safety and the SMS, and
demonstrates its commitment to the importance of safety.
The RTD Safety Promotion plans focus on three main areas:
1. Safety Culture - A positive safety culture focuses on finding and correcting systemic
issues rather than finding someone or something to blame. A positive safety culture
flourishes in an environment of trust, encouraging error-reporting and discouraging
covering up mistakes. The need to address behavior that is malicious or recklessly
negligent must be balanced with the need for a just culture that is not excessively
punitive. A positive safety culture goes beyond simply adhering to procedures. It is
demonstrated when employees carry out their duties correctly, with attention to detail,
full knowledge, sound judgment, and a sense of accountability.
2. Safety Communication - Effective communication of safety risks is critical and a key
component of the safety culture.

Attachment: 2021 RTD PTASP Final (4334 : Approval of 2021 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.B.2.b

52
Packet Pg. 255

A Safety Promotion Communication Plan will be created with the assistance of the RTD
Communication Department. The Safety Promotion Communication Plan will include at least the
following topics:
• Dissemination of safety messages, progress towards safety performance targets, and
lessons learned
• Safety Hazards and risks
• Inform employees of actions taken in response to Safety Concern Reporting and trends
• Measuring or assessing safety culture
• Safety culture promotion
Safety Communication also includes the riders of the transit systems and the public that interacts
with the transit system. RTD leads and participates in several safety outreach activities and
provides safety awareness messages for riders and the public. The RTD Senior Specialist, Safety
Communications works directly with the SS&AM department to ensure a consistent internal and
external safety messaging.
3. Safety Training - Appropriate safety training is provided for each employee
commensurate with their position.
All RTD personnel will receive training to become familiar with:
• Safety Management Systems Overview
• Safety Reporting /Risk Management
• Safety Assurance
• Employee Roles and Responsibilities

I 9.1

Specific Job Safety Training

Safety specific training is provided by the division and department for employees. The training
includes an understanding of safety risks and controls, rules, and procedures. It is the
responsibility of department managers and supervisors to ensure the training requirements are
identified and fulfilled. SS&AM coordinates with department training instructors in formulating
and refining the training programs.
Managers and supervisors must arrange appropriate safety training for each position. This
includes both technical and non-technical training, on-the-job training, and refresher training.
Trainers must be competent and qualified in the delivery of training. A complete and
comprehensive training and qualification record by employee is maintained.
Suitable qualifications of employees are maintained and revalidated in accordance with the
requirements of the division and department, and regulatory requirements.

I 10

SMS Documentation and Records

Documentation and recordkeeping pertinent to each component or subcomponent of SMS is
described in the relevant section of the RTD SMS. This subcomponent will also include changes
for the management of new or revised safety requirements from regulations or otherwise, such as
the introduction of minimum standards for safety. In addition, this subcomponent includes safety
data and analyses delivered to and used by RTD management for safety-related decision-making.

II RISK MANAGEMENT
Element II of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan is Risk Management, describing how
RTD identifies, evaluates, tracks and mitigates hazards and risk in the organization and on the
transit system. In this element, the processes undertaken by RTD are provided in sufficient detail
to be effectively undertaken. Acceptable risk levels, performance targets and mitigation measures
are established.

II

Risk Management Program

II 1.1 Hazard Management
The management of identified hazards is a vital component of the RTD Safety Management
System. A hazard is defined as a condition or set of conditions, internal or external to the RTD
system, which when activated could cause injury or death or damage or loss of equipment or
property. An unacceptable hazard is a condition that may endanger human life or property or
result in system loss. This includes harm to passengers, employees, contractors, equipment, and to
the general public. These hazardous conditions must be mitigated. Hazards are identified in
several different internal and external sources. Hazards may be observed in the operating
environment, through procedures, during system modifications and capital projects, accidents,
extensions or operational changes.
RTD has implemented the guidance as outlined in FTA’s Clarification letter September 6, 2007
on the hazard management requirements. The Hazard Management Program applies to all RTD
employees and obligates everyone to constantly observe hazards in their work areas and report
them to their safety committee, the transit safety specialist or to their supervisor or manager. The
overall hazard management program incorporates a system-wide hazard identification process,
including activities for:
• Identification
• Investigation
• Evaluation and analysis
• Control and elimination
• Tracking
• Ongoing reporting to PUC SSO and RTD senior management relating to hazard
management activities and status

II 1.1.2

Localized Hazard Management

RTD Department Managers will play a key role in the hazard management process and ensure
that the process has been fully integrated within their departments. Managers will also ensure the
following elements of the hazard management process are present in their departments:
• Ensure employees have the ability to report hazards to management in person or through
the use of the electronic hazard reporting form via the hub;
• Ensure hazards are placed on a local hazard log for tracking and documentation;

Represent management or select designee to represent management on a local safety
committee;
Ensure each hazard has been assigned to a specific individual /Point Of Contact;
Participate in assigning hazard ratings (in accordance with the RTD Risk Assessment
Matrix); and
Ensure employees receive appropriate hazard management training.

II 1.1.3

Local Hazard Logs

AGM down to the Division managers along with transit safety specialists will ensure local hazard
logs are used to track hazards at the departmental level within RTD. These logs are to be
maintained within the department and are reviewed by the local safety committee on a monthly
basis. Hazards placed on the local log receive their initial and final hazard rating using RTD’s
risk assessment matrix. Management may give hazards their initial rating when hazards are
received and final ratings when they are closed. Management may also present hazards to the
local safety committee for hazard ratings or employ the Safety Department for assistance in rating
hazards. Hazard ratings may be changed when new information or as a result of data analysis.

II 1.1.4

Hazard Management

When a hazard is identified as needing mitigation that requires cost or changes beyond that of the
local safety committee or department abilities, the hazard will be elevated to the corresponding
Safety Department Hazard Logs and be reviewed by the future Safety and Security Review
Committee (SSRC). The SSRC will represent key department managers that have the ability to
make decisions and will employ multiple disciplines at RTD and have access to higher level
budgeted solutions.

II 1.1.5

Safety Department Hazard Logs

Transit safety specialists (TSS) are responsible for the maintenance of Safety Department Hazard
Logs. TSS’s ensure that hazards meeting defined criteria are entered into the appropriate category
within the Hazard Reporting System for accurate record keeping. Hazard rating can be assigned
by the either the TSS or the future SSRC. The following are Specific hazards that are identified
and mitigated at the corporate level:
• Unacceptable hazards (High Hazards);
• Hazards identified from reviews from outside agency’s (PUC, FTA, FRA, OSHA);
• Hazards identified from accident investigations;
• Hazards where corrective action will cost more than an estimate of $25,000;
• Serious or high hazards on local department hazard log over 180 day;
• When warranted by the Safety Department

II 1.1.6

Corrective Action Plan (CAP)

Corrective action plans are utilized within RTD for hazards that meet certain criteria. The
following hazards require the usage of a corrective action plan:
• Unacceptable hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, or 1C (High
Hazards);

Packet Pg. 260

•
•
•

Review findings from regulatory agencies resulting in Non-conformance (PUC, FTA,
FRA, OSHA);
Corrective action resulting from accident investigations;
When warranted by the Safety Department

In the following instances corrective action plans must receive prior approval by the SSO
Manager before corrective action plans may be carried out:
• Unacceptable hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, or 1C (High
Hazards);
• Review findings from regulatory agencies resulting in Non-conformance (PUC, FTA,
OSHA);
• Accident investigations requiring corrective action,
• Testing or reviews of Industrial Hygiene which potentially exceed OSHA PEL limits,
For hazards that do not meet the Unacceptable Risk Assessment Codes of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B or 1C
(High Hazards), SSO staff will review and preliminarily approve the CAP before safety risk
mitigation activities are implemented.
If an emergency corrective action must be taken immediately to ensure safety, the SSO must be
notified of the issue immediately and RTD must follow up with the SSO for subsequent review
and approval of the corrective action, within 5 business days.
The SSO will review and provide final approval of all Corrective Action Plans on a quarterly
basis.
CAP’s are assigned a specific tracking numbers by the Electronic Hazard Reporting System and
are and are linked with its associated hazard. CAP’s must contain at a minimum:
• A person of responsibility for the corrective action
• A proposed completion date
• Plan approval when applicable

II 1.1.7

Corrective Action Plan/Preventative Action Plan Development

Corrective action plans are developed by department managers/designee in conjunction with the
Safety Department and associated safety committees (Local Safety Committee, future SSRC, and
ESSC). Accident Evaluation Groups (to be formalized) will also be utilized when developing
CAP’s resulting from hazards identified after an accident. TSS’s will ensure that the CAP process
is followed and properly tracked until it is closed.

II 1.2 Hazard Process Overview
RTD's hazard process includes light rail, commuter rail, and bus systems. The hazard
management flow chart lays out an overall description of how hazards are identified, evaluated,
analyzed, controlled or eliminated, tracked and reported to RTD senior management and PUC
State Safety Oversight.
• The Transit safety specialists assigned to light rail, bus, and capital projects are the
primary points of contact (POC) for the hazard management process.

•

Safety Committee members for rail and bus will be able to identify, evaluate, and analyze
hazards.
The TSS’s will enter identified hazards into the electronic hazard reporting system.
The TSS and or committee will develop a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) for each
unacceptable and undesirable hazard entry and identify point of contact or owner of the
hazard and places this information within the hazard reporting system for tracking
purposes.
CAP's may also be identified as a result of an incident and investigation.
Safety committee members also participate in the evaluation and control or elimination of
the hazard.
Hazards must be mitigated at the lowest level possible. However, when a hazard is
identified as having a mitigation that involves multiple departments, or requires cost or
changes beyond the safety committee or department abilities or budgets the hazard will
be elevated to the future Safety and Security Review Committee (SSRC). The SSRC will
represent key department managers and have the capability to employ multiple
disciplines at RTD and have access to higher level budgeted solutions.
Recommendations/Results from Contractor or Internal review, testing, industrial or
environmental sampling results requiring corrective actions will be placed in the hazard
log for follow up and possible need for retesting for compliance with Safety or
Environmental requirements.
If mitigation or control of a hazard is not achieved through the future SSRC, the hazard
mitigation process may be elevated to the Chief Safety Officer’s Safety and Security
Committee (ESSC) for final resolution.

II 1.3 Hazard Identification
Identification of hazards is the responsibility of all RTD employees and contractors. The
continuous identification, monitoring, and elimination of hazards is key to an effective system
safety program.
• Hazard identification methods include, but are not limited to the following:
• Observation, inspection, and interaction of all RTD employees and contractors,
• Reports from safety committee members, passengers, customer service, and field
personnel,
• Evaluation of accidents, incidents, near misses, to include data trends and projections.
• Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) of a design or new construction,
• Safety certification, system integration testing, pre-revenue testing, system modification,
configuration management verification, and inspection processes,
• Operation Hazard Analysis (OHA) of revenue operations
• Internal and external safety reviews, inspections, observations, defects, findings,
observations, violations, and reviews
• Controller logs, daily operating clearances/bulletins, and training feedback
• "Lesson learned" inputs.
• Review of applicable regulatory codes and standards
• "NTSB, FRA, FTA, OSHA, safety recommendations, guidance, initiatives, and alerts
• Nonconformance Reports, Corrective Action Reports (NCR and CARS)
Examples of observed hazards may include:
• An uneven sidewalk joint that could cause a trip and fall
• Opening in a section of corridor fencing which allows access of a trespasser

The RTD hazard logs (by mode – light rail, bus) are managed by the transit safety specialists
(TSS). Hazards identified by an employee to his/her supervisor may be resolved by the employee
and supervisor. For example, a discharged fire extinguisher may be identified by an employee and
brought to the attention of his/her supervisor and the supervisor gives the employee authorization
to order a newly charged extinguisher from the supply room for a replacement. If the supervisor
is unable to solve the identified hazard, he/she will forward the hazard to a safety committee
representative to be brought to the safety committee for resolution. The safety committee and
TSS will review the hazard and assign an initial hazard rating (IHR) and place the hazard into the
hazard reporting system to be tracked. The following flow process will be followed by employees
in identifying and correcting hazards at the employee/supervisor level and actions taken to move
the hazard to the safety committee and beyond if necessary.

Potential Sources of Hazard Identification

II 1.4 Hazard Investigation, Evaluation, and Analysis
RTD is currently in the process of developing and refining a database where incidents and
observed hazards can be tracked and analyzed for leading indicators of potential hazards. This
will allow management to be proactive in correcting hazards.
Safety concerns should be identified and corrected at the lowest level (employee/department) as
soon as practicable. Safety concerns that are not eliminated at this level are reported to a
supervisor or a transit safety specialist. Reported concerns will be assessed by the TSS and or
safety committee to determine if a safety hazard exists and assign an initial hazard rating (IHR).

II 1.4.1

Root Cause Analysis and Accident Evaluation

Hazards are investigated as they are identified through evaluating accidents, incidents, and near
misses. Hazards originating from accidents are reviewed by the transit safety specialist and
respective safety evaluation committees. As part of evaluating accidents and incidents, root cause
analysis using the “FIVE Why?” methodology is used to help focus on the bottom-line
fundamental cause and determine the most effective solutions to mitigating hazards. The primary
purpose of the accident evaluation process is to determine root causes potential hazards that may
have contributed to an incident. A third-party expert may be used to assist with an investigation
if deemed necessary. This will be determined based upon a RTD hazard assessments, to be
determined frequent and high (Catastrophic HIGH).
HIGH risk hazards (1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B) that receive an unacceptable initial hazard analysis
made by management, safety committee or the transit safety specialist receive immediate
attention/control. A high hazard rating requires corrective action.
Hazards that receive a high hazard rating will be elevated from the local hazard log to the
electronic hazard reporting system.

Attachment: 2021 RTD PTASP Final (4334 : Approval of 2021 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.B.2.b

61
Packet Pg. 264

SERIOUS hazards (1D, 2C, 3A, 3B) that are undesirable may require corrective action and
decisions by management. Hazards that receive a serious hazard rating will remain on the local
hazard logs no more than 150 days before being moved to the appropriate Safety Department
Log.
MEDIUM (1E, 2D, 2E, 3C, 3D, 3E, 4A, 4B) hazards may be acceptable with review by
management. Events from a medium hazard are less likely to occur and are less severe in nature.
LOW (4C, 4D, 4E) hazards do not require review and are acceptable.
ELIMINATED hazard is no longer present.

II 1.4.2

Hazard Reporting Threshold to PUC

RTD will notify the PUC of all identified hazards via the electronic reporting system and
monthly/quarterly reporting. RTD will notify PUC of all hazardous conditions that affect the
immediate safety or security of the rail system in a timely fashion. At a minimum, RTD notifies
PUC within one business day, according to the notification procedures in the PUC standard, of
hazardous conditions that are rated as High and set forth in the transit agency’s Hazard
Identification/Resolution Matrix:
• I-A (Catastrophic/Frequent)
• II-A (Critical/Frequent)
• I-B (Catastrophic/Probable)
• II-B (Critical/Probable)
• I-C (Catastrophic/Occasional)
RTD is responsible for assigning severity/probability ratings to hazardous conditions.
RTD will include in its hazard log and hazard management process hazardous conditions,
incidents, occurrences, and events, including the following:
• Incidents involving individuals working in the transit agency-controlled right of way that
are investigated by the transit agency.
• Malfunctions of safety-critical systems that could result or have resulted in catastrophic
or single-point failure.
• Broken or missing safety-critical equipment, infrastructure, or systems that could result,
or have resulted, in employee or passenger injury, or damage to RTD property.

Hazard Severity

Hazard severity is a subjective determination of the worst case that could be anticipated to result
from human error, design inadequacies, component failure or malfunction. The categories of
hazards based on the modified MIL-STD-882 are as follows:
Category 1 Catastrophic - Operating conditions are such that human error, design deficiencies,
element, subsystem or component failure or procedural deficiencies may cause death or major
system loss and require immediate termination of the unsafe activity or operation
Category 2 Critical - operating conditions are such that human error, subsystem or component
failure or procedural deficiencies may cause severe injury, severe occupational illness or major
system damage and require immediate corrective action.
Category 3 Marginal - Operating conditions are such that they may result in minor injury,
occupational illness or system damage and are such that human error, subsystem or component
failures can be counteracted or controlled.
Category 4 Negligible - Operating conditions are such that human error, subsystem or component
failure or procedural deficiencies will result in less than minor injury, occupational illness or
system damage.
The categorization of hazards is consistent with risk-based criteria for severity; it reflects the
principle that not all hazards pose an equal amount of risk to personal safety.

II 1.4.45

Hazard Probability

The probability of a particular event or a specific hazard occurring may be defined as a nondimensional ratio of the number of times that a specific event occurs to the total number of trials
in which this event will occur during the planned life expectancy of a system. Generally, hazard
probability is described qualitatively in potential occurrences per units of time, miles, trips/runs
or passengers carried. A hazard probability may be derived from the analysis of transit system
operating experience, evaluation of RTD safety data, the analysis of reliability and failure data, or
from historical safety data from other passenger rail systems or bus systems.

II 1.4.6

Hazard or Risk Assessments

RTD has adopted a system for assessing the level of risk for each identified hazard to determine
what action(s) must be taken to correct or document the hazard risk. This assessment system has
been incorporated into the formal system safety analysis which enables the Transit safety
specialist or safety committees as decision makers to understand the amount of risk involved in
accepting the hazard in relation to the cost (schedule, cost, operations) to reduce the hazard to an
acceptable level.
The Hazard Matrix (6.4.2) identifies the hazard risk index (HRI) based upon hazard category and
probability and the criteria for defining further actions based upon the index.

II 1.5

Hazard Control, Elimination, and Tracking

Safety critical hazards that have been identified must be controlled or eliminated so that the
hazard does not continue to pose a danger. This may be done in a temporary manner as long as
the hazard is controlled. The process of controlling, tracking, and elimination, of hazards is
recorded on the hazard log which is generated from the electronic hazard reporting system. The
hazard log will be forwarded to PUC SSO on a monthly basis.
All hazard log entries require a mitigation plan or corrective action plan (CAP) (depending on
risk ranking), tracking number, brief description, projected completion date, and an initial
hazard/risk rating (IHR/IRR) using the RTD Hazard Analysis Matrix.
Corrective action plans include the following information:
• Element of activity identified as deficient
• Planned activities to resolve deficiency
• RTD department responsible for implementing corrective action
• Scheduled completion date for implementation
• Estimated cost of implementation
Hazard log entries with their associated corrective action plan are reviewed regularly by the
safety department, safety committees, PUC SSO and periodically reviewed by senior
management. CAP's may be tracked and sorted from the hazard log. When a CAP is closed the
hazard log will reflect this action and a closed date.
Individual CAP files are stored in the enterprise content management system by hazard tracking
number.

II 1.5.1

Hazard Resolution and Elimination

Hazard resolution is defined as the analysis and subsequent actions taken to reduce to the lowest
level practical, the risk associated with an identified hazard. Hazard resolution is not synonymous
with hazard elimination. In a transit environment, there are some hazards, which are impossible to
eliminate and others, which are highly impractical to eliminate. Reduction of risk to the lowest

1. Design out or design to minimize hazard severity. To the extent permitted by cost and
practicality, identified hazards will be eliminated or controlled by the design of
equipment, systems and facilities.
2. Hazards that cannot reasonably be eliminated or controlled through design will be
controlled to the extent practicable to an acceptable level through the use of fixed,
automatic, or other protective safety design features or devices. Provisions will be made
for periodic functional checks of safety devices and training for employees to ensure that
system safety objectives are met.
3. When design and safety devices cannot reasonably nor effective, eliminate or control an
identified hazard, safety warning devices will be used (to the extent practicable) to alert
persons to the hazards.
4. Where it is impossible to reasonably eliminate or adequately control a hazard through
design of the use of safety warning devices, procedures and training will be used to
control the hazard.

II 1.6

Hazard Tracking

Each CAP developed for hazards, findings from investigations or deficiencies will be submitted
to PUC SSO as required for review and approval. The CAP form is automatically assigned a
tracking number and placed on the Hazard log with its identified hazard. Upon completion of the
corrective action the safety department will submit to PUC as required. The completed CAP is
formally adopted by receiving PUC SSO's signature. The Hazard Log will then be updated to
show the status of the identified hazard with its CAP to "CLOSED".
RTD will monitor all Corrective Action Plans with the use of the RTD Hazard Log and will
provide PUC with an updated hazard log quarterly.
Internally, the safety department will coordinate with the appropriate department to develop a
Mitigation plan and fill out the appropriate form for the identified hazard. The form will be
assigned a tracking number by the electronic hazard reporting system and placed on the hazard
log with the corresponding hazards for tracking purposes.

practical level can be accomplished in a variety of ways from protective and warning devices to
special procedures. The hierarchy of controls will be followed to achieve a tolerable risk level.

Ongoing Reporting To State Safety Oversight Agency

The transit safety specialist will review the current status and identify any issues with the
resolution action and dates. The hazard log, at a minimum is provided to the SSO monthly
All hazards identified and rated as unacceptable hazardous conditions will be separately tracked
and reported to PUC along with the corrective action plans for each unacceptable hazardous
condition found. All hazards identified and rated as unacceptable hazardous conditions will be
separately tracked and reported to PUC with determination of an unacceptable hazardous
condition.
PUC will notify RTD in writing of its acceptance or rejection of the corrective action plan and in
accordance with procedures specified in the PUC SSO standard. The RTD CAP form requires the
PUC SSO electronic or wet signature approval indicating the assigned resolution and completion
of the CAP. The CAP is maintained in the Laserfiche hazard reporting system files and is
identified by a specific hazard log identifier tracking number. After a hazard has been resolved, it
will be assigned its final hazard rating.

II 1.8

Pre-Job Safety Briefings/Task Level Risk Assessments

Hazards that are identified in the work area will be recorded on the hazard log which is
maintained by the Transit safety specialist to the specific transportation mode at RTD. All
employees are encouraged to identify and control or resolve hazards at the lowest management
level possible. Employees that perform job tasks are required to discuss job tasks and identified
hazards that are associated with those tasks or job steps during job briefings. Identified hazards
that cannot be controlled with PPE or procedures must be resolved or mitigated through the
hazard management process.

these types of materials are ordered, they are not received until the SDS is provided. SDS forms
are forwarded to the transit safety specialists or and transit environmental specialists who place
the forms in the appropriate SDS database in RTD’s facilities and electronic system.

The EMS policy manual will govern hazardous materials procurement, receiving, storage, use,
and disposal, as well as complying with legal and other requirements. A continual process of
assessment, corrections, and improvement will be adopted by RTD management as a part of the
adoption of the environmental management system program.
During 2013 the new addition of the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) was announced by
OSHA. RTD has incorporated awareness training and announced the new changes to the Hazard
Communications 29 CFR 1200 which are to be implemented over the next two years. All
material safety data sheets (MSDS) will change format and be known as SDS sheets and are
accessible through an Intranet-based system. All MSDS/SDS are available through the SharePoint
Site:

Each employee receives training on hazardous materials management and is instructed as to their
responsibilities right to know about potential hazards that they work with. RTD's safety and
environmental compliance officers, as described in the EMS manual, review compliance with this
manual.

II 2.3

Management of Hazardous Materials

For any hazardous chemical used or stored in the workplace, RTD facilities must maintain a
safety data sheet (SDS), and submit the SDSs (or a list of the chemicals) to their state emergency
response commission (SERC), local emergency planning committee (LEPC), and local fire
department. RTD facilities must also report an annual inventory of these chemicals by March 1 of
each year to their SERC, LEPC, and local fire department. The Environmental Department has
been given this reporting responsibility. The information must be made available to the public.
There are over 2,000 listed hazardous materials and over 600 extremely hazardous chemicals
subject to reporting. Reporting requirements have been limited by quantity. RTD submits an
annual Tier II chemical inventory report for our facilities that are subject to reporting.
The common hazardous materials used by RTD that are subject to reporting are:
• Diesel Fuel
• Gasoline
• New and used oil
• Antifreeze (ethylene glycol)
• Lead acid batteries (sulfuric acid)
The liquids are stored in tanks or drums within secondary containment. RTD also uses many
hazardous chemicals contained in soaps, solvents, brake cleaners, paints, and aerosols. These
hazardous materials are described in the product-specific safety data sheets (SDS).

Attachment: 2021 RTD PTASP Final (4334 : Approval of 2021 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

employees and department managers will be provided with and will be required to comply with
this management system. The manual and the EMS standard operating procedures (SOPs) will
require RTD personnel to comply with applicable local, state, and federal regulations.

RTD is also a small quantity generator of hazardous waste. Hazardous waste is a hazardous
material that has outlived its usefulness or has become contaminated through use. Hazardous
wastes, can be generated by:
• Discarding a hazardous material (oil-based paint, pesticides, some soaps, expired
products)
• Using a product (used batteries, fluorescent lamps, HID lamps, paint thinner, aerosol
dregs)
Hazardous wastes are stored in closed containers and accumulated in satellite accumulation areas.
These containers are labeled hazardous waste and are located near where the waste is generated.
The environmental compliance officers are responsible for preparing appropriate manifests,
scheduling hazardous materials transportation, and final disposal.

Element III of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan is Safety Assurance, which
describes how RTD will measure and review its processes to ensure that it remains in compliance
with established standards. These processes, safety performance targets, and reports will provide
the confidence to RTD leadership that the organization and system is functioning in an acceptable
level of safety. The reviews, inspections, rules checks and compliance verification procedures are
described, required schedules set and acceptable measures established.

III 1 Internal Safety Review Process
Internal safety reviews and inspections are critical components of an integrated system safety
program. As such, internal safety reviews of the light rail system are conducted semiannually
parallel to the PUC to assure compliance with the Safety Management System and that the plan is
effectively implemented. Facilities are inspected monthly for occupational safety issues and local
fire codes. The overall light rail system is reviewed to assure that activities required by RTD’s
operating, maintenance, and Safety Management System are completed. Written reports of each
review are prepared and distributed to the various light rail departments reviewed. The Executive
Safety and Security Committee may also discuss safety reviews, evaluate the effectiveness of the
Safety Management System, recommend corrective action if necessary, and ensure timely
implementation and follow up. An annual internal light rail review report is compiled in January
of each year and submitted to the PUC by February 15 of each year. The report documents the
review findings for the year including the results of the internal reviews performed during the
previous year, a summary of required corrective actions taken, if any, and provision for follow up
to ensure timely implementation and to determine effectiveness of the Safety Management
System. The annual report will be accompanied by a formal letter of certification signed by the
General Manager indicating that the RTD is in compliance with its Safety Management System
and system security plan. If RTD identifies areas of deficiency, the General Manager, by letter,
will identify the activities RTD will take to achieve compliance. Documentation of inspection and
reviews are maintained in the Safety and Environmental Division.
As part of the safety review program, all RTD departments are subject to review. Under the
direction of the Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management, the Senior
Manager of Safety and Environmental is responsible for and has complete authority to conduct
internal safety reviews. Two reviews are conducted each year, one in the summer and one in the
winter. Within a three-year period, all system safety plan elements are reviewed for compliance
with the plan and state safety oversight requirements. The sixth review cycle is usually reserved
to review and revise the review process to assure that all elements are completed and that the
program meets the state safety oversight requirements.
RTD will notify the PUC of an upcoming review cycle at least 30 days prior to the start of the
safety review. The review team consists of representatives from the Safety Unit of RTD. Each
checklist is assigned a lead reviewer for the final development of the checklist and to be the
responsible person to complete the checklist including back up documentation when the review
cycle is complete.

Packet Pg. 275

An opening conference may be scheduled with the departments subject to safety review; in some
cases an opening conference is not required. At the opening conference, the checklists are
distributed and each checklist is discussed and reviewed for accuracy; the schedule is then set
with the affected departments. The actual internal safety review consists of interviews with key
personnel, documentation review, and observation of activities to assess compliance and
understanding of rules, training, and procedures. After completion of the onsite activities, the
checklists are completed and a written draft report is developed. The draft report may include
recommendations or findings. Recommendations are defined as suggestions to make
improvements, while findings are defined as documented deficiencies in the implementation of
established programs, rules or procedures. The draft report is distributed for review and comment
to the affected parties. Parties have 30 days to respond to the draft report including an
opportunity to correct any findings. A final report is completed and distributed to all parties.
Recorded findings require the development of a corrective action plan. Each year, the annual
internal safety review report is prepared and submitted to the PUC, will include an evaluation of
the adequacy and effectiveness of the Safety Management System.
Recommendation and findings will be tracked in two ways. Recommendations from previous
review cycles will be reviewed and evaluated in subsequent cycles. Findings will be tracked
under the corrective action plan process of placing all findings on a tracking spreadsheet and the
subsequent quarterly corrective action plan progress reports filed with the PUC.

III 1.1 Inspections, Field/Coop Audits and Reviews
The Safety Division conducts periodic inspections, field audits/coop walk-throughs and safety
reviews. Maintenance facilities are inspected monthly to ensure compliance with occupational
safety regulations and local fire codes. Semiannual safety reviews are conducted in parallel with
the Colorado Public Utilities Commission to document compliance with established standard
operating procedures, maintenance plans and the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan. Any
deviations from required activities or identified safety hazards are resolved through a formal
reporting process. For additional information on system safety reviews, refer to section 5.3.

III 1.2 Accident Investigation, Notification, Reporting and Corrective Action Plans
Formal investigations shall be conducted for all transit events. All accidents are investigated by
either a Light Rail Supervisor or Transportation Street Supervisor Regarding bus accidents, if
damage is minor, personnel are unavailable or certain weather conditions exist, operators may be
instructed by Dispatch or law enforcement personnel to just complete an accident report.
Subsequent accident investigation reports are completed and distributed to the Operations
Division and the Safety and Environmental Division.
Light rail control will notify Safety Division of every accident that meets the criteria listed below.
Upon notification, Safety Division will determine the level of investigation to be performed by
the Safety Unit. Light rail accidents and incidents are investigated according to RTD Standard
Operating Procedure 103.2 – Incident/Accident Investigation.

Attachment: 2021 RTD PTASP Final (4334 : Approval of 2021 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.B.2.b

Safety Division personnel will either conduct light rail accident investigations or evaluate

and other agencies, coordinate the preparation and implementation of corrective action plans if
necessary, prepare an accident tracking matrix, and provide summaries to the Executive Safety
and Security Committee. All transit events will be tracked and evaluated by the Executive Safety
and Security Committee. The Safety Division will also coordinate all accident investigation
activities with the PUC and will provide as much advance notice as practical to notify the PUC of
an accident investigation. When investigating an accident as defined in rule 7347(a), RTD will
give prior sufficient telephone or facsimile notice to the PUC's staff of the times that an accident
investigation team will convene to conduct interviews, inspections, examinations, or tests to
determine the cause of the accident.
Serious bus accidents are similarly investigated by the Accident Investigation Team consisting of
the following members: Street Supervisors, Manager of Dispatch-Street Supervision, Liability
Claims Representative, Division Manager, Manager of the bus operator’s division, Transportation
Manager of the bus operator’s division, Transit safety specialist/Bus Operations, and Technical
Services Representative.
Notification is required within two hours pursuant to 4 CCR 723-7-7348(a) for any accident
occurring on an RFGPTS where one or more of the following occurs:
1. Fatality at the scene, or confirmation of death within 30 days of accident
2. Serious Injuries as defined in Rule 7341 (tt) requiring immediate medical attention away
from the scene for one or more individuals
3. Property damage resulting from a collision involving a rail transit vehicle
4. An evacuation due to life safety reasons
5. A collision at a grade crossing
6. A derailment of a rail transit vehicle
7. A runaway train
8. A collision between a rail transit vehicle and a second rail transit vehicle, or a rail transit
non-revenue vehicle
Accident notification under 4-CCR 723-7, 7347(b) is not required by RTD as RTD has no light
rail track that is shared with the general railroad system.
RTD will also provide accident follow-up notification by e-mail in the form of a checklist to the
PUC including the following information:
• The nature of the accident as described above.
• The time, date, and location of the accident.
• The time and date of the notification to the PUC.
• A description of the vehicles, rail transit vehicles, passengers, individuals, rail transitcontrolled property, and other property involved in the accident and the direction they
were traveling at the time of the incident, if known.
For accidents involving a rail transit vehicle or taking place on rail transit-controlled property
where one or more of the above thresholds are met, the RTD will conduct accident investigations
for RTD and on behalf of the PUC. Written accident investigation reports will be provided to the
PUC within 45 days from the date of occurrence and shall include the following:

III 1.3 Collect, Analyze and Report System Safety Data, and Maintain Records

76
Packet Pg. 279

System safety data is collected through a variety of sources including near miss information,
accident investigation reports, internal safety reviews, safety committee meetings, occupational
injury reports, incident reports, use of an accident matrix, system monitoring including testing
and inspection records, and the hazard management program. This safety data will be analyzed,
and used for development of Key Safety Performance Indicators and Targets. RTD will initially
focus on areas based on data delivered to the National Transit Database (NTD), as the following:
•
•
•
•

Fatalities – total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles
by mode
Injuries – total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by
mode
Safety Events – total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles
by mode
System Reliability – mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode

These safety performance measures are used to select improvement targets for these four
measures and for each mode of transit, in order to encourage improvements and monitor the
safety performance of delivering transit services. In addition, RTD will select additional
performance measures and targets, both leading and lagging, to insure continual improvement of
our Safety Management System.
RTD will make its safety performance measures improvement targets available to applicable
State agencies (i.e. CDOT) and metropolitan planning organizations (currently Denver Regional
Council of Governments – DRCOG) (together, “External Entities”); and, to the maximum extent
practicable, will coordinate with the External Entities in the selection of External Entity safety
performance targets.
The safety data collected from the above sources will be analyzed for potential safety impacts.
Identified areas of concern are reported to appropriate personnel in the form of specific project
reports, memos, and recommendations from the Executive Safety and Security Committee.
Records of system safety data are maintained in the office of the Safety and Environmental
Division for a minimum of three years. Certain information, such as safety certification back up
documentation is maintained by RTD’s document control process managed by the Capital
Programs Department. In addition to safety, the Safety and Environmental Division maintains
data and documentation of activities required by the Safety Management System. Distribution of
safety-related reports and data is accomplished through the RTD Executive Safety and Security
Committee.

III 1.4 System Modifications or Major Repairs
New equipment modifications and retrofits are determined, reviewed, and approved by the RTD
engineering group and the Technical Support staff. Review may also take place by the RTD
Infrastructure Change Review Committee or Executive Safety and Security Committee if
necessary.

III 1.5 System Modifications and Configuration Management

77
Packet Pg. 280

For Light Rail, System modifications are managed according to Light Rail Standard Operating
Procedure 101.11, Light Rail System Change Procedure. The SOP defines system change as
follows: modifications, alterations, additions, or deletions to the contracts, specifications,
components, equipment or facilities affecting any part of the light rail operating system.
This procedure is intended to assure that any potential hazards that may be introduced through
system modification are addressed through RTD’s hazard management program, and affected
RTD Departments are afforded the opportunity and given due consideration for any proposed
change or modification to the light rail system. System changes are proposed by submitting a
“Proposal for LRT System Change” form. This system change form includes the following
information:
•
•
•
•
•

Brief description including support data
Description of benefits expected
Resources required
Operation implications
Safety considerations

Completed forms are forwarded to the initiator’s supervisor, department head, and lastly to the
Executive Safety and Security Committee via the Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security
and Asset Management. Upon receipt of the proposed change, the Safety Unit determines if a
preliminary hazard analysis (PHA) is necessary. If a PHA is necessary, it is performed by the
Safety Unit. All information is distributed to the Executive Safety and Security Committee for
evaluation based on safety, operational, and cost criteria. The Committee must reach consensus
for the proposal to be accepted. Recommended proposals are forwarded to the Assistant General
Manager of Rail Operations for final signature approval. A review schedule is followed to ensure
proposals are evaluated in a timely manner. The Executive Safety and Security Committee meets
monthly to address proposals and other light rail safety and security issues.
Documentation is accomplished by tracking the system change form and keeping a log of
proposed changes with notes and final action disposition. The change is then recorded against the
asset in the official system of record capturing asset registry attributes that were changed. The
scope of this section applies to the light rail system.
Management of Change/Configuration management is managed in a similar fashion for all other
Divisions of RTD. Authority to make configuration changes lies with the Infrastructure Change
Review Committee with the consensus of the Executive Safety and Security Committee. The
process for making configuration changes is controlled by the Executive Safety and Security
Committee. Specific members of the Executive Safety and Security Committee participate in the
design review and acceptance of modifications, new equipment and facilities, and system
expansion. In managing this process through the Executive Safety and Security Committee, all
departments are assured the opportunity to review and provide input. Design is further controlled
by RTD’s Light Rail Design Criteria. Any deviation from the design criteria must be approved by
the Executive Safety and Security Committee. The formal safety certification process is applied
to system expansions and new systems. Refer to safety certification section for additional
information.

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modifications Hazard

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are included in the hazard management
program process as described in sections 3.3.2, 3.3.3, and 3.3.4. This process is administered by
the Safety and Environmental Division and performed jointly by the Engineering Division, the
Bus Operations Division, the Light Rail Operations Division, and the Safety and Environmental
Division. New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are ultimately reviewed,
approved, and documented by the Executive Safety and Security Committee.

III 1.5.2

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification Review

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are reviewed and approved by the
Engineering Division, the Bus Operations Division, the Light Rail Operations Division, and the
Safety and Environmental Division. This review is conducted to assure that new equipment,
expansions, and modifications safely and operationally integrate into the existing system.

III 1.5.3
Acceptance

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification

Operational readiness of new equipment and system expansions is verified through the equipment
acceptance and safety and security certification process. The Light Rail Operations Division
performs rigorous equipment and integration testing as part of the Vehicle and Equipment
Acceptance process. Once complete, new vehicles and equipment are formally accepted by the
Light Rail Operations Division. This information is presented and approved by the Safety
Certification Program and described in section 3.3.13. The Safety and Security Certification
Program provides an identification, design, review and verification process for system expansions
and modifications. Certification process completion is verified by sign-off from the Chairman of
the Executive Safety and Security Committee.

III 1.5.4

Exceptions to Established Design Criteria

Level 4 and above exceptions to RTD’s Design Criteria are approved only by the acceptance of
the Executive Safety and Security Committee. If appropriate, the Design Criteria may be
amended or modified to accommodate acceptable modifications. The Assistant General Manager
of Capital Programs is responsible for the maintenance and distribution of the light rail design
criteria.

III 1.5.5

Procurement Procedures

Procurement of equipment and materials is controlled by RTD’s Procurement Standards Manual.
Each procurement requires the development of detailed specifications assembled by the
requesting manager. Levels of review are built into the procurement process depending upon the
scope of the procurement. As the scope of the procurement increases, so does the level of review.
Minor procurements require authorization from the Contracts and Procurement division and the
Division Manager of the requesting division. Major procurements such as light rail or bus
construction related projects or procurement of buses or light rail vehicles, are subject to the
following review process. The Engineering Division and Technical Support Staff develop

detailed specifications through the design process. These specifications are subject to several
internal reviews at varying levels of design, peer reviews by personnel from other transit
agencies, and ultimate approval by the Executive Safety and Security Committee. In addition to
procurement specifications, the Safety and Security Certification Review Process described in
Section 3.3.13 governs light rail construction. This procurement procedure in combination with
the system modification procedure, established design criteria, and hazard communication
program precludes the introduction of unauthorized hazardous materials and supplies as well as
defective or deficient equipment into the District’s Transit Systems.

III 2 Management of Change
Management of Change/Configuration control within RTD will be managed through the
Infrastructure Change Review (ICR) process during design and construction. The ICR process is
managed for RTD by Capital Programs and Facilities. The MOC process is managed by the
Executive Safety and Security Committee (ESSC) chaired by the chief safety officer.
Management of Change/Configuration management within RTD consists of the ICR process
during design and construction, and the management of change (MOC) process during operations,
in coordination with the ESSC.
The ICR process is managed for RTD by Capital Programs Department, and coordinates new
systems or extensions before they are implemented in the existing operating environment. Project
managers use the Project Management Plan (PMP) to guide capital projects. In addition to the
Project Management Plan (PMP) the Project Control Specialist will implement guidance from the
Project Control User Manual. This manual is updated periodically and contains direction for as
built and document control procedures. Specific guidance for document control procedures, File
Creation (4.2), File codes, is provided in the Project Control User Manual Section 4.0. Smaller
projects may include an abbreviated PMP specific to the project.
Representatives from each involved department and safety are represented in the ICR process.
Project changes to existing structures or facilities is critical that effected RTD personnel, public,
or other affected groups be notified of the change which might have potential safety or security
impacts. Affected personnel are invited to participate in project meetings and coordinate any
changes. Additional training may be required. Operations and maintenance procedures, bulletins
or SOP’s may need to be developed. General public may be affected. The Public Relations
Department personnel assist with communications to outside agencies or effected groups. There
is an essential element of communications that must take place after the project is completed and
being used. Any observed negative or hazardous impacts of a change must be reported to
management personnel as soon as possible.

III 2.1 Safety and Security Certification
System Safety personnel develop and implement Safety and Security Certification Programs to
assure that safety and security concerns and hazards are addressed prior to the initiation of rail
passenger operations for new corridors, system extensions, rehabilitation, modification or
replacement of equipment. RTD utilizes the FTA Handbook for Transit Safety and Security
Certification to develop the requirements for each safety and security certification program. An
individual safety and security certification plan is developed for each new corridor. For minor
extensions or projects, safety and security certification is addressed through the preparation of
safety and security certification forms applicable to the scope of work. Modifications are
managed through the light rail change/modification process. Regarding new equipment, if it is
procured as part of a new maintenance facility, the equipment is included in the certification
program for the facility. Rail vehicles undergo a formalized acceptance program under the
supervision of rail operations. The Safety and Security Certification Program has the following

Attachment: 2021 RTD PTASP Final (4334 : Approval of 2021 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.B.2.b

81
Packet Pg. 284

goals: verify that acceptable safety and security levels are met or exceeded; document the
verification of safety and security standards; and provide consistency for project certification.
With these goals in mind, the objectives of the Program can be more narrowly defined.
Objectives of the Program include: identify and verify safety and security requirements of the
system design; identify and verify safety and security requirements for construction and system
equipment installation; identify and verify safety and security requirements are met or exceeded
for system testing; and identify and verify safety and security requirements are met for changes or
modifications to standard operating procedures, training manuals, rule book, and system
elements. Under the direction of the RTD Chief Safety Officer, Assistant General Manager of
Safety, Security and Asset Management, the Senior Manager of Safety and Environmental and
the System Safety and Security Manager are responsible for the management of the Program. The
Executive Safety and Security Committee, chaired by the Assistant General Manager of Safety,
Security and Asset Management, oversee the process, in coordination with the ICR.

III 2.2 Quality Assurance
Capital projects at RTD have a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) function built into the
design and construction of the project. Specific personnel are responsible for QA/QC activities. In
general, QA/QC activities in large projects follow standard industry practice and are subject to
review by the FTA and others. Quality control during construction projects is a requirement of the
contractor, and submitted in his quality plan prior to initiation of construction. RTD retains
qualified inspectors and testing firms to provide Quality Assurance by document submittal
reviews and periodic testing of materials throughout the project.
Received goods are required to be compared to items ordered, lot numbering or other
certifications as required on safety critical items. Where applicable, receiving personnel assure
that lot number documentation is provided before materials are received or accepted. Periodically,
purchasing personnel or transit safety specialists will randomly sample hardware, slings, lifting
devices, and other devices for compliance with specifications. Items will also be periodically
functionally tested to assure they meet standards.

III 3 Rules Compliance
III 3.1 Reports and Data Analysis
The results of the operational tests are compiled and reviewed quarterly by the Manager of Rail
Operations or a designated supervisor(s) and the Safety Manager. A written form of the
discussion and review will be provided to the Safety Department within 30 days after the end of
the quarter. An annual report is completed by a designated supervisor(s) summarizing the
previous year’s results of the operational tests. The annual report is turned over to the Safety
Department for further review and trend analysis. See SOP 109.23 Operational Rule Compliance
Testing.

III 3.1.1

Enforcement Violations

Rule violations are addressed through the corporate positive people management process (PPM)
which includes: coaching, retraining, and, formal discipline (performance agreement and
termination) that may result in termination. See RTD Corporate Policy 6.3.1. Rail operations
maintains a log for all stop indications and wrong route violations, and may further investigate
any rules violation that is reported, or that may be part of an accident or incident. Additionally, all
accidents and incidents are reviewed by supervisors and the safety administrator to determine if
rules have been violated, or if revisions, changes, or additions are necessary.

III 3.1.2

Hazard Management

The transit safety specialist may incorporate violation trends or deficiencies for any rule or
procedure into the hazard management program for resolution. Hazards unresolved by the Rail
Safety Committee (RSC) or the Bus Safety Committees (BSC)are directed to the SSRC
committee for further tracking, review, resolution, and or correction. Non-compliant review
findings determined to be hazardous are documented in the hazard log. A date of observation,
description of the hazardous condition, corrective action required, and implementation date are
tracked until the hazardous condition is corrected. See the Hazard Management Program portion
of the PTASP for further information. The Safety Team conducts ongoing and regular
observations and reviews to determine the effectiveness of the rule compliance program.

III 3.2 Standard Operating Procedures and Employee Rule Book
Adopted Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and the Employee Rule Books strictly govern
light rail operations and bus operations. The SOP manual is comprehensive with procedures for
every aspect of light rail operation including: administration, communication, operations- normal,
operations-abnormal, safety, and signals/switches. SOPs are reviewed periodically and updated as
necessary according to the following guidelines: prior to revenue service of a system expansion or
new bus route or new corridor; or as recommended by the internal safety review process. A
committee consisting of Controller/Supervisors, Operators, and Transit safety specialists

Packet Pg. 286

1.B.2.b

The Employee Rule Book contains the body of RTD’s light rail operating rules. It has been
designed to meet the following three purposes to ensure the safe operation of the system.
• To identify RTD’s operating practices and standards;
• To aid in the instruction of these practices; and
• To serve employees as a reference manual whenever questions rise on the safest course of
action.
The Rule Book contains the General Manager’s Statement, instructions for use, types of operating
regulations, and the operations policy statement. Rules are segregated by the following
categories: safety rules, general rules, train operating rules, and standard operating procedures.
The Rule Book is printed in a portable format for ease of reference. Similar to the SOPs, the Rule
Book is periodically reviewed and updated as necessary according to the following guidelines:
prior to revenue service of a system expansion or new corridor; prior to opening a new rail
maintenance facility; or as recommended by the internal safety review process.

III 3.3 Emergency and Contingency Planning
The RTD outlines emergency and contingency plans in the Light Rail Emergency Response Plan.
The purpose of this program is to provide direction to RTD and emergency response personnel in
the case of an emergency situation, which adversely affects operations. There is a training
component to familiarize Denver metropolitan area emergency response agency personnel with
safety features and operating characteristics of RTD’s Light Rail Transit system.
Included in the program are brief descriptions of system elements and illustrations that depict
these elements.
The objectives of this program are threefold:
•
•
•

Generate common knowledge among personnel in emergency response agencies, such as
police and fire departments as well as paramedic units, to enhance their interaction with
RTD personnel when required;
Minimize potential danger to passengers during incidents, emergency or otherwise, that
requires response from agencies external to RTD; and
Maximize the effectiveness of responding personnel dealing with emergency situations
by increasing their overall knowledge of unique elements within the respective
communities.

Planning, updates, and drills are discussed in the emergency plans. Documentation of drills is
tracked either through specific files for each drill or the Executive Safety and Security
Committee. The light rail emergency plan is reviewed and updated if necessary according to the
following criteria: following an emergency incident to review and critique operations if requested
by a Fire Life Safety Committee Member, upon change or modification to the light rail system
requiring changes to this plan, upon the request of any Fire Life Safety Committee Member, or at
least annually to review/revise the plan and arrange for periodic drills and possible refresher
training. Emergency drills are documented in the plan.

Emergency response procedures (internal RTD standard operating procedures) are reviewed and
revised as necessary and distributed to RTD personnel accordingly. Additional information
regarding emergency management is included in Section I 6.1.

III 3.4 Standard Operating Procedures and Employee Rule Book
Bus Operations are strictly governed by policies and procedures outlined in the “Trailblazer”.
Standard rules of conduct and procedure are necessary. The rules outlined in this document have
been adopted for the requirements of RTD’s operations and are considered necessary for
rendering a quality level of service to customers. The “Trailblazer” is comprehensive manual with
procedures and guidelines for every aspect of bus operations including: the performance code;
passenger relations and interaction; ADA requirements; personnel practices; operating
procedures; emergency and legal procedures; equipment care and operation; personal appearance;
radio procedures; fares, transfers, and passes; operation procedures; routes maps and diagrams;
maintenance tips; fleet data; and street guides.
Service Planning/Scheduling updates the “Trailblazer” on an as-needed basis. Transportation
bulletins are a common practice that addresses day to day issues.

III 4 Facilities, Structures and Equipment Inspections
RTD's bus and rail facilities and equipment will be inspected on a regular basis according to
company policies and SOPs, equipment manufacturer's guidelines and recommendations, and as
required by local, state, and federal regulations.

III 4.1 Facilities and Equipment to Be Inspected
Operating facilities and equipment routinely inspected and tested by employees, supervisors,
management, and safety and environmental personnel include the following:
• Bus and rail maintenance/support shops/administrative offices, and equipment within the
shops
• Fire system equipment
• Safety eyewash and shower systems
• Floor and portable hoist systems and cranes
• Heating, air conditioning, lighting, and ventilation systems
• Hydraulic presses, grinders, welders, wheel-truing equipment, lathes, etc.
• Hazardous materials handling and storage, etc.
• Locomotives, cab-cars, passenger cars, light rail vehicles, and buses
• Support equipment (i.e. rolling stock) including high-rail vehicles, track maintenance
vehicles, bucket trucks, loaders, forklifts, aerial lifts, etc.
• Infrastructure including rail station platforms, track, switches, OCS, bridges, gradecrossing equipment, etc.

III 4.2 Techniques, Schedules, and Procedures
Preventative maintenance inspection schedules are generated through the computer system per
equipment manufacturer's guidelines and recommendations, and as required by local, state, and
federal regulations. A maintenance supervisor identifies upcoming PM inspections and assigns
the work out to their crew for completion. Inspectors use checklists to identify potential physical
hazards, unsafe equipment, unsafe acts, and policy and procedural deficiencies with the facility or
equipment being inspected. Completed inspection reports and checklists are returned to the
supervisor for review. Each department is responsible for maintaining inspection and repair
records to confirm the inspection process.

III 4.2.1

M.O.W. (Line, Signal and Rail Maintenance) Standards and
procedures

Line and Signal uses a maintenance of way plan “MOW Procedures” that outlines specific testing
and maintenance procedures in accordance with FRA regulations. These are in accordance 49

Tracking and Resolving Hazards Identified During Inspections

The majority of safety hazards and concerns are resolved immediately by employees, and
supervisors, and require no formal tracking process. Safety-critical hazards that cannot receive
immediate attention are forwarded to the appropriate supervision and will be reported to the
safety administrator or safety committee. An observed safety critical hazard that cannot be
corrected in a timely manner will be entered into the hazard log for tracking purposes and
managed by the SSRC committee. A corrective action plan, responsible person, and completion
date will be assigned. Follow-up inspections will verify that the hazard has been resolved.

III 4.4

Railroad Bridge Safety Management and Inspection Program

The railroad Bridge Safety Management Program (BSMP) has been developed and implemented
by RTD to minimize damages and identify and repair deficiencies in bridges carrying RTD
traffic, to safeguard their ability to carry RTD traffic, and to minimize risk of human casualties.

III 5 Safety Management System Inspections and Reviews
The Safety Division conducts periodic inspections and reviews. Maintenance facilities are
inspected monthly to ensure compliance with occupational safety regulations and local fire codes.
Semiannual reviews are conducted in conjunction with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission
to document compliance with established standard operating procedures, maintenance plans and
the Public Transit Agency Safety Plan. Any deviations from required activities or identified
safety hazards are resolved through a formal reporting process. For additional information on
system safety reviews, refer to section 5.3.

III 5.1 Internal Safety Review Process
Internal safety reviews and inspections are critical components of an integrated system safety
program. As such, internal safety reviews of the light rail system are conducted semiannually to
assure compliance with the Public Transit Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) and that the plan is
effectively implemented. Facilities are inspected monthly for occupational safety issues and local
fire codes. The overall light rail and bus systems are reviewed to assure that activities required by
RTD’s operating, maintenance, and PTASP are completed. Written reports of each review are
prepared and distributed to the reviewed parties. The Executive Safety and Security Committee
may also discuss review findings, evaluate the effectiveness of the Public Transit Agency Safety
Plan, recommend corrective action if necessary, and ensure timely implementation and follow up.
An annual internal light rail review report is compiled in January of each year and submitted to
the PUC by February 15 of each year. The report documents the review findings for the year
including the results of the internal reviews performed during the previous year, a summary of
required corrective actions taken, if any, and provision for follow up to ensure timely
implementation and to determine effectiveness of the Safety Management System. The annual
report will be accompanied by a formal letter of certification signed by the General Manager

indicating that the RTD is in compliance with its system safety program plan and system security
plan. If RTD identifies areas of deficiency, the General Manager, by letter, will identify the
activities RTD will take to achieve compliance. Documentation of inspection and reviews are
maintained in the Safety and Environmental Division.
As part of the internal review program, all RTD departments are subject to review under the
direction of the Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management, the Senior
Manager of Safety and Environmental is responsible for and has complete authority to conduct
internal safety reviews. Two reviews are conducted each year. Within a three-year period, all
Safety Management System elements are reviewed for compliance with the plan and state safety
oversight requirements. The sixth review cycle is usually reserved to review the review process to
assure that all elements are completed and that the review program meets the state safety
oversight requirements.
RTD will notify the PUC of an upcoming review cycle at least 30 days prior to the start of the
review. The internal review team consists of representatives from the Safety Unit of RTD. Each
checklist is assigned a lead reviewer for the final development of the checklist and to be the
responsible person to complete the checklist including back up documentation when the review is
complete. When a review element under the administration of the Safety and Environmental
Division is conducted, PUC staff serves as the lead reviewer to assure an independent review
process. Written checklists are developed by the lead reviewer.
An opening conference may be scheduled with the departments subject to review and the review
team. In some cases an opening conference is not required. At the opening conference, the
checklists are distributed and each checklist is discussed and reviewed for accuracy. The review
schedule is then set with the affected departments. The actual review consists of interviews with
key personnel, documentation review, and observation of activities to assess compliance and
understanding of rules, training, and procedures. After completion of the onsite review activities,
the checklists are completed and a written draft report is developed. The draft report may include
recommendations or findings. Recommendations are defined as suggestions to make
improvements, while findings are defined as documented deficiencies in the implementation of
established programs, rules or procedures. The draft report is distributed for review and comment
to the reviewed parties. Reviewed parties have 30 days to respond to the draft report including an
opportunity to correct any findings. A final report is completed and distributed to the reviewed
parties. Recorded findings require the development of a corrective action plan. Each year, the
annual review report prepared and submitted to the PUC, will include an evaluation of the
adequacy and effectiveness of the new Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan.
Recommendation and findings will be tracked in two ways. Recommendations from previous
review cycles will be reviewed and evaluated in subsequent review cycles. Findings will be
tracked under the corrective action plan process of placing all findings on a tracking spreadsheet
and the subsequent quarterly corrective action plan progress reports filed with the PUC.

5.2

Maintenance

Maintenance and service of all vehicles, equipment and facilities is performed by the RTD in
accordance with manufacturer’s manuals, codes, standards and established procedures.
Maintenance is performed at a level of readiness that ensures safe, efficient and reliable mass
transit. RTD maintains data to track scheduled maintenance of vehicles and equipment.

Safety critical equipment that does not meet established requirements is withdrawn from service.
Vehicles or equipment that are involved in an accident are removed from service if there is reason
to suspect equipment failure contributed to the cause of the accident or if a fatality is involved.
Vehicles or equipment are returned to service only after it is determined that there are no defects
that could have contributed to the accident. The light rail maintenance crew has an established
strategic plan to ensure rapid deployment, recovery and return to service in the event of an
emergency.
Effective maintenance is an indispensable prerequisite to safe and efficient light rail and bus
operations. The Maintenance Departments have standards that make safety and reliability the
primary objectives of the system. These goals are met by the incorporation of preventive and
repair maintenance programs for all aspects of the system. These systems include: traction
electrification (substation and overhead wire), signals, trackway, buses, rail vehicles, and support
equipment such as shop equipment, non-revenue vehicles, and facilities (shop, passenger stations,
park-n-rides, right-of-way). The foundation of the rail maintenance documentation material is the
Rail Maintenance Plan. A well-developed plan ensures: 1) a high degree of continuity and
consistency in routine maintenance activities, 2) a structured process for improving the
productivity and efficiency of Rail Maintenance functions, and 3) a fulfillment of FTA’s Section
9 requirements.
The Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance Strategic Plan addresses the following areas: 1) Preventive
maintenance programs will be cost-effective in minimizing service failures. 2) Changes in
preventive maintenance programs may be expected periodically as experience is gained on the
equipment maintained. 3) Preventive maintenance goals and polices will not be altered due to
time constraints or as a cost-reduction measure in times of financial stress. 4) Effective
maintenance procedures require much record keeping and information storage/retrieval. 5) The
technical sophistication of the LRV, the tracking of a large, expensive inventory and the scale of
the physical plant, place a heavy responsibility on the information capabilities of the Rail
Maintenance Department.
The Bus Fleet Maintenance Plan addresses the following areas:
1. Maintenance Division Goals and Objectives
2. RTD Contingency Bus Fleet
3. Maintenance Management System
4. Preventative Maintenance Program
5. Wheelchair Lift Preventative Maintenance Program
6. Quality Control Program
7. New Bus Inspection Procedure
8. Maintenance Bulletins
9. Standard Operating Procedures
The maintenance philosophy for RTD is to incorporate a mix of in-house and contracted
maintenance activities so that the system is safely and efficiently maintained. This type of
philosophy has successfully been implemented in other transit properties. The maintenance

III 6 Drug and Alcohol Program and Medical Monitoring
6.1

Drug and Alcohol Program

The RTD maintains an employee drug and alcohol program in compliance with U.S. Department
of Transportation and Federal Transit Administration regulations and to ensure the safe operation
and maintenance of systems and equipment. The program includes criteria for random testing of
safety sensitive personnel and testing for cause either accident related or from observed behavior.
The RTD Finance and Administration Department manages this program. The program is subject
to frequent review by the FTA. To date, the program has been found exemplary by the FTA.
Drug and alcohol testing and information about drug and alcohol abuse is included in RTD’s
Drug and Alcohol Policy. The program is administered by RTD’s Drug and Alcohol Coordinator
which includes verification of compliance with the program and training. Training is given to all
employees during orientation training. Revisions to the program are distributed to all employees.
If necessary, follow-up training is provided.
Compliance and knowledge of the program is accomplished through direct supervision of
employees and refresher training if necessary.
GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT
The Regional Transportation District is dedicated to providing safe, dependable, and economical
transportation services to the public, and to providing a healthy, safe and satisfying work
environment for our employees. RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union, Division 1001, agree
that employees of the system must be able to work in a drug and alcohol-free work environment.
At the same time, every effort must be made to protect the rights and respect the privacy of all
employees. The employer has the right and duty to protect its employees, passengers and the
public from the adverse effects of drug and alcohol abuse. It is not the intent of the employer to
restrict the employees' off-the-job conduct.
A successful drug and alcohol program must address the safety implications of drug and alcohol
abuse, and must also institute proper procedures and controls guaranteeing accurate alcohol and
drug testing results, while preserving confidentiality and focusing on rehabilitation through an
effective employee assistance program.
It is the responsibility of all employees to report to work free of alcohol and controlled
substances. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect and respect employees' rights
and privacy.
To meet these goals and comply with legal requirements, RTD has implement this policy to
1. Detect drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through testing;
2. Encourage employees to obtain treatment and rehabilitation for drug and alcohol
problems;

Attachment: 2021 RTD PTASP Final (4334 : Approval of 2021 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.B.2.b

92
Packet Pg. 295

3. Deter drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through education, training, and
discipline; and
4. Enforce RTD’s goal of a drug- and alcohol-free work environment through appropriate
discipline.
Drug and alcohol abuse can have profound effects on the health, work, and personal life not only
of the abuser but also the abuser’s family, friends, and the public at large. Employees should be
aware of the signs and symptoms of drug or alcohol problems, and of available methods of
intervening when a substance abuse problem is suspected.
This policy was originally adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on October 18, 1994 and
subsequent modifications were adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on September 1998, July
2000, May 2003, July 2011, and March 2013. Many elements of this policy are required by
federal regulations covering persons in safety-sensitive job classifications. Other elements of this
policy are not required by federal regulations but are official RTD policy.
Employees wishing to review federal regulations on drug and alcohol use may contact RTD’s
Drug and Alcohol Program Coordinator.
This policy supersedes all other RTD drug, alcohol or substance abuse policies. To the extent that
any elements of this policy may conflict with federal or state regulations as they may be amended
or revised in the future, the regulations shall control. Employees are expected to review, be
familiar with, and obey this policy and all laws concerning drug and alcohol use and testing. All
existing and new RTD employees must receive at least 60 minutes of training on the effects and
consequences of prohibited drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment, and
the signs and symptoms which may indicate prohibited drug use.
Compliance with this policy, including participation in RTD’s drug and alcohol testing program,
is a required condition of employment.

III 6.2

APPLICABILITY
III 6.2.1

Categories of Employees

This policy applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive RTD employees, volunteers,
and contractors. For ease of reference, all of the above persons are referred to in this policy as
"employees" unless otherwise noted. This policy applies to all employees while on the property
of RTD to perform RTD duty or while performing any RTD-related business. Visitors and
vendors are expected to adhere to this policy while on RTD property.
In addition to being subject to all other elements of this policy, employees who perform "safety
sensitive functions" for RTD, as that term is defined in federal regulations 49 CFR Parts 40 as
amended and Part 655, are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other special
requirements set forth in this policy. Generally, a safety-sensitive function occurs when an
employee is performing, ready to perform or immediately available to perform any duty related to
the safe operation of public transportation.

Attachment: 2021 RTD PTASP Final (4334 : Approval of 2021 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.B.2.b

The following are safety-sensitive functions:
• Operation of a revenue service vehicle, whether or not such vehicle is in revenue service.
• Controlling dispatch or movement of a revenue service vehicle.

Maintaining revenue service vehicles or equipment used in revenue service.
Operating a non-revenue service vehicle when required to be operated by a holder of a
CDL.
Carrying a firearm for security purposes.
Supervising, where the supervisor performs any function listed in items above.

RTD has reviewed the actual duties performed by employees in all job classifications to
determine which employees perform safety-sensitive functions, and has determined which job
functions may require the performance of safety-sensitive corporate policies.

III 6.3

Employee Safety Training, Certification, Verification and
Performance Testing

RTD employees receive formal training and certification for the work they perform according to
job classification. The categories of safety-related work requiring training and certification are
rail and bus operators, and rail and bus maintainers. The specific programs are discussed below.
However, each training and certification program contains classroom and hands-on training, and
written exams. Certification documentation, including tests and test scores, are maintained in
employee files and are subject to review during the RTD internal safety review program.
Except for the RTD on-track safety training program required of contractors working on or near
RTD rail property, RTD does not train or certify contractors or employees of contractors. The ontrack safety training program is required of contractors prior to issuance of an access permit to
work near or on RTD rail property. The program is usually instructed in a train-the-trainer format
allowing contractors to train their own personnel. Compliance with this program is verified
through in-field observation and examination of contractor’s training cards. The Safety and
Environmental Division maintains a log of all contractors trained under the program.
Regarding performance testing, any operating or maintenance rule is subject to verification and
compliance. Compliance with rules, training and certification requirements is verified in several
ways. Rail and bus operators are frequently observed in the field by supervisors and safety unit
personnel. If supervisors observe an issue, they discuss it with the operator as soon as practical. In
addition to this on-going monitoring and observation, rail and bus operators are subject to formal
ride checks in which supervisors, usually anonymously or covertly, observe bus and rail operators
according to a predetermined criteria or check list. These ride checks are documented, reviewed
with the operator and maintained in the operator’s employee file. These records are subject to
verification during the RTD internal safety review process. If a trend or issue is discovered during
system monitoring, observation and ride checks, they are reported to the RTD Executive Safety
and Security Committee for inclusion into the RTD hazard management program.
Bus, rail and facility maintainers also receive direct supervision including observation and
verification of their maintenance activities. Each piece of work that is assigned to a maintainer is
reviewed and approved for correctness by their immediate supervisor through the work order
process. When a maintainer completes their work assignment, their direct supervisor verifies and
approves the work through observation and signature approval on the work order. In late 2007,
this process was automated in the new enterprise system. The maintainer will enter in the system
that the work is complete, the direct supervisor will verify and approve the work, and then accept
that the work was properly completed in the enterprise system. Maintenance activities are also
observed during the RTD internal safety review process. Supervision is also assessed during the

Attachment: 2021 RTD PTASP Final (4334 : Approval of 2021 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.B.2.b

Packet Pg. 297

RTD internal safety review program by the review of documentation and compliance with
schedules. If issues are discovered, they are reported as recommendations or findings in the
review report. Review findings are referred to the Senior Manager of Safety and Environmental
for inclusion in RTD’s hazard management program.

III 6.3.1

Operator Certification

LRV Operators must complete a course on RTD Light Rail Rules and Standard Operating
Procedures before being certified. Written tests, alignment map tests, and practical examination
are administered and must be passed with a minimum correct score of eighty percent. Four of the
six weeks are spent in the LRV in actual operation with a training Supervisor.

III 6.3.2

Operator Annual Re-Certification

Annual re-certification is required of all LRV Operators and Controller/Supervisors.
Controller/Supervisors complete this annual training as they are required to maintain their
operator certification. Re-certification consists of the following: one day review of SOPs, rules
and alignment; review of operators’ performance file including accidents, incidents, near misses
and attendance; LRV ride check with operator; and a written test covering SOPs, rules, and
alignment map. Re- certification requires a score of at least eighty percent.

III 6.3.3

Maintenance Certification

Maintenance personnel including electromotive mechanics, general repair mechanics, track
maintainers, and signal and power maintainers receive classroom and hands-on training
resembling a one-year apprenticeship program. At the end of one year, demonstrating passing
scores on a written exam and hands-on practical exam certifies maintenance personnel.

III 6.3.4

Maintenance Annual Re-certification

Every maintenance employee has an opportunity to receive up to forty hours of annual refresher
training relating to their responsibilities. Re-certification occurs every two years. Maintenance
personnel must again demonstrate passing scores on a written exam and a hands-on practical
exam.

III 6.3.5

Bus Operator Training

Bus operators must complete an Eight-week class, (7 weeks training and one week “conversion”)
Conversion week the Operator drives on his/her own however reports back daily to training for
support. This class covers RTD rules and standard operating procedures before entering service.
A series of ten written tests are given throughout each class session. The certification consists of
hands-on and classroom instruction. After the first two days of instruction, all class participants
spend time on the bus daily. Prior to entering service, operators must pass a final examination
with a minimum correct score of seventy-five percent. Operators must also obtain a CDL.

specific training classes. The training includes the Rail System Safety Course presented by the
Transportation Safety Institute and other courses covering occupational safety.
Personnel outside the safety unit may receive the Rail System Safety Course and attend APTA
seminars. System safety personnel conduct in-house training for RTD personnel regarding safety
certification, hazard analysis, and construction safety.

III 6.4

Procurement

Procurement of equipment and materials is controlled by RTD’s Procurement Standards Manual.
Each procurement requires the development of detailed specifications assembled by the
requesting manager. Levels of review are built into the procurement process depending upon the
scope of the procurement. As the scope of the procurement increases, so does the level of review.
Minor procurements require authorization from the Contracts and Procurement Division and the

SMS Implementation Activities and Responsibilities

IV 1.1

SMS Committees and Position Responsibilities

RTD implements the SMS through Leadership and line management and also utilizes a series of
committees and department positions who have responsibility for specific areas, yet work in a
coordinated manner to ensure the safety management systems are in place and providing the
results desired. As related in section 3.2, safety is a key responsibility of all managers at RTD.
All employees have the right to present safety concerns to their immediate supervisor, manager,
or transit safety specialists. Any employee, supervisor, or manager that brings an incident,
accident, safety concern, or hazard, in good faith will not be adversely affected, or be subjected to
harassment or intimidation. These retaliations are not tolerated by RTD.

IV 1.2

SMS Committees

RTD implements the SMS through Leadership and line management and also utilizes a series of
committees coordinating bus and rail operation and maintenance services. Concerns, if not
resolved by the manager or supervisor, will be referred to and addressed by the respective safety
committee. The following hierarchy of committees at RTD are established to address all safety
issues.

IV 1.2.1
(ESSC)

General Managers Executive Safety and Security Committee

The ESSC is RTD's highest level safety committee, chaired by the General Manager. The
committee is alternately chaired by the Chief Safety Officer. The ESSC is comprised of members
of the RTD corporate staff, which includes representation from the executive level, and the rail,
and bus, and facilities business unit general managers, and the Safety, Security, and Asset
Management Department.

1.B.2.b

The ESSC committee meets monthly to review reports on safety, accident trends, major
accidents, urgent/safety critical concerns or hazards, internal/external review findings,
certification recommendations, items referred from the SSRC, and other items of concern to the
ESSC for comment, direction, resolution, and execution. Minutes are maintained and
disseminated to members of the committee.

IV 1.2.3
Management of Change/Infrastructure Change Review
(MOC/ICR) Teams or Committees
Management of Change/Configuration control within RTD will be managed through the
Infrastructure Change Review (ICR) process during design and construction. The ICR process is
managed for RTD by Capital Development. The MOC process is managed by the Executive
Safety and Security Committee (ESSC) chaired by the chief safety officer. Management of
Change/Configuration management within RTD consists of the ICR process during design and
construction, and the management of change (MOC) process during operations, in coordination
with the ESSC.
.
MOC process applies to existing bus and rail services systems, vehicles, facilities, and equipment
that may not require formal safety certification but which may have safety impacts.

IV 1.2.4

Bus Safety Committee (BSC)

The bus safety committees coordinate on-going safety efforts within the Transportation,
Facilities, and Maintenance departments of the bus system. They meet monthly to update and
mitigate hazards within their facilities, and on their Systems. Committees are formed for the
District Shops, Platte and Treasury, East Metro, and Boulder Divisions. The BSC committees are
chaired by the Safety Division’s delegate, usually a Transit safety specialist. The committees
consist of up to any manager within the Division, and an employee(s) from the following areas:
bus operators, bus maintenance workers, facilities maintenance workers (to include Service and
Cleaning), Health and Wellness, RTD Security, and any other unique area (i.e. – Treasury). The
union (ATU) appoints bargaining unit employees to the BSC as needed to serve as safety
representatives from the ranks of each department.
Committee members are granted an opportunity to speak, and to present safety issues to the BSC
committee through an open communication process. Minutes will be maintained and distributed
to the members of the BSC, the Transportation Managers, and posted to the local Safety Board in
the division, and be made available to others.
The BSC minutes will contain an open item log listing issues brought forward at BSC meetings,
submitted through the Hazard Management System, and the Safety Suggestion Boxes posted at
each Division. The log will include the month/year the item was brought forward to the
committee, an initial hazard rating (Risk Assessment Code), and the estimated month/year the
corrective action will be complete. There will also be a log of closed/completed items, as well as
informational items for RTD employees. This log will be posted at each Division for all

not resolved in the BSC, or safety critical hazards, are referred to the SSRC.
BSC actions will include the following:
• Reviews facility and operations system safety issues identified by members, staff,
reviews, or inspections
• Assigns responsibility for correcting hazards
• Reviews open items for completion
• Ensure safety and regulatory rule compliance (FTA, PUC)

IV 1.2.5

Rail Safety Committee (RSC)

The rail safety committees (RSC) coordinate on-going safety efforts within the operations and
maintenance services of the rail system. They meet monthly to update and mitigate hazards in
their facilities and on their systems. A committee is formed for light rail. The committees consist
of the Operations manager, two representatives (one Union rep, one admin rep) from operations,
LRV maintenance , Facility Maintenance, Maintenance of Way and the transit safety specialistrail, who serves as a technical advisor and Chair to the committee. The corresponding
maintenance facilities (Elati, Rio Court, and Mariposa) are represented respectively on their RSC.
The union appoints bargaining unit employees to the RSC annually to serve as safety
representatives from the ranks of each department, voicing safety concerns to the RSC.
Committee members are granted an opportunity to speak, and to present safety issues to the RSC
committee through an open communication process. Minutes of discussion and action will be
maintained and distributed to the members of the RSC, and be available to others.
The RSC will maintain a local hazard log listing issues, corrective actions, and close-out dates.
The log will include the date entered and the responsible party to correct the action. Most safety
issues will be resolved within the parameters of the RSC. Issues not resolved in the RSC, or
safety critical hazards, are referred to the SSRC.
RSC actions are similar to those listed under the BSC above. Additionally, the RSC examines
compliance with General Code of Operating Rules (GCOR), (FRA 49 CFR Part 214, 49 CFR
200-399; FTA 49 CFR 659).

IV 1.2.6

Fire and Life Safety Committee (FLSC) (Projects Only)

The Fire and Life Safety and Committee serves as a liaison between project safety and local
police, fire and emergency response agencies. The FLSSC is chaired by the System Safety
Engineer. Members include local police, fire, and EMS staff, and RTD's public safety, bus
operations, and rail supervisors.
The FLSC coordinates inspections and drills to verify the fire life safety and security emergency
response, and familiarization and compliance in the system. Drills are initiated during the
activation phase, and continue during revenue operations, per federal requirement, to maintain an

/ (FAC)

Activation Committee (AC) / Rail (RAC) / Bus (BAC) / Facility

The Activation Committee is a working committee of managers that meets regularly, combining
safety and security verification process functions into RTD's construction, systems integration,
and testing phases of new rail projects. The RAC is made up of an activation manager (RAM) and
one manager from each of the following four supporting disciplines: Safety, Civil, Systems and
Operations.
RTD has instituted the use of the Activation Committee and the Hold Point process to bring on
new bus and facility projects. The membership of the committee may change slightly to best fit
the role of the RAC, BAC or FAC. The remainder of this section describes the Rail project
process, but is readily adaptable to a bus or facility project.
Each discipline manager will be responsible for ensuring all certified items lists (CILs),
procedures, tests, filing of documents, and any other assigned activities for his/her group are
completed in accordance with applicable parts of the rail activation plan (RAP). Three of the four
discipline managers, identified above, will each be assigned coordination responsibilities for one
of the three rail activation primary functions-safety and security certification, system integration
testing, and rail services. The RAC will oversee and approve all rail activation documents and
activities.
The RAM, with help from the RAC, will ensure that the project follows the rail activation
process, that all documents are properly completed and filed correctly, and that all necessary
safety and security certifications are properly completed and signed before the project enters
revenue service.

The RAC will meet regularly to develop and finalize details of the RAP specific to the project,
and then manage rail activation activities against the plan. They will also discuss progress, issues,
and concerns in regard to activation activities and requirements. Meeting minutes will be
recorded and filed each time the committee meets. An action items list will be included with the
minutes, and will be updated and discussed each time the committee meets to ensure
responsibility and completion of items deemed critical to successful rail activation. The
committee will create, maintain, and adhere to a rail activation-specific schedule, which will help
to ensure completion of activation and start-up activities prior to scheduled revenue service dates.
Following commencement of revenue operations, the RAC provides "lessons learned" input to
planning and design teams, and for improved processes for the next activation.

IV 1.2.9

Safety and Security Working Group (SSWG)

The Safety and Security Working Group (SSWG) is established by the Project Manager (PM) for
each project that significantly changes the interaction of employees or patrons with the RTD
system. The SSWG examines the design and specifications of safety and security critical systems
on the project. The SSWG is chaired by the PM, project director, or a designee. Primary
responsibilities of the SSWG are to establish the preliminary hazard analysis, focus on and
mitigate hazards on the project, and coordinate the project safety elements through design,
construction and activation. The threat and vulnerability assessment (TVA), if conducted, is also
coordinated by the SSWG.
The SSWG begins during the design phase and conducts regular review meetings, separate from
ongoing design efforts, to focus specifically on safety issues. The project manager ensures that
safety considerations are continually considered during regular design reviews. Design
modifications that are recommended to be incorporated into the RTD design criteria are referred
to the Capital Development civil design manager for review at the design and construction
meeting (DCM). Modifications are then forwarded to the Configuration Control Committee
(CCC) for approval if the modifications are significant enough.

to the remediation of specific hazards. To this end, it is best for the SSWG to be included in the
scope phase of the project plan.
The SSWG defines the job specific CILS and creates and maintains the PHA. If the SSWG
determines that the residual risk of a hazard cannot be reduced below Medium, then the SSWG
presents its findings to the SSRC for final risk analysis.

The training will include:
•
Safety Management Systems Overview
•
Safety Reporting
•
Risk Management
•
Safety Assurance Practices
•
Employee Roles and Responsibilities
RTD employees and contractor personnel, whether construction or service contractors, are

as well as local, state, and federal safety regulations. Service contractors who perform specific
jobs under contract are required to be in compliance with specific safety or environmental laws
that are or may be affected by their work.
RTD has developed the RTD FasTracks Construction Safety Guidelines for Light Rail Transit
that governs contractor safety specifically for contracted construction workers for RTD. This
manual outlines procedures and responsibilities of RTD project managers and contractor
personnel who contract with RTD to perform construction work activities. Additionally, the RTD
safety goal is to achieve accident-free construction projects.
The RTD FasTracks Construction Safety Guidelines for Light Rail Transit reflect minimal
standards. All general contractors, contractors, and their sub-tiers will be expected to meet or
exceed the standards and good safe practices outlined in the manual and their own safety
program, whichever is more stringent.
The RTD grants and contract administrator will review and implement into contract language
requirements for the contract employees to meet. These contracts are written and reviewed by
RTD's Office of General Counsel and Safety and Environmental Divisions, as well as the contract
administrator to assure that specific safety and environmental requirements for contract
employees are met.

IV 2.3

Work-Required Training for Employees and Contractors

RTD is a public employer within the State of Colorado. As such, RTD is not subject to
enforcement under Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). However, it is the
District’s policy to voluntarily comply with OSHA regulations. To that end, the Safety Division
develops safety policies and procedures for occupational safety in compliance with OSHA
guidelines. Regular training sessions are conducted with affected employees based on job hazard
analysis. Annual refresher training is conducted for high hazard areas such as confined spaces and
lockout/tagout (LOTO). Safety staff conducts training. In addition to safety policies, the
environmental unit develops policies for environmental compliance. All RTD employees and
contractor personnel who foul or have the potential to foul the tracks (within 10' of centerline of
track), must receive the OTST prior to beginning their work. Contractors are responsible to train
their employees on OSHA-Required training prior to performing RTD projects. Other related
training that contract employees and RTD employees will be current on includes the following:
•
Hazard communication
•
Blood-borne pathogen awareness
•
Hazardous energy control (LOTO)

These specific work positions, whether they are held by RTD employees or contractors
functioning for RTD Rail Services, may be regulated by 49 CFR 228. Other FRA regulatory
requirements, including the following, must be met by employees and contract personnel as it is
required by their function.
•
Maintaining and accessing employee and contractor training records
•
Compliance with training and certification requirements
Employees and contractors, who are under a legal contract with RTD, are obligated to comply
with specific safety and environmental requirements and demonstrate quality of workmanship by
observation and records reviews. Employees and/or contract employees will meet the training,
inspections, testing, and maintenance specifications as outlined in 49 CFR, as it relates to
commuter rail vehicle maintenance and personnel training. RTD supervisors, managers, and
transit safety specialists are authorized to make regular observations of work being performed,
and will determine whether or not safety and environmental requirements are being complied
with. The quality of materials and construction processes will also be reviewed by designated
quality assurance personnel. Training courses given to employees and contractors will require
that tests be completed prior to the completion of coursework. These will be the primary methods
used to assure that compliance is obtained.
RTD will identify the tasks related to the inspection, testing, and maintenance required by Part
238 that must be performed on each type of equipment that RTD LRV operates.

Contractor Safety Coordination and Construction Safety

Except for the RTD on-track safety training program required of contractors working on or near
RTD rail property, RTD does not train or certify contractors or employees of contractors. The
On-Track Safety Training (OTST) program is required of contractors prior to issuance of an
access permit to work near or on RTD rail property. The program is usually instructed in a trainthe-trainer format allowing contractors to train their own personnel. Compliance with this
program is verified through in-field observation and examination of contractor’s training cards.
The Safety and Environmental Division maintains a log of all contractors trained under the
program.
All contractor work on or near RTD rail property is controlled by access permits. Prior to issuing
an access permit, the contractor is required to meet with RTD staff to describe and coordinate
their work. After this initial coordination, the contractor applies for a permit which is reviewed
and approved by light rail maintenance-of-way, light rail transportation and safety prior to
signature issue by light rail control. The contractor is bound to the requirements of the permit. All
contractors contracted with RTD are also bound by contract specifications for the work they are
to perform.
The Safety and Environmental Division has developed two documents for the management of
construction safety; the Construction Safety Guidelines, and the Safety and Security Certification
Plan. The Construction Safety Guidelines presents the requirements for RTD construction
projects and follows the OSHA construction requirements and regulations. Contractors are
required to follow OSHA construction safety requirements and requirements of RTD contract
specifications and access permits.
RTD safety officers conduct construction safety oversight to monitor contractor work place safety
and conformance to OSHA standards. Oversight includes contractor safety orientation prior to
project commencement, field monitoring, and site safety inspections. Periodic safety meetings are
conducted between RTD and contractors to ensure safe project construction.
The Safety and Security Certification Plan describes the process for project and construction
verification. The Plan contains design and procurement specifications, field inspection
documentation, equipment testing requirements, and integrated testing procedures.

IV 2.5

Construction Safety Requirements

The construction safety program is developed and managed by RTD transit safety specialists.
This program defines construction safety functions and responsibilities and other construction
safety requirements such as safety equipment, documentation, and safety personnel. All
contractors and RTD employees must comply with Occupation Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) rules and the requirements of the construction safety program, RTD Rail Services rule
books, SOPs, and individual company contract agreements with RTD.
Contractors who have personnel working around rail systems may be regulated by 49 CFR Part
214, the Roadway Worker Protection Act. Responsive to that requirement, RTD has established a
training and certification class for rail roadway workers (OTST). All construction and RTD

Construction Safety

Construction safety is administered in accordance with contract specifications, and applicable
Federal, State and local safety requirements. The RTD System Safety Engineer has primary
responsibility for safety oversight of construction projects. The program is based on, and
complies with applicable federal, state, and local safety codes and regulations. Procedures have
been established for the control of operating hazards, including but not limited to chemicals,
noise, cut and abrasion injuries, strain, and sprain injuries. Contractors are required to comply
with these requirements for the safety of their own employees as well as to safeguard RTD
employees, contractors, passengers and the public.
Engineering and Project Management approves the contractor's safety program plan and
supporting documentation, with the concurrence of the Safety Division. Particular emphasis is
placed on work that may affect RTD operations, passengers, facilities, and personnel. All
contractors working in the RTD rail rights of way, or interfacing with RTD Rail Operations are
required to attend OTST. This training covers track access, right of way flagging, and operating
procedures. Reviews of the contractors are conducted to assure compliance with Federal and State
Law, and the RTD requirements.

IV 3.3.1

Employee and Contractor Awareness of FRA
Requirements

RTD employees and contractors are required to be aware of and comply with specific FRA
regulations. A specific requirement of Roadway Worker Protection (RWP) (49CFR214) is a
safety requirement that employees and contractors must follow. Employees and contractors who
may foul the tracks or have potential to foul the tracks while performing their work are required
to receive specific Roadway Worker Protection training before they perform roadway work. The
rail control centers have established a Work Permit which must be completed and submitted for
approval prior to working on the tracks. Contractors and employees must receive RWP training
and verify competency through testing. Track Access Coordinator reviews and verifies training
requirements prior to approving work permits. Safety personnel and Rail Supervisory personnel
may remove an employee or contractor from a worksite if he/she demonstrates a lack of
knowledge and understanding of applicable RWP rules and procedures. Contracts require
compliance with specific OSHA regulations and employee safety programs as applicable to the
work being performed. Safety personnel and rail supervisory personally conduct inspections of
contractor worksites to assess contractor employee knowledge of and compliance with regulatory
and contract requirements. Deficiencies are brought to the attention of contractor project
managers for corrective action.

January 2021 Service Change Proposal

Discussion

DISCUSSION
The proposed January 2021 service adjustments reflect a mix of service enhancements, service
reductions and service suspensions in order to maximize ridership within the very limited resources
available to the District as a result of the financial shortfalls resulting from the COVID induced economic
slowdown. The proposals herein include a mix of service adjustments that represent the redeployment of
current resources available under the COVID 19 service plan. Overall, these proposals redirect resources
from services that are underperforming to services that have passenger capacity challenges due to limits
set by social/physical distancing policies that limit capacity on each RTD vehicle to approximately 30%
of pre-COVID capacity. Additionally, these proposals modify service patterns and levels of service on rail
corridors to more effectively match service to ridership demand. With the anticipated depletion of “Cares
Act” funding, the RTD’s ability to fund the operation of additional “follower” service will be sharply
reduced. This necessitates that services that have retained ridership during the pandemic are adequately
resourced to avoid leaving passengers behind due to capacity requirements. COVID induced reductions
in sales and use tax collections preclude returns to higher Pre-COVID service levels and overall ridership
remains less than half of former levels.

As can be seen from the tables and graph above, weekday ridership on local bus service has continued
at levels approximately 45% of pre-COVID levels while ridership on Regional services, Flatiron Flyer
services and light rail services have seen weekday ridership declines of 75%-85%. These ridership
numbers appear to be largely affected by reduced commuter activity and reduced employment center
occupancy. The tables were excerpted from a previous Ridership Restoration report and are provided to
describe changes in system ridership.
It is intended that the service adjustments proposed to the current COVID 19 service plan be adopted
as a distinct change to the initial COVID service plan implemented April 19, 2020, as notable changes
are proposed to both bus and rail services. Leveraging the significant collaborative efforts made by the
Reimagine RTD project, a proposal to optimize RTD Light Rail service patterns are contained herein.
Continued coordination between RTD Systems Planning and Service Development staff has also yielded
alternative service plans and analyses to support proposals that shift resources to route services with
higher utilization from services with very low utilization. It should be noted that many of the routes
proposed for service improvements are routes that serve communities that rely on transit for their travel
needs. These riders often perform essential jobs and have continued to ride during the pandemic. It
should also be noted that alternative services have been considered for services that are proposed for
suspension and are listed in Attachment B of this report.
The guiding principles for proposed routine RTD service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;

Packet Pg. 327

1.C.1

•
•
•
•
•

The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; and also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

However, given the current economic conditions due to the COVID induced economic slowdown, the
overarching guiding principles for the proposed January 2021 service changes come from the Board
adopted Guiding Principles for COVID-19 Budget Reductions, especially Principle number three (3):
“We will prioritize mobility for people who must depend on transit during the pandemic: we will strive to
maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services to
access essential jobs and their necessities, while also keeping our community activity centers
appropriately connected.”

Rail
C/D Lines
Due to low ridership in the late evening, and increased ridership in the morning peak, this
proposal adjusts the weekday service span: 30-minute frequency between 4:00 a.m. –
6:00 a.m., a 15-minute frequency between 6:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m., and a 30-minute
frequency from 10:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. Weekend service span would be operated from
4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. with a 30-minute frequency between 4:00 a.m. – 8:00 a.m., 15minute frequency between 8:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m. and 30-minute frequency between
10:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. Change in service span and frequency will accommodate the
increased passenger loads that are occurring in the morning peak that currently under the
COVID plan on a 30-minute frequency during the weekday, reduction in the overall service
span will allow for a larger maintenance window for MOW to do routine maintenance
(currently an hour, this change will allow for a 3.5 hour maintenance window), and minimize
overtime costs. Scheduled meets will occur all day long, instead of just the late evening
between E and D line southbound at I-25 & Broadway to allow for a more efficient transfer
for passengers coming from Denver Union Station (DUS) going to Mineral. Northbound
passengers will only need to wait for 3 minutes to transfer to the E line to reach DUS.
E/F Lines
This proposal consolidates the E and F lines to run the E line pattern of service to DUS from
RidgeGate. The E line has the highest ridership bi-directional peak commute when compared
to any other light rail line pre-COVID. Due to low ridership in the late evening, and increased
demand in the morning peak, it is proposed that the weekday service span be adjusted to
4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. with a 30-minute frequency between 4:00 a.m. – 6:00 a.m., a 15minute frequency between 6:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m., and a 30-minute frequency from 10:00
p.m. – 11:00 p.m. Weekend service span would also be from 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. with
a 30-minute frequency between 4:00 a.m. – 8:00 a.m., 15-minute frequency between 8:00
a.m. – 10:00 p.m. and 30-minute frequency between 10:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. The effort
in changing service span and frequency will accommodate the increased passenger loads

frequency between 10:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. Change in service span and frequency will
accommodate the increased passenger loads that are occurring in the weekday morning
peak that currently under the COVID plan running on a 30-minute frequency during the
weekday, will also allow for a larger maintenance window for MOW to do routine
maintenance (currently an hour, this change will allow for a 3.5 hour maintenance window),
and reduce overtime costs.
N Line
Minor schedule adjustments anticipated after the September 2020 implementation of this
corridor. No cost impacts are anticipated.
R line
Recommend adopting the Reimagine RTD rail plan by recommending shifting the
southernmost terminal from RidgeGate to Lincoln due to low demand south of Lincoln with
a service span of 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. on a 30-minute frequency for weekday and
weekend. Change in service span will allow for a larger maintenance window for MOW to
do routine maintenance (currently an hour, this change will allow for a 3.5-hour maintenance
window), and minimize overtime costs.
W line
Due to low ridership in the evening and increased capacity demands during the weekday
morning peak, recommend adjusting the service span to be from 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m.
Weekday frequency between Jeffco Government Center to DUS 30-minute frequency
between 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m., and 30-minute frequency between Fed Center to DUS
between 6:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m., creating a combined frequency of 15-minutes between
the Fed Center and DUS to address capacity concerns under the current COVID plan.
Weekend service span would be 30-minute frequency between Jeffco Government Center
to DUS 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m., and 30 minute frequency between Fed Center and DUS
between 8:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m., creating a combined frequency of 15-minutes between
Fed Center and DUS between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Change in service span and

that are occurring in the morning peak. The proposed reduction of the overall service span
will allow for a larger maintenance window for maintenance (currently an hour, this change
will allow for a 3.5 hour maintenance window), and reduce overtime costs. Proposed
adjustments to the schedule would support all-day scheduled meets between E and D line
southbound at I-25 & Broadway to allow for a more efficient transfer for passengers coming
from Central Downtown Denver destined to RidgeGate Parkway. Northbound passengers
will only need to wait for 3-6 minutes at I-25 & Broadway to transfer to the D or H lines to
the Central Downtown area.

Alternative Service Considerations for Suspended Fixed-Routes
January 2021 Proposal

Recognizing that travel patterns will not return to normal as people with the ability to work from home,
the vast majority of Regional passengers, will continue to do so, several options are being considered for
how to more cost-effectively serve these remaining Regional passengers. While passengers need the
mobility currently offered by RTD bus service, continuing to run full-size buses to accommodate a few
passengers is not a cost-effective or efficient use of RTD’s resources. Options being considered include:
vanpools/carpools; ride-hailing, e.g., taxi, Lyft; and RTD FlexRide or Access-a-Ride.
Vanpool service refers to a group of passengers with similar origins and destinations driving together in
a van provided and maintained by the DRCOG waytogo program and partially funded by RTD.
Advantages of this option include:
o Drivers are not paid, thus relatively low cost
o No deadhead, as vehicles remain with the driver
o Capacity in one van sufficient for each bus trip at current ridership, and flexible for additional
passengers
o Convenient trips for passengers — Vehicles would not need to stop at all bus stops along the
route and potential for passenger pickup/drop-off at home or work.
Challenges of this option include:
o One passenger must volunteer as the driver and also a backup driver needed
o Willingness of passengers to share a vehicle under COVID conditions

Regional Routes
During the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic, ridership on Regional bus routes has fared comparatively worse
than other services offered by RTD. Even at reduced service levels, some operating routes are carrying 3
to 5 passengers per trip on routes of 25 to 40 miles in length. These poorly performing Regional routes
are:
CV – Pine Junction/Conifer – Denver
EV – Evergreen – Denver
GS – Golden – Boulder

Each of the routes require 4 vanpools to cover their 4 trips, or $2,268 per month to cover their full cost.
Ride-hailing refers to providing vouchers or subsidies for passengers to travel via a hired mode, likely be
a transportation network company such as Lyft or a taxi.
Advantages of this option include:
o No dedicated fleet of vehicles or employees
1
Packet Pg. 335

1.C.1.b
Attachment B

Can operate only upon passenger request, thus reduce costs relative to a fixed-scheduled bus
when demand is lower (e.g., Friday, holidays)
o Convenient trips for passengers — Vehicles would not need stop at all bus stops along the
route; potential for passenger pickup/drop-off at home or work.
Challenges of this option include:
o Vehicles are typically not ADA accessible. RTD would need to provide Access-a-Ride if requested
by a passenger to keep the service equivalent to present bus service, though this is not required
for Regional service.
o Willingness of passengers to share a vehicle under COVID conditions likely limits usage to one
passenger per vehicle, requiring multiple vehicles for each bus trip, increasing costs
o In ride-hail model the driver is not paid for deadhead time and these routes would likely require
significant deadheading, making them less attractive to drivers and less reliable to passengers.
Could be mitigated through a subscription model.
o If the service proves to be popular and attracts additional passengers, costs can rise significantly
Ride-hailing Cost
Prevailing rates apply and an individual ride is required for each rider. An estimate is $25 for a 25-mile
trip or (probably) more.
RTD FlexRide or Access-a-Ride operated could offer two operating options:
o Operating the full Regional route with smaller, more efficient vehicles
o Operating a truncated route to connect passengers with the RTD system without going all the
way to Downtown Denver. This is similar to a FlexRide as a first and last mile solution, but covers
a much longer distance.
Access-a-Ride currently has capacity to operate additional trips and meets ADA requirements. It could
provide a general public service, acting like a FlexRide anywhere in the metro area. FlexRide typically
operate in small service zones and may not achieve the same efficiencies as operating this kind of
service with Access-a-Ride.
Benefits of operating RTD Access-a-Ride include:
o Lower hourly operating cost
o Potential for less deadhead and service hours and cost by truncating route at a station
o Utilizing available capacity in Access-a-Ride
Challenges of operating RTD Access-a-Rdie include:
o Requires a vehicle and operator provided by RTD
o Passenger willingness to ride in a smaller vehicle with other passengers due to COVID concerns
o Longer travel time passenger trips If route is truncated to connect with RTD system prior to
Downtown Denver
o Truncating Route GS is not a viable option due to already only having potential connections at
its endpoints

In addition to the routes stated previously, there has been requests from passengers to provide service
on the following routes that were suspended entirely due to COVID-19:
116X – South Simms Express
P – Parker – Denver
Y – Lyons – Boulder
The alternative delivery options outlined in this document could also be applied to these routes, though
Route Y is similar to Route GS in that is does not have a good connection point to the rest of the system
other than at its current south end in Boulder. Boulder County is currently providing taxi vouchers to
residents of Lyons for travel to Boulder or Longmont. Additionally, Route P may be better served as a
local feeder service due to the proximity of existing rail service at Lincoln Station to most of the boarding
passengers. This can be better addressed when looking at providing alternatives to low-performing local
services.
Local Routes
During the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic several local routes were completely or partially suspended in April
2020 due to projected low ridership. As essential workers have traveled throughout the pandemic and
businesses have reopened more recently, requests for service on some suspended routes have been
communicated to RTD. Routes and options for providing service to these areas are the following:
Route 99 – South Kipling
Service has been frequently requested from passengers between Federal Center Station and the US285/Hampden Ave area. Options considered are:
o Operate hourly service on the full Route 99 between Federal Center Station and Southwest
Plaza
- Serves the entire route at fixed, regular schedule
- Continues to provide service to low-demand areas that have not requested it
- Cost of three buses and operators
o Operate hourly service on a truncated Route 99 between Federal Center Station and US285/Hampden Ave
- Serves the in-demand portion of the route at fixed, regular schedule
- Cost of one bus and operator
o FlexRide
- Serves area on-demand and may have scheduled timepoints
- Cost of a bus and operator but at lower cost than bus
- Zone would be very large to cover all passengers and connect to Federal Center Station,
reducing reliability

128 – 128th Ave
Service has been requested in Broomfield on Route 128. Most of this area is currently covered by the
Broomfield FlexRide and also the Broomfield Easy Ride. Options considered are extending one or both.
RTD will work with the municipality and passengers to better communicate the options available in this
area. FlexRide currently covers the area and has capacity.
Route 483 – Parker Rd/Lincoln Ave and Route P – Parker/Denver

Packet Pg. 337

1.C.1.b
Attachment B

125 – Youngfield/Ward
Service has been requested for the portion of Route 125 between Federal Center Station and Red Rocks
Community College. The options considered is to extend the coverage zone for the Green Mountain
FlexRide to cover Red Rocks Community College. The FlexRide zone is adjacent to the college and this
requires no additional resources.
Utilizing other demand-responsive services such as taxis, Uber, and Lyft, were examined but are not
recommended due to challenges related to providing ADA accessible service. Third parties providing
service in non-accessible vehicles require accessible vehicles be available from RTD to serve disabled
passengers and will generally offer one vehicle per passenger trip. Furthermore, it is difficult to attract
drivers to attract drivers to provide these trips for reliable service. The cost of having these accessible
vehicles on standby negates any efficiencies gained by providing trips with third-party non-accessible
operators. RTD is currently conducting a pilot program that allows for accessible trips to be provided in
conjunction with other trips operated by non-accessible vehicles. Should this prove successful and
scalable, it may be possible to implement on a larger scale across the district.

Attachment: Attachment B (4333 : January 2021 Service Change Proposal)

Service has been requested from the Parker area to connect with the rest of the RTD system. The Parker
FlexRide currently operates but does not currently connect with the transit network. Options
considered are:
o 75-minute service on a truncated Route 483 between Lincoln Station and Parker Park-n-Ride
- Serves the in-demand portion of the route at fixed, regular schedule
- Cycle time prevents more frequent service
- Cost of one bus and operator
o Extension of Parker FlexRide to provide service to Lincoln Station
- Could operate as a demand responsive service or a deviated fixed route
- Cost of one additional bus and operator, but at lower cost than a bus

Second Quarter 2020 Performance Measures

INFORMATION
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
The Performance Report is presented for Board review each quarter according to Fiscal Policy Statement,
Budget Policy 10. These year-to-date measures provide a framework in which RTD determines how well
it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within its mission statement
objectives.
DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Second Quarter of 2020. Of the 42 performance measures
tracked for the GM, RTD met 31 of the goals (73.8%) in Q2. The following is a review of the
exceptions.
Goal
Goal 3.1 – Maintain system-wide on time performance
Regional (bus) on-time service of 85.8% was below goal of 88.0%. Commuter Rail on-time service of
84.5% was below goal of 90.0%. For Bus Operations, there are a number of routes that had poor
performance this year that are being eliminated or modified with the restructuring of services when the
N Line opens. Also, the pandemic service plan has been problematic such that by adopting a Saturday
schedule for weekday service, differences in service characteristics between Saturday and weekday
schedules impacts on-time performance. The Planning department is currently working on correcting
some of these schedule challenges into 2021. In Rail Operations, a major thunderstorm in June shut
down Commuter Rail service for several hours spanning two days.
Goal 3.2 – Maintain system-wide service availability
Light Rail service availability of 96.7% was below goal of 99.0% but improved from Q1. We were
providing pre-pandemic service levels for roughly half of Q2 so the train operator shortage was still a
factor. Also, track work and rail replacement was carried out for State of Good Repair. Commuter Rail
service availability of 91.4% was below goal of 97.0%, due to a major thunderstorm in June that shut
down service for several hours spanning two days.
Goal 6.1 – Maintain all required recovery ratios
The Operating Cost Recovery ratio was 12.1% through Q2 and below goal of 38.8%. This ratio
measures farebox revenue and other operating revenue coverage of operating and administrative costs
(excluding ADA costs and interest expense). The measure was not met due to a large decline in farebox
revenue in Q2 due to the pandemic.
Goal 6.2 – Increase in Ridership
Q2 ridership for 2020 was down 36.3% from same time in 2019. Through Q1, the decline was centered

Packet Pg. 345

1.D.1

in bus service mirroring the national trend, but Q2 ridership was negatively impacted by the pandemic
throughout the system. This goal is an annual measure and we will continue to monitor.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
Q2 fare revenue and total operating revenue were down 51.9% and 49.9%, respectively, from the same
time in 2019 due to the impact of the pandemic in Q2. These goals for 2020 are annual measures based
on the 2020 budget.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
Bus operator vacancies, bus mechanic vacancies, and light rail operator vacancies exceeded their goals
through Q2 due to continuing impact from attrition, retirements, skilled labor availability, and system
growth. We were providing pre-pandemic service through roughly half of Q2. Compared to year-end
2019, light rail operator and bus mechanics vacancies are lower, while bus operator vacancies are
higher.

the scheduled departure time.
2 Commuter Rail is considered on-time if a departure from a location is no more than 0 minutes early or 5 minutes after the
scheduled departure time.
3 A number of bus routes that had poor performance are being eliminated or modified with the restructuring of services when
the N Line opens. Also, the pandemic service plan has been problematic in Q2 in that the adoption of a Saturday schedule
for weekday service impacts on-time performance due to differences in service characteristics.
4 In June, a major thunderstorm shut down service spanning two days.

Access-a-Ride/Cab 2nd Quarter Update 2020

Information

Access-a-Ride 2nd Quarter 2020 Highlights

1. The current paratransit software has been reviewed for replacement this year which has also been
approved by the ITSC review team. We have moved forward with designing requirements and await
the completion of an RFP which is being developed as an at-risk proposal to be paid for through savings
accrued through operational efficiencies which would improve our productivity, reduce revenue hours,
and increase on-time performance.
2. We have currently engaged some of our APAC members with testing our in-house designed Mobile
Application, which will offer our Access-a-Ride passengers a scheduling solution either with a computer
or smart phone. The application, which has been designed to meet accessibility requirements, will
allow the user to schedule, cancel, and obtain live ETA information regarding their trips. Test
participants are offering their recommendations for improvements which are being made within hours
of the request. To date, feedback has been very positive and overwhelmingly encouraging. Staff plans
on releasing the application to the general Access-a-Ride population within the next few weeks.
3. Improvements to our OTP has yielded an increase in our overall customer service satisfaction. It
should be pointed out that similar to our fixed-route contracted services counterparts, in lieu of
furloughing a majority of operators, up to 60% were asked to serve on an extra-board. The benefit
included: retaining work force until new service levels are clear; assisting with fluctuations in service
demand; and initially maintaining a 1:1 ratio between operator and passenger as suggested by social
distancing protocols.
4. Continuing drops in service demand, (pre-COVID), saw 5 quarters with decreasing year over year trip
volumes. In the most recent quarter, service demand has decreased Access-a-Ride trip demand has
decreased by 80%. We have recovered to approximately 35% of our 2019 trip demand but will need to
look closely at whether we will continue to need four service providers going forward as the fixed costs
have led to a near doubling of trip costs.
5. Since its inception on April 2, 2020, the Access-a-Ride service has performed nearly 500 food deliveries.
The program is considered a win-win, as our at-risk passengers do not have to travel outside of their
homes in order to purchase food while RTD saves money by not needing to provide round trip services.

Update on May 20th ACPD meeting from APAC Liaison - Ed Neuberg, RTD, for William Gross, APAC
liaison
Light Rail pilot program – Update on the pilot test on allowing bicycles to use open ADA areas on
light rail cars or at stations if unused. This is only a pilot, there is no plans for starting this broadly.
Bicycles can only use ADA areas that are empty, and will vacate those areas if ADA rider boards;
this will not impact high-block areas (ramps for wheel-chair access to raised light rail cars).
RTD’s Reimagine project – Update on process (same presentation APAC will get later).
Hero Awards – None at this meeting due to COVID19 and social distancing. ACPD Chair is going to
work to on how to provide awards at the August meeting while still not meeting in-person.
Meeting Frequency – ACPD is recommending to meet every other month (currently quarterly).
Next ACPD meeting: Aug. 20th, 2:00pm

Questions/Comments
• Question: What are the pilot protocols for when an ADA rider boards?
Answer: Bicycles should not be on the high-block areas, or be in access areas (blocking access to
rail cars).
III.

Updates: COVID19 – Differences, response - Larry Buter, Paratransit Manager

Changes: On July 1st RTD returned to charging fares and entering at the front of fixed-route buses; and RTD
returned to allowing Access-a-Ride riders to schedule trips up to 5-days in advance.
Unchanged: There is still a restriction on subscription trips; whenever possible, Access-a-Ride is still working
to be 1-to-1 (1 driver to 1 rider) for social distancing, although this is not always possible; and free food
deliver service continues (has been over 320 food delivery trips).

2nd Quarter 2020 Summary

Questions/Comments
• Question: When will RTD start charging for food delivery?
Answer: There is no plan to start charging; if a date is set, APAC will be updated. Food delivery can
only be scheduled 1 day in advance to ensure food is available.
• Question: Day programs are looking to adhere to state requirements and reopen; will Access-aRide be able to continue 1-to-1 on vehicles when/if programs reopen?

Update: Communication – Sara Francois, RTD Marketing/Communications
Access-a-Ride Newsletter
o It will be a quarterly email/news blast. It will include links to specially created paratransit
related articles, featured on RTD’s website and News Stop.
o It will be emailed to all email addresses in Access-a-Ride database – APAC members are
automatically signed up. If we don’t have a person’s email they need to sign up (link on the
bottom of the RTD website). If a person doesn’t have an email address, they may request
a printed/mailed copy from Larry Buter.
o First email/news blast is expected to be emailed the week of July 20th; this is also the 30th
anniversary of ADA. [NOTE: E-blast was deployed the morning of July 29, after an approval
delay and using the best-open-rates.]
Web page updates [Note: these are completed actions]
o Access-a-Ride Page: Will add a side box with APAC meeting dates and the conference call
number (link to open on phone, auto dials) and code; and a link to the “ADA Committees”
page (the page where ACPD and APAC is described, links to apply to be a member; and
meeting location and times are posted).
o ADA Committees Page – Will reopen the link to the application form.

Questions/Comments
• Question: Will the newsletter be accessible - emails are not always easily read by readers?
Answer: The digital team is making the newsletter accessible.
• Question: The online RTD calendar of events is hard to understand for the visually impaired. Can
this be made more accessible?
Answer: We will list APAC meeting dates and the call-in number on the ADA Committee web page.
• SUGGESTION: For visually impaired people with no email address, is it possible to send it in braille,
or offer to read it to the person?

Update: Mobile App/web portal – Brandon Fowler, RTD
What it will do – a rider will be able to use it to: 1. See reservations; 2. Cancel existing reservations;
3. Request a trip to a location identified as a favorite 2-5 days in advance; and 4. See where their
vehicle is and estimated arrival time.
o Requesting a trip
▪ Enter the data to request a trip to a favorite location.

Answer: We are working on plans for when programs and schools reopen. Without day programs
it has been easier to meet the 1-to-1 goal. When they reopen RTD will still require all to wear masks,
and try to limit the numbers on board whenever possible.
Questions: What are the cleaning protocols for handrails and seats, etc.?
Answer: Since COVID19 started, RTD providers and drivers have been helping to clean vehicles
(their own and others). Cleaning occurs every night; everything in the vehicles is cleaned – straps,
seats, handrails, seats, floors.

A confirmation number will show up on the booking page and the trip will show
up on the “Future Trips” tab OR you will get a pop-up message saying it did not go
through and why not. You can then fix errors in the request until a confirmation
number is provided by the application.
▪ Similar to on the phone, you request a trip with a 30-minute window, and if there
is a problem in scheduling, a scheduler will contact you.
Readability/Accessibility testing
o First, a third-party contractor (SpireDigital) will test and recommend improvement, and the
portal will be revised; second APAC volunteers will conduct a two-week pilot, including past
APAC members that have been engaged (Douglas Howey and Diane Bomar).
o APAC Volunteers will:
▪ Receive an email to set up a login and password to test real-world functionality;
and
▪ Send input to Larry Buter, RTD via email two weeks after initiation of the pilot.
When ready for public release – All Access-a-Ride email addresses will be automatically entered
and they will receive an email to set up their own web portal account. If someone does not have
an email in their current account, they will need to request to sign up and provide an email address.
An email address is required.
Status – RTD IT is finalizing cyber security and other clean-up elements; they will then send it to the
third-party accessibility tester. After portal revisions, APAC volunteers will beta test it for the twoweeks. Finally, RTD will revise the portal based on APAC suggestions before making it available to
the public.
Schedule – Expectation (no guarantee) is APAC volunteers will start pilot testing in August, with
public release in the fall, but depends on revisions needed.
ACTION: Volunteers: Becky, Brenda, Joe, John, Niccole (also Diane Bomar and Douglas Howey)

Questions/Comments
• Thank you to the developers for working on this and getting it done.
• Question: Web portal trip requests are restricted to known favorite locations?
Answer: Yes, web portal trip requests are limited to known favorites. If you want to add a new
location or schedule to a unique location, you will need to call reservations. This may be a future
feature, but not to start.
• Question: How will the person get confirmation of a trip?
Answer: When scheduling a trip, a confirmation number will show up on the booking page OR an
instant popup message saying, “unable to process request” and the error to fix.
o Example: If it is Monday 5pm, you can schedule a trip for Wednesday at 5pm or later (2
days in advance). If all data is entered correctly and all is good, you see a confirmation
show up on the page with trip data and the trip will be listed on the “Future Trips” tab. If
data is not entered correctly (e.g., something missing, pick-up time is after drop-off time),
you will instantly see a pop-up message saying “unable to process”, and you will need to

reenter the request fixing any errors – fix errors until you see a confirmation number show
up at the top of the booking page.
Question: What if you want to schedule a trip within 2-days?
Answer: You must call reservations to schedule trips less than 2-days in advance.
Question: Will this work on iPhone, android, and/or computer?
Answer: It will work on all equipment that access the internet/web sites - it is not an application
but a web page. You will be able to download an icon on your phone that looks like an app, but is
a direct link to the web page.
Update: Reimage RTD process – Bill Sirois, RTD and Julie Skeen, CIG
Reimagine RTD objectives – Using a data driven process, the project will: determine how RTD will
meet current challenges; and RTD’s role in meeting long-term transit needs in the region.
Key elements/results
o System Optimization Plan - How and where to provide transit service with limited
resources (input and draft by Fall 2020; implementation January 2021).
▪ Evaluate current system and determine what RTD can afford and develop a draft
plan.
▪ Seek input on public priorities, and on a draft Plan.
o Mobility Plan for the future - Long-term strategies to address future mobility needs in the
region) (Summer 2021).
Current Challenges identified
o Reduction in ridership resulting from COVID19 pandemic – evaluate current bus and rail
services; and develop a financially sustainable service plan.
o Budget cuts required due to lower revenues (less sales and use tax revenue); and no
expectation for additional federal funds.
o Need for a long-term vision for the future.
Process is staring with a simple question: How should RTD define success? What are the priorities?
Priorities like:
o Long service hours – run all day, early and late.
o Fast trips – minimal transfers and time.
o Convenient stop locations – easy and quick rider access.
o Reliable service – arrive when expected with minimal delays during.
o Easy transit connections – easy and quick access to other transit services.
o Frequent service – vehicles arrive often, shorter wait times.
o Equitable access – focus on providing access to those how who depend on public transit.
o Geographical access – focus on covering the entire region – including suburbs.
o High ridership-based service – focus on covering areas with the most riders.
o Resource efficiency – focus on using resources efficiently so that every dollar spends
results in maximum ridership.

Scenarios - We will develop different scenarios to provide an opportunity to evaluate tradeoffs to
find an appropriate balance between the competing priorities that reflects the impacts of reduced
revenues and ridership from the pandemic.
Outreach for Reimagine RTD
o Gather unique insights into needs/concerns for our different riders.
o Learn what others believe should be RTD’s priorities moving forward – how to face large
budget shortfalls and make tough decisions about where to invest RTD’s scarce resources.
o Two stakeholder groups – Technical Group (agencies’ staff) and an Advisory Committee
(elected officials, paratransit riders, fixed-route riders and advocates).
Next Steps
o Reimagine RTD webpage: link
▪ Take the survey – click “survey” button on webpage.
▪ Share your ideas, see upcoming events, sign-up to stay informed, and see a map –
click “Share ideas” button on webpage.
▪ Listen to Advisory Committee meetings or Technical Working Group Meetings –
click on “Share ideas” button and scroll down to see events.
o Listen to Board meetings

Questions/Comments
• Question: How much will new technologies address some of the priorities (ex., focus on high
ridership vs service across the district)?
Answer: Technology will have some short-term impacts (ex., payment systems), but technology like
autonomous vehicles or electric buses are still a long way off, we are focused on more short-term
priorities because of the current fiscal challenges.
• Question: Is this focused on bus and rail (fixed route), or does it also include paratransit?
Answer: The process is mostly focused on fixed route.
• Comments on APAC members priorities:
o Equity for those who rely on public transit, their only transportation is transit.
o Equity for those who rely on it, but also need to focus on geographic access for people of
color and economically disadvantaged – these are linked. Reliability, if it is not reliable
people will not use it (if reliable, ridership would increase). Also, resource efficiency. The
trick will be in balancing across all of the priorities.
o Concentrate on economics and seriously consider those on Access-a-Ride; consider those
in poverty and not raise costs which would make transit inaccessible.
o Cost is a serious consideration and needs to be balanced with service provided. Focus on
communication and customer services in an effort to change the perception/reputation of
the RTD. Focus on reliability – when trips are unreliable I still pay, but there is also an
emotional cost if trips are unreliable and I am late.

Five vacant seats in August – five members have completed their 3-year term: Becky Pyle; Joe
Triplett; Krystin Trustman, CCDC; Tim Brotzman; and William Gross.
o RTD expressed great appreciation for these members, many of whom have been engaged,
prepared, and committed to APAC longer than the 3-years term (they were engaged before
term limits were enacted 3 years ago). Their efforts have made Access-a-Ride better than
before.

Contractor Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 2nd
Quarter 2020

Information

RTD currently provides 45% of its fixed route bus service via four contracted bus divisions operated by
First Transit and Transdev. With bus divisions located in Longmont, Denver, Commerce City and
Englewood, our contract partners provide fixed route bus service throughout the RTD District. The
performance for First Transit and Transdev is measured on the following performance indicators:
Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 miles, Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 miles, OnTime Preventive Maintenance Inspections, On-Time Performance, Miles Between Lost Service Road Calls
and Operator Complaints per Boarding.
Because of their commitment to excellence, dedicated corporate support and detailed problem solving,
First Transit and Transdev as a group, met all of the Board of Director adopted 2020 key performance
measures through the 2nd quarter 2020. In the areas where our contract partners fell slightly short of
their individual goals, they implemented both procedural and staff changes which should result in
continuous improvement throughout 2020. The following is a more detailed discussion of fixed route
contractor performance through the 2nd quarter of 2020.
•

PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles through the 2nd quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to
utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of
operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety
meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities and on the
street.

•

PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles
through the 2nd quarter. Only two of the twelve passenger accidents that occurred during the
2nd quarter were classified preventable. First Transit Commerce City did not meet the goal
(0.28) however, only one of their passenger accidents was classified as preventable. All of the
bus operators involved in passenger accidents were provided retraining on the proper procedures
for addressing passenger safety. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness of
passenger safety through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger
accidents per 100,000 miles.

•

ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled through the 2nd quarter. Competitive Services staff will
continue to monitor the contractor operations to ensure PMIs are completed on-time.

ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
The contractors, as a group, met the target of 86% Local On-Time Service through the 2nd
quarter. Transdev (85.8%) did not meet the goal due in part to unexpected detours and traffic.
The Pandemic Service Plan adopted in April has been very problematic for Bus Operations as well.
Running times for weekday services are timed based up on weekday traffic, traffic lights, and trip
loads. Saturday services are significantly different than weekday services. By adopting a
Saturday schedule for a weekday service, the differences in service characteristics impacts ontime performance. RTD Service Planning is currently working on correcting some of these
schedule challenges with the September 2020 and January 2021 runboard since we are currently
expecting to operate reduced service schedules into 2021. RTD and the private contractors
continue to campaign routes and operators with low on-time performance with a strong focus on
first time point departures. On a monthly basis contractors review the OTP report and meet with
operators of low performing routes to discuss factors that are impacting their ability to reach
86% on-time performance.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.

•

MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, as a group, exceeded the target of 30,000 Miles Between Lost Service
Maintenance Road Calls through the 2nd quarter. First Transit Longmont did not meet the goal
during the 2nd quarter; however, First Transit Longmont has shown improvement since the
beginning of the year. In addition to continuing to address deficiencies identified in First Transit
Longmont’s Preventive Maintenance Inspection (PMI) and Quality Control (QC) practices, an
expanded maintenance action plan was implemented during the 2nd quarter to further address all
issues. Competitive Services staff will continue to monitor the contractor operations and work
closely with local and corporate management teams to ensure this goal is being addressed by
completing preventive maintenance inspections on-time, working off defects in a timely manner,
monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a pro-active
approach to maintaining the buses in their fleet.

•

OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
At this time boarding information is not available; however, the contractors continue to
investigate and address customer complaints with operators. The contractors utilize onboard
video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist operators in improving customer interactions. In
addition, the steps noted above regarding on-time performance should help address some
customer complaints. The contractors also continue to address complaint trends with all
operators at monthly safety meetings.

FlexRide Quarterly Report – 2nd Quarter 2020

Information

RTD’s FlexRide services are currently operated by Via Mobility, MV Transit and the Seniors’ Resource
Center. With FlexRide bus divisions located in Boulder, Denver and Evergreen, our contract partners
provide FlexRide services to 23 distinct service areas throughout the RTD District. The performance for
Via Mobility, MV Transit and Senior’s Resource Center is measured on Ridership, Customer Contacts,
Preventable Vehicle Accidents and Productivity (boardings per service hour).
Customer contacts received were down when compared with the same period in 2019 and overall for
2020. Preventable Vehicle Accidents decreased during the quarter. Our contract partners continued to
experience a decrease in ridership during this period and the year. FlexRide staff continues to monitor
low performing FlexRide services to help increase ridership and productivity. The following is a more
detailed discussion of the FlexRide contractor performance through the 2nd quarter of 2020.
Ridership
FlexRide ridership for the second quarter for 2020 was down in comparison to the same quarter in
2019. Boardings in 2019 were 223,716 and 2020 were 132,617. Contributing to the decrease in
ridership included the impact of low fuel prices, which gives customers a low-cost alternative to using
the FlexRide service and the reduced service levels due to adoption of the COVID-19 pandemic service
plan. Similar to our fixed-route bus service, beginning April 19, 2020 all FlexRide services began
operating a reduced weekday schedule under our COVID-19 service plan in response to decreased
demand.
Customer Contacts
FlexRide experienced a decrease in overall customer contacts in the second quarter for 2020 when
compared to 2019.
Customer contacts are reviewed on a daily basis. Those contacts that are considered operator-related
(within the operator’s control) are monitored for trends and improvement.

At Fault contacts decreased by two when comparing quarters. The number of all other customer
contacts received regarding FlexRide service (requests for new service or a change in service which can
include boundary changes, service day and hours, web site issues, no return calls, etc.) are as follows:
2020: 149
2019: 199
Preventable Accidents
The preventable accident rate for the second quarter dropped compared to 2019. Contractors have
continued to retrain operators identified as being involved in accidents and have increased the number of
“ride-alongs” performed by operations specialists and training staff.
Turnover has been high due to a
great job market resulting in new operators in the field. RTD Safety and Training Compliance Officer has
been working with contractors and researching additional defensive driving refresher courses.
2020: 6
Preventable Vehicle Accidents: 1.16 per 100,000 miles
2019: 13
Preventable Vehicle Accidents: 1.912 per 100,000 miles
Productivity
The majority of the FlexRide services have seen a decrease in productivity when compared to the same
period in 2019. COVID service reductions started having an effect on ridership in March and has
continued through the second quarter. The attached 2020 Special Services 2nd Quarter Report provides
the productivity numbers for each of the FlexRides and some other special services for which RTD
provides cost-share funding. The acceptable level of productivity for FlexRide service continues to be
3.0 boardings per hour.

Customer Comment Analysis – 2nd Quarter
2020

Information

Customer comments through the 2nd Quarter of 2020 for both RTD and the private contractors showed
improvement over the same period in 2019. The total number of operator-related comments for the
District as a whole for the 2nd Quarter of 2020 was 5,517. The total number for the same period in
2019 was 8,017. Every customer comment category showed improvement over 2020. RTD and the
private contractors review customer comments on a daily basis and implement corrective action as
needed to address deficiencies and improve performance. Additionally, reduced ridership due to the
COVID-19 pandemic has led to less complaints overall.
Recapped below is an analysis of the customer comment trends through the 2nd Quarter of 2020. Also
included is a comparison of customer comment data for the same period in 2019.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer comments on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer comments using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the comment is not supported by factual data. Some of the
reasons for the “Not Valid” classification include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the comment

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer comments.
•

•
•

Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator, running time of the route, or
other circumstances such as construction and detours.
Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
RTD conducts refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings

Packet Pg. 385

1.D.5

•

•

•

•

wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado Cross Disability Coalition,
Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis, DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force, RTD Advisory
Committee for People with Disabilities-ACPD) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service
for passengers with disabilities.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Operating Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
Trends in customer service challenges are also addressed through bulletins, campaigns, and other
communications to ensure that RTD and Contractor employees are aware of our customers’
concerns.

Historically, and in 2020, the following comment categories generated the highest number of customer
comments:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop

All of these comment categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
comment numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high comment categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and external,
that are impacting the number of comments. The input received from both RTD and private contractor
operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 2nd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category significantly decreased by 60.8%
compared to the same period in 2019. “Flashbacks” for “bus did not show” comments often show
buses running late. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 1.57 comments per day. The
comparable number for 2019 was 4.02 comments per day.
Bus Early – 2nd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category decreased 23.7% compared to the same
period in 2019. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” comments often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The
YTD average in this category for 2020 is 2.88 comments per day. The comparable number for 2019
was 3.80 comments per day.
Bus Late – 2nd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category significantly decreased 58.2% compared to
the same period in 2019. Improving on-time performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of
reasons including construction, traffic and heavy ridership delays. Running time issues are continually

Packet Pg. 386

1.D.5

reviewed by RTD Service Planning and Scheduling. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 2.80
comments per day. The comparable number for 2019 was 6.74 comments per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category significantly decreased
41.7% compared to the same period in 2019. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and
undercover ride checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate
manner. In addition, RTD and the private contractors have “G-Force Activated” event-recording systems
(Drive Cam, Smart Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis.
Operators continue to be counseled and retrained, as needed, to improve driving performance. Also,
periodic safety campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this
category for 2020 is 2.23 comments per day. The comparable number for 2019 was 3.85 comments
per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category decreased 27.1% compared to
the same period in 2019. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined appropriately if video evidence confirms that
they treated passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions
for handling similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 6.48
comments per day. The comparable number for 2019 was 8.93 comments per day.
Discrimination – 2nd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category decreased 19.0% compared to the
same period in 2019. Investigation into discrimination-related comments usually shows the operator not
at fault. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 0.19 comments per day. The comparable
number for 2019 was 0.23 comments per day.
Fare Dispute – 2nd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category significantly decreased 52.0% compared
to the same period in 2019. Investigations into “fare dispute” comments often show that passengers
presented an improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare
policies. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 0.47 comments per day. The comparable
number for 2019 was 0.98 comments per day. It should also be noted that RTD made a decision to
suspend fares in the 2nd quarter of 2020. This is a major factor in the reduction of fare disputes during
this reporting period.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category decreased 12.4%
compared to the same period in 2019. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held
at the private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of
RTD passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not
following proper procedures, appropriate coaching activities are taken. The YTD average in this category
for 2020 is 4.93 comments per day. The comparable number for 2019 was 5.66 comments per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category decreased by 12.7% compared
to the same period in 2019. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation,
Operations Managers, the Bus Operator Training teams, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to
provide operators with up-to-date information to answer customer questions and address customer
concerns. Although RTD and the private contractors have seen an influx of new operators, their impact

Packet Pg. 387

1.D.5

on this category is minimal, thanks to annual refresher training, assistance from Street Supervisors and
trainers, and improved communication. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 0.30 comments
per day. The comparable number for 2019 was 0.35 comments per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 2nd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category decreased 12.6%
compared to the same period in 2019. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these comments will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop as the bus
passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting
directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” comments from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
comments (119 of the total 1542 = 7.72%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjusted, as needed, as resources will
allow. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 8.47 comments per day. The comparable number
for 2019 was 9.75 comments per day.

2020 2nd Quarter Monitoring Report – Private
Contractor Drug and Alcohol Compliance

Information

In compliance with the recommendation included in the Performance Audit of the RTD conducted in
2015 on behalf of the State of Colorado, the following is a summary of the monitoring activities
completed by RTD Drug & Alcohol compliance personnel through the 2nd Quarter of 2020:
Number of files reviewed:

85

Percentage of records in compliance with requirements:

95.3%

These statistics represent the verification of records reviewed for the private contractor operations for a
portion of the quarter. Generally, these numbers are much greater, but due to Covid-19, RTD has
suspended all in-person meetings-which are required for physical review of the files. Scheduled visits for
the contractors are going to resume once RTD allows in-person meetings and when deemed safe to do
so.

Attachment: Service Availability Memo - August 2020 (4319 : Service Availability – August 2020)

TO:

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.86% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in August 2020. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflects an
improvement as compared to the same month (August) last year. Lost service for personnel
related reasons follows:
•
•
•
•

August 2020 – 21.32 hours
August 2019 – 163.56 hours
Year to date hours for 2020 – 1587.60 hours
Year to date hours 2019 – 2566.77 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in August were bus bridges and the COVID19 pandemic and the pandemic service reduction.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.86% of all scheduled hours of service in the month,
it was necessary to cover 0 shifts with RTD operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 0 hours of service being provided by a
“6th day” RTD operator. Additionally, our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev,
covered 0 shifts, or approximately 0 hours of service, with operators working a “6th day”.

Subject:

Approval of New Auditing Contract

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 16, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 29, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to Plante
Moran, LLP to perform RTD’s independent audit and financial procedures services. The contract is
awarded for these services for calendar years 2020, 2021, and 2022 in the amount of $338,811.
There is an option to extend the contract for two additional one-year periods, at RTD’s discretion, in the
amount of $242,749.
This action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Strengthen Transparent Public Communication/Collaboration
BACKGROUND
According to Section 12 of Article VII of the RTD Bylaws, “The Board of Directors shall cause an
examination of the District’s financial statements to be made in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards following the end of each fiscal year. One certified copy of said audit shall be filed
with the office of the State Auditor. The audit shall be performed by an independent Certified Public
Accountant retained by the Board of Directors at the sole discretion for this or any other purpose they
deem necessary. The auditor shall provide a signed auditor’s opinion as to the fair presentation of the
financial position of the District, the results of RTD operations and changes in its financial position for
the fiscal year ended. The Board of Directors shall cause such other audits to be made as it deems
necessary, utilizing the Internal Audit staff or independent auditor as it alone shall determine.” In
addition, the District is required by the Single Audit Act of 1984 and certain debt and lease covenants to
have an independent audit of other selected information. Additional services include an annual review of
information provided for the National Transit Database as well as a review of the General Manager’s
contract.

DISCUSSION
The current RTD contract for these services expires on September 30, 2020 with RubinBrown, LLC
having provided these services to RTD for the past several years. Due to the expiration of this contract,
a request for proposals was issued in which six proposals were received. The proposals were scored
40% for the qualifications of staff, 30% for the qualifications of the firm and 30% for cost. Plante
Moran was determined to offer the best value of the proposals received.
Plante Moran is the 16th largest accounting firm in the United States serving over 500 governmental
agencies. With offices in Denver, Boulder and Fort Collins, the firm is the second largest single audit

Packet Pg. 397

2.B.1

provider and a member of the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) and APTA. Plante
Moran also has a national transportation practice group focusing on public transportation including team
members that serve on APTA’s finance and audit committees.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this contract is included in the 2020 Amended Budget and will be included in the 2021
Budget and Mid-Term Financial Plan (MTFP).

Approval of Budget for Homeland Security
Grant for Bus Audio/Video Live Connection
Award

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 16, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 29, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Board of Directors approve receipt of the Bus Audio/Video Live Connection
project award in the amount of $2,416,000 with no matching requirement. The award is from
FEMA/Homeland Security under the Transit Security Grant Program. Receipt of this award requires
establishing the project budget in Oracle and an increase to budgeted 2020 revenue of same amount.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Strategic Priority #5 – Strengthen Safety and Security
BACKGROUND
The existing audio/visual software on 800 buses and 30 light rail vehicles is at end of life, and the
support for the software has ended as the audio/visual technology in use will no longer be developed
and supported by the vendor. The purpose of the project is to upgrade the current fleet of Bus/LRV
network mobile video recorders to operate remotely accessible live audio and video systems. RTD
invested millions in existing infrastructure that is at end of life and if we do not update it will no longer
be viable. The video system serves as an investigative tool in criminal and civil issues. RTD depends on
visual/audio records to provide rider security, legal protection to RTD (from lawsuits), community safety
and overall transit safety. There are multiple potential risks if RTD does not maintain these security
systems with more effective solutions.
The grant will allow RTD to update the software for existing camera(s)/video hardware with a newer
configuration, i.e., the cameras and physical recorders will remain as is, but the recording software will
change to support live streaming. There will be no new hardware purchased; the solution will
accommodate current hardware and spare stock.
DISCUSSION
The award is from Homeland Security in the amount of $2,416,000 with no matching requirement. The
next step is to create the project budget and transfer funding into the project so that spending can
occur. Awards such as this that are awarded after the budget is approved need a Board action to
establish the project budget and increase revenue in our Oracle accounting system as there are no other
sources to fund the award.

Packet Pg. 399

2.B.2

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact is neutral as both the project budget and revenue are established for the same
amount and offset.

DTP Private Activity Bond Refinancing Consent

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 16, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 29, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to consent to the proposed refinancing subject to the
conditions described below.
GM Goals
• Mission- Oriented Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
• Strategic Goal #6: Move Toward Stable Financial Situation
BACKGROUND
In 2010, RTD issued the Private Activity Bonds (PABs) as conduit issuer and lent the proceeds of the
PABs to Denver Transit Partners (DTP) to assist in financing the Eagle Project. (See attached 2010 RTD
Board of Directors Resolution.) The principal of and interest on the PABs are payable by DTP pursuant to
the 2010 Loan Agreement. The PABs do not constitute an indebtedness of RTD. However, DTP relies on
TABOR payments from RTD to pay debt service on the PABs. The PABs are subject to optional
redemption (refunding) on or any date after July 15, 2020.
INFORMATION
Since the PABs may be refunded for a savings in interest expense, DTP has requested RTD’s consent to
the refinancing of the PABs pursuant to the Concession and Lease Agreement (CA). Section 10.4 of the
CA provides the requirements for refinancing the PABs. Specifically, 10.4(d) states, “The concessionaire
shall not implement any Qualifying Refinancing without the written consent of RTD (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
RTD has met with DTP over several months to discuss DTP’s request. RTD has reviewed DTP’s financial
model for the refinancing and both DTP and RTD have discussed questions raised by both parties. At the
time of a refinancing, a calculation is performed pursuant to the CA to determine the Refinancing Gain,
as shown in the table below. The Refinancing Gain is then split equally between RTD and DTP. Pursuant
to the calculation, Limb B is paid to DTP’s equity investors and Limb C is paid to DTP.
The General Manager provided a Notice of Election to DTP pursuant to the provisions of the CA with an
election to receive an upfront payment to the extent an agreement can be reached between RTD and
DTP based on the conditions described below, subject to the Board’s consent. In the absence of an
agreement with DTP related to the lump sum payment, RTD would receive any Refinancing Adjustment
as a reduction in the Service Payments over the remaining term of the CA. DTP currently estimates that
RTD’s 50% share of the Refinancing Gain would be approximately $15.8 million received as an upfront

Packet Pg. 401

2.B.3

payment under current market conditions. This estimate is based on current interest rates, estimated
costs of issuance, DTP’s underwriters’ views on likely credit spreads, and DTP’s indicative credit rating
from two major rating agencies. The final Refinancing Gain would be based on market pricing for the
refunding PABs.
The key sources of variability between now and pricing of the proposed refunding PABs include:
(i) general movement in interest rates, (ii) change in credit spreads, (iii) overall supply and demand
conditions in the tax-exempt and taxable municipal bond market, (iv) outcome of the ratings process,
and (iv) the specific bond structure, including the potential use of bond insurance, that will be optimized
during the PABs marketing and pricing processes to produce best results.

Refinancing Gain Formula:

Estimated Value

Limb A: Discounted present value of net project cash flow, taking into
account the benefficial impact of the refinancing. Discount rate is
13.94% (the Base Case Equity IRR)

$171.87m

Limb B: Discounted present value of net project cash flow, prior to the
refinancing, i.e. not taking into account the beneficial impact of the
refinancing. Discount rate is 13.94% (the Base Case Equity IRR).

($129.35)m

Limb C: Adjustment for DTP to recover any negative impact to the Base
Case Equity IRR since Financial Close in 2010

($7.58)m

Limb D: External Professional Costs

($3.34)m

Total Refinancing Gain

$31.60m

RTD's 50% Share

$15.80m

DISCUSSION
DTP has requested to move forward and complete the refinancing as soon as possible. DTP provided
RTD with notice of a proposed refinancing on August 28, 2020 pursuant to CA requirements. If the
Board consents to the refinancing, the key upcoming dates would be:
•
•
•

September 29th: RTD Board meeting to authorize consent to the refinancing
October 27th: RTD Board approval of the key financing documents (resolution, indenture, loan

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Board of Directors

Date: September 17, 2020

From:

Executive Committee,

GM

Date:

Board Meeting Date: September 29, 2020

Subject:

Approval of Board Expense Reductions for
2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Executive Committee of the RTD Board of Directors that the Board approve a
motion to adopt the attached Resolution No. ______, Series of 2020, concerning a Reduction of Directors
Expense Budget Lines in Fiscal Year 2021 to Offset Revenue Shortfalls Due to COVID-19 Impacts
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2020 Core Goal #3 - Strong Financial
Management.
BACKGROUND
Directors are eligible for reimbursement from the District for reasonable local and travel expenses
incurred that are necessary to the transaction of official District business. Out-of-District registration
fees for the first two sanctioned events for each Director are not charged against the Director’s
expenses and are instead paid for using Board Office funds.
In 2009, 2011, and 2020, the Board adopted resolutions reducing the Board members’ spending limits
on their local and travel expenses as economic downturns required a reduction in overall agency
spending. The ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and beyond necessitate additional
budget reductions.
DISCUSSION
For Fiscal Year 2021 only, the attached resolution:
•
•
•

Reduces by $4,000 the amount allocated to each Directors’ travel expense budget;
Reduces by $1,000 the amount allocated to each Directors’ local expense budget;
Reduces by half, to $12,750, the amount budgeted by the Board Office to defray the cost of
Directors’ registration fees incurred in order to attend out-of-District transit-related conferences.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adoption of this resolution would result in an estimated General Fund savings of $87,750 during Fiscal
Year 2021. This amount represents a 49.4% reduction in the budget allocation for Directors’ overall
local- and travel-related expenses.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

Reduction of Directors Expense Budget Lines in Fiscal
Year 2021 to Offset Revenue Shortfalls Due to COVID-19 Impacts
WHEREAS, RTD’s Board of Directors consists of 15 elected members who serve their
constituents on a daily basis throughout the community, at committee meetings, study
sessions, and Board Meetings, and at the legislature; and
WHEREAS, each fiscal year moneys are allocated to Directors’ expense budgets to allow for
reimbursement of their individual local and travel expenses; and
WHEREAS, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on both farebox revenues
and sales and use tax revenues; and
WHEREAS, though RTD has received a significant amount of funding through the federal
CARES Act, that amount is not enough to offset lost revenues, and considerable agencywide budget reductions are necessary both now and in future years; and
WHEREAS, physical distancing requirements, broad travel restrictions, and event
cancellations both locally and nationwide have diminished Directors’ opportunities to travel
within their districts to conduct business and meet with constituents and to travel outside
of the state in the exercise of their duties; and
WHEREAS, at the same time, remote meetings have offered the Directors the ability to
conduct business from home, thus minimizing or eliminating the need to travel to and from
the Blake Street Offices to participate in, and formally vote during, Board and committee
meetings during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic; and
WHEREAS, due to projected revenue shortfalls in 2020, the Board of Directors approved
Resolution 012, Series of 2019, and Resolution 006, Series of 2020, which reduced the
amounts allocated to the Directors for fiscal year 2020.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that for fiscal year 2021 only, in light of ongoing
financial hardships impacting the agency, the Board hereby reduces the following budget
lines:

2) The amount allocated for local expenses for each Director other than the Chair of the
Board is reduced from $4,000 to $3,000 per Director. The amount allocated for local
expenses for the Chair of the Board is reduced from $4,500 to $3,500.
3) The amount allocated by the Board Office to defray the cost of Directors’ registration
fees incurred in order to attend out-of-District transit-related conferences shall be
eliminated.

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
To:

Board of Directors

Requested
by:

Natalie Menten, Director, District M

Date:

September 16, 2020

Subject:

Compensation Reduction Salaried Non-Union

Date: September 16, 2020

Board Meeting Date: September 22, 2020

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by Directors Menten, Folska, and Mihalik that the Board of Directors adopt a
compensation reduction package for the salaried positions within the following salary ranges.
Tier 1 – Reduce wages 15% for salaries $150,000 and above
Tier 2 – Reduce wages 10% for salaries $100,000 - $149,999.99
Tier 3 – Reduce wages 5% for salaries $60,000 - $99,999.99
Reduction is effective January 1, 2021.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
The agency is poised to layoff hundreds of employees, eliminate service in areas of the region, and
spend emergency reserves to a balance that will only cover several weeks.
DISCUSSION
This compensation reduction is in lieu of staff's proposed furlough days (estimated 30,000 hours).
•

Furlough days create slower response time for customers, less productivity for the district, and
shift additional burden and stress to the employees earning less than $60,000.

The RTD Board has a fiduciary duty to reduce overhead costs in order to achieve a balanced budget.
These salary reductions are reasonable and responsible in light of our financial reality.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Estimated $5,435,600 reduction in wages and pension expenses.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To adopt the proposal.
2. To reject the proposal.

The second quarter 2020 SB154 ratio is 12.1% which is lower than the statutorially required 30% ratio. The low ratio is caused by the absence of fare revenue and reduction of taxes due to COVID.

(1) Variance is due to lower parts, suppliers and purchased transportation.
(2) Variance is due to lower labor, repair parts and purchased transportation.
(3) Variance is due to projects budgeted evenly across year but not yet started.
(4) Variance is due to timing of project expenses not yet incurred, many of which are grant-funded.
(5) Variance is due to lower outside security services costs.
(6) Variance is due primarily to timing of outside counsel costs related to litigation.
(7) Variance is due to timing of outstide IT services costs for projects.
(8) Variance is due to timing of outside printing costs for schedules, other outside services and special events.
(9) Variance due to purchasing card costs that initially get coded to this cost center until they can be coded to each cost center where they were incurred
(10) Variance due timing of hosting services charges for MinuteTraq.
(11) Variance due to timing of grant fund draws, particularly the Eagle P3 FFGA and preventive maintenance grants typcially drawn late in the year.

Subject:

LiVE Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 16, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 22, 2020
Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program transitioned to
new rules after December 31, 2019.

DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

Packet Pg. 430

2.D.1

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.

As of August 31, 2020, 11,346 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 7,037 have been
approved, 3,387 have been denied, 911 are pending and the remaining 11 have been closed for other
reasons. Of the 3,387 denied, 1,960 were denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65
and older which entitles them to a better discount, 472 were denied because their address was out of
District, 75 were denied because it was a duplicate application, 74 were denied because the applicants
were already enrolled, 608 were denied because they did not respond to requests for a photo or
additional information, and 198 were denied because they did not meet the income threshold. Of the
911 pending applications, all applicants lack an uploaded photo.
The decrease in ridership caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the suspension of fare collection from
April to June 2020 have had a significant impact on the program. The number of approved applications
went from an average of 230 per week in the first two weeks of March to an average of 100 in April,
50 in May and June, and 110 in July and August.
The 7,037 LiVE participants enrolled as of August 31, 2020, provided a mailing address1 in the following
counties: Denver 3,415, Arapahoe 1,590, Jefferson 810, Adams 647, Boulder 307, Douglas 83,
Broomfield 29, and Weld 28. Note that some counties are only partially in the RTD District. 128
participants reside in the RTD District but provided a mailing address in a county outside of the District,
which is acceptable under the program rules.
From the implementation of the LiVE program through July 2020, we issued 540 LiVE MyRide cards that
were used for 12,600 trips. 2,430 mobile app users bought 29,900 mobile 3-hour passes and day
passes. Nonprofit organizations bought 122,840 LiVE paper tickets. We do not know how many
individual riders received LiVE tickets from nonprofit organizations since the number of tickets issued to
each client depends on the organization and the client’s situation.

In addition to going live on July 29, 2019, the following actions have been completed:
•
•

LiVE fares are available through RTD’s mobile ticketing application.
LiVE fares are available on LiVE MyRide smart cards. The cards can be ordered through the
MyRide portal and have been made available for purchase at RTD sales outlets as well as

King Soopers and Safeway stores.
LiVE airport upgrades are available on buses and from Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs).
Order forms for LiVE 10-ride tickets have been made available to organizations in the RTD
nonprofit program.
RTD Operations staff and Security staff have been trained on the LiVE fares and eligibility
requirements.
Marketing, training, product readiness and communications activities have been deployed.
Step-by-by step instructions for applications as well as other materials are available
through the RTD LiVE web page. A LiVE Program handout has been created, printed, and
uploaded to the web page. The instructions and handout are available in English and
Spanish.
The LiVE application process in PEAK is available to applicants in both English and
Spanish.
RTD customer service is answering LiVE program questions and referring customers to the
appropriate parties for assistance.
Denver Human Services is verifying income for those not categorically income-eligible
through public assistance programs.
Denver Human Services is providing LiVE eligibility customer service by phone and e-mail.
RTD staff are performing quality control, making any needed adjustments for uploaded
photos, working with applicants if a better photo is required, and assisting customers
whose cards have been lost or stolen.
The livecard@rtd-denver.com mailbox is active and being utilized to communicate with
customers about photos and cards and to field questions. Community partners can request
printed LiVE handouts through this email address.
A feedback form about the LiVE application experience is available on the RTD website.
RTD staff have promoted the LiVE program and answered questions at community events.
Denver Human Services has provided information about the LiVE Program and application
at community events and to community partners and caseworkers.
RTD hosted live and webinar training by PEAK Outreach (Boulder County) for nonprofit
organizations that are interested in helping their clients apply for LiVE.
RTD has refined the communications plan for LiVE and is expanding outreach and
marketing activities.
The team has identified requirements for PEAK enhancements related to the LiVE
application and application processing.
Negotiated the scope for enhancements to the LiVE application and application processing
in PEAK with the State’s software vendor. These enhancements will include revised
verbiage in the LiVE application based on feedback. Due to the pandemic’s impacts on the
RTD budget, this project was put on hold.
RTD kicked off a broader marketing campaign about all fare discounts, including LiVE,
starting with in-vehicle advertising and social media posts. In June, RTD issued social
media posts for each fare discount. We also included information about the fare discounts
in the communications and outreach related to resuming front door boarding and fare
collection on July 1.

We worked with Denver Human Services to adjust procedures due to the COVID-19
situation. The LiVE eligibility technicians are processing applications and provide customer
service remotely while the Denver Human Services offices are closed to the public. In
addition to the online application on PEAK, interested individuals have the option of
applying by phone, at least until the offices re-open.
Executed an amendment to the intergovernmental agreement with the City and County of
Denver to add the services of an Outreach Coordinator at Denver Human Services. The
person in this new position will assist eligible riders who face barriers to completing a LiVE
application. We plan to offer this service at rotating locations throughout the District, for
example in homeless shelters.
Created new LiVE informational materials based on feedback by customers, Denver Human
Services, and community-based organizations. This included a comprehensive questions &
answers document and short videos with basic information, how to apply, and how to use
the program. Updated the LiVE website for clarity and ease of use and added the new
materials and a new “partner toolkit” area.
Launched a new round of communications about the LiVE program. This included issuing a
news release and posting the new LiVE videos on social media. New communications
about the program and partner toolkit were emailed to community partners and RTD
Nonprofit Program customers. PEAK Outreach and Denver Human Services disseminated
the information through their email lists as well.

Next Steps:
•
•

RTD is working with the State’s software vendor and Denver Human Services to work out
remaining “bugs” from the initial implementation in PEAK.
RTD is evaluating next activities for the marketing campaign about the discounts offered
by RTD, in accordance with the LiVE/All Discounts Communications Plan.
On-going communications with organizations in the RTD Nonprofit Program about program
rules, the application process, feedback, and changes due to the COVID-19 situation.
RTD is working with homeless services providers to develop and implement a temporary
LiVE ID card. Organizations that serve individuals in emergency situations will be able to
issue temporary LiVE ID cards to their clients after the PEAK application is completed. This
will eliminate the wait time between the LiVE application and the ability to use the

2020 FISCAL POLICY STATEMENT

1. The Board of Directors may consider potential fare adjustments annually at the time
of the development of the Mid-Term Financial Plan. As part of this process, staff
will review potential fare adjustments to establish a fare structure to ensure that it:
• is understandable
• is implementable
• addresses equity including social and geographical
2. Fare or other revenue streams and cost savings should aim to achieve financial levels
equivalent to inflationary adjustments in fare revenue established in the Mid-Term
Financial Plan.
3. Fare policies will take into account the special needs of all transit dependent patrons.
4. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
5. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
6. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.

•

total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;

3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted Mid-Term Financial Plan
as the basis for the capital program to be included in the annual budget.

cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be brought to
the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future technological

FUND BALANCE POLICIES
1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and FasTracks to
provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected
increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as a result of economic
downturns affecting revenue. The Base System should strive to maintain a total
fund balance at an amount approximately equal to three months of Base System
operating expenses excluding depreciation among the following three reserve funds:
3
Packet Pg. 438

2.D.2.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 29, 2019

the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating reserve, and the remaining
unrestricted fund balance. For FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund
and unrestricted fund balance should be maintained at an amount approximately
equal to three months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation. RTD
will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund balance
replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses are an
especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.

2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board-appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as economic downturns. With Board
approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the need
for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond rating.
The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled
major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases.
The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a
prompt manner.
4. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate an unrestricted operating
reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to mitigate service or
project disruptions due to revenue fluctuations, unanticipated expenditures of a
nonrecurring nature, or to avoid cash flow disruptions. The source of replenishment
of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution.

Attachment: 2020 Fiscal Policy Statement (4332 : Fiscal Policy)

RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.

6. The Board shall establish a reserve for future construction under the FasTracks plan:
• The FasTracks Management Reserve will be appropriated at a sufficient level each
year to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule, relating to
logistics or cost savings opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is
adopted, and will not be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System capital
or operating activity.
7. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding to
complete and operate additional FasTracks projects. Expenditures from the FISA will
be subject to Board approval. Funding of the FISA will be provided from the sources
4
Packet Pg. 439

2.D.2.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 29, 2019

identified in the Board approved Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) and other sources
approved by the Board.
8. All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a reserve for
future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be used to fund the
(non-FasTracks) Base System expenditures.

1. Debt financing will not be issued to support operating expenditures.
2. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, Certificates of Participation
(COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to exceed the
lesser of the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.
3. Effective communication with credit rating agencies will be maintained, and a policy
of full disclosure on every financial report and official statement will be followed.
4. Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures and the net revenue coverage ratio will be analyzed.
5. It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's credit ratings at the highest reasonably attainable level
in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to receive
lower interest rates and lower debt insurance premiums than would be possible with
lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:
