## IV. Retiree Awards

There were two retires for the month of May: Gene Barnett, Bus Operator with 22 years of service, and Matt Vigil, Facilities Maintenance Mechanic with 20 years of service.  Neither one was able to attend the Board Meeting.  Chair Sisk acknowledged the longevity of RTD employees as the backbone and heart of the organization.  He thanked the staff for their work as they are partners more than employees.

## V. Public Participation

- Scott McCarey, representing Boulder County, spoke in support of the Longmont Fare Buy Up program.  He thanked the RTD staff for its willingness to try something new without knowing what to expect.  He specifically thanked Brian Matthews, Manager for Special Services, for his availability and can-do attitude.  He stated that this program will give a better understanding of the relationship between fares and ridership in Longmont.  He noted that a 2008 demographic survey showed that 62% of Longmont riders have an annual income of $25,000 or less.  These are the individuals that will benefit from this pilot program.  Chair Sisk extended his thanks to the Boulder County Transportation staff and to Scott McCarey for leading by example.

- Indira Guzmán-Sais, representing Community Language Cooperative, encouraged the Board to be more inclusive by providing interpretation services during all RTD public meetings as well as translated materials.

- Zoë Williams, representing 9 to 5, thanked the Board of Directors for listening to her testimony and that of her peers.  She recognized RTD staff’s decision to have citizen’s input in the upcoming fare evaluation process.  She asked the Board members to be champions for lower fares as they also represent low income citizens who pay for FasTracks.  These constituents look up to the Directors for guidance, support, and leadership.

- Eva Hernández, representing Padres y Jóvenes Unidos, spoke in Spanish using a translator.  Her family depends on RTD for their transportation needs.  Her oldest of four children is a sophomore at Lincoln High School.  She stated that she is very proud of her son and his accomplishments; however, she is sad because at times, she cannot allow him to go to after school classes and/or activities because they cannot afford public transportation.   She said that extra-curricular activities are an important part of the college application process and pointed out it is unfair that youth have to be denied from their studies and cultural activities due to this problem.  She encouraged the Board to not wait to make decisions that would help families that cannot pay for public transportation now.

- Doug Gragg, Denver, indicated that the $2.25 one-way fare inhibits people from using public transportation.  He suggested that the Fare Task Force include outside participation and input.  He noted that the pronunciation of the recording on the 16th Street Mall Ride is at times unintelligible.  He also pointed out that the announcement for the light rail on the 16th Street Mall Ride only says “connections to the south” and makes no mention of the West line.

- Chris Zivalich, representing 9 to 5, stated that he patrons RTD enthusiastically.  He recently was laid off and has found it difficult to afford the fares during his job search, which at times demands multiple trips in one day.  He spoke in favor of an income-based fare.  He noted that if a program of this nature was in practice, it would help him during this hard time.  He also said that he would gladly pay regular fare once regularly employed.

- Dean LeDoux, Denver, noted the area he lives in is mostly served by Route 16, which has a lot of low income housing.  He pointed out that riders have to pay for the return trip even when the transfer slip is not expired.  He also noted that the 303-299-6000 information line is awful.  The recording does not understand the prompts he gives.  He thanked the Board for listening to his comments.

- Laura Avant, Denver spoke on behalf of income based fares.  She noted that she and her husband live on social security income and must budget in order to take the bus.  She thought the fare was $2.20, not $2.25.  Her husband found himself at the doctor’s office without enough money to return home.  Her husband, who has a leg condition, had to walk over two miles home as she was unavailable to pick him up.

- Athena Rose, Denver spoke in favor of discounted RTD passes for employees of entities such as AmeriCorps who are serving the community and receiving minimum pay for their work.  She stated that as a member of AmeriCorps she cannot afford a monthly RTD pass.

## X. General Manager's Report

General Manager Washington provided the following report:

- The ATU Northwest Regional Conference starts May 28th in Denver.  The ATU has asked General Manager Washington to address the conference.  He noted the significance of management being asked to address a Union Conference.

- The RTD FasTracks Annual Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Stakeholder and Community Update is scheduled for May 28th, 2014.   He explained that in 2005 RTD put together a number of MOUs with the minority stakeholder groups around the region after FasTracks was approved.  As part of the MOU, RTD holds this meeting every year.  General Manager Washington estimates 250 stakeholders to be in attendance.

- The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) was created in the fall of 2012 by staff to look at our revenue enhancing opportunities through a Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM).  The Board approved three priorities for the use of this revenue if realized: completion of US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), building of the North Metro Line to at least 72nd (which has now been exceeded as we are at 124th), and utilizing any remaining funds above the $300 million goal to leverage potential grants or private sector contributions for FasTracks partially-funded projects.  He noted that even though the funding is not available yet, there is a money grab attitude from different parties.  He encouraged the Directors to review the November 2012 Board Report.  He believes the response to our stakeholders is that RTD will live by the Board Report; RTD must see how much revenue is realized through the FISA and RAM.  He explained that when staff thinks there are enough funds, they will present items to the Board for approval.  General Manager Washington reiterated that the Board will make the decision on what expenditures get approved.  He wants to clear up the misconception that staff is hoarding the FISA funding.

o        Director Lubow asked if her understanding of the FISA’s money not being available until 2017 is correct.  General Manager Washington answered that it is not; staff plans to come to the Board when they feel there is enough money for a significant project.  Director Lubow inquired if the account is on track for the $300 million estimate or if it is too early to tell.  General Manager Washington said it is too early; the Board has been briefed on the account’s balance during the Finance Administration & Audit Committee Meetings in the Monthly Financial Status Report.

o        Director Folska remembers the RAM coming from the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force.  She stated that the Board members who started in 2013, including herself, did not vote on the FISA and therefore might not remember the full language of the RAM.  Director Folska thought the goal of the FISA and RAM was to complete FasTracks sooner rather than later.  She asked for further clarification as originally the goal was to build the North Metro Line up to 72nd.  She stated that the Line is now being built up to 124th, yet she recalls 104th also being mentioned.  General Manager Washington answered that the Risk Allocation Matrix was an exercise from the Senior Leadership Retreat in 2012, not the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force.  He also said that the original goal was 72nd.  Through innovative financing, the boundary was extended to 124th.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, noted that the Certificates of Participation (COPs), if approved, will finance up to 104th.  Terry Howerter added that besides the COPs, there is an anticipated $23 million in-kind contribution from local governments, $169 million from previously issued sales tax bonds, and $85 million in cash for a total of $708 million for the project.

o        Director Folska asked if the $135 million allocated for US 36 BRT has been already used and if the project could be considered completed.  General Manager Washington said that the money allocated has been used but he would not say the project is complete.

o        Director Hoy confirmed with General Manager Washington that the document with the FISA goals was from November 29, 2012.

o        Director Lubow asked about the possibility of the FISA funding up to 162nd.  General Manager Washington replied that it could.  Staff will come to the Board with a recommendation depending on what the market dictates to do next.  Ultimately it is a Board decision.

o        Chair Sisk asked for clarification on the final numbers allocated for the US 36 BRT.  Marla Lien replied that $135 million was allocated to High Performance Transportation Enterprise (HPTE) for the construction of the managed lanes.  She believes RTD has over $145 million in the total project.

- Other Matters:

o        Management has received feedback on ideas and potential improvements regarding DUS.  Considering the magnitude of the project, the modifications will be minor.

§         Director Tobiassen extended his gratitude to all the volunteers who braved the weather in order to serve during the DUS operational openings.

o        The DBJ article on Terry Howerter, who has been an integral part of the FasTracks project, was a great article.  He commented that everyone at RTD is very proud of Terry Howerter.

o        Former Bus Operations Manager Martha Hecox passed away on May 6th, 2014.  She was a great asset to the District for 20 years.

§         Director Daly invited the Directors to the celebration of Martha Hecox’s life.  He remembered her as the first women in our District, as well as nationally, to be an Operations Director.  Her first job with RTD was doing ride checks.

o        Fare Task Force

§         Chair Sisk asked when the Board could expect to see a progress report of the internal fare review.  General Manager Washington answered that the Board could expect a progress report before the end of the year.  Public input is schedule for the last half of 2015.  Board approval will be needed during the beginning of 2016.

§         Director Lubow asked for clarification as she recalled there would be quarterly reports.  General Manager Washington said that there would be quarterly reports during the Operations & Customer Service committee meetings. He thought the Chair was referring to an interim plan.  Chair Sisk noted that Director Lubow captured his question better.

§         Director Deadwyler expressed her concern over the length of the time line.  She suggested the process be streamlined and not extended to the 2016 openings.  General Manager Washington reported the Task Force has been formed.  Staff would like to hire a consultant to look through all the details as this would help the project to be well thought through.  A 2016 deadline would give enough time for implementing any new technology.

§         Director Deadwyler also noted the possible conflict of interest as the Fare Task Force and the group considering a fare increase are the same.  General Manager Washington clarified that it is only one group who will be reviewing the fares and proposing changes, if any.

§         Director Solano noted that Citizens Advisory Committee members and RTD Directors are not represented on the Task Force.  He suggested additional stakeholders’ and Director’s participation as outside influence and “devil’s advocate”.  General Manager Washington noted the process is similar to our service change process, which is done 3 times a year: staff drafts a plan for the Directors and the public to review (as outside influences), the plan is redrafted with feedback received and then the final changes are presented to the Directors for their consideration.
