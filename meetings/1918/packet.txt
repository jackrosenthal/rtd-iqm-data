General Manager 2015 Tactical Plans
Phil Washington, General Manager, introduced the Proposed Tactical Plans for Strategic
Goals and Priorities determined at the March 1, 2014 RTD Board/Senior Leadership Team
Advance as presented starting on page 3 of the Study Session Board Packet for April 22,
2014. The four priorities that were determined at the Advance are:
 Advancing/Completing FasTracks
 Fiscal Sustainability/Financial Plan
 Improve Service Delivery
 Implement Technological Advancements
Chair Sisk reminded the Directors the discussion was directed at goals for 2015 and
encouraged any questions regarding the 2014 goals and budget to be taken off line.
Questions/Comments from Board Members:
Director Tobiassen called Sherie Skinner, Manager for the Transportation Operating
Division, the best resource in bus operator retention due to her attitude and leadership. He
then commented on Information Technology (IT) and Smart Cards saying that he looks
forward to improving the interface with customers through mobile technology and
smoothing out the customer experience. He shared his experience of waiting in line for a
half-hour at King Soopers to buy a book of passes for a friend. He noted the current
external point of sales experience discourages customers from purchasing bus passes and
affect the most vulnerable that rely on them. He also added how a Smart Card or a web
interface purchase would help the process be more customer-friendly. He said that he
looks forward to IT asset management through preventive and predictive maintenance. He
referenced the operator camera, which records 20 seconds of video during erratic driving
and sends the footage to supervisors, as great technology for behavior modification.
Director Menten pointed out that some West Line funds were wasted in esthetics when
they could have been used towards more necessary items. She asked the staff’s opinion
on using city and other funding sources on unnecessary items. Marla Lien, General
Counsel, answered that what is esthetic versus what is necessary is subjective; she
explained that the Federal Transit Authority (FTA) requires that all Full Funding Grant
Agreements (FFGAs) use 1% of the funding towards art. Some local communities,
including the City and County of Denver, also have local art requirements. She noted that
other features like landscaping, green space, trees, etc. are required through codes and
zoning.

Director Menten asked for an update on the naming rights discussion the Board had
previously. She mentioned she is open to the idea of naming rights while emphasizing the
necessity to avoid confusion. Mr. Washington answered that the naming rights came out
of the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force. IMG Consulting was chosen by a Request for
Proposal (RFP). He said they presented to the Board an inventory of assets and are now
working on establishing each asset’s value. Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for
Communications, noted he is meeting with IMG Consulting in two weeks. Staff and IMG
will present updates to the Board throughout the process prior to any vote. He also
acknowledged the presentation was a bit confusing and took responsibility for not
clarifying.
Director Menten asked for a spreadsheet on the real property owned by RTD and
acknowledged it could take a while to put together. Mr. Washington said such list was
provided to the board 6 to 8 months ago and could be redistributed. Director Menten
asked Mr. Washington to resend the list as she recalled the list presented to be limited.
Director Menten mentioned that when speaking about changing rail hours she thinks we
should reduce hours as she is not sure who rides after 11:00 P.M. Director Menten asked
when the Directors would know about possible schedule changes for bus or light rail. Mr.
Washington answered that he is in conversations with Bruce Abel, Assistant General
Manager for Bus Operations, and Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager for Rail
Operations, for the August, 2014 and January, 2015 schedule changes. He explained
that the goal is to provide more maintenance hours. He said that further information will
be presented over the spring and summer.
Director Menten wondered if RTD pays anything for the Google Trip Planner. Mr. Reed
noted the Google Trip Planner is a free, open source application where RTD provides the
data every time there’s a service change. With the DUS opening, the RTD Trip Planner
will be eliminated and the Google Trip Planner will become the main tool. He shared that
staff is working on a new open source RTD Trip Planner, which will include information
tags such as parking information.
Director Lubow asked about charging patrons to use RTD parking facilities and what State
law is regarding the matter. Mr. Washington said RTD has a parking management plan
under which the first 24 hours of parking are free to residents of the District. He stated
that at this time there are no plans to change the parking management plan. Ms. Lien
added that 2013 legislation allows parking charges if the facility is operated by a third
party and the funds are not directly paid to RTD. The legislation also allows for leasing of
RTD parking facilities to third parties. No proposal has been received and any proposals
would come to the Board for approval. Mr. Washington said that RTD is listening to the
market in regards to third parties leasing parking space and the option is not ruled out.

Director Lubow asked if there have been conversations with the Northwest Corridor
stakeholders about cost sharing or if it is too early to have such conversations. Mr.
Washington acknowledged that the Northwest Corridor stakeholders may be hesitant to
commit to cost sharing because of the current lack of funding for the corridor; however,
he said that cost-sharing has been part of the conversation for 10 years. Mr. Washington
gave examples from the City and County of Denver and Aurora, where overmatching has
gone beyond hard cash into waving permit fees, right-of-way, etc. Director Lubow asked
how the funds from naming rights would be used. Mr. Washington said that is a
conversation for the Board to have.
Director Daly commended the investment for the Light Rail Simulator as a great use of
money for safety, noting a recent BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) accident where
maintenance of way employees were killed due to a poorly trained operator. He reminded
the Board of the service cuts that took place two years ago. He noted General Manager
Washington’s mention of looking to expand operations. Director Daly asked if staff would
take suggestions from the Board regarding re-evaluating some of the lines that were lost.
Mr. Washington answered in the affirmative saying every suggestion will be looked at in
terms of the service criteria of ridership and business decision.
Director Solano noted he has received positive feedback on the performance of route
104X. He also said he is glad that one of the objectives is for matching funds. He
pointed out the issue of possible unincorporated areas in Commerce City. Mr. Washington
replied he didn’t know the specific area mentioned and that it could be an annexation
issue. Chair Sisk asked Director Solano to resume this conversation with staff offline.
Director Walker noted much of the efficiencies in the document are already incorporated
into RTD practices. He asked staff about any foreseeable external influences for 2015.
Mr. Washington noted that the most important external influences are financial. Two tools
used to mitigate the external financial influences are First Southwest Company as financial
advisors and the quarterly Sales and Use Tax forecast from the Leeds School of Business.
Ms. Lien added other areas such as the Federal Government not funding some requests,
changes to the American Disability Act (ADA), and other changes in policy that could
affect RTD. Mr. Washington also mentioned some changes are due to safety such as the
requirement for all trains to have Positive Train Control (PTC) by December 31, 2015 as a
result of the Los Angeles Metrolink accident. Most agencies have to retrofit without funds
in order to comply. RTD is building FasTracks using PTC technology.

Packet Pg. 7

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 22, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow also asked about the maximum amount of routes that RTD can contract
out to private companies. Mr. Washington said the maximum is 58% and RTD is currently
at 56%.

6.A

Director Deadwyler was surprised to see some of the 2015 bullet points as she thought
they were supposed to be implemented in 2014, specifically automated call backs, phone
systems, etc. Mr. Abel noted most practices will be implemented by the last quarter of
2014 and the goals for 2015 are to expand and support implementation. Director
Deadwyler mentioned she tried using Access-a-Ride for a shared trip with her cousin who
is also her constituent. She said reservations didn’t know how to do that so she had to be
transferred to scheduling. She suggested that coordinating trip sharing and transporting
people going the same direction, i.e. same school, should be a goal in order to be more
efficient. Mr. Washington said he had no problem adding this to the plan and asked for
staff to look into it.
Director Foslka apologized for breaking order during the naming rights discussion and
thanked Mr. Washington for his proactive approach. She noted that while there are
always unforeseen circumstances that require people to react there is a lot of value and
cost savings in being proactive. She suggested the Denver Regional Mobility and Access
Council (DRMAC) as testers of the IT customer interface. She also encouraged being
mindful of purchasing accessible software and to have a third party audit its accessibility.
Director Folska asked staff if Automatic Train Stops (ATS) is tied to the control rooms.
Mr. Jenkins answered that the train depends on the operator to stay on the track, but the
ATS technology would stop the train if there is a signal violation. Director Folska noted
that the simulator cost per user is very nominal and that safety is of the utmost
importance.
Director Hoy noted that some goals overlap. He suggested Quick Response (QR) Code
technology as a great way of providing information at bus stops; he said this is something
that seems to be missing from the apps he has seen. Director Hoy expressed concern that
every bus company is trying to reinvent the wheel. He thinks that there must be a way
that RTD can work with other agencies to fine tune their apps rather than create our own.
Director Hoy stated that the ultimate goal is to make people feel comfortable stepping
onto public transportation. Mr. Reed shared that RTD does just that; we have third party
mobile apps on our website that are thoroughly test, ensuring that only the best apps are
available through the customers. He also said a mobile website is being prepared so it can
be fully functional on mobile devices without compromising the full website’s functionality.
Director Anderson thanked the staff for the great and ambitious work. She said she
would be sending her questions via email. She commented on her attendance at the State
of the City of Arvada Luncheon and how the community is very supportive of RTD and

Packet Pg. 8

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 22, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Sisk interjected to thank the Directors for their questions and not repeating each
other. He also thanked the staff for the thorough answers.

6.A

Director Bagley asked Paula Perdue, Executive Manager of the Board Office, to explain the
next steps in approving the General Manager’s Tactical Plan. Ms. Perdue replied the next
step is a meeting of the General Manager Oversight Committee by mid-May to ensure the
goals are specific, measurable, assignable, realistic, and time-related (SMART). Director
Bagley asked the Directors to please send any further comments via email to Ms. Perdue
prior to the committee meeting.
Chair Sisk concluded the discussion saying that his issues to pay attention to are the
Transit Oriented Communities (TOC), Transit Oriented Development (TOD), and the Smart
Card. He thanked Mr. Washington and the staff for all their work.

III.

Tiger Grant Submission
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning and Mike Turner, Manager for
Planning Coordination, presented the United States Department of Transportation’s
Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Discretionary Grant
Opportunity submission starting on page 28 of the Study Session Board Packet for April
22, 2014. Bill Van Meter stated that there are two submissions staff will be making
which are:
 Capital Grant for the Central Rail Connection
 Planning Grand for the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) II
Mr. Washington noted that the first TIGER application, for the Central Rail Connection,
emphasizes the historic African American Community of Denver, how the area was known
as the Harlem of the West and how the line would connect the area with business and
employment centers to the east and downtown. RTD has been pursuing letters of support
from the Congressional Delegation as well as area churches, organizations, businesses,
etc. The City and County of Denver will contribute funds.
Mr. Van Meter noted the second TIGER application will ask for planning funding for
Northwest Area Mobility Study II concentrating on CO 119 and HWY 287 as Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) corridors. CO 119 was chosen by the stakeholders, who allowed RTD to
choose the second corridor.
Director Bagley mentioned he is extremely supportive of the TIGER grant submission from
the capital project standpoint. He wondered if there needs to be Board authorization for
submission since the applications are due April 28th but the NAMS presentation is not
scheduled until May. Mr. Van Meter answered the Board authorization is not needed.

Packet Pg. 9

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 22, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

FasTracks. She shared that there is such a willingness to work together to get FasTracks
finished. She also noted that the City of Arvada has overmatched funding. At this time
Director Anderson excused herself from the rest of the session.

6.A

Director Tobiassen mentioned that the TIGER grant seemed like a great opportunity. He
noted that there had been some discussion about replacing light rail with trolleys. He
wondered about the status of this discussion. He expressed concern that we might build
something now that could be torn down in a few years. Mr. Van Meter answered that the
application is for light rail technology. Mr. Washington added that the community is on
board as they are concerned with connectivity no matter the mode. Mr. Turner said that
the community expressed they wanted the project sooner rather than later.
Director Tobiassen shared his struggle with the huge investment downtown that is
pushing out the very people that RTD is trying to effect or help. He pointed out that this
is currently happening with the Denver Rescue Mission; they have been in the same
location for years and suddenly everyone wants to get rid of them. Director Tobiassen
stated that he does not want to see something similar happen in Five Points and asked
staff to make it clear that the culture/fabric of the community would not be changing as
part of the application.
Director Daly said he also was concerned about the streetcar but if the community will not
object to the light rail we should go ahead with the plan.
Director James said he was very supportive of the Central Corridor and sees the potential
for economic development for the area. He asked for the amount asked for each
application. Mr. Washington said that the average award for capital projects ranges from
$10 million to $20 million. Mr. Van Meter added that the planning grant is for $1.5
million.
Director Lubow asked if RTD has to find additional funding for the grant and if so, where
the funds would come from. Mr. Van Meter answered that yes, RTD is responsible for
additional funds. These funds would come from the City and County of Denver as well as
FasTracks. Director Lubow noted that the planning grant would set RTD up to ask for a
capital grant in the future. She wondered how often TIGER grants happen. Mr. Van
Meter said the TIGER grants have happened every year since 2009. Director Lubow asked

Packet Pg. 10

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 22, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley said he understands the need to move but noted that the Board has not
seen the final recommendations from the first NAM Study. He expressed concern with a
submission for the grant without Board recommendations. Mr. Washington said that
timing was not ideal and staff really struggled with how to best proceed. Stakeholders’
prioritizations became final last week as there was no set date beyond spring, 2014. Mr.
Van Meter added that the idea for the TIGER submission first surfaced at the end of
February/beginning of March, 2014; at that time the original application submission
deadline was June, 2014. He said DOT recently moved the deadline to April which has
really affected the timing.

6.A

Director Hoy shared some of the concerns Director Bagley expressed about the Directors
not having input prior to the application. He noted both the CO 119 and HWY 287
corridors are north/south corridors leading to a lack of east/west connections to I-25 and
the North Metro Line. Mr. Washington told the Directors that the selection of CO 119 and
HWY 287 does not indicate lack of consideration for other corridors. TIGER criteria
changes every year and HWY 7, an east/west connection, could be pursued in the future.
Director Solano shared Director Hoy’s concern about an east/west connection. He shared
a recent conversation with St. Anthony’s Hospital staff as they expressed such a
connection to be important to them. He also said he understands where staff is coming
from and as long as that connection is still in consideration, he felt comfortable moving
ahead.
Director Folska shared the same sentiment as Directors Bagley and Hoy, especially since
she thought the NAMS results would be presented to the Directors by the end of the first
quarter of 2014. She noted that people commenting on the NAMS report in the
newspaper without the Directors having reviewed the report is troublesome. She said that
arterial BRTs without access to the North Metro or the Northwest lines could be
problematic in the long run if the BRT definition doesn’t change. Mr. Washington explained
the timing of the NAMS was a dynamic process. He further noted that the planning piece
needs to happen regardless of where the money comes from and that’s what this
application is for. Mr. Van Meter added that BRT language does not influence all grant
applications; once planning is done other available pools of funding will be researched as
necessary.
Chair Sisk said he was disappointed and caught off guard with the Director response to
the NAMS II grant application. He didn’t want the constituents and stakeholders to hear
that they couldn’t apply for a TIGER grant due to timing as the stakeholders should be
applauded and not taken to task. He also mentioned he was delighted about the Central
Corridor’s wonderful opportunity.
Director Bagley noted that the reason RTD has the current staff is because they are
trustworthy. He said if they decide to move forward with the TIGER application it is
because they considered it the best decision. He stated that as Directors it is right to

Packet Pg. 11

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 22, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

if there was a date of project completion required for the grants. Mr. Van Meter said that
there was but that he didn’t have the date readily available. Mr. Washington noted that
the Directors going to Washington, D.C. for the APTA Legislative Conference in March,
2014 was very worthwhile. He said that if the definition for BRTs is changed as
requested, this will enabled staff he ability to pursue federal dollars after the planning
steps are complete.

query the issue but reiterated his respect and support for the staff and their decision to
move forward.

Update on Market Street Development Deal - No Backup
Marla Lien, General Counsel, reminded the Board that RTD will be vacating Market Street
Station on May 11, 2014 with the DUS opening. She said that RTD has been a rent free
tenant of Market Street Station since 2011 when RTD sold the property to the City and
County of Denver (the City) to help fund DUS. She explained that when the property was
sold, RTD entered into a purchase of sale agreement with the City who entered into a
purchase of sale agreement with the Union Station Neighborhood Company (USNC). She
stated that RTD retained an easement for 20 parking spaces, utilities and loading dock.
This means that should anything need to be relocated it would be at the developers’
expense.
Marla Lien said that the developer has the right, not the obligation, to buy Market Street
Station by December 31, 2015 if they purchase the remaining 5 parcels from around DUS.
She shared that the developer just entered into an agreement to purchase Block B, the last
remaining parcel, by July 30, 2014, so staff anticipates they will be positioned to buy
Market Street Station from the City. RTD will not receive any money from that purchase;
RTD already received its funds with the selling of the property to the City. She stated that
staff does not know what the developer plans to do with the land but she believes it is
zoned for a 5 story office building.
Director James asked about any potential plans for office space for RTD Headquarters.
Mr. Washington said he has commissioned a task force to look into potential options in the
next 6-8 month. The task force will then present their findings to the Board.

V.

Other Matters
Director Bagley reminded the Directors that the General Manager Surveys are due on April
28th.
Director Folska asked Director Tobiassen to share the story of an RTD bus operator
chasing a criminal with his bus. Director Tobiassen said the event started at Centre Point
Station when a bus operator noticed someone stealing a purse. The operator followed the
perpetrator with his bus to the Aurora Library parking lot while communicating with the
Aurora Police Department in the process.
Director Tobiassen asked how Senate Bill 197 (Matt Jones bill) passing through Congress
would impact the US36 High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes. Ms. Lien replied that it
won’t impact the US36 project because that contract is signed. She explained that the bill
is targeted at Public-Private Partnerships (P3s). This means that if RTD wants to do more

Mr. Washington acknowledged a letter received by the Board from the US36
Mayors/Commissioners Coalition (MCC). He said RTD can agree with most of the items in
the letter; staff will prepare an answer noting this as well as the items RTD can’t agree
with which are:
 Railroad crossing quiet zones are not RTD responsibility as RTD is not responsible
for freight noise
 Re-evaluation of priorities i.e. not pursuing any more FasTracks except for
Northwest corridor since this puts in jeopardy safety, state of good repair issues,
and the authority of the Board
Chair Sisk reminded the Directors about the DUS Employee Party on Saturday, April 26,
2014.
Director Menten noted she had a question about the General Manager’s Report but would
take if offline.

P3s in the future, then there would be multiple layers of process and reviews that would
be required before any project could be implemented. Mr. Washington said RTD stands
neutral on the matter. Director Tobiassen said that if there was an opinion he would be
happy to pass it along to his representative.

B. Updates
Committee Chair James indicated there would be a small change in the agenda.
The Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) which normally reports out in the
FasTracks Monitoring Committee would provide an update first on the agenda.


CAC Update
Cindy Stovall shared that the last CAC meeting was April 16, 2014. The
agenda consisted of updates on the Central Rail Line Mobility Study, the I225 rail line, and the CAC members/RTD Directors one-on-one meetings.
She pointed out that a few one-on-one meetings have been rescheduled.
She expressed her appreciation to the Directors for taking time to meet with
the CAC members. She shared that sixteen out of the seventeen CAC
members attended the DUS Gala on May 8, 2014 and that many attended
the Grand Opening on May 9, 2014. The CAC looks forward to touring the
East Rail Line at the end of May.

• Bike Parking and Accessibility Plan
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, and Genevieve
Hutchison, Transportation Planner, presented the Bike Parking and
Accessibility Plan starting on page 4 of the Planning &
Development/FasTracks Monitoring/Government Relations Committee

Packet Pg. 15

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 13, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska participated via telephone.

6.B

Director Tobiassen stated that he had sent the Bike Parking and Accessibility
Plan presentation to various leaders in the bicycle community and sent their
feedback to Genevieve Hutchison via email. He noted one of the comments
identified Denver and RTD as innovators and asked RTD to be bold, brave,
and to continue to be leaders in this aspect. Director Tobiassen
recommended reaching out to experts in the cycling field to expand
creativity and innovation. He also suggested expanding the Smart Card
technology to the bicycle locker system at the light rail stations. He
suggested a “Bike Tool Tree” inside secure areas such as Boulder’s Busthen-Bike Shelters. He encouraged Staff to improve the bike parking
experience and expressed his gratitude for all their work.
Director Bagley asked Staff where most of the survey responses came from
within the District. Genevieve Hutchison replied that the responses
represented the overall District with an emphasis on Boulder and the US-36
Corridor. She mentioned the survey collected location data for specific
replies and will forward the raw results available to Directors Bagley.
Director Walker encouraged Genevieve Hutchison and her team to work with
city and/or jurisdiction bike coordinators to make the last mile, trails, and
bike lanes safe and accessible for all riders.
Chair Sisk noted Boulder has a high percentage of ridership among bike
riders. He challenged Staff to consider how to increase ridership in the
entire District by using bike parking and accessibility to the last mile. He
encouraged Staff to challenge the unchallenged and to use other transit
authorities, such as Portland’s TriMet, as an example.
Director Hoy asked Staff for feedback on the low rental rate of RTD bike
lockers, currently at 40%. He also asked Staff to monitor Boulder’s Busthen-Bike Shelters program, owned and administered by Boulder County, to
explore their success rate.
Director Lasater asked Staff to consider alternative rail options for heavier
frame/cruiser style bikes. He also inquired about bike storage in regional and
Packet Pg. 16

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 13, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Meetings Packet for May 13, 2014. Genevieve Hutchison stated the
purpose of the update as:
 background on RTD’s bike parking
 explain why RTD is doing the study
 discuss completed elements
 discuss next steps
She emphasized that the purpose of the online survey was to study bike
rider behavior. The survey identified safety and security as the top concerns
for bike riders when using RTD bike parking facilities.

6.B

Director Solano asked if Staff has looked into stops and stations that could
be suited for a pilot study on shelters similar to Boulder’s Bus-then-Bike
program. Genevieve Hutchison said she is working with Boulder County to
get more information on their program as well as studying area density and
connections in order to identify pilot stations.
Director Rivera-Malpiede thanked Staff for their work and encouraged them
to meet with leaders from Transportation Management Associations (TMA),
Transportation Management Organizations (TMO), Denver Regional Council
of Government (DRCOG) and Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT)
to explore bike programs and expand the collaborative model for the region.
Committee Chair James echoed Director Rivera-Malpiede’s recommendation.

• NAMS Update
Bill Van Meter and Chris Quinn, Project Manager for Planning, presented the
Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) Update starting on page 19 of the
Planning & Development/FasTracks Monitoring/Government Relations
Committee Meetings Packet for May 13, 2014. The NAMS update
presented 5 Key Tasks that reflect the general consensus of the Policy
Advisory Committee (PAC) on April 18, 2014:
 for I-25 Downtown Express HOV lanes, analyze potential alternatives
to facilitate reverse commute between downtown Denver and US 36
 determine remaining FasTracks Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) funding/scope
commitments for US 36 BRT Corridor
 evaluate feasibility and cost of constructing the Northwest Rail in
segments
 evaluate potential for extending North Metro Line to Longmont
 Evaluate potential mobility improvements in the area such as arterial
BRT on Diagonal and US 287
It also presented the parameter agreed upon by PAC:
“Northwest area remains committed to NW Rail as envisioned by
FasTracks and given the projected timing of the NW Rail’s
implementation, NW stakeholders want to see benefits sooner.”

local buses as bike season approaches and at times bike riders are passed up
due to full capacity. Genevieve Hutchison noted that 2 bikes fit in each of
the 2 or 3 baggage compartments of the regional buses, for a total of 4 to 6
bikes per bus. In local buses, she said it is at the discretion of the bus
operator to allow bikes inside the bus. She mentioned that her team has
looked into 3-bike racks for local buses but has not moved forward due to
safety concerns.

6.B

Chris Quinn also noted two upcoming Telephone Town Hall meetings on
May 19, 2014 and May 21, 2014.

Director Bagley asked why Staff recommends Route 119, with a 2035
projected ridership of 5,000 boardings as presented by Staff, as priority over
Highway 287, with a 2035 projected ridership of 9,000 boardings. Chris
Quinn answered that Route 119 connects the communities and job centers
in Boulder and Longmont. Bill Van Meter noted the presentation is an
update and not a recommendation, though he anticipates Staff will
recommend the study suggestions at the June 3, 2014 Planning &
Development Committee Meeting. Director Bagley asked for the cost and
mileage for each corridor. Chris Quinn answered Route 119 is 18.5 miles
and HWY 287 is 21.8 miles. Each corridor has a similar cost averaging $55
million.
Chair Sisk thanked Directors Anderson, Hoy, and Lubow for participating in
the 13 month NAMS process and commended each entity on their
participation. He hopes the Directors would see the collective nature of the
stakeholders as they came together to leverage the opportunity to make a
difference in the NW area.
Director Lubow commended HNTB as consultants and Staff for their
excellent work on NAMS. She reiterated the sentiment of the taxpayer and
stakeholders regarding the desire for rail and asked RTD to pursue annual
efforts to move forward with that plan.
Director Hoy emphasized that Route 119 was the consensus of all
stakeholders, even those who would not benefit by the route. Stakeholders
could not reach a consensus on option #2 and allowed Staff to decide.
Staff chose HWY 287. Director Hoy asked Staff to not abandon the rail
option or HWY 7, as it provides an east/west connection.
Director Solano noted the Financial Analysis’ Issues and Variables portion
alludes to assumptions that would affect the projections. Chris Quinn
explained the projections would change if the performance of the economy
and tax revenue changes. Director Solano asked why the remaining
corridors could not be financed by Certificate of Operations. Chris Quinn
answered that RTD has no ownership of the underlying property.
Packet Pg. 18

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 13, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson expressed her concern over Senate Bill 197 and any
effects it would have on the reverse commute. Marla Lien, General Counsel,
said Senate Bill 197 is not signed yet. If it is signed, then it would affect
future projects and not any already signed contracts. Director Anderson
asked if RTD would have to work with DRCOG on any long term BRT routes
outside of NAMS. Chris Quinn confirmed her assertion.

6.B

Director Lubow shared her experience commuting on both Route 119 and
HWY 287 and noted how Route 119 is already at capacity thus a better
option for a BRT. She also emphasized the strength of the communities it
connects.

• TOD Report
Bill Sirois, Manager for Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) & Planning
Coordination, and Patrick McLaughlin, Associate for TOD, presented the
TOD report starting on page 47 of the Planning & Development/FasTracks
Monitoring/Government Relations Committee Meetings Packet for May 13,
2014.
Bill Sirois pointed out the report’s new format as compact and graphically
pleasing. He noted the ground breaking for the Alameda Station Pilot Project
and the closing on the 26th and Welton property as 2014 events since the
report covers the year 2013.
Patrick McLaughlin noted the report has been released annually since 2005.
The report includes the internal database of all new real estate development
within a half a mile from transit as well as existing and future planning
activities related to TOD.
Director Lasater asked for clarification on the meaning of current and future
stops. Patrick McLaughlin used the East Rail as an example, as those
stations are under constructions. Director Lasater then asked about the
activity in the SE corridor since new developments, such as Kaiser
Permanente’s and Skyridge Medical new facilities, seem to not be included.
Patrick McLaughlin said that he could make the exact figures available. He
mentioned that both Kaiser Permanente and Skyridge are included in the
database and that perhaps were included in the “office” category.
Director Anderson was struck by the “cookie-cutter” style of most new
development along transit. Aware that RTD does not do land use planning,
she encouraged Staff to communicate the need for variety with developers.

Packet Pg. 19

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 13, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley pointed out the rail component for the NW was voted for in
2004 and could only be removed by a vote. Using the SW corridor as an
example, he noted that investments are made only when full funding for a
segment is available. He also noted that RTD consistently works in areas
where there is ridership and revenue. He understood the collaborative piece
of NAMS and challenged the statement of Route 119 connecting two
communities as HWY 287 connects 5 communities.

6.B

Director Bagley thanked Staff for the report and pointed out the increase in
retail activity in 2006 due to FlatIrons Crossing as a great example of retail
and transit.

Director Tobiassen appreciated Director Anderson’s comment on the
similarity of residential development along transit. He asked Staff for data
regarding property value changes along transit and TOD vs. away from
transit. He also inquired about the residential demographics and RTD pass
ownership along the corridors. This data, he mentioned, would be useful to
promote TOD future development. Patrick McLaughlin answered that
throughout the economic cycles, value on properties closer to transit
reduced less than those further from transit. He also mentioned he is
working with Dennis Yaklich, Market Research Manager, to develop new
surveys to give statistical snapshots on how people access stations and
what kind of transportation they are using, among other data. The findings
will be reported to the Board.
Director Lubow had a recent conversation with Bill Sirois in which he
mentioned other ideas that were not included on the update and asked him
to briefly mention them. Bill Sirois said future ideas deal with process, how
to move forward, creation of more pilots, perhaps changing the way RTD
does business, etc. He mentioned that research is being conducted
internally and externally and his team will come to the Board later in the year
with more information.
Director James thanked the Staff for the new TOD report format. He agreed
with Director Tobiassen on promoting TOD’s value creation with our
partners in the community.
Director Bagley pointed out that all corridors are different. He also noted the
Millennial Generation as the one mostly attracted to TOD, the one better
positioned after the recession, and the necessity to cater projects to that
market.
Director Solano asked about educational development along transit. Patrick
McLaughlin referred him to the second slide of the overview which included
the education category. Director Solano noted his concern regarding

Packet Pg. 20

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 13, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Solano asked for clarification on the “cultural” category. Patrick
McLaughlin said the category included museums, performance spaces, and
art galleries. He also noted the database includes development along
planned stations. Director Solano asked for an explanation on the cultural
development component along the North Metro line. Patrick McLaughlin
said it is concentrated in the Stock Show area and around 104th Avenue.

6.B

gentrification in certain Districts and wondered how to discourage the
practice.

Director Folska expressed her confusion on the University development
numbers. Bill Sirois explained the numbers were reached by ongoing
conversation with developers and trying to price them in relation to the pay
for parking program. He also said that the final price is not determined
because marketing is still working on the survey. Director Folska asked for a
deadline for the final price. Committee Chair James asked Director Folska to
address these questions offline with Staff. Director Folska replied that she
tried to ask the questions prior to the meeting and said she will contact Bill
Sirois for further clarification.

• University Retail Space
Bill Sirois presented the University Retail Space Update starting on page 82
of the Planning & Development/FasTracks Monitoring/Government Relations
Committee Meetings Packet for May 13, 2014. The update includes
University Station Apartments and the University Station Garage (USG).
Bill Sirois noted how in 2006, when the USG opened, RTD thought it was a
great idea to build a retail front. Today, the approach would be different.
Committee Chair James thanked Staff for acknowledging USG retail front as
a “lessons learned” process. He asked Staff if there was any research on
how the parking was to be structured and/or distributed. Bill Sirois said
there has been some discussion on angled parking but the City and County
of Denver was not very supportive.
Director Tobiassen noted that one of the rejected Request for Proposal (RFP)
from 2012 is close to the current RTD proposal. He expressed his
disappointment on the repetition and missing on the opportunity of working
then with a well-known developer.
Director Lubow asked for copies of the 2012 RFPs and the responses.

Packet Pg. 21

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 13, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska congratulated Phil Washington on his vision and mentioned
how I-225 and North Metro are a result of the 2010 Industry Forum vision
casting. She also congratulated Marla Lien and her team. She asked Staff
why commercial real estate development would be surprising since they
have to go through the planning, zoning, and permit processes. She
encouraged Staff to work with permit agencies in order to maximize TOD
research and development.

6.B

Committee Chair James asked if any entity has the option, interest, and/or
first buyer right of refusal on the USG other than RTD or the Federal Transit
Administration. Bill Sirois answered no.

Phil Washington noted that RTD uses all mechanisms available to promote
properties. In 2012, RFP responses were deemed unresponsive when
compared to the requested specifications. The new RFP has additions from
lessons learned and Staff believes it will get responses.

C. Other Matters
Committee Chair James asked the Directors to log out and close E-Boardroom.
Staff will assist with launching the program for the FasTracks Monitoring
Committee Meeting.

D. Next Meeting Date - June 3, 2014

Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 13, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska asked about property rights to adjacent property owners.
Marla Lien answered that RTD has never had a policy of giving property
rights to adjacent owners. Director Folska was pleased the RFP was an
open process. She also noted the importance of RTD marketing its
properties to their highest use and developing public trust with the taxpayers
RTD serves.

C. Recommended Actions

• Recommendation for Contract Award to Triunity-Hill Joint Venture for the
FasTracks Construction Management Support Consultant Contract
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award a contract to the
Triunity-Hill Joint Venture, the most qualified firm based on the application
of the evaluation criteria, in the amount not to exceed $15,150,000 for
Construction Management Support Consulting work for FasTracks for the
years 2014-2020. Funds for the award are contained in the RTD FasTracks
capital budget for each project to which they will be assigned.
Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the May 27, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Lasater seconded the motion.

6.C

Pranaya Shrestha, Senior Manager of Program Management,
recognized Jonnie Thomas of Triunity and Dan Heilig of Hill
International who were in the audience.
Pranaya Shrestha explained that as staff moved forward
developing the schedule for the North Metro Rail Line after
receiving the unsolicited proposal they realized it went beyond
the length of RTD’s current Construction Management Support
Consulting contract with Jacobs Engineering. He said that
staff feels it would not be beneficial to have people from
Jacobs Engineering begin a project and then need to be pulled
off when the contract ended. He stated that because of this,
a Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued to pursue a new
consulting contract to provide ongoing support for the North
Metro and future projects; this contract term would be for a
six year period, negotiated annually, with four (4) one-year
options.
Pranaya Shrestha shared with the Board that RTD received
four excellent proposals from Kleinfelder, LS Gallegos and
Associates, Inc., RockSol/CH2M HILL and Triunity-Hill Joint
Venture. He noted that each proposal was evaluated based on
the following criteria:
 Understanding of Project Objectives – 25%
 Technical and Management Approach – 30%
 Capabilities and Experience – 30%
 DBE/SBE Approach, WIN Program Approach, and
Creative Strategies to Ensure Diversity and Inclusion –
15%
Pranaya Shrestha informed the Board that there was a five
member evaluation team that unanimously selected TriunityHill. He commented that Triunity, the managing partner, is a
DBE firm that is a true success story of FasTracks. He said
that the DBE goal of the RFP was 27% which the firm has
committed to exceeding; they have established their own goal
of 34%. Pranaya Shrestha also noted that they were
committed to exceeding the WIN goal of 10%. He shared that
Triunity-Hill was very committed to community outreach to try
to bring on individuals that live in the community to work on
the project, which was viewed very positively during the
evaluation process.

Discussion:

6.C

Pranaya Shrestha stated that funds for the contract award are
included in the FasTracks budget for each project that the firm
will be assigned.

Director Lubow expressed concern that this contract might be
duplicative of our current FasTracks Construction Management
Support contract that goes through 2017. Pranaya Shrestha
explained that staff did not want to have anyone from Jacobs
start on North Metro because the work will go beyond the end
of our contract with them. Rick Clarke, Assistant General
Manager of Capital Programs, noted that both firms supply
RTD with people to help manage our projects; however, the
people for any project that will go beyond 2017 will come
from the Triunity-Hill team.
Chair Sisk shared that he was very impressed that the
evaluation committee unanimously selected Triunity-Hill as the
number one proposal. He wondered how the not-to-exceed
amount was determined. Chair Sisk also wondered how their
cost compared with the other proposers. Marla Lien, General
Counsel, informed the Board that for architectural and
engineering contracts price is not a factor. The proposers are
evaluated on qualifications and then a price is negotiated.
Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that their WIN and DBE
numbers were very impressive. She asked if in addition to
Triunity performing work as the managing partner if they
would also be hiring local DBEs. She also wondered if the
WIN participants would be local people as well. Pranaya
Shrestha said that Triunity-Hill had several local DBE firms that
they would be working with. General Manager Washington
noted that through the WIN program, anyone that is eligible to
work in the US can take part in the program. He explained
that RTD and Triunity-Hill would be doing outreach within the
project’s communities to encourage local participation.
Director Bagley asked if Triunity-Hill would only be working on
the North Metro Corridor. Pranaya Shrestha stated that if
there are other projects that would be in the District’s best
Packet Pg. 26

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 13, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson asked if Triunity, as the DBE partner, would
have boot on the ground. Pranaya Stated that they absolutely
would. He noted that the project manager is an employee of
Triunity. He said that RTD staff also anticipates other key
staff members will be from Triunity.

6.C

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED.

• Approval of the 2014 Annual Program Evaluation (APE)
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee the Board of
Directors approve the 2014 Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The APE
provides a comprehensive financial blueprint for all FasTracks capital
projects completed, underway or planned through the year 2019.
Motion:

Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the May 27,
2014 Board meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Rick Clarke noted that there was a Power Point presentation
included with the Board Report that is available in the May 13,
2014 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet. He
reminded the Board that staff reviewed the presentation at the
April 1, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring Committee meeting. He
explained that the goal of first presenting the item as an
update was to give the Directors a chance to review the
information and ask staff questions. He shared that his team
had received a lot of good questions from the Board.
Rick Clarke shared that staff started the Annual Program
Evaluation (APE) process in 2007 as a response to the
financial challenges that RTD was experiencing with
FasTracks. He explained that staff thought it would be a good
idea to conduct a top to bottom cost of FasTracks each year.
He said that this gives RTD a financial blueprint to manage the
overall FasTracks budget as well as each project budget. He
noted that since so many of the FasTracks projects are now in
construction the major effort has shifted from developing

Packet Pg. 27

interest to have them work on the contract allows for us to
use them. Rick Clarke said that no one from Jacobs would be
replaced on any current project with Triunity-Hill staff.

Director Bagley noted that the financial impact outlined in the
Board Report is really only a small piece of the overall APE.
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, stated
that was correct. The other components of the APE were
previously approved by the Board. He said the financial
impact in the Board Report only identified the new item that
was approved.
Director Solano noted that the APE is part of the Senate Bill
(SB) 208 Baseline Report. He wondered if the Colorado
Department of Transportation (CDOT) and Front Range
express (FREX) would also fall under the umbrella of SB 208.
Bill Van Meter stated that SB 208 only applies to RTD; if we
want to build any fixed guideway (bus rapid transit, light rail,
etc.) it must be approved by the Board with a super majority
vote (2/3) and approved by the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) through a simple majority vote. Marla
Lien noted that CDOT is subject to submitting an RTP.
Committee Chair James noted that the current committed
capital cost of FasTracks is $5.3 billion in year of expenditure
(YOE). He asked if staff could give him the total budget
including what is not currently committed in YOE. Rick Clarke
explained that the total cost of FasTracks is only available in
current year dollars as staff has not yet inflated uncommitted
projects. General Manager Washington explained that the
YOE number is very difficult for the general public to
understand so it can be counterproductive for RTD to use.

for the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) that staff will begin
presenting in June.

D. Updates

• Eagle Project Update

Kevin Flynn recognized the team present from Denver Transit Partners.
They passed out a copy of the Commuter Rail Project Quarterly Newsletter
that was recently distributed throughout the Eagle P3 communities.
Director Anderson asked that the economic impact information be sent to
her. She expressed that her constituents would be very interested in that
information. She thanked the team for the great work they were doing in
Arvada. Director Anderson noted that as the line is built through Arvada
work is literally happening in people’s backyards but she has heard very little
grousing. She said that everyone is excited about the project and cannot
wait to be able to ride the train.
Director Tobiassen wondered if there was any risk in the Aviation Station
being completed on-time as construction has not yet started. Greg Straight
stated that construction had actually been stated. He explained that this
was a project in which we were still finishing the design while we had begun
construction. He shared that all the contracts needed to complete the
station had been executed so he did not anticipate any issues with it being
completed on-time.
Director Tobiassen commented that on the Southwest Corridor there is a
detection system for derailments. He wondered if there was a similar
system for the Commuter Rail. Rick Clarke stated that generally the
Commuter Rail and freight tracks are 50 feet apart; where they are not, a
wall is built. He said there is no detection system needed like on the
Southwest Corridor because that is Light Rail, not Commuter Rail.
Director Bagley extended his congratulations and welcome to Joe Christie.
He shared that Joe Christie is one of his constituents and he is very excited
to have him on the project.
Director Solano thanked DTP for putting their newsletter in both English and
Spanish.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 13, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Rick Clarke introduced Greg Straight, Design-Build Project Manager, Kevin
Flynn, Public Information Project Manager, and Joe Christie, Construction
Project Manager. He shared with the Board that Joe Christie is a new
addition to the Eagle P3 team; he worked on Denver Union Station and after
that success, Rick Clarke said that he was very happy to have him move
over. They reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is
available in the March 13, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda
Packet.

Director Rivera-Malpiede echoed Director Solano’s thanks. She noted that
the communities affected by the project can be tough to communicate with
but the RTD and DTP teams do a great job. She said that they respond
immediately and communicate bilingually with cultural competence and
sensitivity.

Director Folska expressed her thanks to the RTD and DTP staff. She
believes that everything they do is just really outstanding. She wondered if
the re-alignment of the I-225 Line around Fitzsimmons could delay its
completion and if so, could that delay lead to a delay for the East Line. Rick
Clarke said that the design for the I-225 re-alignment is complete and staff
does not anticipate any change in either line’s opening.
Director Deadwyler congratulated the DTP team. She shared that working
with them has been great and very informative. She said the way the team
communicated with her District, especially in the Montbello area, really made
her life easier.
General Manager Washington noted that the Board was really able to realize
the national significance of this project during their recent trip to
Washington, D.C. He said that this is not only an economic investment but
is also redefining how transit mega-projects are done. He stated that the
federal administration using this project as the only example of innovative
financing in the GROW AMERICA transportation proposal is a very big deal.
He reminded the Board that this is the only P3 in transit in this country.
Committee Chair Hoy commented that the importance of this project was
really brought out loud and clear during the Denver Union Station events as
well.

E. Other Matters
Director Bagley said that there were several recent events that he wanted to share
with the Board:
 In preparation for Denver Union Station opening he has been making
presentations to the City Councils for Littleton, Cherry Hills Village and
Greenwood Village as well as the City Club of Denver. He said that these
presentations have been really well received.
 Director Bagley shared that at the D4 groundbreaking for Alameda Station,
he and General Manager Washington had a really great conversation with
Packet Pg. 30

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 13, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Sisk asked if staff could extrapolate further the economic impacts of
this project. He noted that while $802 million is a lot of money the figure is
even higher when we consider the trickle down effects. He believes looking
at the project from an economist perspective would be very impactful.

6.C



Director Anderson shared with the Board that she just completed reading a great
book, The Race Underground, about the story of transit in Boston and New York.
She thought it had a great background on what part electricity has played in transit.
She said it was very interesting, well written and fun to read.
Director Tobiassen asked staff to pass along his congratulations to Abniger Ek-Chan
and John Deschner who represented RTD at the International Bus Roadeo. He
stated that this is a very tough competition and RTD was very well represented.
Director Lasater informed the Board that he has been doing tours of DUS with
elected officials from Parker, Lone Tree, Centennial and Greenwood Village. He
said everyone from that area thinks RTD is doing an exceptionally great job.
Director Lasater noted that they were very interested in Transit Oriented
Development as well as the timelines for various lines to be completed.

four WIN participants. He congratulated General Manager Washington for
his conversation with them and for allowing Director Bagley to participate as
he thought it was a very meaningful conversation.
He and Chair Sisk attended the welcome receptions for the Max Program.
He believes this is a tremendous program that really shows RTD’s
commitment to advancing our employees.
At the DRCOG Awards Ceremony one of Director Bagley’s former City
Council Members was awarded the John. V. Christensen Memorial Award.
He said in looking at past year recipients he learned that Director Anderson
had received the award. He stated that this is a tremendous recognition for
her to have received.

C. Updates

• State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna
Julie McKenna thanked the Directors for their kind words and for allowing
their firm to represent RTD at the Capitol. Jenifer Brandeberry was in
attendance but left early due to a prior commitment.
Julie McKenna noted that BMPA’s efforts during this session focused on
educating legislators on RTD’s work. The Senate Transportation Chair, the
Hon. Nancy Todd, requested a tour of Denver Union Station (DUS), the I225 corridor, and the DIA construction for her committee members. Some
Congress members were briefed on the Northwest Area Mobility Study.
There is interest from other Congress members to attend tours and/or future
briefings.
She pointed out a few bills that were of special interest to RTD:
 Senate Bill 197 was created out of concerns over the US 36 Public
Private Partnership (P3) and public input process. The bill would
require Senate approval for certain contracts over 35 years including
contingency provisions. A number of entities expressed their concern
over the constraints proposed by the bill and pointed to RTD and its
success with P3 as an example of the collaboration potential. The bill
passed the legislature. The next step is for Gov. Hickenlooper to sign
or veto.


House Bill 1152, regarding passive surveillance records, passed. The
original bill prohibited record retention beyond 6 months. Marla Lien,

General Counsel, provided amended language allowing record
retention for criminal proceedings, felony issues, etc.
Three other bills dealing with construction defects were introduced during
the last months of the session. The goal was to address the lack of owner
occupied housing at TOD sites. None of them passed. Julie McKenna
pointed out they may be reintroduced during the next session.

Michael Dino, Senior Policy Advisor for Patton Boggs, congratulated RTD on
the success of the DUS Grand Opening. He updated the Board on two
pieces of legislation introduced in Washington, D.C.:
 On May 12, 2014 the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee introduced their version of the Transportation
Reauthorization bill. Their focus is on freight regulations as well as
programs with regional and national significance (in 2005 DUS
received $50 million through such programs). They continue to
support the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act
(TIFIA). It is in RTD’s interest to monitor the Banking and Finance
Committees and their response to this bill.
 Two weeks ago the White House introduced their version of the
Transportation Reauthorization bill. It includes funding Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT), workforce development, and the Transportation
Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program.
Michael Dino added there may not be further activity during the rest of the
session. The Transportation Reauthorization Bill may see a one year
extension as parties figure out how to continue to fund it.
Director Tobiassen thanked Patton Boggs for the successful trip in March to
the APTA Legislative Conference in Washington, D.C. and for their part on
the DUS project.
Director Walker noted that Canada recently tightened their requirements for
freight trains carrying oil. He asked if Patton Boggs could foresee any
repercussions in our country, specifically for RTD. Michael Dino said that
both the Department of Transportation and the Federal Railroad
Administration are under some scrutiny. He projects there may be some
tightening of regulations though the specifics are yet to be determined.
Director Folska thanked Patton Boggs for their work with RTD.
Phil Washington, General Manager, noted that the Secretary of
Transportation’s office called him on May 12, 2014 to apologize for
Secretary Anthony Foxx’s last minute cancellation to the DUS Grand

Opening. Phil Washington said he extended an invitation to Secretary Foxx
to visit at a later date and reiterated RTD’s desire for the TIGER grants.

Committee Chair Daly noted the Highway Trust Fund is running out of funds
and asked if there has been any discussion on how to keep the fund solvent.
Michael Dino said there is some discussion but he doesn’t foresee any
conclusion to the conversation as it would involve a tax conversation during
an election year.

• Local Government Update
Sherry Ellebracht gave the Local Government update on behalf of Roger
Sherman of CRL. CRL was logistically involved in the DUS Gala held on May
8, 2014. They are working closely with BMPA during the closing days of
the Legislative Session. CRL will attend the Colorado Municipal League and
Citizen’s Climate Lobby conferences during the summer to network on
behalf of RTD. They are closely watching Senate Bill 197.

D. Other Matters
Director Tobiassen noted that three Directors are going to Washington D.C. in June
for the Accelerate Colorado Conference. They will meet with Federal Legislators
and will communicate the Board’s message, stressing the desire for the TIGER
grants.
Director Rivera-Malpiede thanked Staff and everyone who worked on the DUS
Grand Opening and Gala logistics. She shared she has received feedback from
constituents and from people across the country who were able to participate via
the live stream video.
Phil Washington mentioned DUS had a few logistical adjustments over the first few
days of operations but overall is running great.

B. Recommended Actions

• Approval of August 2014 Service Change
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the August 2014 Service Change package as
revised and summarized in Attachment A and, further, to authorize the
General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as
necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 27, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations,
and Jessie Carter, Manager for Service Planning and
Scheduling, presented the revised August 2014 Service
Change package starting on page 3 of the Operations &
Customer Service/Financial Audit & Administration Committee
Meetings Packet for May 20, 2014. The original version of
the service changes was presented to the Operations &
Customer Service Committee on April 8, 2014. Feedback
gathered during the 6 public hearings was incorporated into
the revised package presented to the Committee at this
meeting. Bruce Abel noted that the guiding principles for
proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service
Standards
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network
and on transit dependent markets

also disparate impacts on low income and minority

 Response to changes in the communities where services

Jessie Carter highlighted the modified changes for bus routes
225, EV/ES/EX, and L. Bruce Abel pointed out that they had
found a more acceptable solution to the initial proposal to
truncate the light rail service and use a bus bridge to the final
termination point. Instead, they will have reduced frequency
yet still serve final line destinations in order to accommodate
for maintenance of way and customer service.
Director Folska asked for more details on the Southmoor light
rail service after 11 p.m. on weekdays. Jessie Carter replied
that the service will transition from every 30 minutes to hourly
from Sunday through Thursdays. Friday and Saturdays will
remain as is.
Chair Sisk congratulated the scheduling team on rerouting Bus
Route 225 in order to serve the patrons of the Community
Food Bank. He said that this reroute will impact those who
RTD needs to serve. Chair Sisk asked for clarification on an
additional SkyRide trip to Boulder at 12:30 a.m. which was
mentioned during the May 19, 2014 Telephone Town Hall.
Jessie Carter answered that he will get back to Chair Sisk
offline with the information.
Director Walker thanked Bruce Abel and his team on the
changes to the C line.
Director Solano apologized for not attending the Commerce
City Service Change Hearing on May 8, 2014 and expressed
his contentment over the growing ridership on bus route
104X.
Director Daly thanked the scheduling team for not giving up on
the bus service from Niwot to Evergreen.

Committee Vice-Chair Solano declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
enter into a contract with Boulder County to allow the County to buy up fares
on all four of the Longmont local fixed route services, herein referenced as
“The 300 series.” Specifically the 300 series are routes 323, 324, 326 and
327 and complementary Access-a-Ride services for an initial period of 6
months with options to extend the buy-up period up to two years.
Motion:

Committee Chair Lubow made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the May 27,
2014 Board meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel and Brian Matthews, Manager for Special Services,
explained that Boulder County, in cooperation with the City of
Longmont, has requested that they be allowed to “buy up” all
fares on the 300 series routes in Longmont. Boulder County
and the City of Longmont feel that one of the major reasons
that ridership has declined in Longmont over the years is due
to high fares. The objective of this action is to build ridership
and prevent future service reductions by RTD. This request is
for a 6-month period. The Federal Transit Authority (FTA)
currently considers this program a fare change, which would
require a fare equity analysis. The program could be extended
for an additional 18 months if the FTA position changes from a
fare change to a fare buy up. Brian Matthews explained that
Boulder County, in collaboration with RTD, will take the lead
on marketing.
Director Tobiassen asked what the difference is between the
proposed 300 series routes and the 16th Street Free Mall Ride,
the Free Metro Ride, and the Englewood ART Ride. Brian
Matthews replied that these were initiated as free services.

• Longmont Fare Buy Up Program

6.E

Director Daly expressed his concern aboutfree rides and the
struggles that are part of such services: abusing the system,
increase of incidents, violent circumstances, etc. He also said
he understand the idea specially when considering the
comparative mileage of the average rider of the 300 series
routes. He called Boulder County very generous in their
request to buy up the fares. Brian Matthews said that RTD is
working with the police to have them involved in all aspects of
the process. He also mentioned that riders of the 300 series
routes will be issued transfers that could be used on the Bolt,
L, Call-n-Rides, and any other RTD service.
At this time, Committee Vice-Chair Solano yielded the chairing
of the meeting to Committee Chair Lubow, who arrived a few
minutes prior.
Director Hoy asked who would be responsible for the extra
equipment, operators, etc., needed if ridership does increase.
Brian Matthews replied that Boulder County has agreed to
cover the costs during the term of the contract. Director Hoy
emphasized that if in two years the program does not work,
patrons will go from not paying a fare to paying the
appropriate designated fare at the time.
Director Bagley asked what would happen to the fares during
the 6 months/2 year contract period if fares increase across
the District. Brian Matthews answered that this specific item
has not been discussed with Boulder County yet but he does
not anticipate this being a problem. The contract has not been
signed and therefore could have an added clause regarding
Boulder County’s responsibility for the fare changes.
Director Solano asked how ridership would be measured.
Brian Matthews answered that bus operators will key
boardings into the fare box.
Director Folska asked if there is a financial benefit to RTD for
offering free rides, such as the ART shuttle and others. Bruce
Abel said he does not know the details, but overall, yes,
thereis a benefit for offering free rides. He mentioned RTD
collects forgone fares for the Englewood ART shuttle from
Packet Pg. 42

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 20, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Patrons on the 300 series routes currently pay a fare. If the
buy up is approved, patrons will no longer pay the fare. The
fare would be paid by Boulder County.

6.E

Committee Chair Lubow shared the excitement of the city of
Longmont and Boulder County over this proposal. She
explained the decrease in ridership after the fare increase since
the mileage was comparatively not enough to justify the new
price. Services were diminished due to low ridership, leading

Longmont will follow the example of Nederland, who had a

C. Updates

• CCDC Settlement Baseline Complaint Report
Bruce Abel, Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager for Contracted Services and
Alice Osner, General Superintendent for Transportation presented the
Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition (CCDC) Settlement Baseline Complaint
Report starting on page 23 of the Operations & Customer Service/Financial
Audit & Administration Committee Meetings Packet for May 20, 2014. One
of the requirements of the CCDC Settlement Agreement is for RTD to
“provide CCDC with an Initial Report. The purpose of the Initial Report will
be to determine a data baseline and to assess, in both data and other
subjective evidence available, the effect of the policy and training as
required by [the] Agreement.”
Bruce Abel, Carolyn Conover, and Alice Osner handed out the Analysis of
CCDC Agreement Securement Area Issues Data during the meeting. They
explained that the key components of the policy are:
 Large items cannot block the aisle of the bus

Packet Pg. 43

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 20, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

non-transfer ridership. Boulder County would pay the average
fare box per year, approximately $210,000, even if there is no
ridership.

6.E

Large items must be collapsed prior to boarding, and passengers must
use the seats behind the securement area for themselves and their
items
 If large items cannot be collapsed and stored behind the securement
area, those passengers will not be able to board the bus
 Large items must be readily moveable and stowed behind the
securement area
 Passengers with mobility aids, such as wheelchairs, will be given
priority boarding at bus stops.
Bruce Abel, after presenting the data, concluded that of the 161 incidents
recorded, only 40 instances were actual pass ups. Of those 40 instances, 6
are still under investigation. Pass up incidents have an average wait time of
10-15 minutes before the next bus arrives. The bus routes generating the
most pass up incidents are the 16, 15L, 15, 0. The bus operations
department is looking into ideas on how to better serve riders in mobility
devices along those routes. Bruce Abel also noted that this topic generated
a lively discussion during the American Public Transportation Association
(APTA) Bus & Paratransit Conference.
Director Anderson thanked Bruce Abel and his team for the report and for
providing better services. She mentioned that she understood how 23 of
the 161 instances were duplicate entries since she would also press the
button multiple times hoping to get dispatch’s attention. She noted that
some of the instances, including the 15 times a lift was inoperable, are an
easy fix. Carolyn Conover ensured that every bus tests their lift prior to
departing on their route. The recorded lift malfunctions were inevitable.
Director Folska thanked the staff for increasing accessibility, embracing
diversity, and giving every constituent the ability to ride on RTD. She found
the report enlightening and asked if these reports would be given to the
Directors on a quarterly basis. She recalled mentioning a while back, halfjoking, getting rid of more seats on buses to make more room for mobility
devices. Today she wonders if this may be a legitimate consideration. She
mentioned the Portland light rail’s priority seating, signs, and recordings in
English and Spanish as an example to take into consideration.
Director Tobiassen suggested staff added to the report the total number of
boardings per day in order to report how many successful boardings
compared to 15 lift failures in 6 weeks. He noted that denial of service to
anyone is always negative, but overall the numbers look impressive and staff
is doing a great job. Bruce Abel said that staff is trying to communicate that
individuals with mobility aids have a limited number of seats and those seats
need to be made available.

Committee Chair Lubow thanked the staff for the report and asked to add
the pending investigations to the next quarterly report.

David Genova, Assistant General Manager for Safety, Security, and
Facilities, noted that the high blocks along the central corridor light rail
stations are over 20 years old. Two locations, 16th and California and 16th
and Stout, will be replaced during the summer and the fall. They will each
be closed one at a time and each will be impacted for up to 30 days. RTD
will work closely with patrons and stakeholders to minimize the impact. The
work will be done by RTD’s capital programs.
Director Folska expressed her excitement over this project. She suggested
widening the blocks, adding panic buttons and/or a security phone as well as
a lip on the edge for security. David Genova replied that staff could look
into a panic button/security phone system and study what impact it may
have on the construction and cost. Regarding expanding the width, he said
that the high blocks are limited due to their position on the sidewalks. He
also noted that the high blocks will look similar to those along the West line.
Director Solano asked how the 16th Street Free Mall Ride or the 16th Street
Mall masonry will be affected. David Genova answered that the stops
where the high blocks are intersect with the mall ride but will not affect the
16th Street Free Mall Ride nor the 16th Street Mall masonry.
Director Bagley asked for the total costs of the renovations for both high
blocks. Mitch Kuharski, Construction Project Manager, said that the cost
depended on the location and that each one averaged $110,000 $120,000. The cost includes removal and replacement.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley asked for an update on the Free Metro Ride operations. David
Genova mentioned that it was very successful. Bruce Abel added that it is
operationally working well and has a promising outlook. He mentioned a small
operational incident that was quickly resolved. Passengers’ feedback is positive as
they ask when it will become an all-day service. Director Bagley asked for an
update on how the Free Metro Ride has impacted the 16th Street Free Mall Ride.
Director Bagley noted he has not received the bike survey statistics he requested
during the May 13, 2014 Planning & Development Committee Meeting. David
Genova said he would follow up.
Committee Chair Lubow recognized Director Claudia Folska as the recipient of the
WTS Rosa Parks Diversity Award. Director Folska said the award reflects RTD’s
Packet Pg. 45

commitment to women in transportation. She was inspired by the recipients in this
organization who continue to be strong models for women in transportation. She
encouraged key RTD leaders (i.e. Nadine Lee, Lacy Bell, Carolyn Conover, Alice
Osner, Danielle Smith), and every women in transportation to look into WTS as a
resource for working collaboratively. She believes this is a shared award and asked
Chair Sisk to keep the award at his RTD office.

B. Recommended Actions

• Resolution No.___, Series of 2014 Related to the Issuance of RTD
Certificates of Participation
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the
“Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional Transportation District
Certificates of Participation, Series 2014A.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 27, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Brenden Morgan, Manager of Debt and Investments,
introduced Dee Wisor with RTD’s Bond Counsel Butler Snow
and Mike Newman with RTD’s Financial Advisor First
Southwest Company. He asked Dee Wisor to discuss the
Certificates of Participation (COPs) financing that RTD is
preparing to issue.
Dee Wisor explained that this is a lease-purchase financing
agreement that is subject to annual appropriation by the
Board. He stated this is similar to what the Board has done in
prior transactions, principally for the purchase of rolling stock;
this is distinguished from what the Board has done in that this
will be financing the North Metro Line itself including the
acquisition of right-of-way, installation of other parts of line,
Packet Pg. 48

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 20, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Directors Deadwyler, Lasater and Rivera-Malpiede were absent.

6.F

etc. and not the rolling stock. Dee Wisor noted that the COPs
have been a challenge to put together but he believes RTD is
where we need to be to go to market soon.

Dee Wisor informed the Board that this resolution would
authorize the General Manager, or the Chief Financial Officer,
to make final pricing determinations when the issue is put into
the market. He pointed out that section three of the resolution
establishes parameters limiting the scope of that delegation to
a maximum principal amount of $515 and maximum annual
repayment cost of $44 million.
Brenden Morgan added that the parameters in the resolution
also set a maximum effective interest rate of 6.5%. He stated
that the maximum interest rate is much higher than the rates
that staff is currently seeing in the market. Brenden Morgan
said that staff would expect to see rates below 5% if RTD
issued today. He explained that the higher rate of 6.5% gives
staff room to navigate should the interest rate market change
by the time RTD locks in the rates.
Brenden Morgan commented that another area of interest is
the credit ratings. He shared that staff has had conversations
with the three rating agencies: Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s,
and Fitch. Brenden Morgan said that RTD has received a
rating from Fitch, affirming their A rating with a negative
outlook. He stated that staff expects to hear from the other
two within the next week.
Director Folska inquired if there was a difference in the credit
rating for COPs versus a bond. She wondered what RTD’s
credit rating is for bonds at this time as well as what the
rating was for the TREX project. Brenden Morgan stated that
there is a difference in the ratings; RTD has two different liens
of bonds, the Base System and FasTracks bonds. He said the
ratings for the Base System, or TREX project bonds, are AAA
for Standard and Poor’s, Aa2 for Moody’s, and AA+ for Fitch.

Packet Pg. 49

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 20, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Dee Wisor noted that the project being financed is the portion
of the Line from Denver Union Station to 104th as RTD has
other resources to fund the line north of 104th. He explained
that RTD does not want to have too much in the way of
District equity invested into the project for legal reasons under
Colorado Law.

6.F

Director Solano expressed confusion about the other funds
available to build the Line between 104th and 124th such as
previously issued FasTracks Sales Tax Revenue Bond
proceeds. He asked for further information about this funding.
Marla Lien, General Counsel, stated that in 2006 RTD issued
our first series of FasTracks bonds. In 2009 RTD bought the
right-of-way from Union Pacific Rail Road for $117 million,
using proceeds from the 2006 bonds, that is now part of the
North Metro project. She explained that those previous issued
bonds bought some of the land that we will now build the
North Metro Line on.
Director Bagley shared with the Board that he and Brenden
Morgan has been discussing this item earlier. He pointed out
that the Fitch rating being negative is not dissimilar from some
of RTD’s ratings on other COPs. He also noted that out of the
three rating agencies, Fitch is the most conservative. Director
Bagley said that one of the things they discussed specifically
was the issue of risk; since COPs get paid off on a yearly basis
RTD must always have the necessary revenues to pay it off.
He reiterated that while there is this risk it is not dissimilar to
the risk, previously assessed to our COPs. Brenden Morgan
stated that is correct. He explained that Fitch does see a risk
that RTD will continue to issue more debt as we build out
FasTracks. Brenden Morgan said that in reference to the
annual nature of COPs, they are structured just like a lease.
The RTD Board has the option to appropriate the annual
payment on that lease or not appropriate and walk away from
that asset.
Director Bagley stated that this negative outlook tells him that
our TABOR capacity and the ability to build other corridors or
major FasTracks pieces will be limited at this time without
other financing methods. Brenden Morgan stated that if RTD
continues to issue COPs to build projects our credit ratings will
continue to lower which will lead to higher interest rates. He
noted that as Dee Wisor mentioned, RTD also uses COPs to
purchase our buses so this could lead to higher costs for the
District.

Committee Chair Walker requested that Director Folska take
the remainder of her bond questions offline as the issue at
hand is the North Metro COPs.

6.F

Director Lubow asked if $515 million was the maximum
amount staff expects RTD would pay to build the North Metro
Line to 104th. Marla Lien stated that $515 million was not the
expected maximum cost. She explained that the Board is
authorizing the issuance of these COPs to use proceeds that
will all be spent on the project to 104th; RTD has spent some
additional funds and will spend additional funds from 104th to
124th.
Director Lubow wondered if COPs are an expensive way for
RTD to get funding because of the negative credit ratings.
Brenden Morgan stated that our lowest rating is from Fitch,
which is an A rating. He explained that in the broad pictures
this is really in the middle of the investing grade categories.
He said that is the lowest lien that RTD has issued to date so
from that perspective it is the more expensive option;
however, it is not subject to the constraints of TABOR. He
stated that this is a very valuable tool to RTD.
Chair Sisk said that he was having difficulty reconciling what
the Board approved previously, Approval of Contract Award
for Design and Construction of the North Metro Rail Line
Project, with what was being presented tonight. He stated
this is a deviation from that approval, which needs to be made
clear. Chair Sisk noted that based on this recommendation
from staff there is a need for other augmented financing
sources; he stated that the Board was not anticipating that
need when the original recommendation passed. He noted
that there was an internal decision made by staff not to seek
COP funding all the way to 124th. He asked for an explanation
of that decision by staff. Marla Lien stated that Chair Sisk
was correct. She shared that there were a variety of

Packet Pg. 51

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 20, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow noted that this COP is for $515 million while
the contract the Board approved with Regional Rail Partners
(RRP) was for a different amount. She wondered what the
$515 million covers. Marla Lien explained that the contract
that was approved with RRP only funds what RTD is paying
for the Design-Build contract. She stated that RTD has many
other costs such as additional right-of-way, purchase of
property for stations, RTD staff, system tie-in work to DTP,
etc. She reiterated that what RTD pays to the Design-Build
contractor is just a portion of what it costs RTD to build that
portion of a line.

6.F

Marla Lien explained that based on these considerations the
decision was made to cut off the use of COPs at 104th and
excluded the purchase of rolling stock to limit exposure to
certain tax considerations or fleet management issues that
would have been problematic.
Chair Sisk asked if there would be additional financing needed
to build to 104th for the reasons set forth. Marla Lien stated
that any money needed outside the COPs has already been
spent from previously allocated debt; staff is not planning on
coming back to the Board for additional funding for the
segment to 104th.
Director Hoy asked why the RTD Board and staff had not
elected to finance more of FasTracks through COPs since they
do not affect our TABOR capacity. Marla Lien explained that
interest rates and TABOR capacity are not the only
considerations when determining if RTD should use COPs;
there are many considerations that are difficult issues to
evaluate.
Director Folska informed the Board that when she was asking
about bonds earlier, her questions really had to do with freeing
up TABOR capacity so we could continue building the Line.
She asked staff to confirm that we would not be doing any
additional financing, whether bonds or COPs to build the Line
to 124th. Marla Lien stated that was correct.

considerations as to why there was a limitation on the use of
COPs to 104th. She said staff and our advisors considered:
 whether or not to include cars
 that there is already tax-exempt bond financing on the
Union Pacific right-of-way
 there is a contract with Denver Transit Partners that
must be managed around in terms of private use

• Acceptance of 2013 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors accept and enter into the record the District’s audited
financial reports relating to the year ended December 31, 2013 as prepared
by Staff and audited by the District's independent auditor, RubinBrown,
LLP.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 27, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Doug MacLeod, Manager of Financial Reporting, explained that
RTD is required by State statute, federal agencies, and our
lenders to complete an annual audit of our financial statements
as well as an A-133 audit in addition to the CAFR that is being
presented. He introduced Cheryl Wallace and Matt Marino
from RubinBrown, RTD’s independent auditor. They presented
the ViewPoints summary that is available for review in the
RTD Board Office.
Director Tobiassen noted that the report discussed RTD’s need
for testing of data recovery procedures. He stated that data
recovery and testing on live systems is very risky. He asked if
RubinBrown recommended a detailed testing procedure or if
we should get an independent, third-party for testing. Matt
Marino stated that this was something RTD’s IT department
was aware of and working on. He stated that RubinBrown
leaves the decision of how to address a recommendation up to
RTD’s management. Cheryl Wallace commented that
RubinBrown does have a niche department that works with

Packet Pg. 53

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED.

6.F

companies on IT controls. She shared that one of those team
members participated in the RTD audit to add value.

Director Folska wondered if accessibility and RTD’s
employment of people with disabilities was audited. Cheryl
Wallace stated that was not something that came up in this
year’s audit. Director Folska said she would speak with
RubinBrown about this offline as she believes there is a new
requirement for organizations receiving federal funding to have
a certain percentage of their workforce be people with
disabilities. Staff indicated they would further investigate this
requirement.
Cheryl Wallace said that one of the things RubinBrown wants
to highlight are any new standards that might affect the
District. She said that the upcoming Governmental
Accounting Standards Board’s (GASB) requirements would
impact how RTD does its pension accounting. She explained
that currently RTD only has to report a pension liability to the
extent it is behind on its annual pension contributions; under
the new requirements RTD must report a pension liability for
the entire underfunded status of the plans. Doug MacLeod
reminded the Board that this was discussed with the actuaries
during a previous meeting.
Director Menten noted that the ViewPoints document stated
that it was for Board of Directors and Management use only.
She wondered if she could share this document as she
believes it is public record. Marla Lien explained that certain
documents are prepared for the Board for their deliberation
that are considered confidential. She said once the Board
adopts the material it will become a public document.
Chair Sisk wondered if staff was running trail balances for our
financial statements with the new GASB requirements. Doug
MacLeod said that due to the changes that can happen with
Packet Pg. 54

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 20, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten expressed concern over RubinBrown’s
findings on federal grant compliance. She wondered if these
findings might be that RTD could become ineligible to receive
a grant. She asked for examples of their findings. Cheryl
Wallace said that this is just a follow-up on a prior year’s
finding. She explained that this was related to Davis-Bacon
compliance and ensuring the DBE Department was consistent
in their required documentation and retention.

the pensions, staff is not currently reporting with the new
requirements; however, they do know that if staff had to
report with these requirements today there would be an
additional $160 million in liabilities.

• First Quarter 2014 Internal Audit Report
Anne Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager for Internal Audit, and Kevin Parker,
Senior Internal Auditor, referred the Directors to the First Quarter 2014
Internal Audit Report starting on page 62 of the Operations & Customer
Service/Financial Administration & Audit Committee Meetings Packet for
May 20, 2014. There were no questions from the Directors on the update.

D. Other Matters
Director Hoy asked for a quick update on our procedures with the Colorado
Department of Revenue for assisting them with their auditing activities. Doug
MacLeod stated that RTD has currently engaged Revenue Recovery Group to
conduct our audits. He said they sent letters to six companies requesting
documentation on March 31st with an additional 14 going out in May. He informed
the Board that they would be coming back with a more thorough update as the
process gets further.

wondered if we were off for fare revenue because of people using different
methodologies to pay for fare than staff anticipated (i.e. using a pass instead
of a single ticket). Doug MacLeod explained that the biggest culprit is due
to variances in selling passes through King Soopers and Safeway. He said
that staff tries to anticipate what they will sell out of what we have
provided but it is a very difficult process. Doug MacLeod noted that Eco and
College Passes can also be difficult as fare revenue has to be spread out
over the life of the pass; RTD receives the money up front but it has not
been earned.

meetings. We had also solicited feedback from the full
Board and had tried to incorporate salient comments
into this document; however, the goal is to keep it
broad enough that it can represent the diversity of the
Board.
Director Folska indicated she felt it was appropriate to
recognize the contribution of Director Tobiassen to the
successful implementation of the paperless packets.

vendettas have no place in Board or committee
minutes. He had left the meeting to escort two of our
important guests out when the discussion around use
of electronic devices occurred. He feels it should have
been discussed offline.

appropriate as stated. He called for the question.

May Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Pro Tem Hoy began a review of the agenda for the May 27 Board meeting and
requested an update from GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair
Bagley.
GM Committee Chair Bagley indicated that he will be reporting out for a couple of minutes
before the Board. He indicated that the committee had met on May 20, 2014 to begin the
goal setting for the GM 2015 goals. They had reviewed the 4 task goals which were
established at the joint Board-staff strategic planning advance in March of this year. The
committee feels these goals were well articulated. A follow-up meeting with the General
Manager will be held sometime in early June. This document will be adopted by the full
Board at the July 15 Board meeting for the General Manager’s 2015 goals.
Chair Sisk indicated he will be acknowledging the work of GM Oversight Committee Chair
Bagley and the full committee for their efforts.
Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to approve moving
the Board agenda to the Board meeting on May 27,
2014.

precedent for recognizing groups, or individuals for their
efforts in resolutions that are already on the books.

Other Matters


Chair Sisk shared that a contractor doing work on the 16 St Mall project had contacted
some Board members. He perceives this is a staff issue and staff will advise the Board
if necessary. Paula Perdue indicated that Rick Clarke, AGM of Capital Programs, is
preparing a memo to go to the full Board.



Chair Pro Tem Hoy shared that he had met with Marla Lien, general counsel, regarding
his questions about the Certificate of Participation (COP). The COP is a complicated
process with many parts. He encouraged anyone who may have questions about
COPs to discuss with Marla Lien offline.



Chair Sisk indicated that he had also discussed the COP with Marla Lien. He feels it is
important that staff explains the reason why the scope of the area covered under the
COP for North Metro was pared down from 124th to 104th.



Dave Genova, Acting GM, reminded the Board of the DUS Plaque unveiling scheduled
for Tuesday, May 27 at 4:00 p.m. in the DUS bus concourse. Chair Pro Tem Hoy
inquired about the West Corridor plaque dedication and if it followed the same process.
Paula Perdue shared that DUS used the West Corridor as a model with all current Board
members on the plaque and using a notice to proceed date of November, 2010 for the
former Board members.



Director Bagley inquired about the DUSPA plaques and if they will be put up at the
same time. Dave Genova explained that they had about three plaques that are under
discussion. We have provided the process to them for submitting their request. This
is an ongoing discussion.



Director Bagley commented about the importance of the collaborative effort between
CDOT, City of Denver and DRCOG relative to DUSPA and suggested that a letter is
written from RTD to these entities thanking them for their efforts. He offered to reach
out to them and personally deliver this message to each of them.



Chair Sisk indicated he thought this was a noteworthy gesture and to have Director
Bagley visit with them will be outstanding.



Director Folska commented she thinks this is a wonderful idea and suggested other
Board members who are our liaisons to these various entities (i.e. DRCOG, CDOT) be
invited to participate. She feels the appreciation should be done in a collaborative and
open manner.



Director James expressed he thinks a formal letter is a great idea; he asked for
procedural clarification from Director Bagley related to the delivery of the message.



Chair Pro Tem Hoy reflected on the fact that we often have one person representing
the agency; he does not think it is inappropriate to have only one person relaying out
thanks. Chair Sisk indicated that he agreed and finds this no different from other
functions where a person represented or spoke on behalf of the agency. Chair Pro

Packet Pg. 61

Director James recommended a reminder be sent to all of the Board members
reinforcing the importance of talking to staff on questions they may have about COPs
prior to the Board meeting.

6.G



Director Folska inquired about the lack of accessible push doors at DUS. Dave Genova
responded they are looking at this but we comply with the ADA requirements relative
to the 15 pounds of resistance for the doors. We will continue to monitor these items
and others they have placed on a list as time evolves.



Director Bagley noted this was a critical issue and shared that DUSPA has elected to
retain Trammel Crow through April of 2015 to work such issues as provided under the
1-year warranty.



Chair Sisk offered up two comments for consideration:
He thanked Paula for the email about the July 11 Crawford Hotel grand opening
and reiterated there are no free rides.
o He wondered if we should begin including on our Board agendas for the
recommended action, how the voting went and who voted for or against. Paula
Perdue asked a clarifying question around this issue and indicated that currently we
provide that information to the Board members and the public from the Committee
minutes. She also expressed concerned about how massive this could get if we
elect to include the voting on the Board agenda.
Director James asked the question who would benefit from this and if it is
necessary.
Director Tobiassen concurred with these points. Chair Sisk chose to accept the
feedback and closed the discussion for now.
Chair Pro Tem Hoy shared that he had participated in a NATA meeting this morning
along with representatives from CDOT. CDOT is very excited to have their busses
using the DUS concourse and enthusiastic about partnering with RTD.

Retiree Awards
There were no retirees in April. However, Director Sisk acknowledged the hard work on a
daily basis of all the employees and what they do to make the agency look good. The
employees are quintessential to the success of this agency and represent what RTD stands
for. On behalf of the Board, he provided our thanks for all that they do.

V.

Public Participation
Chair Sisk wished everyone a happy tax day and opened up public participation. He also
wished them a happy Passover and Easter Sunday, or whichever way they celebrate.
 Doug Gragg, Denver stated that RTD needs to abandon zones. Zones are confusing
even to the drivers. Next month he will have one of the college students draft his
speech and he will be much more elegant; for today he thinks fares are too high.
We need to lower the fares for the working class, especially as you consider their
low wages and what percent of their wages have to go to transportation.


Dawn Marquantte, Aurora, spoke of the hardship she is experiencing since her car
broke down. It is extremely difficult and costly to get her kids back and forth to
school and their activities. She often has to make a decision on to walk or pay up
to $9 per day to take the bus. Her daughter’s school attendance has been affected.
She does not qualify for the discounted program option. This is an issue that not
only is she struggling with but other families as well.



Christine Jarlston, Denver, indicated that she is a college student at the University
of Denver majoring in social work. Right now she receives access to public
transportation but is concerned that after she graduates and in that interim period
of job search, she will be left without transportation options. She has chosen her
field as a way to help people but notwithstanding, this is a low paying field. She is
concerned about the need for accessible and affordable transportation options.

VI.



Regan Byrd, Centennial, also spoke about the challenges with public transportation
and lack of access to vital areas. The current zoning system from where she lives
would require an express pass of $12 per day and would easily become cost
prohibitive. She encourages RTD to seek more specific input on the structuring of
routes and fares which include users of the system who are affected. She
encourages more stable routes and encourages RTD to look at income-based
passes.



Zoë Williams, 9 to 5 representative, spoke to the challenges of women in general
and access to affordable transit. She spoke on the role of women as primary
providers in low-income households living below the poverty level. She thanked
RTD, Board members and staff for meeting with them and hopes they can continue
to have meaningful and productive dialogs. She believes the qualitative stories that
were heard from the women today helps makes this crisis more real and outlines
the issues of providing affordable transit priorities for low income, working women.



Scott Kerr introduced himself as a frequent rider of the RTD system-W Line. He
works with Bayaud Enterprises, an organization that works with people
transitioning from homelessness. These people need access to affordable public
transit. When you look at what they make, having 2 hours pay a day from their job
for public transportation, creates an unfair burden on those who are trying to get
back on their feet. They have a contract with someone in the hospitality industry
in the Denver Tech area; however, getting workers to that location is a real
challenge especially when they are challenged on how to pay for the pass or
arriving to work on time. We need to focus on creating a win-win situation and help
to solve the transportation crisis.

General Manager's Report
General Manager Washington provided the following report:
 RTD has been asked by the Downtown Denver Development about the 16 Street
Mall Transit closure on the 2nd Sunday of the month in July, August and
September. This is in celebration of the Viva Street Initiative promoting health and
fitness.
o Board member Anderson inquired about concerns on possible visitors on the
16 Street Mall who may not be mobile-are there any provisions for these
users? General Manager Washington responded they are thinking this
through.
o Director Daly asked if the drivers on the mall would take a financial loss.
General Manager Washington replied they will not have to take a financial
loss and would be redirected to other routes.
o Director James wanted more information about this Viva Initiative and
indicated we can be a good partner in this initiative.
o Director Lasater expressed that the 16 Street mall shuttle is an attraction for
people visiting from out of town. He wondered if DDP had worked with our
Tourist arm (Visit Denver) to look at possible impact on tourists for these

days in question. General Manager Washington indicated that DDP was
working with various entities affected to minimize impact during this time.
Director Deadwyler asked if the closure would be for all day. The preferable
closure would be 8-5 so some of the day could be recouped.
Director Menten asked about the financial impact to RTD. General Manager
Washington indicated that RTD will not be making any financial contribution
to this effort.

Unanimous Consent
Chair Sisk indicated that there were no items for unanimous consent. He also reminded
the Board members that if an item appears on unanimous consent, they can request it is
moved to recommended action for further discussion.

XII.

Recommended Action
A.

Approval of Funding for Light Rail Storage Tracks

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors
approve funding for the construction of light rail storage tracks as part of the I-225 Rail
Line project. The storage tracks are estimated to cost $12 million which will be funded by
the overall FasTracks program. The storage tracks are needed to add reliability to the
entire light rail system.
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to approve the funding for the
Light Rail Storage tracks.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.
Discussion: Director Lubow indicated that she would be a no vote on this item.
While she recognizes the value, she is coming from one of the
unfunded corridors and feel it is a disservice to her constituency to
use the money in this way instead of putting it toward the unfunded
corridors.
Director Solano indicated that he will also vote no. This feels to him
like robbing Peter to pay Paul. While the North Metro has been
approved, he sees little evidence of construction. He does not want
to shortchange the North Metro or northwest so until he sees
progress, he will vote no.
Vote on
Motion:

The motion passed with 12 in favor (Anderson, Bagley, Deadwyler,
Folska, Hoy, James, Lasater, Rivera-Malpiede, Sisk, Tobiassen and
Walker) and three against (Lubow, Menten, Solano).

Adoption of 2015 Performance Measures

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board
of Directors adopts the attached 2015 Performance Measures for Goals 1-7. There are
23 performance measures in total.
Primary Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to approve the
adoption of the 2015 Performance Measures.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Friendly Primary
Amendment:

Director Lasater made a friendly amendment to change
item 4.1, average TIC speed to answer, from the
proposed goal of <75 to <65 seconds.
Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion on
friendly Primary
amendment:

Initially Director Anderson as mover of the primary
motion accepted the friendly amendment but later
retracted.
Director Lasater indicated that he had several
conversations with staff and they had concur to change
the goal for 2015. Many of the concerns expressed
were for 2016 so they think the <65 is doable for
2015. Scott Reed, AGM, confirmed that they had taken
a look at this goal and concur for 2015. However,
given all the proposed changes for 2016 (i.e
technology, space, facilities, etc) they want to review
this goal for 2016 and make possible adjustments.

Director Walker expressed some discomfort with
lowering this goal without a good baseline.
Director Solano indicated that he could not support
this. He is concerned about the unionized employees.
This will put undue demand on the employees, concern
over equipment, comfortable working environment,
ergonomic concerns, etc. AGM Reed responded they
are already in the process of looking at a lot of things.
The performance measures are management tool. They
believe the <65 is attainable.
Director Deadwyler inquired if they were achieving the
goal today. AGM Scott Reed indicated yes. Director
Deadwyler expressed that union employees have a lot
of pride. She believes they are setting the goal where
it is achievable for the employees.
Director Daly expressed more concerns about the
working environment (i.e. crowdiness, etc)
Vote on Friendly

The friendly amendment passed with 8 in favor

Reed indicated it would not for 2015.

8.A

Discussion:

Chair Sisk made a motion to postpone item 3.1,
system wide-on- time performance with no date certain
until further information about this measure is provided.
Director Folska seconded the motion.
General Manager Washington indicated that staff
usually does due diligence in getting information to the
Board members in a timely manner for them to make
decisions. He apologized that this items had slipped in
the cracks. They believe that changing this measure is
the right thing to do and they will provide further
information on the reason why. They do not want to
ram this through and therefore they concur with this
motion to postpone until later in the summer when they
will bring it back with other measures.
Director Deadwyler commented that she believes the
whole Board action should be tabled until further
consideration. However, this is not a motion.
Director James inquired if biringing this back at a later
time will provide sufficient time for discussion and
implementation. GM Washington clarified the action
was only to postpone item 3.1 and all the other
measures would move forward as amended.
Director Lasater commented that he had discussed with
AGM Abel who feels bad that this information was
delayed. However AGM Abel has several good reasons
why this change is important and needed. He believes
the Board can make better decisions when this
information is received.
Director Hoy asked for a clarification on when that
information would be forthcoming.

Vote on Secondary

Director Folska asked the AGM, Rail Operations, about the dog who rode for free
on the light rail. This was a personal interest story in the Denver Post.
Director Walker shared that he had used a divergent diamond highway when in
Grand Junction. This was a much simpler experience than he had imagined. He
thinks the divergent diamond going into Boulder will work great for commuting.
Director Walker shared that he had received calls from students at Metro State
interviewing him about being a Director. Others added that they have also received
calls or performed personal interviews with students as well.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: May 8, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

May 7, 2014

Board Meeting Date: May 27, 2014

Subject:

Approval of the
Evaluation (APE)

2014

Annual

Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee the Board of Directors approve the 2014
Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The APE provides a comprehensive financial blueprint for all
FasTracks capital projects completed, underway or planned through the year 2019.
BACKGROUND
RTD has been conducting an Annual Program Evaluation since 2007. Given the challenges of managing
a multi-billion dollar capital program, it is desirable to perform a complete analysis of the cost of the
program. The APE captures all project expenses to date and all planned expenses through the year
2019 on a project-by-project basis. It essentially provides a baseline capital budget for board-approved
projects currently underway or planned in the near future.
Since so many of the FasTracks projects are now in construction, the major effort has shifted from
developing accurate estimates of costs to one of managing the projects within the Board-approved
budgets for those projects. The staff provides the Board with regular updates on the FasTracks projects
throughout the year.
On April 1, staff provided an update on the 2014 APE to the FasTracks Monitoring Committee with the
intention of bringing it to the Board at a later date for approval. That presentation is attached. There
have been no changes to the project information since that presentation.
DISCUSSION
The project-by-project cost along with the amount spent through 2013 is shown in the attached
presentation. The total FasTracks budget through 2019 is approximately $5.3 billion, and approximately
$3 billion of this total was spent through the end of 2013.
Since most of our projects are complete or under construction and are being managed within the Boardapproved budgets, the changes to this APE are relatively small. The changes primarily reflect updates to
the project scope and accounting as shown on the attached presentation. A summary of these changes
for the 2014 APE capital budget is:


Incorporation of the US36 BRT scope as approved by the Board in September 2013; with the
exception of the Broomfield parking structure and the north/west-bound Church Ranch platform
which will be completed after 2019;



I-225 storage tracks approved by the Board in April 2014;



Incorporation into the capital budget of the additional (4) Eagle vehicles approved by the Board in
December 2013;

Packet Pg. 75

11.A



Purchase of BNSF right-of-way, west of Ward Road on the Gold Line approved by the Board in
2010.

This APE is a key input to the overall, long-term financial plan that is part of the Senate Bill (SB) 208
Baseline Report that is scheduled to be reviewed by the RTD Board and submitted to DRCOG in the
summer of 2014. The SB 208 and related Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) amendment will include a
comprehensive financial plan that includes all costs and revenues for both base system and FasTracks
through the year 2040.
Future implementation of projects not included in the current APE, must identify the necessary changes
to the financial plan and be submitted to the Board for approval before they could proceed. Therefore,
the APE is a dynamic tool, which is updated as projects move towards completion and any changes
approved by the Board are incorporated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The acceleration of the US 36 BRT project scope through 2018 totals $17.45 million. Of this total,
$1.25 million would be funded through a FASTER grant received in 2014, and the balance of $16.2
million would be funded through the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).
The remaining
changes would be funded within the cash flow of the financial plan adopted by the Board of Directors in
November 2013.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee the
Board of Directors approve the 2014 Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The APE provides a
comprehensive financial blueprint for all FasTracks capital projects completed, underway or planned
through the year 2019.
2. Do not approve the 2014 APE. This is not recommended as FasTracks would not have an updated,
capital budget to manage the program through the year 2019.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

Board Meeting Date: May 27, 2014

Subject:

Approval of August 2014 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the August 2014 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A and,
further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary
for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will adjust services in response to
changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. As part of an overall
effort to maintain our light rail system in a state of good repair, we are proposing changes to the late
night service on light rail, which will create a wider maintenance window for repairs to infrastructure.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate impacts on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Six public hearings were held between May 7 th and May 14th in Evergreen, Aurora, Commerce City
Denver and Boulder. Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in
Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the
August 2014 service change. Also included in these changes are items changed by amendment of the
initial proposal, through actions of the Board of Directors:

Route 225 – Boulder/Broomfield via Baseline & US 287: a reroute of service

11.B.a

Route 6 – East 6th Avenue/North Pecos
This proposal adds a 5:19am eastbound trip from Wewatta/16th to Centrepoint & Sable,
which will provide earlier reverse peak service into the city of Aurora. A running time
analysis will also be conducted to improve on-time performance. Cost estimated to be
approximately $10,300 annualized.
Route 8 – North Broadway/Huron
It is proposed to realign trips after 6:30 p.m. and all day weekends and holiday service to
operate into Civic Center Station. Southbound buses would enter from Broadway,
northbound buses would travel via West Colfax and 15th Street. An additional trip in the
PM peak, leaving southbound at around 5:26pm, from Wagon Road Park-n-Ride is also
proposed to cover a current service gap in the schedule. Saturday running time
adjustments are also needed. Cost estimated to be approximately $10,300 annualized.
Route 9 – West 10th Avenue
It is proposed to discontinue the 8:10 p.m. westbound trip and use the savings to add an
eastbound school tripper at 6:22 a.m. from Lakewood-Wadsworth Station. Boardings on
the 8:10 p.m. trip in the January 2014 runboard averaged 7. School service will also be
resumed. This proposal results in a negligible net savings.
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue
It is proposed to add a 5:12am eastbound trip from I-25 & Broadway to Centrepoint &
Sable. This improvement provides earlier reverse commute service into the city of Aurora.
School service will also be reinstated. Anticipated cost is estimated to be $11,400
annualized.
Route 15L – East Colfax Limited
Schedule adjustments with no cost impacts anticipated.
Route 16 – West Colfax
Schedule adjustments with no cost impacts anticipated.
Route 20 – 20th Avenue
It is proposed to adjust the evening peak period schedule on this service in both directions
to improve the transition between the peak and off peak service levels. No anticipated
cost impact.
Route 21 – Evans Avenue
This proposal extends Sunday service hours from 8:00pm to 11:00pm, east of Evans
Station to Centrepoint & Sable. Current Sunday productivity averages 35 boardings per
hour.
Cost anticipated to be approximately 4 Sunday/Holiday hours and $9,400
annualized.

Nine Mile at 7:13 and terminating at I-25 & Broadway at 7:35 with connections to the
7:38 0Ltd and other routes. This will help relieve overcrowding on the 7:04 and 7:19
northbound trips, which are each experiencing Weekday average passenger loads of over
420 and thus nearing Service Standards. This trip would run Mondays-Thursdays, in
conjunction with the new fourth day of service. Anticipated cost is estimated to be
$70,800 annualized.
W-Line – it is proposed to discontinue four of the most unproductive round-trips of the
Weekday: Eastbound trips from Federal Center Station at 6:01 AM, 3:00 PM, 3:15 PM,
and 6:45 PM and Westbound trips from Union Station at 5:40 AM, 2:25 PM, 2:55 PM,

C/E/F-Line – It is proposed to continue the peak C and E Line service through the midday,
with each line alternating every 30 minutes. The F-Line would also run through the
midday with 30-minute service. This would create a combined 15-minute headway on the
Southeast Corridor between Belleview Station and Lincoln Station.
This proposal
increases connections to and from the W-Line at Auraria West Station and provides more
service to the Auraria at Colfax Station for students at the campus and helps alleviate the
pullin and pullout issues at the end of the morning peak period and before the afternoon
peak period. This operation requires 10 trains instead of the current 6 during the midday.
Anticipated cost is estimated to be $590,000 annualized.

Weeknight (Sunnday-Thursday) Service
D/E/H/W-Line – To provide longer windows for maintenance-of-way it is proposed to
adjust late night and early morning service. Late night service is proposed for changes
Sunday through Thursday nights. This change continues the span of service Sunday
through Thursday nights through 1:00 AM and reduces the frequency from 30 minutes to
60 minutes after 11:00 PM. This proposal will impact approximately 442 passengers on
Sundays and 358 passengers on Mondays-Thursdays.
D-Line - It is proposed to discontinue the 11:30 PM, 12:30 AM, and 1:30 AM southbound
D-Line trips (from 30th & Downing Station) in addition to the 10:46 PM, 11:46 PM, and
12:46 AM northbound D-Line trips (from Mineral Station).

(from Lincoln Station).
W-Line - It is proposed to discontinue the 11:32 PM and 12:32 AM westbound W-Line
trips (from Union Station) in addition to the 12:30 AM and 1:15 AM eastbound W-Line
trips (from Jefferson County Government Center - Golden Station).
Total hours saved: 18.58 daily, 4,738.75 annual. Anticipated savings of approximately
$695,000 annualized.

Additional 15-minute Service
D/E/H-Line – It is proposed It is proposed to extend the current 15-minute headways
ending at approximately 9:30 PM from downtown Denver another hour to approximately

direction between Dayton Station and Nine Mile Station and also reschedule the bus
connections at Nine Mile Station to the Route 35, 121, 130, 131, 133, 135, and 139 to
improve transfers and make the service more reliable. No changes in hours proposed.
W-Line – it is proposed to adjust running times on the W-Line based on modifications in
regards to the quiet zone crossings. It is anticipated that up to one minute will be saved in
both directions, which will also help with the layover/recovery time at Jefferson County
Government Center Station. This adjustment will save an all-day train on Weekdays and
Saturdays/Sundays.
Total anticipated cost savings is estimated to be -$1,157,000 annualized.

School trippers added/adjusted:
D-Line (train 14), H-Line (train 57). Both are proposed to operate on Monday-Thursday
only, utilizing the new fourth class of service schedule.
Special Services
BroncosRide
It is proposed that RTD discontinue the following RTD BroncosRide Routes for the 2014
season: Federal Center Station BroncosRide and Market Street Station. Alternative for
the Federal Center Station will be the West Line Light Rail. With the closing of Market
Street Station, the Market Street Shuttle would be discontinued. Alternative service will
also be the West Line Light Rail (W-line), Southeast Light Rail (E-Line), operating out of
Union Station.
Due to bus constraints associated with week night games, it is also proposed that RTD
discontinue service to the Alameda & Havana PnR and East High School for weeknight
games only. Currently these two locations do not have preseason service. This proposal
will extend to any regular season weeknight games only. Alameda & Havana alternatives
will include BroncosRide out of South High School or any station along the Southeast Light
Rail Line. East High School alternative will be the Route 15Ltd which is being extended to
the Decatur-Federal Station. Approximately 150 customers will be effected each game.
Savings: Annual Savings -$6,100.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: May 14, 2014

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

May 14, 2014

Board Meeting Date: May 27, 2014

Subject:

Longmont fare Buy Up Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Boulder County to allow the
County to buy up fares on all four of the Longmont local fixed route services, herein referenced as “The 300
series.” Specifically the 300 series are routes 323, 324, 326 and 327 and complementary Access-a-Ride
services for an initial period of 6 months with options to extend the buy-up period up to two years.
BACKGROUND
Boulder County, in cooperation with the City of Longmont, has requested that they be allowed to “buy up”
all fares on the 300 series routes in Longmont. Boulder County and the City of Longmont feel that one of
the major reasons that ridership has declined in Longmont over the years is due to high fares. The objective
of this action is to build ridership and prevent future service reductions by the RTD.
DISCUSSION
Boulder County has agreed to reimburse the RTD up to $286,000 on an annual basis (staff estimate is
$210,000 for fixed-route plus approximately $10,000 for ADA annually) for fares on the 300 series routes
and any additional dollars for Access-a-Ride trips that fall within the ADA service area boundaries of the 300
series routes. This dollar amount was established based on 300 series fare revenue from 2012. Originally,
this program request was for a two year period. However, the FTA felt that this would constitute a fare
change and therefore required a fare equity analysis. The program was scaled back to a 6 month
promotional period that would run from July-December 2014. This promotional period is in line with FTA
policy and will not require a fare equity analysis. This request is for a 6 month period but would be extended
an additional 18 months if Boulder County can receive FTA approval. During the dates specified above, there
will be no fare for any passenger boarding any 300 series route. All passengers will be allowed unlimited
boardings on all 300 Series routes, in both directions, throughout the day and throughout the promotional
period. Ridership is currently about 600 boardings per day from previous highs of over 800 boardings per
day. All RTD rules, regulations, and codes of conduct will be the same as if passengers were paying fares.
Transit operators, other RTD staff and members of law enforcement will continue to have the discretion to
refuse boarding to any passenger they deem will compromise the safety of others. Transfers will be issued
to any passengers requesting a transfer. This program will not include the Call-n-Ride or regional routes
operating within Longmont. The purpose of the program is to focus on fixed route local ridership. The Calln-Ride ridership should not be affected by this program. The County has also agreed that RTD will not be
responsible for any additional operational costs required to stay within RTD service standards should ridership
increases generate a need for additional service; any new cost will be borne by Boulder County. The local
agencies, specifically Boulder County and City of Longmont, will perform the majority of the marketing and
publicity for this program with the approval of RTD Marketing. RTD will promote this program at appropriate
locations on the RTD website. Boulder County, City of Longmont and RTD will hold quarterly meetings to
discuss any issues that need to be addressed with the Buy Up program. Boulder County will take the lead
organizing and hosting these meetings.

Acceptance of 2013 Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2013 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP.
BACKGROUND
State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. The District is also
required to provide annual audited financial statements to external entities and other government
organizations to be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements, and other contractual
documents. The accounting firm of RubinBrown, LLP performed the 2013 audit. In addition to the
requirements set forth in state statutes, the audit also was designed to fulfill the requirements of the
federal Single Audit Act of 1984 and related OMB circular A-133.
DISCUSSION
A confidential electronic copy of the 2013 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) has been
included in MinuteTraq. Bound copies will be provided at the meeting on May 20. We have been
advised by the auditor’s that the financial statements in the enclosed CAFR present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the District as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of its
operations and its cash flow for the 2013 and 2012 fiscal years in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2013 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP. This is the recommended action, state statutes and other sources, such as
rating agencies and other legal covenants, require the District to enter annual audited financial
statements into the record.
2. Do not accept and enter into the record the audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2013 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District’s independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP. This is not the recommended action, since state statutes and other sources,
such as rating agencies and other legal covenants, require the District to enter annual audited
financial statements into the record.

Recommendation for Contract Award to
Triunity-Hill Joint Venture for the FasTracks
Construction Management Support Consultant
Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to award a contract to the Triunity-Hill Joint Venture, the most qualified firm based
on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the amount not to exceed $15,150,000 for Construction
Management Support Consulting work for FasTracks for the years 2014-2020. Funds for the award are
contained in the RTD FasTracks capital budget for each project to which they will be assigned.
BACKGROUND
Since the start of FasTracks, RTD has utilized the expertise of various management support consultants
to provide specialized program management expertise, fill short term staffing needs, and augment the
RTD FasTracks staff. Most of these multi-year contracts, like RTD’s current Program Support
Consultant, will reach the end of their contract terms in 2017. However, with the start of the North
Metro corridor project and the potential for future projects, RTD’s program support needs will extend
beyond 2017. Therefore, RTD decided to pursue a new consulting contract to provide ongoing support
for North Metro and future projects.
In February 2014, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Construction Management Support
Consulting Services for the FasTracks program, with an initial focus on the North Metro project. This
contract term would extend for six years, negotiated annually, with four (4) one-year options. On March
12, 2014, four excellent, written proposals were received, listed here in alphabetical order:





Kleinfelder
LS Gallegos and Associates, Inc.
RockSol/CH2M HILL
Triunity-Hill Joint Venture

A five-member evaluation team was formed to review these proposals and select the best qualified
team, based on the following evaluation criteria from the RFP:
A. Understanding of Project Objectives............................................25%
B. Technical and Management Approach .........................................30%
C. Capabilities and Experience ........................................................30%
D. DBE/SBE Approach, WIN Program Approach, and Creative
Strategies to Ensure Diversity and Inclusion .................................15%
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 120

12.E

After reviewing and scoring the proposals individually, the five-member evaluation team met and scored
the written proposals as a team. While there were differences in ranking the third and fourth proposals,
the reviewers had consistently ranked the top two proposals, with unanimous consent on the
recommended proposer. Additionally, both the individual and consensus scores provided enough of a
gap that a best-qualified choice was evident.
During the consensus review meeting, the proposal evaluation team discussed strengths and
weaknesses of each proposal, compared scoring, and developed a consensus score and ranking for each
firm. The Triunity-Hill JV scored the highest ranking within the criteria and was the consensus selection.
Triunity is a locally based DBE company.
The Triunity-Hill JV, which includes a certified DBE as 51% managing partner, has committed to meeting
RTD’s initial DBE Goal of 27% for this Contract, and has set their own goal of 34%. Additionally,
Triunity-Hill JV has committed to meeting or exceeding RTD’s 10% WIN Program Goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the contract award are included in the FasTracks budget for each project that the firm will be
assigned.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award a contract to the Triunity-Hill
Joint Venture, the most qualified firm based on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the
amount not to exceed $15,150,000 for Construction Management Support Consulting work for
FasTracks for the years 2014-2020. Funds for the award are contained in the RTD FasTracks capital
budget for each project to which they will be assigned.
2. Reject all submittals and re-solicit for new proposals. This is not recommended as the evaluation
criteria was in accordance with the Brooks Act requiring a qualifications based selection. Triunity-Hill
JV’s proposal was fully responsive to the selection criteria. Also, the evaluation team was
unanimous in its recommended selection of Triunity-Hill JV; a significant endorsement of this
proposal.
3. Reject all submittals and reconsider the current program management approach. This is not
recommended as RTD doesn’t currently have sufficient staff available to manage the North Metro
project, and does not desire an increase in RTD staffing headcount at this late point in the program.

Subject:

State Legislative Liaison Services Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager to enter into an agreement for state legislative liaison services with
Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BMPA) to exercise a one-year option (June 30, 2014 through
June 29, 2015) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-001, at a cost of $112,000, pursuant to the Contract
Award agreement.
BACKGROUND
Contract 13-DX-001 for State Legislative Liaison Services was signed with Brandeberry~McKenna
Public Affairs, effective June 30, 2013, and contained a provision for four (4) additional one-year option
periods. This board action would exercise the option for Year 1 of the option years. Of extreme
importance, the lobbyists are in daily contact with state legislators regarding bills that RTD seeks to have
passed, as well as regarding bills that would be harmful to RTD.
DISCUSSION
The state lobbying team provides guidance and direction for the RTD Board of Directors and staff in
their relationships with the General Assembly members. Constant monitoring of the activities within
the General Assembly and the Executive Office of the state of Colorado is required, and RTD’s
interests must be conveyed to appropriate legislators, including testifying before certain committees.
Advice and assistance in drafting legislation are also provided by the lobbying team. When RTD has
had legislation before the General Assembly, Brandeberry~McKenna has done an excellent job of
making certain that these bills pass and become part of the Colorado statutes.
As part of the services, frequent contact is made with RTD staff and board members regarding various
bills in the legislature; written summary reports are issued on a weekly basis during the legislative
session; and status reports are given at the Government Relations Committee meetings while the
General Assembly is in session and as deemed necessary thereafter.
The Brandeberry~McKenna team also takes the initiative to educate state legislators on RTD issues and
projects so that these legislators understand mass transit and RTD’s mission.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the Recommended Action. It is recommended by RTD’s Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement for state
legislative liaison services with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BMPA) to exercise a one-year
option (June 30, 2014 through June 29, 2015) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-001, at a cost of
$112,000, pursuant to the Contract Award agreement.
2. Do not approve the Recommended Action. Do not accept the recommendation by the
Government Relations Committee that authorizes the General Manager to enter into a contract to
execute the state legislative liaison services one-year option agreement. A new Request for

Packet Pg. 123

12.F

Proposals could be sent to interested parties, interviews conducted, and a different state lobbying
firm could possibly be selected by the Government Relations Committee and retained. This action
is not recommended because it is the consensus of the Government Relations Committee to
recommend to the Board the selection of the Brandeberry~McKenna team.
3. Do not approve the Recommended Action. Do not retain the services of a state legislative liaison
firm. This action is not recommended because it would put RTD in the position of facing
contentious and potentially harmful legislative issues with no direct legislative liaison services. It
was determined by the Government Relations Committee that the Brandeberry~McKenna team
has been very effective in pursuing the RTD state legislative agenda and will continue to
represent RTD’s interests very well in the future. This team is very familiar with RTD’s issues
and policies.

May 15, 2014

Board Meeting Date: May 27, 2014

Subject:

Resolution No.___, Series of 2014 Related to
the Issuance of RTD Certificates of
Participation

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional
Transportation District Certificates of Participation, Series 2014A.
BACKGROUND:
The Board adopted Resolution No. 1744 (Series of 2013) on November 26, 2013 expressing its
intent to raise capital to finance the North Metro Rail Line to 124th Avenue through the issuance of
Certificates of Participation (COPs).
DISSCUSSION:
This action item discusses the financing of the North Metro Rail Line project and provides a
Resolution authorizing staff to proceed with issuing COPs to fund the portion of the project between
Denver Union Station and 104th Avenue. The portion of the North Metro Rail Line project between
104th and 124th Avenues is being funded with other funds available to the District including
previously issued FasTracks Sales Tax Revenue Bond proceeds, local government in kind
contributions and RTD unrestricted cash.
The Resolution provides for (a) a principal amount of the Base Rentals payable by the District
pursuant to the Lease of up to $515,000,000 (b) maximum annual amount of Base Rentals payable
in any Fiscal Year of up to $44,000,000 and (c) a maximum net effective interest rate of 6.5%. The
District intends to reimburse itself for certain prior expenditures related to the project with the
proceeds from these COPs as outlined in the Reimbursement Resolution adopted by the Board in
December 2013.
The resolution authorizes staff to determine if obtaining municipal bond insurance for all or a portion
of the 2014A COPs is in the best interests of the District and if so, to select a bond insurer to issue
a municipal bond insurance policy and execute any related documents or agreements required to
obtain the insurance.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
COPs, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a Preliminary
Official Statement, Ground Lease, Lease, Continuing Disclosure Agreement, Certificate Purchase
Agreement, Indenture and the Certificate Resolution. The Board is being requested, through the
Certificate Resolution to authorize the issuance, to establish the parameters and to approve
agreements required in connection with the issuance of the COPs.

Packet Pg. 125

12.G

Drafts of documents in substantially final form referenced in the Certificate Resolution including the
Preliminary Official Statement, Ground Lease, Lease, Continuing Disclosure Agreement, Certificate
Purchase Agreement and Indenture are available for review in the Board Office.
The Chief Financial Officer has also hosted meetings with Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch to
provide an overview of the plan of finance for the North Metro Rail Line. A credit rating has been
requested from each of the three rating agency for these COPs.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisor, Butler
Snow LLP as Bond Counsel and Hogan Lovells and Bookhardt & O’Toole as Co-Disclosure Counsel in
regard to the COPs. The COPs will be underwritten by a team including J.P. Morgan (55%), Piper
Jaffray (15%), BMO Capital Markets (15%), Loop Capital Markets (10%) and Harvestons Securities
(5%).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the financing are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and
miscellaneous costs. Total costs of issuance are expected to be approximately $2.7 million.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2014, authorizing the issuance of the District’s Certificates of Participation, Series 2014A.
This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series
of 2014, authorizing the issuance of the District’s Certificates of Participation, Series 2014A.
This is not the recommended action.

substantially the form of the Preliminary Official Statement filed with the District, is in all
respects approved, authorized and confirmed, and the Chair is hereby authorized and directed to
affix his signature to the Official Statement for and on behalf of the District, with such changes
as may be approved by the General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer. The distribution by
the Underwriters of the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement to all
interested persons in connection with the sale of the 2014A Certificates is hereby ratified,
approved and confirmed.
Section 6.
Authorization to Execute Collateral Documents. The Secretary or
Assistant Secretary authorized to act on behalf of the Secretary is hereby authorized and directed
to attest all signatures and acts of any official of the District in connection with the matters
authorized by this Resolution and to place the seal of the District on any document authorized
and approved by this Resolution. The Chair, the Secretary and other officials and employees of
the District are hereby authorized and directed to execute and deliver for and on behalf of the
District any and all additional certificates, documents and other papers, and to perform all other
acts that they may deem necessary or appropriate in order to implement and carry out the
transactions and other matters authorized by this Resolution. The execution of any instrument by
the appropriate officers and employees of the District herein authorized shall be conclusive
evidence of the approval by the District of such instrument in accordance with the terms hereof.
Section 7.
No General Obligation Debt. No provision of this Resolution, the
Ground Lease, the Lease, the Indenture or the 2014A Certificates shall be construed as creating
or constituting a general obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial
obligation of the District within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision, nor a
mandatory charge or requirement against the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then
current fiscal year. The District shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to
the 2014A Certificates except in connection with the payment of the Base Rentals (as defined in
the Lease) and certain other payments under the Lease, which payments may be terminated by
the District in accordance with the provisions of the Lease. Neither the Ground Lease, the Lease
nor the 2014A Certificates shall constitute a mandatory charge or requirement of the District in
any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year or constitute or give rise to a general
obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within
the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation and shall not constitute a multiple
fiscal year direct or indirect District debt or other financial obligation whatsoever. No provision
of the Ground Lease, the Lease or the 2014A Certificates shall be construed or interpreted as
creating an unlawful delegation of governmental powers nor as a donation by or a lending of the
credit of the District within the meaning of Sections 1 or 2 of Article XI of the Colorado
Constitution. Neither the Ground Lease, the Lease nor the 2014A Certificates shall directly or
indirectly obligate the District to make any payments beyond those budgeted and appropriated
for the District’s then current fiscal year.
Section 8.
Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized
pursuant to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair rental value of the Leased Property and do not
exceed a reasonable amount so as to place the District under an economic compulsion to renew
the Lease or to exercise its option to purchase the Corporation’s interest in the Leased Property

pursuant to the Lease. The Board hereby determines and declares that the period during which
the District has an option to purchase the Corporation’s interest in the Leased Property (i.e., the
entire maximum term of the Lease) does not exceed the useful life of the Leased Property.
Section 9.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 1157-209 of the Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District
acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of the principal, interest or prior redemption premiums on the 2014A Certificates. Such
recourse shall not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or
otherwise, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law, enforcement of penalty, or
otherwise. By the acceptance of the 2014A Certificates and as a part of the consideration of their
sale or purchase, any person purchasing or selling such certificate specifically waives any such
recourse.
Section 10.
Repealer. All bylaws, orders and resolutions of the District, or
parts thereof, inconsistent with this Resolution or with any of the documents hereby approved are
hereby repealed to the extent only of such inconsistency. This repealer shall not be construed as
reviving any bylaw, order or resolution of the District, or part thereof, heretofore repealed.
Section 12.
Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, clause or
provision of this Resolution or the documents hereby authorized and approved (other than
provisions as to the payment of Base Rentals by the District during the Lease Term, provisions
for the quiet enjoyment of the Leased Property by the District during the Lease Term and
provisions for the conveyance of the Leased Property to the District under the conditions
provided in the Lease) shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity
or unenforceability of such section, subsection, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect
any of the remaining provisions of this Resolution or such documents, the intent being that the
same are severable.
Section 13.
Effective Date. This Resolution shall be in full force and effect
immediately upon its passage and adoption.

RTD BOARD OPERATING GUIDELINES
BOARD COMMITMENT
Our Board is committed to transit and the goals of the Regional Transportation District. In meeting this
commitment, we appreciate that the Board adds the greatest value when it focuses on and helps clarify
high-level policy issues and plans, including the policies that underpin capital and operating budgets. In
contributing to policies and plans, the Board must understand the vision and mission of RTD and its
priority objectives for the coming years. The Board appreciates that this is an unusual time for RTD
because of the major capital investment in FasTracks that will change the way in which transit is supplied
in the Denver metropolitan area for decades to come. We appreciate that as elected officials we each
represent different areas with different needs and have a responsibility to our constituents. We also
recognize that this Board, by statute, has both policy and executive functions it must perform.
BOARD VALUES
We value the collective Board wisdom that is gained through our deliberations. Thus we value openness
in our discussions, diversity of perspectives, and civility in our conversations. We also place a premium
on deliberations that are both efficient and effective. Recognizing that issues will vary in their
complexity, we value timely decision-making.
STEPS TO ENHANCE BOARD EFFECTIVENESS
The Board supports the following steps to enhance our effectiveness:
1. Recognizing there is not a clean line between policy and management, the Board will place a
premium on conducting policy level discussions at Board meetings and retreats.
2. The Board believes occasional retreats to focus on specific policies, or policies that help guide budget
formulation, will help produce more efficient and effective Board meetings.
3. The Board believes the staff can help it be effective by focused preparation of background material
and packets, concise framing of policy issues, and being available to brief and answer questions from
Board members ahead of meetings.
4. In the interest of focused and efficient discussions, Board members commit to reading appropriate
material ahead of time and staying focused on the topic at hand.
5. Board members are encouraged to address issues for which they have a particular interest, but which
might not be broad policy concerns of the full Board, with staff or at committee meetings rather than
at full Board meetings.
6. The Board recognizes that our members come to RTD with different perspectives and styles. We
value tolerance and appreciation of the Board’s diversity.
7. The Board recognizes that technology and technological tools can enhance the Board meeting
experience by providing timely access to information and research relevant to the topics at hand. The
Board supports the use of electronic devices (i.e. iPhones, Smart Phones, iPads and similar devices)
during committee and Board meetings as long as the use of these devices is not disruptive to the

Packet Pg. 149

12.H

meeting and that Board members provide the proper attention and courtesy to the people in
attendance at the meeting. Cellphones or devices with sound should be silenced with no vibrations.
Voice calls during the meetings are discouraged. Board members are reminded not to communicate
with one another via electronic devices at Board meetings, as all debate should take place in public
forum.
8. We empower the Board Chair and the chairs of our committees to seek the appropriate balance
between open and thorough discussions and timely decisions to bring discussions to closure and to
remind Board members of our commitment to these guidelines.
SPECIFIC NEXT STEPS
▪

Devote time for a Board discussion of criteria to be used in RTD RFPs, which should include the
appropriate level of due diligence the Board should perform on contracts.

▪

Define a date for a Board retreat designed to elicit and discuss some of the most important policy
concerns of Board members.

▪

Establish an annual Joint Board/Staff meeting or retreat that will focus exclusively on policy guidance
for the formulation of the operating and capital budget and the General Manager’s Tactical Goals (i.e.
strategic planning advance).

▪

Identify the types of issues that do not need to come before the Board (e.g., items previously
approved in the budget process or items that could be addressed solely by staff).

▪

Have staff support the Board through its packet preparation with specific actions such as:
▪ highlighting both the guiding policy issue and the decision being sought, and the strategic
goal that the action supports.
▪ limiting the volume of material (augmented by appended material if needed),
▪ bringing more complex items to the Board initially as discussion items and later as decision
items,
▪ providing packets sufficiently ahead of time so that when necessary Board members can be in
contact with either staff or constituents, and,
▪ when appropriate, setting forth options for Board consideration.

▪

Adopt flexible ground rules to guide Board discussions such as:
▪ avoid repeating arguments,
▪ focus on new points,
▪ avoid distracting non-verbal communications, and,
▪ limit comments when a decision of the Board is overwhelmingly clear.



Re-commit to these modified guidelines in 2014 and to ensure we are holding ourselves accountable
to the intent of these guidelines. Also make an accompanying commitment to review their application
on an as-needed basis from the date of this adoption.
