Approval of the Downtown Denver Circulator
Fare-Free Service Plan

Board Meeting Date: May 14, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
Downtown Denver Circulator bus service plan including fare-free operations beginning in 2014.
BACKGROUND
The 2004 voter-approved FasTracks Plan included funding for a Downtown Denver Circulator (Circulator)
bus transit project to complement and enhance the existing 16th Street FREE MallRide. The Circulator is
a critical element to the implementation of the FasTracks Plan as the MallRide will not be able to
accommodate the increase in passengers from the addition of the US 36 BRT and the West, East, Gold,
North Metro, and Northwest Rail Lines.
Since the adoption of the original FasTracks Plan in 2004, RTD has worked with the City and County of
Denver to refine the plan for the Circulator. The long-range vision for the Circulator is all-day operations
along 18th and 19th Streets and Broadway and Lincoln Street between Denver Union Station (DUS) and
the Denver Art Museum area south of Colfax Avenue. The service is planned to operate in mixed-flow
traffic with transit priority measures such as bus bulbs, dedicated stops, a bus/bike/HOV lane, and
multiple-door, fare-free boarding.
In the short-term, RTD is recommending that the Circulator operate during the weekday peak periods
only with five minute headway based service between DUS and Civic Center. The peak period
operations are necessary to prevent overcrowding of the MallRide with the opening of DUS. The
MallRide will continue to have adequate capacity to accommodate the normal mid-day and weekend
transit ridership demand. The Circulator will be supplementary to the MallRide and service levels can be
increased when the MallRide is expected to be overcrowded, including for special events. Therefore, it
is necessary for the Circulator to also offer free service in order to attract customers from the
overcrowded MallRide.
DISCUSSION
Fare-free service is recommended for the Circulator due to a number of characteristics unique to the
Circulator.
These characteristics are outlined below and were the basis for the fare-free
recommendation.
1. The Circulator is a regional service that provides a benefit for the entire District. A recent passenger
survey on the MallRide indicated that 40% of the passengers are from outside of the City of Denver.
The Circulator is anticipated to have a similar or greater percentage of non-Denver residents due to
the primary function being the last mile connection for commuters arriving downtown from other
RTD services that serve the entire District.
2. The Circulator will provide the last mile connection from the new FasTracks projects to the major
employment center in the region. The Circulator and MallRide are necessary for the design of a

Packet Pg. 5

1.C.1

major transit hub at the edge of downtown to work. The service needs to be fast and convenient for
passengers to transfer modes for the last mile of their trip.
3. There is a parallel free service with the MallRide two blocks away serving the same travel pattern.
Since the Circulator will be supplementary to the MallRide, any passengers who would have to pay
the fare would likely opt to not pay a fare and instead take the MallRide.
4. The Circulator ridership is anticipated to be over 80% transfers to or from other RTD services. RTD
has a free transfer policy so the majority of riders would not have to pay a fare even if it was not a
free service. As such, the cost of charging a fare would far exceed the fare revenue collected.
In addition to the characteristics outlined above, the operations of the Circulator would make it difficult
to collect a fare. Multiple-door, fare-free boarding is considered the most important transit priority
measure for the Circulator as it has the greatest impact on reducing travel times and increasing the
reliability of the service. Charging a fare and allowing multiple-door boarding would require off-board
fare collection or a policy that all passengers needing to pay a fare would have to board at the front
door. These options would be very difficult and costly to enforce. If the Circulator cannot operate with
multiple-door boarding, it would not be any different than a standard RTD Local route and other
alternatives such as increasing service on existing downtown routes such as the 0 and 15L should be
considered.
A preliminary Title VI review of the service plan and fare policy reveals an equitable impact with respect
to race, color, national origin and income. The analysis will be completed and submitted to the FTA six
months in advance of the Circulator’s commencement of operation. Once the FTA provides feedback on
the completed equity analysis, the Planning Department will finalize the analysis and seek RTD Board
approval (as required per FTA Guidance).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The opening day Circulator service plan is anticipated to cost $830,000 per year for operations and
maintenance (O&M). This is based on peak period service, six hours per weekday, between DUS and
Civic Center and fare-free operations. The O&M for the Circulator will be paid for from FasTracks.
Charging a fare would result in an increase in the O&M required to operate the Circulator and an increase
in annual Circulator O&M would have a negative impact on the rest of the FasTracks Program.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the Circulator service plan including fare-free operations beginning in
2014.
2. Approve the opening of the Circulator as a fare service in 2014. This is not recommended for the
reasons outlined in the Discussion section and would negatively impact the FasTracks financial plan.
In addition, this option could require additional capital investments for fare equipment that are not
included in the Circulator project.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the Circulator service plan to begin in
2014. This is not recommended as the Circulator is a commitment in the FasTracks plan and a
necessary element to ensure the success of the other projects. Without the Circulator, the MallRide
will be overcrowded which would require RTD to increase service levels on existing downtown routes
such as the 0 and 15L. The Base System is not able to absorb the increased O&M costs associated
with this alternative. In addition, this alternative would require additional buses for these routes

which have not been programed. The Circulator project was awarded a $3.9 Million FASTER grant
for purchasing buses and this money would be lost if the Circulator is not implemented.

RTD Real Property White Paper

Introduction
The intent of this white paper is to describe the real property management and disposition process at
RTD including how real property management interfaces with the TOD function at RTD. This white
paper outlines all existing RTD, state and federal regulations that govern RTD’s acquisition and
disposition of real property and identifies other policy (including TOD) and operational considerations
that need to be taken into account in this process. Also, this paper summarizes how other similar public
agencies approach real property management. Finally, this paper identifies some steps RTD may
consider to more proactively manage its real property assets.

Regulations Governing RTD Real Property
There are several state, federal and RTD laws, regulations and policies which govern the acquisitions and
disposition of properties. RTD must maintain compliance with these requirements.
RTD’s legal authority to acquire property is established in Colorado Revised Statutes C.R.S. 32-9-101 et
seq. “Regional Transportation Act” as amended. This legislation empowers the Board to acquire,
manage, and dispose of property in furtherance of the authorization of planning, building, operating and
maintaining a mass transportation system. This authority includes the power to condemn property for
public use. It is important to note that the authority granted to RTD by the state specifically defines
that RTD can only acquire property for the purposes of mass transit. Different regulations apply to the
disposition of property acquired by RTD depending on the funding source. The disposition of properties
acquired with local funding only are subject to the legal authority above and the Regional
Transportation District Resolution No. 10 Series of 1984 (Resolution Regarding Joint Development and
Disposition of Property Rights) attached as Exhibit A. Disposition of property requires RTD Board
approval.
The acquisition and disposition of property acquired by RTD for federally assisted programs and projects
are subject to acquisition and relocation policies and provisions contained in the government-wide rule
published in the Federal Register on January 4, 2005. The rules are reprinted each year in the Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 49, Part 24. All Federal, State, local government agencies, and others
receiving Federal financial assistance for public programs and projects that require the acquisition of
real property must comply with the policies and provisions set forth in the Uniform Act and the
regulation. The acquisition itself does not need to be federally funded for the rules to apply. If Federal
funds are used in any phase of the program or project, the rules of the Uniform Act apply.

In addition to the Uniform Act, the Federal Transit Administration requires Grantees to be familiar with
other regulations that specifically address the disposition of property, especially U.S. Department of
Transportation, Federal Transit Administration Circular FTA C 5010.1D Grant Management Requirements
dated November 1, 2008, Rev 1, August 27, 2012. The Circular establishes procedures to be followed by
grantees for the disposition of properties, including (1.) selling property (competitively to the extent
practicable) and reimbursing FTA its share of the fair market value, and (2) selling real property and
using the proceeds to reduce the cost of the grant if it is still open or of other FTA funded capital
projects.
A list of properties, vacant and/or underutilized originally acquired without federal funding assistance is
attached as Exhibit B and a list of properties, vacant and/or underutilized originally acquired as part of a
federally funded project is attached as Exhibit C.
As a general rule, property acquired for a construction project is not considered for disposition until
after the construction contract is complete. RTD construction contracts generally make property
acquired for the project available to the construction contractor for construction installation, access to
the site or storage.

Other Policy and Operational Considerations for RTD Real Property Management
There are multiple additional policy and operational considerations that need to be evaluated in the
context of the management, acquisition and disposition of RTD real property. These considerations
should be evaluated in the context of overriding rules and regulations on real property discussed in the
previous section.
Key considerations beyond the existing regulations that govern real property management include:


Financial – management decisions including the acquisition, disposition or transfer of some
other form of property rights are influenced by the general financial conditions of the district
and the financial status of individual capital improvement projects. Examples of this kind of
influence include:
o RTD’s Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) – the RTD Board approved the potential to sell
selected excess properties for the purpose of adding revenues to the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA). This consideration requires RTD staff to look proactively at
selling selected parcels no longer needed for transit purposes to raise revenues to pay
for FasTracks related improvements.
o Engineering decisions on capital improvement projects – financial considerations are
taken into account in acquisition of property for RTD facilities. Budget limitations on
projects often require creative thinking and design to minimize or avoid acquiring
property for RTD rail and bus facilities. RTD staff work very hard to take only property
that is absolutely required for construction and operation of RTD facilities.

2.C.1.b

o

o

Fair Market Value – RTD establishes the value of a property for disposal through a fair
market appraisal. An offer significantly below the appraised fair market value would not
be approved.
Certificates of Participation (COPs) – COPs are used frequently by RTD to leverage
existing RTD assets, including property, for the purposes of financing other RTD
obligations such as capital improvements. The utilization of COPs on RTD real property
must be considered since the disposition of property which is encumbered by a COP will
require that the COP obligation be paid off or transferred to another RTD asset.



Current and Future Operational Needs – RTD’s current and future operational needs are always
evaluated in RTD’s property management process. There are some parcels in RTD’s property
inventory that are underutilized and/or are no longer required for its original intended purpose.
In these situations, it is incumbent on RTD staff to evaluate not only the current utilization of the
property, but the potential for future RTD use. This is extremely important because disposing of
property should only be done in cases where there is no foreseeable transit need for the
property. RTD does not want to be in the situation where it sells an underutilized property and
then determines two or three years later that it did need the property after all.



Transit Oriented Development Opportunities – the opportunity for TOD is an additional
consideration in the acquisition and disposition of property. First and foremost, RTD can only
purchase property for mass transit and cannot purchase property for development. That being
said, RTD does want to encourage the development of transit oriented communities around its
stations and does proactively look for partnership opportunities with local jurisdictions and
private developers to implement TOD at stations. Forming partnerships with others may allow
RTD to avoid acquiring property for RTD’s exclusive use. Examples of this type of partnership
include the Olde Town Arvada station and the Westminster station where the local jurisdictions
acquired property to promote the integration of RTD bus and parking facilities into a larger plan
for transit oriented development.
Additional consideration may be given to TOD in the land disposition process. When certain
conditions are present including local jurisdiction support and commitment for TOD
implementation (the presence of an adopted station area plan, TOD supportive zoning and
commitment of funding for public infrastructure) and private developer commitment and
resources (ownership of land and expenditure of resources on design and entitlements) RTD
may consider reinvesting land proceeds for the purposes of enhancing the station environment
through the implementation of TOD. Examples of this include the Boulder Junction bus transfer
facility and the Alameda TOD Pilot Project where the RTD Board chose to reinvest land sale
proceeds back into the transit facilities that are being built or being reconfigured associated
with the implementation of TOD.

2.C.1.b

A review of procedures of other public agencies, including General Services Administration (GSA),
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA),
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) and
various municipalities within the RTD district was done. All emphasize obtaining the fair market value,
as determined by appraisal of the property to be disposed of and most dispose of surplus property via a
competitive sale to the public generally through a sealed bid or auction. No marketing efforts are a part
of the disposition procedures.

Potential Modifications to RTD’s Real Property Management Approach
As RTD moves forward with the build out of FasTracks and the ongoing operation of its existing bus and
light rail system, modifications to RTD’s Real Property management could be considered. The
modifications would focus on being proactive where appropriate, but understanding that RTD is only in
the business of buying and selling real estate for constructing and operating a mass transit system.
RTD staff proposes the following steps in an effort to more proactively management its real property
assets:
1. Review and Refine Inventory of Surplus and Underutilized Property. Inventories of surplus and
underutilized real properties are attached. RTD staff will evaluate all properties contained in
either inventory, federally funded and/or locally funded and will focus on larger, possibly more
marketable parcels. Small/sliver parcels and other nonmarketable parcels will not be included
in the revised inventory.
2. Conduct an Assessment of Excess and Underutilized Real Property. RTD staff will form a
multidisciplinary committee to assess the potential disposition of parcels within the inventory of
surplus and underutilized parcels. In evaluating the inventory of parcels, RTD will consider all
the factors discussed in this white paper including regulations governing RTD property
disposition and other policy and operational considerations. Following the completion of this
evaluation, RTD staff will consult with select local subject matter experts to get their
perspectives on RTD’s real property inventory in the context of the factors governing RTD’s real
property disposition. RTD staff will then inform the Board of its assessment of the inventory of
parcels. If staff were to move forward with any property disposition, the RTD Board would have
to approve the final negotiated business terms unless the Board had previously delegated that
authority to the General Manager.
3. Develop a Marketing Plan for Select Surplus and Underutilized Property. RTD staff will also
determine if there is a need to market the surplus or underutilized property. Marketing efforts
could include the development of a Request for Proposals (RFP), the installation of for sale signs
on the property to be disposed of, communication with local commercial, industrial and/or
residential property brokers who sell property in the vicinity, or other efforts to be determined.
RTD staff does not feel it would be advantageous to hire a real estate broker to market

Packet Pg. 40

Attachment: Real Property White PaperFINALv3 (1575 : Real Property and TOD White Paper Overview)

Peer Agency Approaches to Real Property Management

individual properties. Hiring a broker would reduce the amount of funds that RTD could receive
on the property because of the need to pay a commission to the broker. It would also require a
competitive solicitation each time a need for representation was identified, adding additional
time and cost to any disposition. In addition, none of the peer public agencies we surveyed
utilized a separate, private real estate broker in the disposition of real property.
4. Ongoing Process to Evaluate TOD Opportunities – RTD TOD staff will continue to proactively
pursue TOD opportunities where appropriate. As identified earlier, RTD will seek out
opportunities for partnerships with local jurisdictions and/or private developers where RTD can
leverage other resources to enhance our bus and rail stations and integrate transit more
seamlessly with development.
Other factors including market viability for TOD and
opportunities to encourage affordable housing as identified by RTD Board policy will also be
considered in the pursuit of TOD. When necessary, RTD staff will engage outside real estate
experts, on-call consultants and others to help evaluate TOD opportunities and negotiate with
private developers (RTD staff has utilized this approach for multiple projects including the DUS
Historic Building, the Alameda TOD Pilot and the Arvada TOD Pilot). RTD staff may engage
additional, outside experts on TOD under the following conditions:





The outside party has agreed to not compete or bid for the TOD opportunity for which
they are being consulted
Each individual TOD opportunity should be evaluated independently on a case by case
basis to determine the type of outside expertise needed since every project has unique
characteristics
Outside experts advising RTD should have a local understanding of the Denver real
estate market

Summary
In conclusion, the sale of surplus property can provide needed revenue to RTD and relieve the District of
the cost to maintain these properties. RTD will take additional steps to inventory, access and market
surplus properties. However, as described in this paper, the disposition of property is a complex
endeavor that must take into account legal, financial, contractual, and future operational requirements
while also considering transit oriented development opportunities where applicable. As we continue to
improve our processes in this area, we will schedule a study session to gather input from the RTD Board
on this very important item.
