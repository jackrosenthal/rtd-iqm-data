Date: July 9, 2015

From:

William C. Van Meter,

Date:

Subject:

2015-2020 Strategic Plan

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: July 28, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the
2015-2020 RTD Strategic Plan.
BACKGROUND
The RTD Strategic Plan reflects guidance and direction from the District’s Board of Directors,
supplemented by extensive staff, stakeholder, and public input. The Plan includes material from the
2015 Board Strategic Advance, and Plan content was heavily based upon two separate sets of one-onone meetings with Board members during the first half of 2015.
Key contributions to the Plan are the result of additional outreach including the following:







Thirty employee Listening Sessions held at fifteen different locations;
An Employee Survey completed by 1,363 employees;
A meeting with the RTD Customer Panel;
Meetings with the Citizen’s Advisory Committee (April 15 and July 8, 2015);
A Local Government Planning Meeting (March 12, 2015); and
Results from the 2014 Customer Satisfaction Survey.

The Plan also reflects input from the Board’s June 30, 2015 Study Session.
The Strategic Plan is organized around seven overall strategies reflecting RTD’s mission. These are:
 Customer Service
 Safety
 Financial Sustainability
 Equity and Accessibility
 System Optimization
 Technological Innovation
 Workforce
Each strategy is accompanied by a goal statement, narrative describing the strategic theme in more
detail, and a set of initiatives that articulate short-, medium-, and long-term implementation. Most of
these initiatives are ongoing in nature, and will be a continuous effort during the five-year plan timeframe. Some of the initiatives involve actions that may not come to fruition until beyond the five-year
time-frame but warrant action now.
The Strategic Plan represents a Board-initiated and adopted document that singularly incorporates longerterm policies, complementing other Board efforts and actions. For example, tactical plans such as the
Strategic Budget Plan, FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation, Annual Budget, and Annual Board/Senior
Leadership Team Strategic Planning advance are at a more immediate implementation level while the
Strategic Plan looks at the next five years and well beyond.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Strategic Plan Implementation will take place in a number of ways. A subsequent document will
describe performance measures to monitor and report on the success of Plan initiatives. In addition, the
Strategic Plan will be referenced during preparation of Board Reports, the Annual Budget, and the
Strategic Budget Plan. Finally, the Board will review the Strategic Plan annually during the Strategic
Planning Advance to check on timeframes, relevance, and content of the seven key strategies identified
in this document.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Financial impact attributable to Strategic Plan initiatives has previously been incorporated or will be
considered in the Annual Budget, Strategic Budget Plan, and/or FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation as
appropriate.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the 2015-2020 RTD Strategic Plan.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action.

Strategic Planning Process Flow
Attachment: RTD_Stategic_Plan_layout_v9 (2441 : Strategic Plan)

The exhibit on this page provides the context for the Strategic Plan within RTD’s overall planning and budgeting process. As shown,
the Strategic Plan represents the District’s long-term strategy and vision, carefully integrated with the Board’s short-term goals
established during the annual Strategic Planning Advance.
The Plan is organized around seven overall strategies serving RTD’s mission. Each strategy is accompanied by a goal statement,
narrative describing the strategic theme in more detail, and a set of initiatives that articulate short-, medium-, and long-term
implementation. Most of these initiatives are ongoing in nature, and will be a continuous effort during the five-year plan time-frame.
Some of the initiatives involve actions that may not come to fruition until beyond the five-year time frame, but warrant action now.

FOREWORD
On behalf of the RTD Board of Directors, we adopt the 2015 Strategic
Plan. This Plan reflects the Board’s collective vision for the District
– for both the next five years, and for decades to come as well. The
Board has identified seven strategies that help frame the District’s
big-picture goals, accompanied by initiatives to implement them. This
Plan clearly and simply articulates those goals for our employees,
stakeholders, and most of all, our passengers.
RTD is a complex organization, relying on hundreds of employees to serve nearly 3 million
people spread over 2,340 square miles across the Denver metro area. This complexity,
however, does not obscure the simple strategies and goals that are paramount to the District:
customer service, safety, and financial sustainability. To these we provide additional strategies
and goals that amplify and support our fundamental, basic mission. Included among these is
our commitment to implement the FasTracks program approved by the voters in 2004.
It is the Board’s hope that the Strategic Plan will be our guiding, aspirational document detailing
how we will move forward together. In my previous role as a city Mayor, we always turned to
our comprehensive plan to influence important land use decisions. The Strategic Plan should
serve a similar purpose, helping us make sound choices that direct and shape what RTD is,
what RTD does, and why we do it. This Plan focuses on the next five years, yet looks far into the
future, and we will revisit it periodically as circumstances warrant. The Board is committed to
making decisions based on sound public policy, and the Strategic Plan is a key tool in doing so.

RTD MISSION STATEMENT

RTD Interim General Manager Dave Genova
RTD was created in 1969 by the Colorado General Assembly to
develop, operate, and maintain a mass transportation system. Since
then, the District has made strategic decisions based upon careful
budget planning, attracting and retaining a talented workforce,
and never losing sight of our commitment to our customers and
safety. From our beginnings as a bus company, we have added light
rail, transformed Denver Union Station, and witnessed extensive
development around our transit stations. The FasTracks program,
which will add more light rail, new commuter rail, and new bus rapid transit, is carving an
unmistakable mark on the Denver metro area. It is now time to adopt a Strategic Plan to
move us into the next five years and beyond.
Between 2016 and 2020, RTD will undergo another period of transition as significant
portions of the FasTracks program begin revenue service, and the bulk of our current major
capital expansion program winds down. The Strategic Plan will be an important document
as we move through this transition, since it identifies seven key strategies to focus our
attention. We will build upon a solid foundation, particularly in the safety area, which the
overwhelming majority of RTD employees understand is RTD’s top priority. Additionally,
this plan details how we will enhance customer service, use technology to improve
the customer experience, optimize our growing system, continue to ensure financial
sustainability, and maintain a dynamic workforce. Join me as we maintain RTD’s position as
one of the top transit agencies in the country and continue our strong legacy of providing
safe, reliable transportation to the region.

To meet our constituents’ present and future public transportation needs by providing safe,
clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective service throughout the District.

Customer Service
Deliver safe, reliable,
and efficient transit
service District-wide.
Engage our customers
to improve services in
an open and transparent
manner.

RTD’s customer experience has to be safe and reliable for RTD
to continue to maintain and grow its customer base. On-time
performance and service reliability will allow RTD to build a
competitive edge within the regional transportation system
as vehicular travel becomes increasingly difficult in the future.
Having a seamless interface between all RTD services—whether
it be bus, Access-a-Ride, light rail or commuter rail—should be a
high priority to ensure RTD customer satisfaction. RTD customers
must feel comfortable and safe on any RTD service, whether it is
run by RTD or one of its contractors.

Attachment: RTD_Stategic_Plan_layout_v9 (2441 : Strategic Plan)

Strategy:
Deliver CustomerOriented Service

Responding to customer needs is important in the 21st century.
As rider expectations evolve, RTD must endeavor to meet their
needs with a growing emphasis on technology and immediate,
reliable information. It will be critical for RTD to proactively
engage our customers to seek ways to improve our service,
and to be transparent about the realities of how we operate
our services. Finding new and improved ways to engage
our customers will allow RTD to stay ahead of the curve and
anticipate rather than react to customer needs.

Safety
Continue to develop
new approaches and
new technologies to create
safer environments for our
riders and our workforce.
Establish best practices
with safety partners to
develop a performancedriven safety culture.

“RTD is the best transit agency in
the country because of our great
team of employees and what you
do every day to safely deliver our
mission.”

RTD recognizes that management and employee commitment is
the hallmark of a true safety culture, where safety is an integral
part of daily operations. To support safety’s priority in the agency,
RTD will strengthen accountability systems and promote a safety
culture. Safety accountability includes establishing safety goals,
measuring safety activity, eliminating hazards and unsafe work
behaviors, and proactively improving the safety environment.

Attachment: RTD_Stategic_Plan_layout_v9 (2441 : Strategic Plan)

Strategy:
Foster a Safety Culture

In the recent employee survey more than 70% of employees
responded favorably to questions about RTD’s safety priorities
(72%), the safety of their work life (76%) and the ease with which
they can report safety concerns (84%). Still, maintaining safe
service requires constant vigilance and collaboration throughout
the agency. Through the Strategic Plan, RTD looks to improve
customer and employee safety by encouraging respectful
collaboration founded on mutual trust. RTD has an organizational
commitment to establish the core value of safety. RTD will
further promote a positive safety culture where values, attitudes,
competencies and patterns of behavior will improve the health
and safety of employees and customers. RTD will continue to
build on an already robust safety culture through enhanced
employee engagement. Ultimately, safety is each employee’s
responsibility.

Financial Sustainability
Ensure cost-effective and

and proactively pursue
partnerships to supplement
District resources. Strengthen
fiscal resiliency and explore
financial innovation to keep
the system in a state of
good repair and deliver
better service.

RTD has the responsibility to use taxpayer and passenger dollars
to provide the best possible public transit service. To consistently
deliver excellent services and projects, RTD must maintain
financial stability. Multi-year financial planning is vital to ensure
that capital and service visions become realities. The agency can
augment its finances by maximizing the revenues it generates
through operations and by exploring new sources of income.
Traditional funding sources alone will be insufficient to meet
the long-term needs of the future RTD system. RTD must also
continue to seek out non-traditional partnerships with public and
private sector partners to leverage outside funds.

Strategy:
Strengthen Fiscal
Resiliency and Explore
Financial Innovation

Even as RTD employs asset management programs and
endeavors to keep the system in a state of good repair,
ongoing investment must be sustained to keep its vehicles and
infrastructure functioning and to maintain a robust system. These
assets often require more frequent maintenance to ensure
safety and ongoing functionality, which puts a growing burden
on the operating budget. Reliable and sustainable funding will
be absolutely necessary for RTD to make the critical investments
that the region needs. A long-term comprehensive funding
plan that takes into account both operating and capital needs is
essential to creating a robust, modern transit system.

A balanced approach to accessing RTD facilities will be important
in order to continue to expanding and increase RTD’s customer
base. Active transportation options such as walking, biking, car
share, and ride share should be embraced as viable alternatives
to access RTD facilities in addition to personal vehicles and buses.
Improved first and final mile connections through partnerships with
local jurisdictions, developers and other entities are essential to
expanding multi-modal access and growing ridership.
Continued improvement of access for people with disabilities is
important to preserve mobility for those with limited options.
Best efforts to adhere to the American with Disabilities Act
(ADA) Standards for Accessible Design at all RTD facilities,
and continued improvement of efficiency of RTD’s Access-a-

Ride service and ADA access to fixed route service, are key to
preserving mobility for the disabled community.
Promoting the creation of diverse transit oriented communities
around our facilities serves RTD well by improving accessibility
near stations and expanding RTD’s ridership base. Local
jurisdictions have prioritized development around RTD facilities
as means to direct future growth. RTD should proactively partner
with local jurisdictions and others to leverage this planning vision
and create vibrant, walkable areas around stations. In creating
these transit oriented communities, RTD needs to be sensitive to
community issues such as affordable housing and transportation,
and should work with local jurisdictions and others to find
solutions to promote neighborhood diversity.

RTD began as a bus company and has expanded with the Central,
Southwest, Southeast, Central Platte Valley, and West light rail
lines. The District has also added a variety of other transportation
options, including Call-n-Ride, Access-a-Ride, Limited stop bus
services, Express and Regional bus services, and an extensive
Park-n-Ride system.

Strategy:
Optimize Service
Delivery
Balance competing
mobility needs across
the District to provide
service in the most efficient
manner possible. Work with
partners to develop, fund
and complete FasTracks and
increase ridership.

The FasTracks program represents one of the most ambitious,
large-scale transit expansion programs ever undertaken in
the United States. The combination of light rail, commuter rail,
downtown circulation, and bus rapid transit capital investment
projects—as well as Denver Union Station and its integrated
transit oriented development—is destined to transform the
Denver metropolitan region. A key effort over the next five
years will be to carefully integrate the FasTracks projects into
our existing bus and rail system.

While most of FasTracks will be in service by 2020, key
components of the program will likely not be completed. During
the next five years, the District is committed to exploring financial
and implementation strategies to keep these unfinished projects
in the forefront to fully realize the voters’ 2004 vision. It is
unlikely that RTD can fully fund these projects from FasTracks
sales tax revenues in the near term, so partnerships with local
governments and private companies will become an integral
component of the funding strategy.
FasTracks, however, will not meet all the transit demands
expected during the longer time horizon of 15 to 25 years.
These 2040 transit needs, based on Denver Regional Council
of Governments jobs and housing growth projections, must
be planned for implementation a decade or more from now.
Addressing these needs may require improving the existing
system’s capacity. Other needs will likely be met by a thorough
exploration of bus rapid transit investments throughout the
District, both on arterial streets and on State highways. Finally,
RTD will need to explore visionary approaches to linking the
District’s light rail, commuter rail, and bus rapid transit systems
with other transit systems serving the rest of the Front Range.

Employing technology can help RTD not only increase ridership
but also better manage its business, assets, and operations.
Customer expectations are changing with a shift in rider
demographics, travel patterns and needs. Meeting customer
needs means providing access to information, ensuring
connectivity with devices throughout the system, and employing
the technological innovations that have become the norm. A
public transportation system that is easy to understand and use
is not only important in attracting and retaining riders but also in
increasing market share. Technology-based customer information
tools are essential to inform riders about transit services and help
them easily navigate the RTD system.

Strategy:
Use Technology to
Operate Efficiently and
Improve the Customer
Experience

Just as technology can help customers make better decisions
about travel, new tools at the system level will help RTD make
and implement better strategic and investment decisions that
can save time and money. The challenge is to systematically
develop and introduce these new tools, for both customers and
RTD processes, while staying up to date in new technological
innovation.

RTD recognizes that our employees are the single most important
asset in the organization. As the baby-boomer generation
nears retirement, the agency needs an ever-greater focus on
recruiting and training employees with competitive benefits while
providing the knowledge and skills for those employees to build
their careers in public transportation. Additionally, a coordinated
effort to capture the experience and knowledge from the current
workforce will pass knowledge to the next generation.

Strategy:
Foster a Dynamic and
Sustainable Workforce

The upcoming completion of a large percentage of FasTracks will
also require that RTD examine the best use of resources to shift
focus from construction to maintaining existing and new assets.
Results from the recently-conducted employee survey show that
the agency’s focus on safety and customer service are wellestablished at every level of the organization. However, that
survey also revealed concerns about internal communication and
collaboration. RTD has made a commitment to improve two-way
communication to ensure that every employee’s voice counts.

CEO

Date: July 9, 2015

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

July 8, 2015

Board Meeting Date: July 28, 2015

Subject:

Contract Amendment; 2nd Optional Year of
2013-2015 Street Improvements & Shelter
Installations Contract; # 33DM005

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
amendment to initiate the second optional year of a three-year contract for the annual Street
Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $390,318.35. Funding
for this contract amendment is provided by the annual 2015 – 2016 Engineering Expense Budgets.
BACKGROUND
Due to the repetitive work of this contract, a three-year contract value was determined to be an
effective way to manage this work for the District. Bids were received and a contract was awarded to
Manion Construction, Inc. as the lowest responsive and responsible bidder in September of 2013. The
current base contract value and amendments are as follows:

Grand Total: Base Year, Amendments, and 2nd Optional Year $ 1,466,090.90
DISCUSSION
This second optional year amendment will increase the contract by $390,318.35, creating a total
contract amount, which includes this amendment, of $1,466,090.90. Manion Construction has
performed well throughout the term of this contract and has achieved all RTD requirements. The
contract enables work to be performed in a quick, responsive manner.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Estimated $390,318.35 budget shall come from the 2015 and 2016 Engineering Expense Budgets
dependent on the calendar year in which the work is performed.
DBE/SBE GOAL
Manion Construction Inc. is a SBE certified contractor.

1.B.2

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all
documents necessary to award a contract amendment to initiate the second optional year of a
three-year contract for the annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with
Manion Construction, Inc. for $390,318.35. Funding for this contract amendment is provided by
the annual 2015 – 2016 Engineering Expense Budgets.
2. Delay the recommended action. This is not recommended as it will delay the construction of
projects that have been identified for repairs and impact coordination efforts with various
jurisdictions.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to execute all documents necessary to award a contract amendment to initiate the second year
option of a three-year contract for the annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract
with Manion Construction, Inc. Instead develop a new Invitation for Bid (IFB) for this year’s
construction work. This is not recommended because:
a.
b.
c.
d.

It would create a delay in constructing the 2015-2016 street improvements.
The current Contractor is providing a good quality product in a reasonable time.
The 2015-2016 contract prices are considered to be fair and reasonable.
The district desires to partner with the DBE/SBE Community and Manion Construction is a
SBE certified contractor.
