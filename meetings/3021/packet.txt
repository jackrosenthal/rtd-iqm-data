DEVELOPING THE MOBILITY OF THE FUTURE

• Two highest priorities: Equitable Access and Reliability
• Geographical Access also highlighted, but focused on equity populations outside of
major urban centers

• Next highest priorities: Convenient Stop Locations, Long Service
Hours, Easy Transit Connections
• Concerns about how changing fixed routes will impact Access-aRide service – requests for RTD to establish a policy to retain
Access-a-Ride services even if fixed routes are eliminated
• Resource Efficiency, Fast Trips and Frequent Service were also
mentioned as lower-tier priorities

Key Takeaways

• Reliability was ranked highest priority – by far!
• Other top priorities included Convenient Stop Locations, Geographic
Access, Equitable Access, and Frequent Service
• Highest priorities from targeted outreach meetings were Reliability and
Equitable Access
•

Equitable Access was ranked 3rd and 5th in the surveys

• Geographic Access was ranked 4th in the community survey and 2nd in the
online survey
•

7

High degree of support from ADA survey online responses – likely focused on
reaching equity populations outside of urban centers

Mentimeter Exercise – TWG/AC and RTD Board of
Directors Results

DEVELOPING THE MOBILITY OF THE FUTURE

• TWG and AC strongly supported service to equity populations
• TWG and AC strongly supported high-frequency service to areas
with transit supportive land uses over a coverage-based system
RTD Board of Directors
• All groups favored a regional transit
backbone provided by RTD and
exploring local community partnerships
to operate/pay for local service
• Preliminary Board of Directors' results
indicates that they are leaning toward
more of a coverage-based system

• Lowest cost per boarding
• Best travel time ratio
• Social Equity results in the:
• Most social equity population service by 15-minute or better
service
• Highest bus boardings per service hour

Allocation Scenarios to Understand Tradeoffs –
DEVELOPING THE MOBILITY OF THE FUTURE
Key Takeaways
• Geographic Coverage results in the:
• Most population and employment served (with less frequent
service)
• Fewest boardings
• Lowest equity population served by 15-minute or better service
• Highest cost per boarding
• Would require reducing service in higher-density population
areas
• Would reduce ridership overall

TOD Status Report

TOD Illustrated

This report provides an update on TOD in the District, showing:

This report depicts the high density development that has
occurred within a half-mile walk of rail and Flatiron Flyer
stations, both shortly before and following the opening of
the transit lines.

• A significant amount of development in the region occurred within a
half-mile radius from RTD’s stations
• 2019 accounted for the most multifamily deliveries ever
• 2019 office deliveries were below 2018 figures, but remained strong

Equitable TOD Policy Research
Denver Metro Area was #2 most intensely gentrifying in America, 2013-2017*
• Equitable TOD Policy is an opportunity to encourage ridership, gain revenue, and be
responsive to community concerns through inclusive joint development.
Peer agency comparison

Enter Presentation Title
Title Case

• Equitable TOD Policies use a variety of tools to encourage the development of
affordable housing on transit agency land, including:
•
•
•
•

% affordable goals for residential development
Flexible parking replacement expectations
Expeditious processing and preference given to affordable projects
Negotiated land/lease prices and conditions/covenants/restrictions

• BART – 35% of development
affordable to low-income households
• LA Metro – 35%
• Sound Transit – 80%
• VTA (Silicon Valley) – 35%

• Current RTD policy supports local jurisdictions’ affordable housing policies; new policy
could continue to support.
Possible Next Steps: Present peer review and discuss potential RTD policy options for
encouraging affordable housing
