MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL MANAGER AND CEO
November 2023

The FY 2024 Budget represents the agency’s financial
plan for the forthcoming year. In adopting this budget
framework in alignment with the 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan, the agency demonstrates its ongoing
commitment to the Strategic Priorities of Community
Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, and
Financial Success. With this commitment also comes a
renewed collective focus on three primary initiatives:
Back to Basics, People Power, and Welcoming Transit
Environment.
•

Back to Basics: RTD strives to enhance the
reach and impact of internal
communications and to redouble agency
efforts to maintain assets in a state of good
repair leveraging sound asset management
principles

•

People Power: Recognizing the critical
importance of its people, the agency’s most
important resource, in achieving the
agency’s mission, RTD seeks to vigorously
address impediments to recruitment and
retention efforts and to foster a culture of
learning and development

•

Welcoming Transit Environment: RTD seeks
to reduce the impacts of criminal behaviors
and Code of Conduct violations on agency
services and workplaces and, in doing so, to
improve community and employee
perception of personal and public security
on RTD property and vehicles

Through the efforts of the Finance Team, agency
executives, senior managers, and subject matter
experts, these three initiatives are reflected throughout
the 2024 Proposed Budget and have been interwoven
into work plans created by employees throughout the
agency. By focusing on these important factors, RTD
Regional Transportation District
2024 PROPOSED BUDGET

can continue to strive to achieve
meaningful progress toward
established success outcomes.
In keeping with these success
outcomes, RTD continues to
adapt to accommodate the
ever-evolving transit needs of
customers and communities
throughout the agency’s 2,342
square mile footprint.

Debra A. Johnson

In Q1 2024, RTD will implement large-scale changes to
the agency’s fare structure as contemplated by
recommendations culminating from the Systemwide
Fare Study and Equity Analysis (Study) conducted in
2022 and 2023. When RTD launched the Study in April
2022, it embarked on the most comprehensive and
holistic review of fares the agency had taken in its 50plus year history. In response to customer feedback
regarding the cost and complexity of fares, the Study
was predicated upon the overarching goals of creating
a fare structure that is simpler, more equitable,
more affordable. The fare structure for 2024 and
beyond mirrors those laudable goals.
Under the new, simpler fare structure, not only will full
fare paying customers be asked to pay less for fares
across the board, existing discounts for eligible
individuals will be increased, truly enhancing the
overall affordability and accessibility of public transit
throughout the Denver metro area.
Moreover, the agency is offering all of its transit
services at no cost to those 19 years of age or younger
commencing in September 2023 and continuing
through August 31, 2024; further, the agency is
seeking additional legislative support to continue
offering this program for years to come.
As contemplated in the System Optimization Plan
approved by the Board in 2022, RTD continues to
deploy transit service commensurate with the agency’s

All those within RTD’s established boundaries,
including visitors traveling to the region, have a vested
interest in RTD’s ongoing success. Even those who
have never stepped foot on one of the agency’s
revenue vehicles reap the rewards of a robust, reliable,
accessible transit system by way of benefits that
include cleaner air, lower congestion, and dependable
mobility options should the need arise. In fulfilling the
myriad of needs of customers and communities
throughout the region, RTD is truly fulfilling its mission
of making lives better through connections.
Of course, none of this would be possible without the
efforts of those steadfast employees who work
tirelessly to make transit service delivery possible. I
acknowledge and appreciate the collaborative efforts of
all RTD employees, as well as the efforts of the Board
of Directors and the agency’s union and contractor
partners.

I once again extend my sincere thanks and
appreciation for the contributions in the timely
preparation of the FY 2024 Budget to Doug MacLeod,
Chief Financial Officer; Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager,
Budget; Heidi Wagner, Senior Manager, Finance; the
Budget Analysts, and the members of the Leadership
Team.
And lastly, I would be remiss not to thank the
customers, communities, stakeholders, and partners
who engage with RTD every day.
On behalf of RTD, I truly appreciate the opportunity to
lead this team of dedicated individuals as the agency
strives to be the trusted leader in mobility,

delivering excellence and value to our
customers and community.

INTRODUCTION
The Regional Transportation District’s 2024 Proposed Budget (Budget) represents the expected revenues,
expenditures and financial position anticipated for the fiscal year January 1 through December 31, 2024. The RTD
Board of Directors appropriates funding by fiscal year that allows the agency to continue its mission to make lives
better through connections. The expenditures set forth herein align the Budget with RTD’s Strategic Plan Priorities
and prioritized objectives within the projected financial constraints.

For FY2024, the operating expense budget is $1,040.8M, new capital is $185.5M, debt service is $223.3M, capital
carryforward of $232.8M for a total expenditure budget of $1,682.4M. Fund balances are budgeted at $898.6M.

This Budget demonstrates RTD’s financial capacity to address, based on current information, the agency’s strategic
priorities in the near term. The development of the Budget is a cross-departmental collaborative effort; hence the
proposed budget for the Board’s consideration is a collective staff recommendation.

17.A.c

The 2024 Proposed Budget focuses on the Strategic
Priorities of the Board-approved 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan. As a result, funding appropriations are aligned in
a manner to direct efforts towards achieving the
desired success outcomes as measured by specific
metrics.
The 2024 Proposed Budget operating expenses have
been developed in accordance with the System
Optimization Plan (SOP) approved by the Board. Other
significant expenditures for debt service and capital
expenditures are also included in this proposed budget
which have been developed utilizing RTD’s debt
service schedules, capital needs identified through the
Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan as well as
capital projects previously approved by the Board for
appropriation that have not been fully completed
(capital carryforward). The TAM Plan continues to be
evaluated, adjusted, and prioritized to address the
agency’s needs to maintain assets in a state of good
repair.
While RTD’s current financial position is strong and
funding capacity is available to fund initiatives and
programs within the Strategic Priorities and Initiatives,
it is expected that the agency will continue to be
challenged with accessing adequate non-financial
resources as a result of the difficult labor market
environment, supply chain issues and high inflation.
Economic conditions indicate that retail spending is
slowing and decreasing due to higher personal debt
levels, inflation and discontinuance of federal
government transfer payments that occurred for
Regional Transportation District
2024 PROPOSED BUDGET

economic incentives during the COVID-19 emergency.
Furthermore, the RTD 0.6% sales tax will be subject to
Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) revenue growth
limitations beginning in 2025. While economic
conditions in the Denver metro area remain better than
national averages as a result of low unemployment,
strong personal income growth and a diverse business
base, the agency is heavily reliant on sales and use
taxes, which can be adversely affected by changes in
personal spending behaviors.
Although challenging circumstances exist in the
economy, the agency expects to continue to benefit
from favorable short-term investment rates and low
long-term interest rates for borrowing. Historical
experience during economic slowdowns have also
contributed to more favorable labor market conditions
to improve hiring and retention. Finally, the agency is
well positioned with strong reserves to weather
negative impacts to sales and use taxes.
This Budget proposal sets a financial course that is
prudent and strategic while providing the foundation
for financial sustainability.
The agency will continue to uphold its responsibility of
good stewardship of taxpayer dollars while striving to
provide Community Value, Customer Excellence,
Employee Ownership, and Financial Success. The 2024
Proposed Budget seeks to align expenditures with the
Strategic Priorities and Initiatives while maintaining a
conservative approach to revenue assumptions.

PERSPECTIVE

17.A.c

STRATEGIC PLAN ALIGNMENT
The Budget has been developed to direct resources to RTD’s Strategic Plan Priorities.

RTD strives to be a strong community
partner, providing value to customers as well
as to the broader Denver metro region while
sustaining planet Earth

Employee Ownership

Customer Excellence

Financial Success

RTD strives to consistently deliver highquality customer service

RTD takes very seriously the management of all
financial resources

RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled
and engaged workforce

The Budget has been further refined to focus on the agency’s three Strategic Initiatives. The three initiatives
outlined below drive RTD’s operational decision-making and will support resource utilization in 2024.

Back to Basics
RTD is redoubling its efforts to maintain assets in a state of good repair,
leveraging sound asset management principles. Additionally, this strategic
initiative focuses on enhancing the reach and impact of the agency’s
internal communications efforts. Ensuring all employees have the
information needed to be successful in their role is critically important to
maintaining an engaged workforce.
In support of Back to Basics in 2024, RTD will focus on replacing large sections of the downtown rail in Denver. This 30year-old section of the track opened for service in 1994 and needs a full-depth replacement. Replacing the downtown rail
will ensure that RTD is able to maintain its assets for the next 30 years and beyond. Additional plans are being developed
for replacement of other sections of RTD’s light rail track.
Additionally, RTD staff is implementing a more robust strategic approach in implementing and maintaining an effective
Transit Asset Management (TAM) plan in which prioritization of asset replacements and renewals are prioritized according
to the Strategic Initiatives. Staff completed a review and prioritization of capital carryforward projects resulting in a
significant decrease to those efforts to align with available resources.

People Power
RTD’s employees are the agency’s most important resource. In order to
achieve RTD’s mission of making lives better through connections, the
agency is vigorously addressing impediments to employee recruitment and
retention. Additionally, the agency is focused on creating a culture of
learning and development.

Community Value

17.A.c
In support of People Power in 2024, RTD has prioritized resources to focus on recruitment and retention of frontline
workers in addition to hiring of police officers.
Several efforts are underway for employee training and recognition programs as well.

Welcoming Transit Environment

In support of Welcoming Transit Environment in 2024, RTD will focus on
continuing to build the RTD Police Department and place less reliance on
contracted security services. Additional efforts will also be undertaken for crime prevention through environmental design.

FISCAL AND BUDGETARY POLICIES
Annually, the Board considers the RTD Fiscal Policy for the following fiscal year. Development of the Budget adheres
to this Fiscal Policy. The Board approved the 2024 Fiscal Policy the October 24, 2023, Board meeting. The 2024
Budget Policy, which is derived from the 2024 Fiscal Policy, is summarized as follows:
Summarized Budget Policies

•

The Board will review and adopt the RTD Fiscal Policy

•

There shall be a budgetary monitoring system that charges expenditures against approved appropriations

•

The Budget shall be summarized for adoption purposes

•

Budget preparation shall follow Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)

•

A balanced budget is required in which revenues plus reserves are greater than or equal to expenditures

•

Procedures that postpone funding of necessary expenditures, such as preventive maintenance or equipment
replacement, will be avoided

RTD seeks to reduce the impacts of criminal behaviors and Customer Code of
Conduct violations on its services and in workplaces. This strategic initiative
prioritizes the safety and security of customers and employees on RTD’s
vehicles and property.

17.A.c

FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The financial aspects of a budget consist of three primary categories: revenues, expenditures, and reserves (also
referred to as fund balances). Revenues and expenditures provide the cash inflows and outflows while reserves
provide the financial balance to smooth cash flow volatility and supply the financial relief necessary for unforeseen
circumstances that inevitably arise.

Revenue sources are generally either recurring or finite. RTD’s Fiscal Policy establishes that one-time revenues be
used for one-time expenditures while recurring revenues provide a sustainable source to fund ongoing needs.
Because one-time revenues have a finite term, commitments for recurring expenditures require an alternative
source once the one-time revenues are exhausted.
RTD’s sources of recurring revenue, in descending order of size, are sales and use taxes, fares, federal operating
grants and miscellaneous revenue from advertising, investment income and rent. Historically, RTD has also been
the recipient of one-time revenues from federal capital grants, federal COVID-19 relief funding, local contributions,
and land sales. RTD does not budget or forecast one-time revenues unless certainty exists.
Revenue assumptions for the Budget include the following:
•

Fare revenue has been adjusted downward to $63.9M in anticipation of impacts from implementing
initiatives culminating from the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis. These impacts are expected to
result in the fare recovery ratio (fare revenue vs. operating expenses) to only be approximately 5%. The
decrease in fare rates, simplification of fares, zero fares for youth and increase of the LiVE Program
discounts are the primary factors related to decreased fares. However, the overall financial impact to the
agency is relatively small, with fares having previously decreased as a percentage of total revenues during
the COVID-19 pandemic.

•

Sales and use tax projections were provided by the University of Colorado Leeds School of Business (CU
Leeds) in August 2023. The CU Leeds forecast model predicts that tax collections will be lower in 2024 by a
modest amount compared to the March 2023 forecast. The lower forecast for 2024 resulted from a
slowdown in year-over-year growth in actual tax collections during 2023. Significant tax growth in the
preceding three years combined with federal COVID-19 grant relief funding has resulted in strong growth in
reserves and significantly higher investment returns. The RTD forecast aligns with the statewide
expectations from the Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) and Office of State Budgeting and Planning
(OSPB).

•

Operating grants of $154.2M are anticipated in 2024. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) increased the
annual FTA preventive maintenance formula grants to RTD by approximately 30%. Additionally, the federal
COVID-19 relief grants, which were fully drawn in May 2023, resulted in a delay in drawing preventive
maintenance grant funding due to additional expenditures needed. Therefore, the agency intends to
accelerate drawing of these apportionments in the coming fiscal year. The grant apportionments are based
upon financial and statistical data that RTD submits to the National Transit Database (NTD).

•

Capital grants of $156.4M are expected in 2024. The majority of these funds are pass-through grants
related to Colfax BRT.

Revenues

17.A.c

COVID-19 relief grants were fully drawn in 2023. This additional grant funding combined with strong sales
and use taxes has contributed to an unprecedented balance of over $1 billion in cash and investments as
well as substantial reserves, which, along with higher interest rates, will generate additional investment
income in 2024. These significant cash and investment balances are earmarked for state of good repair
needs and maintaining fund balances in accordance with the RTD Fiscal Policy.

•

Other revenue includes recurring revenue of $38.4M which consists primarily of a federal Build America
Bonds (BAB) interest rate subsidy and advertising revenues.

Expenditures
Expenditures consist of both recurring expenses, such as operating expenses, as well as occasional outlays such as
projects, debt service and capital expenditures.
RTD’s largest expenditures are providing transit-related operations. These costs include compensation, materials
and supplies, contracted services, insurance, utilities, and other such expenses.

RTD has ongoing asset management needs that are informed by the TAM Plan and requests for new
initiatives. Asset management needs can fluctuate significantly by year when, for example, a single year
includes a large purchase such as fleet replacements. There are no significant fleet replacements contemplated
in 2024, however, design and pricing are being developed for certain rail component renewals and
replacements as some portions of track are reaching the 30-year mark. Appropriation for repair and
replacement activities for light rail track is requested at $150.0M. These activities are contemplated for 2024
including shutdowns of certain significant portions of rail lines in the downtown Denver area. Staff intends to
continue to fund capital needs with cash on hand in the Capital Replacement Reserve. However, analyses will
continue to be performed to ensure that the most financially advantageous asset management funding
mechanisms are pursued, given that investment return rates currently exceed borrowing rates.
Operating expenses include an average of 5.1% increases due to inflationary pressures and supply chain
constraints remain a concern, particularly with certain materials. RTD has taken steps to accelerate certain
large purchases and also to allow for additional lead times in order to lock-in prices.
Expenditure assumptions for the Budget include:
•

Salaries and wages assume full staffing to provide service levels in accordance with the System
Optimization Plan (SOP). While it is anticipated that continued high employment and a competitive job
market will prolong RTD’s ability to attract and maintain full staffing levels, funding has been made
available in these appropriations. In addition, the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) includes wage
increases that have been included with provisions for incentive pay for represented employees until
such time that adequate staffing levels are achieved. The compensation increases in 2024 shown below
are primarily driven by annual increases and the addition of sworn RTD police officers, which the latter
increase is partially offset by the decrease in contracted security services included in Outside Services

•

Benefits include the following:
o

A 2% increase for represented employee health and welfare benefit premiums. Larger prior
year premium increases resulting from many large claims, particularly those from claimants with
COVID-19 related complications, have subsided

Regional Transportation District
2024 PROPOSED BUDGET

13

Packet Pg. 59

Attachment: Proposed Budget (2024)[11-08-23] (4856 : 2024 Proposed Budget)

RTD also has a significant debt burden primarily from capital expansion projects as well as obligations issued to
finance the purchase of rolling stock. RTD completed two refinancings in 2023 to realize interest savings and reduce
the debt burden. As interest rates have risen recently, RTD does not anticipate performing additional refinancings in
2024.

•

o

A 10% increase for non-represented employee health benefits in 2024. In 2023, RTD improved
the pricing of the CIGNA plan to provide an affordable alternative to the Kaiser Permanente
plan as an enhancement to employee satisfaction. Shifts in participation between these two
plans occurred, which necessitated the 2024 increases

o

Dental and vision plans for employees remain largely unchanged for 2024, with certain
guaranteed pricing having been completed in 2023

o

Retirement plans for represented employees in 2024 include the same 2023 RTD contribution,
of 15% of wages to the defined benefit pension plan employee contributions remaining at 5%
per the CBA. This plan was closed to new entrants on January 1, 2023. In addition, provisions
have been included to fund the new defined contribution plan at 9% with up to a 5% match for
new employees having commenced January 1, 2023. The defined benefit pension plan is 76%
funded. As the number of active employees in the defined benefit pension plan continues to
decline due to retirements, future years may require a shift from a percentage of active wages
to a fixed annual amount based on actuarial recommended contributions in order to maintain an
adequate funding level

o

The non-represented employee defined benefit pension plan is funded with a $15.0M
contribution in 2024, which is the same amount contributed in 2023. The actuarially
recommended contribution in 2024 is $11.0M, and the additional $4.0M is recommended by the
Trustees due to the availability of cash and the notion that funds contributed to this plan earn a
higher rate of return that RTD can achieve under the restrictions of the Investment Policy. The
additional contributions in 2024 reduce the long-term financial risk to RTD of future inadequate
funding. This plan is 79% funded and currently has 140 active participants. This plan has been
closed to new employees since January 1, 2008, and funding requirements will tail off over the
next several years

o

The non-represented employee defined contribution plan assumes RTD funding of 9% of
wages, which is the same amount contributed in 2022. Board policy is to contribute 7-9% of
wages each year. Only non-represented employees hired January 1, 2008, and thereafter
participate in this retirement plan. In October 2023, a recommendation to the Board was made
to change the five-year cliff vesting to 20% vesting for each full year of employment up to
100% at the end of the fifth year to bring the vesting in this plan into parity with the
represented defined contribution plan

o

RTD will continue to offer the 457(b) retirement plan to all employees. This is a voluntary plan
for which only employee contributions, and no RTD contributions, may be made, up to Internal
Revenue Service annual limits. RTD will continue to fund the administrative costs

Materials and supplies consist of consumable items such as fuel, fluids, and parts. Diesel fuel purchases
are typically contracted at a locked price for a certain number of gallons. RTD is currently assessing a
diesel fuel contract for 2024 but has not yet locked pricing. Contracting fuel purchases provides budget
certainty, particularly in the volatile fuel pricing environment. Diesel and gasoline expenses typically
account for 2% of operating expenses and the increases

•

Services consist of contracted specialty IT and legal needs as well as security. Additionally, these
expenses contain inflationary increases which are offset by reductions resulting in a $32.7M decrease in
2024. The majority of the decrease is due efforts to budget more accurately for execution based on
personnel constraints as well as a reduction in contracted security needs which will be replaced with
RTD police officers. An additional appropriation of $137.9M is included which results from a passthrough grant Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with Denver to provide funding for Cofax bus rapid
transit (BRT) corridor enhancements. There is no net financial impact to RTD due to future receipts of
offsetting grant funding.

•

Insurance costs are expected to increase modestly due to premium increases and certain
enhancements to coverages to manage financial risks to the agency. Insurance costs have been
relatively flat over an extended period due to effective claims management

•

Other expenses primarily contain expenditures for utilities and purchased transportation and, to a
lesser degree, various minor business expenses

•

o

Utilities include projected amounts for traction power commensurate with planned rail service
levels and in alignment with 2023 usage with a slight increase due to current rates

o

Purchased transportation includes contractual increases and are aligned with expected revenue
service hours. The contractual increases in 2024 reflect fixed route bus and ADA contract
amendments as well as a larger service availability payment to the Eagle P3 concessionaire for
single year asset maintenance need contemplated in the Concessionaire Agreement

o

Travel and training and budgets have been maintained at the same levels as 2023 with the
intent to contribute to employee development and industry participation.

o

Funding for an on-call contract is included to address specialty consulting engagements, if
necessary

o

A budget of $250,000 is available for employee engagement to be used for outreach and
recognition programs. All other discretionary spending will continue to be limited

Debt service represents a significant portion of RTD’s annual expenditures. Debt service consists of
principal and interest payments on bonds, certificates of participation (COPs) and lease-purchase
agreements. Debt service payments for 2024 will total $223.3M, down from $225.8M in 2023 as a
result of refinancings for interest savings. The Base System bond payments will expire in 2024, at
which point, the Base System will be subject to TABOR restrictions.

Memorandum
To:

Board of Directors

From:

Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO

Date:

November 14, 2023

Re:

Staff Response to 2024 Proposed Budget Board Inquiries

The 2024 Proposed Budget will be presented as a recommended action item during the Finance and Planning
Committee on Tuesday, November 14, 2023, and, if approved in committee, during the Board Meeting scheduled
to be held on Tuesday, November 28, 2023.
On Friday, November 10, 2023, Board Office Executive Manager Jack Kroll provided to me a compiled list of
questions posed by Directors regarding the 2024 Proposed Budget
This memorandum serves as staff’s response to those questions.
Question1: What is an "MTFP project"?
Response 1: The 2024-2029 Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP) includes projects in the forecasted
expenditures. Projects may be capital assets that have a life of more than one year and/or may be expense
projects for which there is not a capital asset owned by RTD. Projects are efforts that may contain multiple
components and refer to single or aggregations of multiple capital and expense items. Projects are
captured under a single project number in RTD’s financial systems. An example of an MTFP project is the
downtown Denver loop light rail track replacement, which requires repair and replacement of multiple
assets, such as track, concrete, ballast, etc., as well as expenses for items not owned by RTD, such as
streets and sidewalks, in addition to external engineering and consulting work.
Question 2: Is there a policy on carrying forward expenses? If so, what is it? Or what has been our practice?
Response 2: Yes. Both the Board-approved 2023 Fiscal Policy and the 2024 proposed Fiscal Policy contain
the following provision, in both instances on page 2:

RTD will limit capital expenditure and expense fiscal year carry-forwards to the lesser of the life of the
project or three years.
Question 3: Is there a more detailed budget breakdown by department? Are any of these department expenses
actually capex?

Question 4: Why would we have the New Flyer electric buses in FY23 capital carry-forward? Why did we approve
an electric bus study for FY23, and how does that relate to the conversations on New Flyer?
Response 4: There are no electric buses included in the capital carryforward. RTD is currently replacing
40-foot diesel buses, and deliveries will continue into 2024, thereby necessitating a carry-forward of
appropriated funding. Moreover, the “study” underway is for development of a facilities and fleet transition
plan with a focus on low-no emission vehicles, not solely electric revenue transit vehicles.
Question 5: For accounting methods, do we consider funds awarded when the check comes or when the letter
comes that a check is pending?
Response 5: Staff considers funding to be awarded upon receipt of the notification letter of said award.
Further, staff budgets for apportioned funds as part of the established accounting process. Actual revenue
is recognized when eligible expenses are incurred and submitted to the Federal Transit Administration for
reimbursement.
Question 6: What is the projected cost of any salary increases for non-represented salaried employees?
Response 6: Recognizing the critical importance of the agency’s people power, efforts were made through
the negotiation of the most recent collective bargaining agreement with the Amalgamated Transit Union
Local 1001 and the Compensation for Study for non-represented staff to ensure RTD’s base compensation
is market competitive. This has resulted in hourly wage increases for represented employees of 4%
annually in both 2023 and 2024.
In alignment with these efforts, salary increases for non-represented employees, approximately
commensurate with the increase in the Consumer Price Index for the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood area and
including a corresponding aging of the employees’ pay bands/compensation structure, are currently being
considered by the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and Chief People Officer. While a funding provision
has been included in the 2024 Proposed Budget for salary increases, this amount is a placeholder and
does not necessarily represent the final determination. For that reason, specific salary increases will not
be shared publicly at this time.
Question 7: What is the plan for the $45M net cash flow in 2023 as shown on P.21?
Response 7: Net cash flows are retained in fund balances to be used in future periods with Board
appropriation approval. RTD will experience negative cash flows in certain years, such as when large

Response 3: Yes. RTD budgets by department, cost center and object account and records those budgets
within agency financial records. The 2024 Proposed Budget materials provided for the Tuesday, November
14, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting includes a chart depicting the operating expense
breakdown by department. Staff can provide detail income statements by department as necessary.
Capital expenditures are not recorded by department.

17.A.g

Subject: Staff Response to 2024 Proposed Budget Board Inquiries
Page: 3
purchases are made, and positive cash flows in other years. The variance in net cash is managed through
reserves to ensure fiscal sustainability.

Response 8: The decrease in Outside Services noted in the draft 2024 Proposed Budget, as presented
during the Finance and Planning Committee meeting on Tuesday, October 3, 2023, is attributable to the
reduction in contracted security services. This reduction is commensurate with an increase in the Transit
Police and Emergency Management Department personnel and equipment, which increase is accounted
for in salaries and benefits and other expenses. The 2024 Proposed Budget allocation for Outside Services
reflects an overall significant increase given the inclusion of an expense for a pass-through grant, which
is offset by grant funding and has no net financial impact to RTD.
Question 9: What is the current state of reserves? Is there a reason this isn't shown in the budget?
Response 9: The 2024 Proposed Budget includes a listing of budgeted reserve or fund balances, as shown
on page 9 of the agenda packet for the Tuesday, November 14, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee
meeting. The total estimated reserves are $898.6 million.
Question 10: Leases and rentals seem to be increasing materially, what is contributing to this change?
Response 10: Leases and rentals are budgeted to increase from $3.3 million in 2023 to $5.2 million in
2024. This category represents less than 1% of the total operating budget; however, the increase is due
to higher lease payments for the Civic Center administrative building in which many staff offices are
located.
Question 11: Have we been able to reduce costs through partnerships and similarly increase services? This is a
core tenet of the strategic plan and it'd be good to see how we're doing from a dollars stand point on these
initiatives.
Response 11: The 2023 Budget included $2 million for the Call for Projects Partnerships Program, whereas
the 2024 Proposed Budget allocates $4 million to the program, both to continue funding commitments for
projects selected in 2023 and for new partnership efforts in 2024. This funding was made available due
to higher-than-anticipated sales and use tax revenue. It is important to note that the 2023 projects were
announced in September 2023, thus full implementation has yet to come to fruition.
Question 12: Are we carrying any reserve dollars for larger capital improvement projects? For example, we are
regularly told at meetings the challenges that having older facilities and facilities outside of our control can create.
In order to make these improvements and avoid debt in an environment like this, it would seem to make sense
that we should be carrying funds to replace things like bus depots at some point.

Question 8: We seem to be creating a strong decrease in outside services and other expenses, what is this
attributed to?

Question 13: On the revenue side, there have been a number of conversations on finding ways to diversify our
revenue. However, it does not appear that we are engaging in this when we evaluate both revenues and
expenditures, recognizing it takes money to make money. Is there a plan to act on revenue diversification? Or is
this something that would require further board action?
Response 13: During the September 12, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting (meeting), staff
presented an update regarding the creation of a Revenue Diversification Working Group (Working Group),
the concept of which originated during the Board’s 2023 retreat. The Working Group, which has held two
meetings to date, was created to investigate revenue diversification and other opportunities to mitigate
financial risk associated with reliance on a limited number of funding sources. A position paper regarding
the purpose, activities, and reporting structure of the Working Group was included in the meeting’s agenda
packet. Finance Committee Vice Chair Erik Davidson serves as the Board liaison to the Working Group.
Moreover, Chair Guissinger has participated in both Working Group meetings. Currently, the Working
Group is in the research phase.
Question 14: What is RTD contributing to the defined benefit pension plan for non-represented salaried
employees? And is this something the Board will vote on separately as used to be the case?
Response 14: The 2024 Proposed Budget includes a $15 million contribution to the non-represented
employee pension plan. This contribution is recommended by the non-represented employee pension trust
in consultation with the trust actuary and is the same amount contributed in 2023. Trustees include
Directors Broom and Dishell. This pension plan was closed to new employees on January 1, 2008.
Approximately 140 active employees and 469 inactive employees and beneficiaries are included in the
plan, and the pension is 79% funded. No separate vote will occur on this item as it is included in the 2024
Proposed Budget that that will be considered by the Board.
Question 15: In general, how is RTD doing with respect to it’s pension plans and the associated obligations: are
we caught up? How solvent are we? Are we doing anything this year to catch up?
Response 15: Both the represented and non-represented employee pension plans are closed to new
employees, which significantly reduces the financial risk to both pension beneficiaries and RTD. The nonrepresented employee pension is 79% funded, and the represented employee pension is 76% funded.
The trustees and staff are comfortable with this level of funding, since the plans are closed and future
contributions will rise in the short-term then trail off over time. The $15 million recommended contribution
includes $4 million intended to mitigate the underfunded portion of pension assets in the non-represented

Response 12: In the 2024 Proposed Budget, $185 million has been allocated to the Capital Replacement
Fund for asset renewals and replacements in accordance with the Transit Asset Management (TAM) plan.
Staff projects that the necessary funding will be available through 2029 to fund the TAM with the Capital
Replacement Fund. The Board may also consider authorizing the use of the Unrestricted Fund should
unforeseen needs arise. The agency also has other options to finance large capital purchases as necessary.

Question 16: What is included in the following expense/cash flow categories on page 21 of the Proposed Budget
a. Insurance
b. Outside services
c. Grant Revenues
d. Purchased services
Response 16: Those expenses are detailed as follows:
Insurance includes the projected expenses for self-insured claims and insurance premiums for excess
coverages for Worker’s Compensation, physical damage, and liability claims.
Outside service includes expenses incurred for utilizing third parties, including building and facility
maintenance, external IT services, contracted security services, software maintenance, Partnership
Program funding, and specialty consulting services such as engineering.
Grant revenues include formula grant funds, which are primarily derived from Federal Transit
Administration preventive maintenance grants, annually apportioned to the agency under 49 U.S.C. 5307
based on information the submitted to the National Transit Database (NTD). RTD only budgets for grants
where certainty exists that funding will be received.
Purchased transportation includes operational services provided by third parties utilizing RTD’s assets,
such as contracted fixed-route bus, paratransit and FlexRide services, in addition to commuter rail
operating service for the A, B and G lines
Question 17: What is the plan for the R Line safety improvements and where is that money coming from?
Response 17: These improvements were funded in the 2023 Budget, and this project is in the design
phase after having completed the conceptual phase. Upon completion of the 30% design, this work will
be competitively bid following a solicitation for proposals. The work is anticipated to be completed in Q1
2026.

Question 19: Where is the funding for the Partnership Program in the Budget?
Response 19: The 2024 Proposed Budget includes $4 million for the Partnership Program in the Bus
Operations Department in the Outside Services line item.
Question 20: Why hasn't the Board rec'd a status report of capex projects that are in progress/deferred/etc. in
three years? Previously, that would have been part of the MTFP. Did we change board policy?
Response 20: As RTD transitions from a program of large-scale capital expansion with respect to the
FasTracks buildout to a long-term operations and maintenance program as envisioned in the 2021-2026
Strategic Plan, a holistic review of capital projects and resource allocation is occurring as part of the Backto-Basics Strategic Initiative. This effort includes the close-out of older projects and the evaluation and
prioritization of future projects according to project criteria focused on safety, compliance, statutory
requirements and the TAM. This transition represents a significant effort, given that RTD currently has
$9.2 billion in assets. As information regarding this shift in focus is developed and finalized, staff will begin
providing updates to the Board as well as providing publicly available information on the RTD website
regarding current and future planned projects.
Question 21: Will the Board be updated as to what previously appropriated capital expenditures are/will be
abandoned - and the justification?
Response 21: Staff has included in the 2024 Proposed Budget the 2023 capital carryforward and 2024
new capital requests. A listing of closed and completed capital expenditures is not included in the 2024
Proposed Budget, since future capital expenditures will be focused on ongoing and future needs in
alignment with the Strategic Plan and TAM.
Question 22: Will there be a comprehensive update on capital carry-forward?
Response 22: Staff has included in the 2024 Proposed Budget documents the 2023 capital carryforward
list, which catalogues several individual projects that were previously approved for funding appropriation
by the Board. Staff is available to meet separately and discuss in more detail.
Question 23: Would RTD please send the list of all previously approved unexpended or unencumbered capital
project appropriations by EOB? I believe RTD maintains list that contains the description, a full summary/rationale,
a cost center/dept, the FY awarded, a tracking code, and the amount spent against the appropriation. Which
previously approved projects have been abandoned and why?

rail line for revenue service, the central corridor, which extends 5.3 miles from Broadway and I-25 Station
to 30th and Downing Street in Denver. Recognizing the rail was installed prior to the opening, it is now
more than 30 years old, and due to its age and de-icing agents used on the downtown street segment,
the paved section needs replacement.

of Internal Auditing (Standards). This mandatory guidance constitutes principles of the fundamental
requirements for the professional practice of internal auditing and for evaluating the effectiveness of the Internal
Audit Function’s performance.
The Internal Audit Function adheres to the Institute of Internal Auditors' Practice Advisories, Practice Guides,
and Position Papers as applicable to guide operations. In addition, the Internal Audit Function also adheres to

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Salaried Trustee Appointments

November 14, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
November 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve Resolution No. ______, Series of 2023, reappointing Charlene
Polege, Chief People Officer, and Bill Sirois, Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities, as Trustees
with terms expiring December 31, 2025, and appointing Jennie Waski, Senior Specialist, Benefits with a
term expiring December 31, 2024, to the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit Pension Plan (DB plan) and
Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Retirement Plan (DC plan) Trusts.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 001, Series of 2008 (Resolution No.
1), which established a committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee
Pension Trust Fund, and the Finance Chair (i.e., the Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit
Committee as it existed at that time) to screen applications from prospective pension and DC plan
Trustees from among “the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management
salaried employee class and…[to] bring recommendations back to the Board.”
As a revision to the process established in Resolution No. 001, the Board adopted Resolution No. 27,
Series of 2010, which stated that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have served satisfactorily and in
whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to seek applications
for renewal, and instead the application process established by the Board in 2008 would be used on
those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or appropriate to appoint new salaried Trustees to
the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008, Series of 2016 (Resolution No. 008), the Board of Directors
amended the Defined Benefit Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Retirement Trust (Trusts,
collectively) to remove the “senior” and “middle” management distinction established in Resolution No.
001. Instead, Resolution No. 008 authorized the Board to appoint two employee trustees who
participate in the DB pension plan and two who participate in the DC plan, as well as two Directors
appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer, who is a permanent member of the Trusts, to
serve as the same trustees on both trusts.

Packet Pg. 97

18.C

DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priorities of Employee Ownership and Financial Success.
RTD provides a DB pension plan to non-represented (salaried) employees hired before January 1, 2008,
and a DC retirement plan to salaried employees hired thereafter. Each plan is overseen by a Board of
Trustees comprised of four RTD staff, two Board members and the RTD Chief Financial Officer serving
as a permanent trustee. RTD staff trustees are recommended to the Board by the General Manager and
CEO for appointment, and the Board Chair, with full Board approval, appoints two Board members as
trustees.
Trustees serve staggered terms of two years.
The Board’s approval of this recommended action would accomplish the following:
Extend through December 31, 2025, the term of current trustee Charlene Polege, Chief People
Officer, whose term expires on December 31, 2023
Extend through December 31, 2025, the term of current trustee Bill Sirois, whose term expires
December 31, 2023
Appoint Jennie Waski, Senior Specialist, Benefits, to the vacant trustee position with a term
expiring December 31, 2024
The above actions would result in a body of seven trustees, with two active trustees being participants
in the closed DB pension plan.
The term extensions and appointment of these trustees will focus Trust governance with employees
who participate in and represent staff colleagues participating in these retirement plans, have expertise
in the areas of human resources, health and wellness benefits and finance, as well as maintain Board
participation in the salaried employee retirement Trusts in its capacity as a policy-making body.
Further, the Trust plan documents will continue to require Board approval for changes in plan design and
annual budget appropriation in addition to any material changes to the plans coming to the Board
through the Audit Committee.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Paratransit Vehicle Procurement

November 15, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
November 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with Model 1 Commercial Vehicles, Inc., for the purchase of 19 paratransit vehicles at a price
of $149,047 each, for a total cost of $2,831,893 in 2024. The contract also contains options for the
purchase of up to an additional 231 paratransit and 53 FlexRide vehicles over a five-year period, for an
estimated not-to-exceed cost of $49,000,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The agency’s current paratransit vehicles entered service in 2014 and have traveled an average of
156,000 miles. These vehicles now require extensive maintenance to remain in service and are in dire
need of replacement.
At the time of the vehicles’ original purchase, the planned replacement date was 2019, in alignment
with the Federal Transit Administration’s useful life benchmark of five years for such vehicles.
Replacement of the vehicles was postponed due to service reductions related to impacts from the
COVID-19 pandemic as well as budgetary constraints.
The current paratransit vehicle fleet provides 90% of service using lift-equipped vehicles, while only
25% of paratransit customers require lift-equipped vehicles. The remaining 10% of the paratransit fleet
is comprised of sedans for ambulatory trips, which account for 75% of paratransit customer demand.
The procurement described herein is part of a holistic mid-range review of fleet size and mix within the
paratransit vehicle fleet. In 2023, the review includes the procurement described herein as well as the
retirement and disposal of 50 vehicles that have met their useful life. As part of this review process,
staff will also:
• Develop a detailed stakeholder engagement plan
• Analyze industry-specific risks, benefits, and standards to assess the ideal mix between liftequipped vehicles and sedans in order to be reflective of customer needs, and finally
• Develop vehicle fleet recommendations prior to the next anticipated procurement in 2027

Packet Pg. 102

18.D

DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Priorities of
Community Value and Customer Excellence.
On June 7, 2023, RTD issued a solicitation for the replacement of paratransit and FlexRide service
vehicles. Following the open solicitation period, one proposal was received from Model 1 Commercial
Vehicles, Inc., which formerly did business as Creative Bus Sales, Inc.
Vehicles procured under the contract will conform to the configuration developed, in cooperation with
members of the disability community, at the time of a prior paratransit vehicle procurement.
Each vehicle procured under the contract will be equipped with:
• An extended lift to accommodate large mobility devices
• A security camera system, which is agency-standard for all newly procured rubber-tire vehicles
• An upgraded suspension system to provide a higher level of comfort, addressing a prevalent
customer comment with regard to paratransit vehicles that are traditionally retrofitted, as there
are no original equipment manufacturers currently designing and manufacturing paratransit
vehicles in the United States
Paratransit vehicles will offer three access areas for mobility devices, in compliance with standards
promulgated under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Any FlexRide vehicles procured would
offer two such areas.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding is included in the Amended 2023 Budget for purchase of the initial 19 paratransit vehicles.
Funding for future contract years is contemplated in the Mid-Term Financial Plan and will be presented
for the Board’s consideration annually, as identified within each year’s respective budget. Currently the
project is funded at $23,849,900.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
January 2024 Service Change

November 15, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
November 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the January 2024 Service Changes as revised and summarized in
Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators impacted by these changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 (ATU), the January
2024 Service Change Proposal facilitates both an opportunity for RTD bus and rail operators to select
new work assignments and for Service Development staff to adjust the operations plan for RTD’s transit
network.
As stated in previous reports, staffing levels continue to be the primary challenge in increasing service
levels to match those identified in the System Optimization Plan (SOP). Considering the agency’s current
staffing levels and anticipated attrition, the January 2024 Service Change recommendations are
designed to have minimal impacts to staffing levels. The recommended changes to service are centered
on improving system performance and CBA compliance related to respite time.
DISCUSSION
The recommended service changes herein include a mix of service improvements and adjustments
centered on system maintenance. Adjustments to bus schedules are aimed at improving on-time
performance on services such as the 15/15L – East Colfax routes, which will see construction related to
the East Colfax Bus Rapid Transit project. Rail line schedule analyses are also recommended to address
system network connections and signal system delays experienced in the downtown Denver area. This
recommended service change includes schedule adjustments on over 20 routes/lines of service to
improve service reliability and network connectivity.

Packet Pg. 104

18.E

In alignment with Strategic Plan priorities, relating most directly to Customer Excellence, and recognizing
RTD’s workforce challenges, the proposals herein are directed at improving on-time performance,
maintaining compliance with the agency’s CBA with ATU.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on RTD service standards
• Effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit-dependent markets
• Availability of alternative services to affected riders
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the district and family of services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act objectives: benefits and services are provided without
regard to race, color or national origin; also, corrective and remedial action is taken to
prevent disparate impacts on low income and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
A summary of the service proposals is provided below, which are detailed in Attachment A.
Public Hearings Summary
Three public hearings were conducted:

the Board of Directors, shall be independent in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. To qualify as
independent, an audit committee member may not be employed by, or provide any services to, the organization
beyond their duties as a committee member or Board Member. The members should collectively possess sufficient
knowledge of audit, finance, specific industry knowledge, IT, law, governance, risk, and control. Because the
responsibilities of the Audit Committee evolves in response to regulatory, economic, and reporting developments, it

year
The term of office for an Audit Committee member is two years for a Board Member, except for two initial one-year
terms upon initial formation of the Audit Committee. Board Members will have a two-year term, staggered with at
least two Board members’ terms overlapping an election year. External members of the Audit Committee will have
two or three-year terms, staggered to overlap election years. Continuance of Audit Committee members will be
reviewed annually. To ensure continuity within the Audit Committee, the appointment of members should be
staggered to avoid full turnover in the Audit Committee.
Each member of the Audit Committee shall serve for such term or terms as the Board may determine or until his or
her earlier resignation, removal or death. Any vacancy on the Committee shall be filled by the Board. No member of
the Audit Committee shall be removed as a member, except upon the affirmative vote of ten Directors.

all Audit Committee meetings. The Chief Audit Executive or designee will facilitate and coordinate meetings as well
as provide ancillary support to the committee, as time and resources permit.
Meeting agendas will be prepared in consultation with Audit Committee members, management, and its auditors, to
be provided in advance to members, along with appropriate briefing materials. Minutes will be prepared and all

limitations and significant interim changes to Executive Leadership and the Audit Committee. The internal audit
plan is developed based on a prioritization of the audit universe using a risk-based methodology, including input
of Executive Leadership, the Audit Committee, and the Board. The CAE reviews and adjusts the plan, as

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Board Schedule for In-person and Remote Meetings

November 16, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
November 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the default meeting location for full Board and Committee
Meetings. In adopting this action, unless otherwise determined by the Chair in consultation with the
Executive Committee, the Board anticipates holding all standing and ad hoc committee meetings virtually
and holding monthly Board Meetings, Special Board Meetings, and Study Sessions in-person at the 1660
Blake Street Offices. In-person meetings will retain a hybrid or virtual option for public participation.
REPRESENTATIVE
Lynn Guissinger, Board Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the Tuesday, January 31, 2023, Board Meeting, the Directors discussed options for the
resumption of certain in-person meetings. From this discussion, the following themes emerged:
1. All meetings to be held in-person every other month
2. All meetings to be held virtually
3. All committee/ad hoc meetings to be held virtually, with Board Meetings, Special Board Meetings,
and Study Sessions to be held in person
4. All monthly meetings for a given month to be held in person on a quarterly basis
5. All meetings to be held in-person
Board Office staff later polled the Directors and asked them to rank the options by order of preference.
Of the Directors who responded anonymously to the ranked choice polling, a majority of Directors
preferred option 3. Beginning March 28, 2023, all Committee meetings were held virtually, and Board
Meetings, Special Board Meetings, and Study Sessions were held in person.
DISCUSSION
During the October 18, 2023, Study Session, the Board discussed its meeting location plan for the 2024
meeting cycle. A majority of the Directors present indicated that they wished to continue the 2023
meeting practice (option 3 above) indefinitely.

Packet Pg. 131

19.G

Until the Board determines otherwise, all future meetings are expected to follow the hybrid meeting
process established in 2023, with all standing and ad hoc committee meetings to be held virtually, and
Board Meetings, Special Board Meetings, and Study Sessions to be held in-person.
The Chair, in consultation with the members of the Executive Committee, may determine that a change
in meeting location for a given meeting, whether virtual or in-person, is necessary or advantageous to
the Board or its committees. Sufficient public notice will be given in the event of any change of meeting
location.
Approval of this recommended action meets the agency’s Strategic Priorities of Community Value and
Customer Excellence.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Board Office budget contains sufficient allocations to meet the anticipated expenses associated with
this action.

Executive Summary
Proposed Changes to RTD Board of Directors Expense Policy and Procedures Manual

Overview: In August 2023, the Board Office embarked on a full review of the RTD Board of Directors
Expense Policy and Procedures Manual. The document was last updated in 2019 and stands to benefit
from, among other items, numerous changes to align the document with current Board Office practices
and recent changes to RTD’s employee travel policies.
Timeline: The timeline for fall 2023 review is as follows
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

August: Board Office staff draft recommendations for changes to the policy
August: Chair reviews initial draft changes
August-September: RTD General Counsel and CFO review draft changes
September: Executive Committee reviews drafts changes
September: Full board is provided with draft changes
October: Executive Committee re-reviews
October: Full board considers for approval

Categories of proposed changes: Generally, the proposed changes to the policy fall into the following
categories: revisions to align the board’s travel policies with that of the agency; additions to drive financial
transparency; edits to clarify language; adaptations of policies to align with current practices and a
modernization of business expenses; changes to use more inclusive language; and modifications to drive
clarity as well as reduce redundancy.
Key proposed changes: Key changes to the policy include
•
•
•
•
•

Replacing per meal and incidental expense reimbursement with a per diem system for out-ofdistrict travel. (Aligns with RTD employee travel policy change)
Addition of a fourth expense category for out-of-district conference registrations to drive financial
transparency.
Modernization of business expenses to include changes in air fare and hotel pricing
Explicitly creating the option for Directors to receive an RTD issued cell phone
More clearly identifying acceptable expenses

Next steps: Should the Board adopt these changes the new policy would take effect starting January 1,
2024. And while the Board would retain the ability to update the policy further at any time, the policy
would then be placed on a review cycle to be revisited in the fall of 2026.

19.H.b

The Regional Transportation District Act, specifically in sections 32-9-114 (d) and
32-9-117, establishes the authority for reimbursement of necessary expenses
pertaining to the activities of the District. The following policy is intended to give
guidance and set limits on expenses and allowable reimbursements for members of
the RTD Board of Directors. The Board has directed the agency to provide these funds
to Directors only for conducting official RTD business.
1.0.

General Policy

Directors are eligible for reimbursement from the District for reasonable expenses
incurred that are necessary to the transaction of official District business. Each
Director must exercise sound judgment when incurring and submitting for
reimbursement such expenses, in keeping within the standards and proprieties of an
agency supported by public tax dollars. These funds are not intended to be used in a
discretionary way for special projects or initiatives undertaken by individual Directors.
Each Director’s annual limit for allowable expenses and reimbursements is as follows:
Travel Expense and Local Expense
Conferences

$6000

$4000
*The Chair may
access up to an
additional $1500

IT Expenses for Out of District
Monthly
Conference
Internet/Phone*
Registration
Fees
$1680
$1800.00

*IT expenses eligible for reimbursement are outlined in Section 5.0, Business
Communications.

The expense limits outlined above may not be exceeded but for the following
exceptions:
• Under direction from the Chair, the Board Office may transfer funds between
a Director’s Travel and Local accounts to cover allowable expenses incurred
or anticipated to be incurred by the Director.
• The Chair may utilize funds from the Chair’s account to pay for another
Director’s travel or local expenses.
Directors who do not meet their limit for expense reimbursement may not transfer
unused portions to another director. Any unused portions will not roll over to the next
fiscal year and Directors are not eligible to be issued an RTD Procurement Card (PCard).

Introduction

3 of 15

Packet Pg. 139

The Board of Directors may choose to periodically limit by way of resolution the
amount annually allocated to the Directors’ expense accounts as the economy and
the fiscal sustainability of the District dictate.
The Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District has taken formal action
to delegate authorization for travel necessary to the transaction of official business,
within budget limitations, as follows:
• The Chair may authorizebusiness, conference, and training travel, including
associated expenses for Directors.
• The allowable reimbursable expenses contained in this document are detailed
in Section 2.0, Reimbursable Expenses.
The Chair may choose to deny a request from a Director for travel not covered by
this policy, refer the request to the Executive Committee, or both. The Chair may
refer any travel or reimbursement request to the Executive Committee without the
Chair’s prior determination on the request.
A Director whose request for travel has been denied by the Chair or the Executive
Committee may appeal for reconsideration of the denial by the full Board. Unless the
travel request is subsequently approved, the Board Office cannot make further travel
arrangements related to the denied trip. A Director is not eligible for reimbursement
for the cost of any unapproved travel costs or arrangements booked by the Director.
The Chair must deny the travel request of any Director who has expended or will
have expended prior to the trip all funds from the Director’s travel budget, unless the
Chair elects to authorize the Board Office to pay for the Director’s travel expenses
using supplemental funds.
The Board of Directors may not incur expenses to any RTD departmental (except
Board Office) or non-departmental budget code. All incurred travel related-expenses
eligible for reimbursement by a Director must be charged to the Director’s travel
Budget.

For local, transit-related events sponsored by RTD, a Director is eligible for
reimbursement for normal, customary expenses incurred by the Director, and a guest,
The expenses of the Director and the Director’s guest, are paid from the Director’s
local expense fund. (Resolution 002, Series of 2019).
While the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission has ruled that Article XXIX of
the State Constitution (also referred to as Amendment 41) pertaining to ethics in
government does not specifically apply to the RTD Board, the recommendation from
RTD’s General Counsel is for Directors to refrain from accepting anything of greater
than nominal value in the exercise of their official duties. A Director who attends, in
as an exercise of their official duties, an event for which the expected value of
attendance exceeds $75.00 is responsible for the cost of their attendance. Directors
may submit itemized receipts for reimbursement, or the Board Office can make

purpose, and the name and title of any qualifying attendee, if applicable. An ordinary
expense is one that is common and accepted in one’s field of trade, business, or
profession. Political meetings, partisan conferences, or political group activities
cannot be covered as an RTD expense.
If meetings between multiple Directors and either employees or business contacts
result in the a subsequent request to reimburse for a meal, the meal costs are equally
divided among the Directors attending and charged to each Director’s local expense
account accordingly. Directors are not eligible for reimbursement for meals or event
fees incurred by guests except as described in Section 1.0, General Policy.
In the event that RTD purchases a table for an event for which not all seats are
claimed by Directors and staff, a Director may request additional seats on a firstcome, first-served basis and may invite a guest at no cost to the Director’s local
expense account.
Any incidental local expenses submitted without a proper itemized receipt will only
be reimbursed up to $10.00.
In-person Board and/or Committee Meetings are typically catered for the convenience
of Directors. If a Director chooses to have a meal ordered for them by the Board
Office, the cost of the meal will be charged back to their local account. If a Director
chooses to purchase their own meal from a different vendor, the Director must
provide an itemized receipt in order to be reimbursed for the meal cost.
Directors are not eligible for reimbursement for expenses, such as meals, flights,
hotels, etc., whether local or out-of-District, for any non-RTD transit-related business.
This includes expenses incurred by spouses, significant others, guests, or
dependents. In the event that a Director departs from an out-of-district event or
conference earlier than anticipated or stays longer than originally scheduled through
the Board Office, the Director cannot be reimbursed for meals or lodging fees for the
full days missed due to early departure or additional days of expenses incurred as a
result of staying longer. For any additional airline fees or charges incurred as the
result of a flight change due to an early departure or late stay, the Director must bear
the cost as a personal expense.

The following expenses are not authorized for reimbursement: Personal expenses
such as personal hygiene items, magazines, in-room movies, in-flight movies, preboarding fees, laundry, childcare, pet care, etc.
• Trip insurance for flights and/or hotel
• Travel Insurance (note:
All Directors receive Travel and Accident
Insurance, which covers the Director while traveling on district business.
• Alcohol (Reference RTD Drug and Alcohol policy)

The Chair has flexibility in approving Director expenses. If requested expenses do
not fall within the expense guidelines, the Chair may seek advice and
recommendations from the Executive Committee.
This policy is not designed to provide guidance on every conceivable expense
reimbursement request, as such, Directors are encouraged to seek advanced preapproval for any potential expense which is not explicitly covered elsewhere in this
document.

Travel Request Process

Travel arrangements for the RTD Directors are typically handled by the Board Office,
and a travel authorization must be received before travel. Directors should contact
the office at least 30 days in advance and provide all information needed to complete
the airline and hotel accommodations. If a Director chooses to make their own travel
arrangements, all travel confirmations are to be provided to the Board Office at the
time of booking for the purpose of record keeping and expense tracking.
When requesting travel arrangements, Directors should provide the following
information to the Board Office:
• Conference name
• Requested arrival and departure dates/times
• Preferred airline and frequent flyer number (if applicable)
• Any applicable discounts, credits or travel miles to be utilized
• Special considerations
Unless prior approval is obtained, the Board Office arranges Directors’ travel on the
most economical fare for the required journey and makes every effort to book the
Directors their desired flights and host hotel accommodations. The Board Office
provides electronic travel confirmations to each Director with the flight and hotel
confirmations, transportation information, a copy of the event registration and
agenda, and other pertinent travel materials.
Travel requests received less than seven business days before the scheduled trip are
processed based on the most current rates and availability.
If a Director cancels their scheduled trip, any airline, conference, or hotel cancellation
penalties will be deducted from their travel and/or conference registration fee
account, as applicable.

Air transportation for travel to out-of-District conferences and events is typically
arranged by the RTD Board Office. Travel by indirect routes, or inclusion of side-trips
for personal reasons, must be approved by the Chair. Reimbursement for travel
expenses in a host city is allowed one day before the start of a conference or one
day following scheduled conference events where travel scheduling provisions or
same day flight times are not available or convenient, such as when a Director would
need to fly from Denver to Washington, D.C., on Saturday to arrive in time for a
conference with a start day of Sunday, and no flights are available for the Director
to arrive in time for the Sunday meeting start time.
Directors are responsible for any portion of ticket costs resulting from personal side
trips (including hotel, food, ground transportation, and parking).
If the RTD air travel is a portion of another planned flight that has been arranged
directly by the Director, a copy of the itinerary and ticket claiming reimbursement
must be provided to the Board Office at the time of booking.
A Director is responsible for any first-class, business class, and pro-rata boarding
expenses.
If not purchased simultaneously with the airline ticket, a Director will be reimbursed
for costs associated with both a standard seat selection and checked and/or carryon bags.
Directors who wish to track their frequent flyer miles (if applicable) must provide the
Board Office with the frequent flyer number at the time of the booking. The Board
Office requests this information in advance, but it is the sole responsibility of the
Director to ensure his or her account has been credited with the frequent flyer mileage
information.
All air transportation credits paid for by RTD are to be utilized in the booking of future
Director travel only and are not for personal use.
4.1.2. Ground Transportation
Directors are eligible for reimbursement for the actual expense of ground
transportation necessary to conduct official business. As a representative for the
transit agency, Directors are expected to utilize the most efficient, timely, and costeffective ground transportation when traveling locally or out of town, namely public
transit, complimentary shuttlebus service provided by a hotel or conference,
transportation network company such as UBER or LYFT, taxi, or rental car, in this
order of preference. If a Director pays for the transportation of other Directors or
staff, all names are to be documented on the receipt and expense report for
reimbursement.

Car rental expenses are permitted only with prior approval of the RTD Board Chair
and only when another means of transportation is not feasible. Rental car
arrangements should be made by the Board Office staff. Travel between the airport
and the hotel or conference center by rental car or other means are eligible for
reimbursement with receipts provided that the Chair has authorized the rental.
The rental car should be contracted for a size appropriate for the number of
passengers. The Director must include a copy of the rental contract when submitting
the expense report. Reasonable parking fees for rental cars may be claimed for
reimbursement. (Note: Travelers must ensure that adequate insurance coverage is in
place by purchasing optional insurance coverage as part of the rental agreement.
(Cars are to be refueled before returning to the rental agency.)
4.1.4. Personal Vehicles and Travel Outside the District Other Than by
Air
The use of personal vehicles outside of the District is not encouraged. Directors must
have the Chair’s approval prior to using a personal vehicle for official business outside
the boundaries of the District
If approved, the mileage reimbursement for out of district travel cannot exceed a
reasonable flight cost to and from the destination.

4.1.5. Mileage Reimbursement
The standard vehicle mileage allowance is determined annually by the Internal
Revenue Service.
All mileage incurred, including to and from the airport for local events and/or travel,
by a Director is paid through the appropriate expense cost code to the Director on all
submitted expense forms.
Director’s expense accounts will cover the first 30 miles of mileage reimbursement
per event. Any mileage that exceeds 30 miles will be charged to a Board Office
expense account for mileage differential.
4.2.

Lodging (Hotel Accommodations)

The Board Office typically books lodging accommodations via P-Card for each
Director attending an out-of-District event. In the event these fees are not pre-paid,
the Director must submit a copy of the official hotel bill with the expense report when
claiming reimbursement.
The Board Office makes reasonable arrangements at the single occupancy rate for
hotel accommodations in accordance with acceptable standards for that location.
For APTA conferences, hotel reservations cannot be booked until the attendee is
registered for the conference. Directors should inform the Board Office staff in a
RTD Board of Directors Expense and Reimbursement Policy

timely manner they wish to attend a conference, otherwise the conference hotel
could fill up.
Hotels typically require a personal credit card for the person staying at the hotel for
purpose of incidental expenditures. Arrangements made via RTD P-Card only cover
room, tax, and any other destination/mandatory fees (if applicable). Upon check in,
Directors will need to provide the front desk with their own personal credit cards for
miscellaneous expenses. When checking out, Directors are advised to check that
their personal credit cards were not charged for room and tax.
Note* For Directors using a debit or bank card to cover miscellaneous expenses, the
hotel may place a hold on the card in a set amount for the duration of the stay.
Directors are eligible for reimbursement for the actual cost of lodging, including room
charges, taxes and fees. Directors who are unable or unwilling to stay at the
conference host hotel, should adhere, whenever possible, to recommended GSA
nightly lodging rates.

4.3.
Per Diem for Meals and Incidental Travel Expenses
Directors traveling out of district on official RTD business will be reimbursed a daily
per diem amount according to the current federal Continental United States (CONUS)
published reimbursement rates to be used for the cost of meals or other incidental
travel expenses including housekeeping , tips, snacks, drinks, etc. There is no need
for a Director to submit receipts for these items in their travel reimbursement request
as they will receive the CONUS per diem rate by travel location for each day of
business travel, therefore, it is within the Director’s discretion to determine the usage
of this amount. This per diem reimbursement amount will be adjusted annually in
accordance with the General Services Administration federal CONUS reimbursement
rate.

Directors cannot be reimbursed for any day(s) that they may choose to go early or
stay late for personal reasons. (See Section 2.0, Reimbursable Expenses.)

4.4.

In State Travel Out of District

Directors travelling within the state but outside the District to attend seminars,
conferences, or transit-related meetings are eligible for reimbursement for travel
expenses. Covered expenses include registration fees, lodging, standard mileage,
and Per Diem. Directors are not eligible for reimbursement for lodging expenses
without the prior approval of the Chair. For additional information regarding in state
travel see section 4.1.4 Personal Vehicles and Travel outside the District other than
Air. (Approved Travel and Local policy, November 20, 2007)

Business Communications (cell phone, internet)

Directors are eligible for reimbursement for a home office setup package from their
local expense account. Eligible equipment includes high-speed internet equipment
such as a cable modem and router, and printer. The Director is responsible for
selection, use, ownership, loss, and replacement of all equipment after initial
reimbursement by the District. Directors may opt to purchase the equipment or utilize
RTD-owned equipment. Equipment purchased by Directors and reimbursed is
considered RTD property.
Each Director, upon their request, will be provided an RTD issued and owned smart
phone and a laptop/tablet. RTD owned equipment is subject to RTD rules for the use
and handling of agency-owned equipment, including but not limited to policies
governing the type of information permitted to be stored or accessed on the computer
or smart phone. All equipment provided or purchased with funds that were later
reimbursed by the District remains the property of the District and must be returned
upon the Director’s departure from office.
In the alternative, Directors may use their existing equipment or may acquire their
own equipment for use in conducting their official duties. To be eligible for
reimbursement for recurring IT expenses, a Director must submit on a monthly basis
a telephone and/or internet bill indicating the amount paid and location of the internet
services being provided. Monthly reimbursement claims that are not accompanied by
supporting documentation are not eligible for reimbursement.
Monthly IT
reimbursements are capped at $140.00 per Director.

6.0.

Out of District Conference Registrations

Registration fees for conferences, workshops, or other approved events are typically
pre-paid directly by the Board Office. In circumstances where a Director pays for their
own registration fees, the Director is eligible for reimbursement post travel/event and
must submit with the expense report, when claiming reimbursement, a receipt or
proof of registration fee paid.
The Board cannot exceed its budget allocations for conferences, seminars, and other
such events. Out-of-District registration fees for each Director are charged to the
Directors Conference Registration Fee budget. Local registration fees are charged to
the Directors’ local expense account.

Professional Affiliations/Membership Subscriptions

The Regional Transportation District encourages development of Directors through
active membership in professional organizations.
Although membership in
professional affiliations can be an indirect benefit to RTD as an organization, the main
benefit is the development of the Director, by allowing the Director to keep abreast
of trends in their transportation or technology, cultivate networks with other
professionals, and develop skills and ideas to become more effective in their policymaking at RTD. Any memberships that are of an extraordinary cost or that require
approval will go before the Executive Committee for approval.
Membership subscriptions in local chambers or approved organizations are processed
through the RTD Public Relations Office. Directors should submit their membership
requests through the Board office who will track and coordinate with the RTD staff
responsible for payment. Organizations must meet the criteria of being transit-related
and/or necessary to the conduct of business and local community involvement.
Membership requests that do not fit this criterion must be approved through the
General Manager’s budget. The Board policy on Organizational Memberships was
passed in August of 2011.

8.0.

Participation in Transit Related Community Events

A Director is eligible for reimbursement for normal, customary expenses associated
with attending an event for the Director and one guest, so long as the event is transit
related. The expenses of the Director and one guest are paid from the Director’s local
expense fund.
Directors may sponsor a transit related community event with advance approval of
the Chair. Any sponsorship costs will be deducted from the Director’s local expense
account.
9.0.

Participation in Community Non-Transit Related Events

Participation in community non-transit related events is supported by RTD with
approval of the benefit to the agency. Such events are essential in getting the
community involved in the mission and vision of RTD. At times the General Manager
or RTD outreach departments purchase a table at a community event and invite
Directors as ambassadors for RTD at no cost to the Director.
Any other approved events are paid for out of the Director’s local expense budget.
Should a Director decide to purchase a table for an event in the Director’s community
with local expense funds, any unused seats are to be paid for out of the Director’s
local budget as well.

At no time can a Director’s expense funds or RTD funds be used for any event or
expenditure that is political in nature. For guidance on determining whether an event
or expenditure is political in nature, Directors should consult with RTD General
Counsel.

11.0. Expense Reports
11.1. Travel Expense Reports
Pursuant to IRS guidelines, a Director should submit a completed expense report to
the Board Office no later than the end of the month following the Director’s return to
the District. (e.g., If the trip was taken in October, the expense report is due no later
than by November 30th). The Executive Committee reserves the right to suspend the
provision of travel arrangements for any Director who is delinquent in submitting an
expense report. If extra time is needed to complete the expense report or the Director
has a valid reason for the delay, the Chair should be notified to make the decision to
extend this timeline.
The Board Office processes one travel expense report, post travel, for each Director
traveling to an out-of-District conference or event. In order to provide processing time
for the staff to meet the deadline for submitting the reports to the Chair, the Directors
must include supporting documentation for expense reimbursement. Directors should
submit a completed expense report to the Board Office within two weeks after
returning from a trip.
11.2. Local Expense Reports
Pursuant to IRS guidelines, in order to receive reimbursement for local expenses, a
Director must submit a completed monthly local expense report to the Board Office
within 90 days of the date of the incurred expense. In the months in which no
expenses are incurred or in which the Director does not wish to claim any expense,
the Director must still submit a signed report for the reporting month with zero
balance. The Board Office will process one local expense report for each month a
Director requests reimbursement.

Directors who do not meet their limit for expense reimbursement may not transfer
unused portions to another director. Any unused portions will not roll over to the
next fiscal year and Directors are not eligible to be issued an RTD Procurement Card
(P-Card).
The Board of Directors may choose to periodically limit by way of resolution the
amount annually allocated to the Directors’ expense accounts as the economy and
the fiscal sustainability of the District dictate.
The Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District has taken formal action
to delegate authorization for travel necessary to the transaction of official business,
within budget limitations, as follows:
1.• The Chair may authorize , within budget limitations, business, conference, and
training travel, including associated expenses for Directors to consult with
Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Federal Railroad Administration (FRA),
other federal agencies, or the Congressional Delegation in Washington, D.C.,

For any travel in the last three months of service of a Director’s term, the District
cannot reimburse expenses for transit conferences to Directors who have not met
the statutory requirements to be placed on the ballot for re-election or who are term
limited. Special travel requests by these Directors to complete special projects or
those who have been approved to speak on behalf of the agency can be reviewed
for approval by the full Board, within budget limitations.

Commented [TSP4]: Removed as this is not currently practiced.

For local, transit-related events sponsored by RTD, A a Director is eligible for
reimbursement for normal, customary event expenses incurred by the Director, and

than nominal value in the exercise of their official duties. A Director who attends, in
as an exercise of their as a function of his or her official duties, an meal or event for
which the expected value of attendance exceeds $50765.00 is responsible for the

If approved, the mileage reimbursement for out of statedistrict travel cannot exceed
a reasonable flight cost to and from the destination.
If a Director chooses to travel by car or long distance rail rather than by air, the Board
Office staff will follow established guidelines to determine the lowest available flight
cost to and from the destination. If use of a personal vehicle is requested, the
Director is eligible for reimbursement for the cost of mileage up to the maximum
allowable under the Internal Revenue Service guidelines but not to exceed the cost
of air travel to the destination. The cost of the air travel is to be determined by the
Board Office staff prior to the date of travel to determine the amount that may be

The Board Office makes reasonable arrangements at the single occupancy rate for
hotel accommodations in accordance with acceptable standards for that location.
For APTA conferences, hotel reservations cannot be booked until the attendee is
registered for the conference. Directors should inform the Board Office staff in a
timely manner they wish to attend a conference, otherwise the conference hotel
could fill up.
Hotels typically require a personal credit card for the person staying at the hotel for
purpose of incidental expenditures. Arrangements made via RTD P-Card only cover
room, and tax, and any other destination/mandatory fees (if applicable). Upon check
in, the Directors will need to provide the front desk with their own personal credit
cards for miscellaneous expenses. When checking out, Directors must are advised
to ensure check that their personal credit cards were not charged for room and tax.
Note* For Directors using a debit or bank card to cover miscellaneous expenses, the
hotel may place a hold on the card in a set amount for the duration of the stay.
Directors are eligible for reimbursement for the actual cost of lodging, including room
charges, and taxes and fees. Charges other than room charges or taxes appearing
on the hotel bill may be reimbursable upon submittal of a completed, signed expense
report accompanied by itemized receipts. If Directors who are unable or unwilling to
stay at the conference host hotel, must use sound judgment in the selection of
lodging in keeping with the purpose of the travel so as to minimize the cost to the
District. it is recommended that they should adhere, whenever possible, to
recommended GSA nightlydaily lodging rates. Lodging or hotel accommodations
billed to a P-Card require itemized receipts to match to the actual incurred amount.
When a Director is accompanied by another individual, the District is to be billed only
for the single-occupancy rate for lodging. The Director must pay for the difference
between single- and double-occupancy rate for the room, if applicable.

Directors may claim reimbursement for travel expenses, including meals and

conference where travel scheduling provisions or same-day flight times are not
available or convenient, such as when a Director would need to fly from Denver to
Washington, D.C., on Saturday to arrive in time for a conference with a start day of
Sunday, and no flights are available for the Director to arrive in time for the Sunday
meeting start. Directors cannot be reimbursed for any day(s) that they may choose
to go early or stay late for personal reasons. (See Section 2.0, Reimbursable
Expenses.) Directors must provide itemized receipts for incurred travel-related
expenses.
Formatted: Justified

When attending an out-of-District event or conference for which meals are provided,
Directors are expected to reduce the number of meals for which they intend to be
reimbursed by the number of meals that are provided at the event or conference.
However, a Director is eligible for reimbursement for a meal purchased outside of the
conference if the Director submits an itemized receipt explaining the business purpose
for the meal.

3.4. Miscellaneous Expenses
Miscellaneous expenses such as meal gratuities are to be included with each meal
and indicated on the receipt submitted with the expense report. Reasonable gratuities
for baggage handling at airports or the place of lodging upon arrival and departure
are allowable and must be shown as a separate item under “miscellaneous expense”
on the expense report. Baggage fees paid to airlines for travel must be accompanied
with a receipt. Gratuity for housekeeping during lodging is an allowable expense.
Directors are not eligible for reimbursement for personal calls. Calls for District
business are fully reimbursable as long as documentation related to the person called
and the subject of the call is included with the expense report. A Director who claims
reimbursement for monthly cell phone service may not claim a business call as a
separate, additional expense if the call is also included in the monthly service.
Directors traveling out of the country should coordinate with the Board Office to
determine the most cost-effective means of carrying out RTD-related communications
during the time the Director is traveling.

Professional Affiliations/Membership Subscriptions

Commented [TSP37]: Talk to Vivian about this project.

The Regional Transportation District encourages development of Directors through
active membership in professional organizations.
Although membership in
professional affiliations can be an indirect benefit to RTD as an organization, the main
benefit is the development of the Director, by allowing the Director to keep abreast
of trends in their transportation or technology, cultivate networks with other
professionals, and develop skills and ideas to become more effective in their policymaking at RTD. Any memberships that are of an extraordinary cost or that require
approval will go before the Executive Committee for approval.

Membership subscriptions in local chambers or approved organizations are processed
through the RTD Public Relations Office. Directors should submit their membership
requests through the Board office who will track and coordinate with the RTD staff
responsible for payment. Organizations must meet the criteria of being transit-related
and/or necessary to the conduct of business and local community involvement.
Membership requests that do not fit this criterion must be approved through the
General Manager’s budget. The Board policy on Organizational Memberships was
passed in August of 2011.
For budgeted events only, such as the Board Member/Board Support conference
hosted by the Board in 2015, the budget allocations for specific events serve as the
official authorization for the Chair to approve. For out-of-District budgeted events
only, the “RTD Travel Request and Authorization” form and the expense report
require approval from the Chair.

Participation in Transit Related Community Events

A Director is eligible for reimbursement for normal, customary expenses associated
with attending an event for the Director and one guest, along with other approved
attendees as approved by the Chair, so long as the event is transit related. The
expenses of the Director and one guest are paid from the Director’s local expense
fund. The approved attendees will come from the general Board Office budget.
Directors may sponsor a transit related community event with advance approval of
the Chair. Any sponsorship costs will be deducted from the Director’s local expense
account.

Participation in community non-transit related events is supported by RTD with
approval of the benefit to the agency. Such events are essential in getting the
community involved in the mission and vision of RTD. At times the General Manager
or RTD outreach departments purchase a table at a community event and invite
Directors as ambassadors for RTD at no cost to the Director.;

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Bylaws Amendment—Director Informal Meeting Process

November 16, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
November 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to amend Article IV of the Bylaws of the Regional Transportation District to
establish a procedure for informal meetings to engage in discussions of public business with three or
more Board members.
REPRESENTATIVE
Lynn Guissinger, Board Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The proposal is intended to complement the regular structure of Board meetings by outlining how
Directors can schedule flexible and adaptable meetings when three or more members consider them to
be necessary or desirable. The purposes of such meetings include preparing a matter to bring to the
Board, discussing working relationships with stakeholders and constituents, or considering other matters
related to agency business. The scheduling Directors must provide the meeting agenda, including any
materials, the time, and location of the meeting to the Executive Manager of the Board Office and the
Board Chair at least forty-eight hours prior to the meeting. Notice of the meetings will be posted on the
Board’s online two-week calendar. Written minutes shall be recorded.
Like all Board meetings, the informal meetings will comply with applicable laws, particularly the Colorado
Open Meetings Law and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Board Office staff need not be present and
informal meetings will not be broadcasted, video recorded, and the Board Office will not prepare a
written transcript.
This item has come before the Board several times including when it was initially introduced as a threedirector initiated action item at the September 28, 2022 Board Meeting, and the matter was tabled to
the November 15, 2022 Board Meeting. At the November 15, 2022 Board Meeting the proposed
changes were tabled again and the April 25, 2023 Board Meeting was selected as the date to return to
the matter. Prior to the April 25, 2023 Board Meeting the three-director initiated action item was
withdrawn from the agenda by the Executive Committee at the Executive Committee’s April 20, 2023
meeting. This Bylaw change returned to the Board during the Board’s October 18, 2023 Study Session.
During that discussion the Board provided consensus that the Bylaw change should return to the Board
as a proposed action item. The Bylaw change is now coming to the Board as a Recommended Action.

Packet Pg. 171

19.I

DISCUSSION
The proposal can encourage useful discussion of nascent issues as well as improve the process for
Director initiated discussions and action items that come before the Board or its standing committees. If
the Bylaw amendments are adopted, Directors will have clearer guidelines to develop agendas and
choose locations suitable to the discussion topic. Blake Street will remain as a location available to
Directors who wish to utilize RTD's IT expertise, security advantages, and meeting spaces while
remaining cognizant of the additional staff burdens and costs associated with afterhours meetings.
Others may select an alternative venue commensurate with their anticipation of meeting requirements.
Nothing in these proposed Bylaw changes should be construed as limiting the ability of three or more
directors to call a Special Meeting of the Board as defined in Article IV Section 3.
The proposed Bylaw amendments add a new section to Article IV (Meetings), Section 4 (Informal
Meetings), stating:
Article IV (Meetings), Section 4 (Informal Meetings)
Informal Meetings may be called to engage in discussions of public business by three or more
Directors. The purposes of such meetings may include discussion of a matter to bring to the Board,
relationships with stakeholders and constituents, or other matters related to agency business. No
formal action may be taken. The Directors calling the meeting may set the location and agenda as
appropriate to the topic of the meeting. Written minutes shall be recorded.
Additionally, a new subsection is to be added to Article IV (Meetings), Section 8(c): Notice of Meetings.
Article IV (Meetings) Section 8(c): Notice of Meetings
Directors scheduling an Informal Meeting must provide the meeting agenda, including any materials,
the time, and location of the meeting to the Executive Manager of the Board Office and the Board
Chair at least forty-eight hours prior to the meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Additional costs could arise as a result of informal meetings being held at 1660 Blake St. after normal
business hours.

PREAMBLE

The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created
by the Regional Transportation District Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD
Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly, First
Regular Session, 1969). The District is a

political subdivision of the State of

Colorado, with those powers specifically granted and those reasonably implied from
the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the objects and purposes of the
District.

The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly
conferred by the RTD Act, at § 32-9-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the
internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD Act, while others
are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the
Board. For convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or
other laws, together with those that are adopted under delegated authority, are
combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any omission from
them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty,
or responsibility to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the
RTD Act or other applicable laws as they now exist or may be amended.

PREAMBLE

The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created
by the Regional Transportation District Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD
Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly, First
Regular Session, 1969). The District is a

political subdivision of the State of

Colorado, with those powers specifically granted and those reasonably implied from
the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the objects and purposes of the
District.

The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly
conferred by the RTD Act, at § 32-9-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the
internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD Act, while others
are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the
Board. For convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or
other laws, together with those that are adopted under delegated authority, are
combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any omission from
them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty,
or responsibility to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the
RTD Act or other applicable laws as they now exist or may be amended.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Potential Bylaw Amendment—Committee Work Plans

November 16, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Board Office Executive Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
At the Study Session on October 18, 2023, the Board of Directors discussed the idea of annual
committee work plans.
Annual committee work plans are a useful tool for ensuring the Board and staff collaborate effectively to
accomplish the necessary work of the agency and Board, while providing dedicated space for the Board
to pursue governance/policy objectives and gain further insights into matters of interest to Directors.
Work plans elevate and respect the role of the committees of the Board as some of the most effective
forums for completing the work of the Board.
At the conclusion of the discussion on October 18, 2023, the Board provided consensus guidance to
Board Office staff to develop a formal discussion item for a Bylaw amendment that would broadly define
the process for creating and approving annual committee work plans.
DISCUSSION
The Board is asked to Discuss the following proposed change to Article VI (Committees of the Board),
Section 4 (Work Plans)
Article VI (Committees), Section 4 (Committee Work Plans)
Each standing and ad hoc committee must create, approve and forward to the full board for review an
annual work plan detailing the major issues the committee will consider throughout the fiscal year.
The work plan shall be developed in collaboration between the respective committee’s chair, vice
chair, and the responsible RTD administrator(s) with the input of the committee’s members. The work
plan must be created and approved by the committee no later than March of each year. Work plans
for standing committees may, for purposes of ensuring the continuity of a standing committee’s
work, extend through February of the following fiscal year.
While leaving space for matters that may arise through the course of a year, a good work plan will
outline what Discussion Items will be discussed and when, as well as what Recommended Actions will

20.1

be taken and when. Additionally, work plans should provide staff/administration greater ability to plan
for and respond to Director requests. Directors should utilize work plans as guiding documents in their
endeavors to maximize the Board’s focus and minimize the amount of staff time spent on topics with
little consensus support. A committee should revisit its work plan regularly.
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the Board’s ability to effectively govern directly impacts the
overall performance of the agency.
