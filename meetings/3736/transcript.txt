ERIK DAVIDSON: And this is Erik Davidson. I am present. That's 13 present, one absent. For the sake of
clarity in the record, Director Dishell is no longer on the Board.
I would like to note, for the sake of the record actually, that the reason for that is that Director Dishell
resigned his position as of yesterday, which is November 17, as he is no longer a resident of District D.
Please note that the Special Board Meeting does not have a section for public comment this evening.
However, the Board can still offer-- I'm sorry, the public can still offer comments to the Board by email or
by participating remotely in the regularly scheduled Board meeting, which will be on December 3.
We'll move to the next section of our agenda. This is our Executive Session. In a moment, the Board will
meet in executive session to discuss personnel matters regarding the General Manager and CEO's 2024
performance self appraisal. I would like to append the motion to move into executive session to state that
the special board meeting will be deemed adjourned after it adjourns into the executive session. For
public transparency, this means that once the Board moves into executive session, the main meeting will
be adjourned.
I will, in a moment, entertain a motion to move into executive session to discuss the following. Executive
session pursuant to Section 24-6-4024(f)(i) CRS for consideration of personnel matters regarding
presentation by General Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson of 2024 performance self-appraisal,
preliminary performance feedback from the Board of directors, and discussion of the same.
Do I have a motion?
LYNN GUISSINGER: So moved.
JULIAN BOUQUET: Second.
ERIK DAVIDSON: I have Guissinger as the movant, the second as Bouquet.
Are there any no votes to move into executive session? All right. Seeing none, that'll be 13 aye, zero no.
With that, we will take a moment for technology to switch over to the executive session. If everyone could
just remain where they are. But we'll take a couple minutes and the main meeting will be adjourned as of
5:38 PM Mountain Standard Time.
All right.
