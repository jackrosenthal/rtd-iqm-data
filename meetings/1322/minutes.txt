Recommended Actions:
2010 Financial Plan Adoption
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors adopt a financial plan scenario for the 2010 FasTracks
Annual Program Evaluation that includes the passage of a 0.4% sales and use
tax increase commencing in January 2011 and successful receipt of an
additional Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) for the East and Gold Line
Public Private Partnership Corridors (EAGLE P3 Project) in the amount of
approximately $1 billion. This scenario results in the completion of the full
FasTracks program by 2017, and provides the basis for RTD to proceed
forward with DRCOG review of the FasTracks program and financial plan as
required by Senate Bill 90-208.
Because a decision has not been made as to the timing of a potential election,
it is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors also adopt a secondary
plan or “back up” plan. This would include adoption of a financial plan
scenario for the FasTracks program that assumes the passage of 0.4% sales
and use tax increase commencing in January 2013. This scenario results in
the completion of the full FasTracks program by 2019, assuming current cost
escalation and revenue growth forecasts.
This action does not represent a decision or commitment at this time by the
Board of Directors to place a sales and use tax increase on the ballot, but it
preserves the capability for the RTD Board of Directors to continue
consideration of all potential scenarios for completion of the FasTracks
program. Should the Board choose not to seek a tax increase, the secondary
financial plan would be adopted by the RTD Board.
The Board requested the language be changed to not give the perception that
a decision has been made to go out for a vote in 2010.
This action allows RTD staff to move forward with DRCOG process.
Director Tayer requested more analysis done on the shelf life of the
environmental studies in light of going to the ballot in 2012.
MOTION:

Director Martinez made a motion to
forward this item to the full board at the
February 16, 2010 Board Meeting.

SECOND:

Director Kemp seconded the motion.

MOTION:

Goldman Sachs – Incentive Fee and Increase in Monthly Retainer
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors approve payment of an incentive fee in the amount of $1.40 million
to Goldman Sachs in consideration of work performed outside of original
scope of its contract as financial advisor on the Eagle Project.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the
Board of Directors approve an increase in the monthly retainer paid to
Goldman Sachs from $25,000 to $56,500, effective as of January 2010, in
consideration of the increased level of effort beyond what was anticipated at
the time of contract award.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize a transfer of $1,778,000 from the FasTracks
Contingency Reserve to the FasTracks expense budget to fund the incentive
payment and the increase in the monthly retainer for 2010.
The Board wants to see more substantiation and documentation based on
facts as to why the $1.4 and the increase in monthly retainer is merited.
Chair Kemp recommended putting this item on Recommended Action and that
more detailed information be included.

this item to the full board at the February

(CCD) for the East Corridor project (a part of the Eagle P3 project). The
agreements include 1) a proposed IGA with CCD regarding overall
coordination with the City, and 2) a proposed IGA regarding coordination with
Denver International Airport (DIA). The agreements include specific terms
defining CCD’s local agency contribution, coordination, and the rights and
responsibilities of each party.

Approval for providing construction funding in an amount not to exceed $9
million to the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) for continued
construction for Denver Union Station (DUS)
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an IGA with
DUSPA to provide additional funding through a loan in an amount not to
exceed $9 million for construction on the DUS project. This funding will
allow DUSPA to issue a full Notice to Proceed prior to financial close of the
federal TIFIA and RRIF loans for the DUS project, and will be repaid by
DUSPA through draws on the federal loans. This recommendation is
contingent upon receipt by DUSPA of a favorable decision by the U.S.
Department of Transportation (DOT) for the TIFIA and RRIF loans
respectively.
It is also recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to transfer $9
million from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve to provide continued
funding for the DUS construction. This action will accelerate funding
programmed in the DUS Budget for 2010 to allow full construction to start
and maintain the FasTracks schedule. The Contingency Reserve will be
replenished from DUSPA’s federal loans draw.
