Executive Committee
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you, Tai-Shrae. So we'll call to order the executive committee. We are convened
as of 12:03 PM on September 22 2022. I'd ask everybody tuning in here to mute yourself until you're
called upon.
I'll now call the roll. First Vice Chair Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Here.
VINCE BUZEK: Second Vice Chair Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Here.
VINCE BUZEK: Secretary Sloan.
MARJORIE SLOAN: Here.
VINCE BUZEK: Treasurer Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Present.
VINCE BUZEK: And Buzek is here. Other Directors in attendance are Director Tisdale, and that's the only
other director I see. We've got our General Manager and CEO, Debra Johnson, our General Counsel,
Melanie Snyder, and a host of other important staff people. Thank you all for being here.
The first part of our agenda is the public comment section. I'd like to open up public comment to anyone
who would like to address the committee regarding any topic listed in the published meeting agenda for
the current and immediately preceding month. If you wish to speak and have not already done so, please
either raise your virtual hand or press star nine on your phone. Staff will unmute you when it's your turn to
speak. If you are dialed in, press star six to toggle your mute settings.
Please bear in mind that by participating in this process, you are being recorded. If you do not wish to be
recorded, then your comments will need to be submitted in writing. If any speaker has documentation or
reference materials for the committee or if any member of the public would like to submit written
comments, please email those materials to the Board office at the following email address,
rtd.boardoffice@rtd-denver.com.
During public comments, the committee will not offer comments or responses. Directors or staff may
contact speakers following their comments if they raise matters that lend themselves to follow-up.
Speakers should begin their remarks by stating their names, and each speaker will have 3 minutes to
speak. And Tai-Shrae, do we have anybody in the queue to speak?
TAI-SHRAE PARISH: I do not see any hands raised.

VINCE BUZEK: OK, and I understand we have no email comments received by the Board office. That
being said, I will now close the public comment period and move to our first recommended action, which
is recommended action to allow for a bylaw change. And I believe there's an amendment to that that just
came through as well.
So it's going to be as amended by the amendment that has come forward via email to everybody. So I'm
to be looking for a motion that recommends by the RTD Board of Directors, Dishell, Guissinger, and
Sloan, the Board of Directors, to amend Article IV of the bylaws of the Regional Transportation District to
establish a procedure for informal meetings to engage in discussions of public business with three or
more Board members in addition to regular Board, special Board, standing committee, and ad hoc
committee meetings. Do I have a motion?
LYNN GUISSINGER: So moved.
MARJORIE SLOAN: Second.
VINCE BUZEK: Guissinger and Sloan. And how about discussion on this? Director Sloan, you look like
you're ready to speak.
MARJORIE SLOAN: I am. I am on my husband's computer right now because mine died immediately
before we came up here. And just as a note, I will get off this computer and onto my phone for the
executive session, just to be safe.
But yes, I am really pleased to bring this matter to the Board. It's taken awhile, and I think with every
group of comments, it's improved. But what Directors Guissinger, Dishell, and I are proposing is a plan to
provide a way to do informal Board meetings.
And I would note first that it is in compliance with both the letter and the spirit of legislation involving RTD
Board members. It complies with the Open Meetings Act, and we will make arrangements for it to comply
with all anti-discrimination measures as well. As far as the spirit goes, it will also be more transparent for
not only other Board members to find out ideas that are being pursued by their colleagues but also the
public, and participate or observe as the meeting is called.
So it is in compliance and, really, beyond compliance with all legislation. It's also very useful. It will allow
for both procedural efficiency and substantive effectiveness.
As far as procedure goes, as you know, according to our current provisions, we cannot discuss
substantive issues that come before the Board with more than two people. And that's under the law. This
provides for a way to be more efficient in terms of getting Board members involved, aware of things that
are going on.
And specifically, as far as efficiency goes, I'd like to point to this very measure that it requires three Board
members to propose an agenda item to the full Board. And this smooths the path for the way to do that.
As far as substantive effectiveness goes, it allows all Board members to weigh in on things that one, or
two, or three Board members are interested in, and it provides for public input and knowledge of that as
well.
So we have compliance, usefulness. As far as perception goes, and this involves some of the comments
to the proposal that it might be perceived as lack of transparency, I would say it's the exact opposite. It
will be perceived as a way to pull the public in and other Board members in.

And as far as staff's workload goes, this should actually put more of the burden on interested Board
members and less on staff members. An example, very recent example, of this is, there was a proposal
about a sustainable investment policy raised by two members and staff, did all the research on that. If that
could have been an informal meeting issue, Board members could have weighed in and helped. So it will
not be a further burden on staff, I think, again, quite to the contrary.
As far as details go, you did receive a proposed amendment. That is basically because we were moving
provisions around. And Director Dishell realized that there was the lack of a topic sentence in section 8C,
Notice of Informal Board Meetings.
So we proposed adding that notice will be given to each Director at least one business day before the
meeting. And again, the business day language was provided by Director Dishell, and Directors
Guissinger and I thought that was a good idea. So just a sentence that explains what that provision is
about.
And again, we've changed the notice to the Board Office from 48 hours to two business days. And we
appreciate Director Dishell's contribution to that. He identified some real problems.
So an advantage of this, and just to sum it up, it provides a flexible way to have Board members dig in,
with the knowledge of other Board members and notice to the public, in issues of interest. Some of these
might raise to the level of this one, a bylaw change. Others actually will be decided, well, no, it's not worth
the Board time, but that was an interesting discussion.
So I think this bylaw change will be quite helpful to the Board's conducting its business. And again, it's in
compliance. So thank you for your time on this.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for those comments and explanation. First Vice Chair Guissinger, do you have
anything to add to that?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Not at this point. I think that was a good summary. Thank you, though.
VINCE BUZEK: Great, thanks a lot. We'll go to discussion and Second Vice Chair Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Sloan. That was a very thorough explanation. And I want to thank
you and Directors Guissinger and Dishell for working hard on this. And also, I know that the Board Office
and General Counsel Snyder had some input into this as well. It's very thorough.
I really am happy to see this for a couple of reasons. There are so many topics that I believe are perfectly
fine to discuss in public. And I think we cloaked ourselves in this two person limit and limited ourselves in
productive dialogue.
And I think some of this stemmed from Director Sloan and Director Cook, who I see has joined the call as
well. And I want to get together with some to talk about how we can outreach to our County
Commissioners and other stakeholders in the community. And we didn't really have an organizational
structure much like NETA has to really dialogue with some of these, and we wanted to get together to put
together some sort of a plan and move forward just some issues about that. And this really does solve
that problem, and it allows us to maybe move forward to be better representatives of our constituents.
The other advantage I see is, as I was listening and was thinking about this further, is that it really-- I think
it does provide more transparency in that it eliminates that daisy chaining communication that some

boards and commissions have been accused of conducting. And instead of doing that one-on-one
conversation, this allows for a more free exchange of ideas. So I just wanted to make those comments
that I think it's a good step forward, and I look forward to participating in this particular process a little
more fully. So again, thank you, Directors. Well done.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you, Second Vice Chair Catlin. Treasurer Whitmore, you're next.
TROY WHITMORE: Thank you, Mr. Chair. So I'm probably the curmudgeon of the Exec Committee today
on this matter, as Directors Sloan and Guissinger well know. I'm not yet at a yes vote at the Board
meeting for this. I'm concerned about perceived transparency issues and safety issues, and so I'm not
sure I'm there yet. The one thing that I will say is I do appreciate the efforts on this, and this definitely
needs to go to the full Board. So I'm supportive of moving it to make sure it's on the agenda, Mr. Chair.
Just one cursory quick question to Legal Counsel. You are comfortable with this, I am sure, or it wouldn't
be on our agenda. But are there any things that give you pause for concern?
I am a little bit nervous about the Board staff, and having to track down folks for minutes, and keep things
accountable there. But Melanie, do you have any comments? Or if you don't, that's fine as well.
MELANIE SNYDER: Thank you for the question. Mr Chair, if I may. OK-VINCE BUZEK: Yes, please.
MELANIE SNYDER: Thank you. This is Melanie Snyder, General Counsel. So thank you for the question,
Director Whitmore.
As Director Sloan indicated, I have had communications with both she and Director Guissinger about
open meetings compliance. So certainly, that's why we are adhering to the notice requirements and the
Open Meetings Law. And then this Amendment also requires that meeting minutes be taken and
published. So I think that it does meet the letter and the spirit of the Open Meetings Law.
One thing I would caution, it's not a legal issue, but this Board has set up sort of an expectation of
transparency with its meetings, particularly during the pandemic. So I do think that constituents and the
public have grown accustomed to having the availability of YouTube-streamed standing committee
meetings that they can watch, that they can watch the meetings online virtually. And it's my understanding
that that is not going to be happening for these informal meetings, that they would be-- if the public
wanted to participate or hear, they would need to be there in person.
Again, that's not an Open Meetings compliance issue. That's more just for your consideration as a Board,
with respect to the standards you've set for transparency.
TROY WHITMORE: OK, yeah, I do appreciate that. That's one of the minor concerns I have. But I will
yield the floor. But I'll be a yes vote today, and we'll see where I am when it comes up for the official okeydoke. Thanks, Mr. Chair.
VINCE BUZEK: You bet. Secretary Sloan?
MARJORIE SLOAN: Sure. Thank you, General Counsel Snyder. I am so glad you brought that up. And
also, Director Dishell did in his comments about having online streaming access to a meeting.

And we had talks about it, the proposing Directors, and decided not to place terms like YouTube, or
Zoom, or even broadcast in the bylaws, which are supposed to be lasting guidance for the Board and
internet access is changing all the time, but that we would encourage the online connection, if the Board-whoever the scheduling Board members felt like that it was a possibility on that, meaning they would work
on that. And again, that's another advantage of the flexibility of these meetings, that it will be Board
member call about the appropriateness of getting the public involved.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for those comments. Second Vice Chair Catlin?
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I wanted to qualify. I am in favor in spirit, but I do want to listen to
the discussion at the full Board meeting before I make my final determination in a vote at the Board
meeting.
And thank you, Director Sloan, for clarifying that there is an opportunity for streaming or, I mean, one
could bring a laptop and set something up, I suppose, in a meeting, to benefit the public. So I'm glad that
we have that flexibility to provide that. So thank you for the explanation. That's all I have.
VINCE BUZEK: Great, thanks so much. My comments would, I think, echo those of Secretary Sloan. I
think this provides for more transparency, not less, and definitely for more community involvement on a
smaller scale.
You know, not many people attend our Board meetings, and you can hardly blame them. But to be able to
go out into the community with a handful of Directors from the area to address topics specific to that
community and that are of interest in the community and not have to limit yourself to two Directors
because of this issue, I think, is going to be really beneficial to the public. So I'll be supporting this as well.
If there's no more discussion, then we'll take the vote here. I'll call the roll. First Vice Chair Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes.
VINCE BUZEK: Second Vice Chair Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
VINCE BUZEK: Secretary Sloan.
MARJORIE SLOAN: Yes.
VINCE BUZEK: Treasurer Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Yes.
VINCE BUZEK: And I'm a yes as well. Now, just remember that even though this came out of the
Executive Committee with a unanimous vote, when it goes to the Board, it will be listed under
recommended actions, not as a unanimous consent. So we'll have this full discussion once again with the
Board and not on the unanimous consent agenda. So just keep that in mind.
September Board meeting agenda review is next. You were all given a copy of the September Board
meeting agenda. Is there a motion to move that agenda forward to the Board?

LYNN GUISSINGER: So moved.
TROY WHITMORE: So moved.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Troy, you're muted.
TROY WHITMORE: [INAUDIBLE]
VINCE BUZEK: Well, that's probably for the best. I heard Whitmore and Guissinger as my movant and
second. Any discussion? Seeing none, are there any no votes on this-- seeing none that passes and that
moves forward. Excellent.
I'd like to also note that in observance of Rosh Hashanah, the Board meeting in September will be held
on Wednesday, September 28. Make sure you mark your calendars. And don't show up on Tuesday,
show up on Wednesday, OK?
We're going to move on to our discussion items next. First is our general-- sorry-- Government Relations
report. General Manager Johnson, would you or Michael Davies like to present this item?
DEBRA JOHNSON: Mr. Chair, I will yield the floor to Michael Davies, who will provide the report this
month. Michael?
MICHAEL DAVIES: Yes, thank you General Manager Johnson. And hello, Chair and members of the
committee. I am Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer. And I just have a brief oral report for you
based on the written report.
Starting at the federal level, really, the focus is watching what's going to happen with the appropriations
for fiscal year 2023, which begins October 1. And having watched many appropriations process in
Congress, it is getting very late, essentially one week left. And there is still no clarity from Congress on
what items are included or will be included in a continuing resolution and then, two, when that continuing
resolution will sunset, and ultimately, Congress will either have to pass all of the individual appropriations
bills or pass another continuing resolution. So there is not a lot of clarity with one week left before the
federal government shuts down here.
So a few sticking points, none of them related to transportation appropriations, but a few sticking points
that leadership in Congress is still negotiating, so watching that closely. At the state level, just a quick
update on the Zero Fare report. Obviously, Zero Fare for Better Air has concluded at the end of August.
And as part of the grant terms, RTD must prepare a report for the Colorado Energy Office.
And that report, just as a note, is not just on results from August but is also to compare August to
September and also to July, and learn as much as we can by comparing ridership, and not just ridership
but incident reports, and a wide variety of other information that will be included in our report. So the
report is certainly going to be a comprehensive in nature and cover more than just August ridership. So
working on that internally.
Also, at the state level, just want to note that General Manager Johnson and Chair Buzek presented at
the Transportation Legislation Review Committee earlier this week and reported on RTD priorities and
projects to the Joint Committee. And also, during that Joint Committee, later on in the day, the Committee
did review bills that they are going to advance for next year. And so reviewing those bills, as of now, none

of the bills cross into RTD territory or have any major impacts on transit policy. But we'll continue to track
the work that TLRC is doing on state legislation prior to next year's regular session.
And then lastly, at the local level, just want to note that you all may recall that back in June, the Board did
approve the framework for the Subregional Service Councils to be developed and stood up. And staff has
been working to stand that up. And so invitations have been sent out to Mayors and Chairs of County
Commissioners as well as transportation stakeholders and others identified by the Board in that
framework for Subregional Service Councils.
Invites have been sent out to identify an individual to serve on those Subregional Service Councils. And
so those notices are out there now, and we'll be communicating and collecting that information from the
various jurisdictions and hoping to hold a meeting in the late October, November time frame to have the
initial Subregional Service Council meetings. And with that, that concludes my report. Thank you.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you, Mr. Davies. Are there any questions? I see Second Vice Chair Catlin. Please
go ahead.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you. You said that letters had gone out to various Mayors or City Councils and
County Commissioners. I would really like to see the letters that went to the Jefferson County
Commissioner, since that is the only standing elected body that represents my district. And I am really
hoping that perhaps we can get somebody from a nonprofit in this vast geographic area that is not as
represented as some of the other areas. So if I could see the letter that was sent to the County
Commissioners, and then I would be happy to engage to express my interest with those people, I'd really
appreciate it. Thank you.
VINCE BUZEK: GM/CEO Johnson.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Just to add on to Mr Davies' comments about
the distribution of the letters requesting representation for the Service Councils, they were sent also to
nonprofit entities, being the LLCs within the service area, the district, that is, as well as TMAs and TMOs.
And we'll be more than willing to provide that copy of the correspondence that went to Jefferson County to
Director Catlin.
But I wanted to qualify that there were a myriad of other entities as well that received them. We're really
trying to look for a cross-section not just from jurisdictional staff but also from those working in the
advocacy realm as it relates to service delivery. Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, that's great. I appreciate it.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for that clarification. Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you. Just to echo that interest, I don't know if you can provide a copy of a
sample letter and the people it went to within the districts. That might be too much. But I would like to see
it. I almost wish we could have been copied on them. But anyway, I wanted to ask that as well. Thank
you.
VINCE BUZEK: GM/CEO Johnson?
DEBRA JOHNSON: Yes, thank you so much. What I will do, Mr. Davies will coordinate with my office.
Our consultant, Catalyst, was putting together a comprehensive list as to where they were disseminated.

So maybe it'd be easier for us to provide that spreadsheet to all of you and then just provide a sample of
the letter that went to the elected, then the nonprofits and like the TMOs and TMAs.
And Jennifer Webster will-- I have just receive confirmation that she will send the spreadsheet and a copy
of the letter in reference to what I just said. So thank you, Jen. She's listening in. So we're in line. Thank
you.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for that, and thank you, Catalyst. Let's see. I see First Vice Chair Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Just really quickly first, great job at the TLRC, Mr. Chair and Ms. Johnson. I thought
that I was able to listen in while I was out in Anaheim for the Zero Emission Bus Conference. Michael, just
a quick question. I was reading something late last night about the Republicans potentially closing down
the government because they're unhappy with Joe Manchin and his vote. What are you hearing? Is that a
real threat?
MICHAEL DAVIES: Yes, Director Guissinger. You know, hard to say, obviously, with no clarity on, like I
said, what's included in the continuing resolution and how long that continuing resolution will run. I think
there's probably a lot of bickering on both sides and, I would say, hard to determine exactly how credible
that option is right now for the government to shut down. A lot can happen in negotiations with a full week
to go. But that is certainly the threat that the minority party has, is to not negotiate and force a
government shutdown because it does require 60 votes in the Senate to approve appropriations bills.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Thank you.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks. Secretary Troy Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Yeah, thanks, Mr. Chair. Just an additional note on the TLRC. This is the first one
that I've missed. I've been part of the peanut gallery for four years and I hate to miss it, but family
obligation, with medical things that we had to deal with.
But I heard from a third party lobbyist that has nothing to do with RTD about how impressed she was with
the presentations from RTD and specifically, kudos to CEO/GM Johnson. So unsolicited and from
somebody that doesn't have a dog in the fight. So kudos to Mr. Chair and CEO/GM Johnson.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for that and my apologies for referring to you as Secretary Whitmore. You are
Treasurer Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: It was a promotion, promotion then. Thanks.
VINCE BUZEK: That's hard to say, actually. Thanks for that. As long as we're on the topic of government
relations, just a reminder to the Directors on the call, Tai-Shrae sent everybody on September 8 an email
regarding Squire Patton Boggs and Patty Doersch's request. And there is a response deadline of
tomorrow, if you could look at that and make sure that you respond.
From that, I'm going to move on to the Audit Ad Hoc Committee update. I mean, Ad Hoc Committee Chair
Catlin, would you or other members of the committee please provide an update?
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you. We have our consultant here with us today. I thought I sent-MATT MARINO: I'm here.

PEGGY CATLIN: Matt Marino from RubinBrown. And I see Doug MacLeod is on too. So I will turn it over
to Matt unless Doug would like to say a few words. Suffice it to say that we've been quite busy and are
moving along, but I will yield the floor to Matt or Doug. Which one of you?
DOUG MACLEOD: Matt, maybe I'll just start and give a synopsis of what the plans are. So Matt and his
team from RubinBrown gave an update to the Finance and Planning Committee on the 13th. We want to
bring that same update to the Executive Committee.
And then the plan will be to give an update at the full Board meeting on the 28th as well. Then in October,
the plan is to bring forward some action items for the Finance and Planning Committee, followed by the
Board, to approve a couple of items that Matt will go over during his discussion. So Matt, please go
ahead.
MATT MARINO: Perfect, yes. Thank you, Doug. That is a great summary of kind of the overall push
towards what we're going towards. We did take some of the feedback that we received as part of the
Finance and Planning Committee update, and we did start incorporating some of those modifications into
the proposed Audit Committee charter.
And so the three kind of main things that we worked on was modifying the composition of the Audit
Committee to be three internal, i.e. the Directors, and then two external. That would still allow us to leave
space to attract a financial expert, and we do have some candidates that likely could fulfill those roles,
that we'll bring to the Board for approval.
And then we also worked on providing some delineation on how the Audit Committee is to report to the
Board. And so we added a provision in the Audit Committee charter, whereby the Audit Committee is to
report to the Board at least quarterly, regardless of the amount of meetings that they are having. That
way, the Board of Directors are getting the updates that you all need to manage the organization.
So I can walk you through some of the modifications we made. One of the other big things that we really
want to achieve when looking at the Audit Committee charter is, we wanted to make sure that we dealt
with the factual reality that if we have three Directors that serve on the Audit Committee, there is a high
likelihood that one or more of them may not be re-elected. And so we wanted to write some guidance in
there, what would happen if a Audit Committee person was elected to serve on the Audit Committee, but
then during their term, they do not win re-election.
And we put a provision in there basically saying that at the discretion of the full Board, an existing Audit
Committee member that was previously a Director could continue serving as an Audit Committee member
for a term of one year after their end of their original term. So that would allow for continuity of the Audit
Committee. We thought it was important for the Audit Committee to have knowledge about RTD,
experience about RTD, and really make sure that we have a good team put together. Since it is a smaller
team, if you had significant turnover, it would be very disruptive to the process. So this is where we had
that there.
We also added a provision after much debate at the Audit Ad Hoc Committee about contemplating that
for a member of the Board of Directors to serve on the Audit Committee, that that member have at least
one year as a Director of RTD overall prior to being appointed to the Audit Committee, so that they have
some working knowledge of RTD overall, they have some historical context on what's important from a
risk perspective, and so on. Obviously, all of this is at the approval of the Board of Directors, like we
talked about at the Finance and Planning Committee. But we definitely wanted to take the feedback that

we were given during that meeting and try and make the modifications to hear the suggestions that we
had received from numerous Directors on different provisions. Any questions or anything you want me to
talk through in more detail or provide some additional context on?
VINCE BUZEK: Well, I don't see any. Why don't you go ahead?
MATT MARINO: OK. So really, I think this three Directors to external should work very well for the District.
We have approximately five to six candidates that have applied for this proposed Audit Committee. PSA,
I'm not sure the email has gone out, Director Catlin, to the Directors. But we are asking existing Directors
to also submit their RFQ or their qualifications to serve on this Audit Committee, just so that we can
provide that information to the full Board on why a Director might be interested in serving on that Audit
Committee, and then we can make that ultimate recommendation. So Director Catlin, did that email go
out already?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes, Tai-Shrae sent that email out. And I would encourage Directors to apply, since
we've made a strong statement that we want a majority of the committee to be comprised of Directors.
Now is the time to show that you're committed to that. I know that Director Davidson, and I'm not sure
about Director Dishell, will be submitting some applications. But I would like to see others express an
interest as well. Thank you.
MATT MARINO: And we understand that any given Director may not fulfill all of the qualifications outlined
in the request for qualifications. But if you could highlight the ones that you feel you fulfill, that would be
helpful for your fellow Directors to make an evaluation when it comes to final selection of making that.
One thing that I thought was helpful that Director Davidson put together that helps really kind of help
everyone understand why the terms is important-- so this is a pictorial presentation of kind of trying to put
what I have in words into a picture.
So we have the three Board of Directors committee members. The first term for two of the three would be
only a one year term in order to avoid that situation I talked about a little earlier, that we would end up
turning over a large part of the Audit Committee too early or all in one year. And so that's why we've kind
of tried to stagger both our internal Directors that would be on the Audit Committee as well as our external
committee members. One committee member would serve three year terms, and the other would serve
two year terms.
We did advertise the position of a two to three year term. So we feel that this would allow for continuity of
knowledge, allow for, really, the best Audit Committee possible, so that we can provide useful information
up to the overall Board of Directors. Yes, Director Whitmore?
TROY WHITMORE: So I had this thought the other night when we were discussing this. Apparently, if
we're going to assign two year terms to Board members, this question may be a moot point. But all of our
other committees and our offices' positions are selected in January. So we know when a Board member
has not been reelected or chosen not to run again. So I guess I thought it was a bit moot to worry too
much about that, that we would have our appointments in January.
However, this would indicate that this would be more of a long term commitment to make sure we had the
continuity. I just was curious with our Chair and others if they are 100% comfortable with that type of an
appointment. I mean, our Chairs don't serve more than one term without an election. So that was just my
question, Matt, to some of my fellow colleagues.

VINCE BUZEK: Director Guissinger. Yeah, go ahead.
PEGGY CATLIN: If I might interject here, the thought was for continuity, but also, we have set it up
where, instead of just committee members being appointed by the Chair, that this will be subject to the
entire Board approval. So it's a little bit different construct than our normal Committee process, since we
have provided for external membership, and it will be subject to the entire Board approval. Does that help,
Director Whitmore?
TROY WHITMORE: Well, not a lot because we did change our committee structure to Board approval, if
I'm not mistaken, Mr. Chair, this past year, with your craftsmanship. And it worked extremely well. But I
guess I'd like to hear our Chairs' opinion on that. I'm not overly concerned and grumpy about it, folks, but I
just thought maybe that's something that should be fleshed out a little bit.
So I guess Vince is speechless. So I didn't mean to set you up. Sorry, Mr. Chair.
VINCE BUZEK: No, that's fine. I think I agree with the recommendations of the Committee Chair Catlin.
Because of the importance of this Committee and the work that they're going to be doing, I think that
these terms and the full Board approval and all that, I think is really important. And just by the way, we do
have Directors Cook and Tisdale on the line, and the small committee concepts really came from them. I
want to make sure they get the credit that they deserve.
But yeah, I don't have any heartburn over the staggered terms, the two year terms, and things like that,
unless anybody else wants to chime in. And I see Director Erik Davidson with his hand up. Please go
ahead, Director Davidson.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Yeah, Thank you, Chair. Thanks for letting me participate here. I just also wanted to
interject that there were some very helpful guidelines, not standards, but guidelines, for specifically public
sector agencies put out by the Institute of International auditors that strongly urged and recommended a
minimum of two to three year terms.
So in addition to our own concerns and interests in continuity and recommendations from RubinBrown we
were also, I just wanted to add, bringing in some of those IIA recommendations as well, which also did
touch on the importance of the entire Board approving or at least ratifying the appointment of Committee
members. So I think it's great, as Treasurer Whitmore, you pointed out, that our small committees already
have that construct. But just wanted to add that there was also some input from the IIA recommendations
for public agencies as well.
TROY WHITMORE: If I can jump in, Mr. Chair.
VINCE BUZEK: Go ahead.
TROY WHITMORE: Thank you all for your input. That's helpful.
VINCE BUZEK Yeah, I agree. The continuity factor is really important. I can envision an audit starting in
one member's term and then going forward into other members' terms, and you might have people trying
to do a lot of catch up work to figure out what's going on. First Vice Chair Guissinger, please.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Just wanted to just say thanks to Matt, and Doug, and the committee members for-it sounds like you were being very responsive and, as usual, working through a lot of tough issues. And I

think this setup looks really good. Thanks, and I'm glad to hear that our Ad Hoc Committee members, at
least two of them are applying for the full Committee. And I think that's great. Thanks.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for that. Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, thanks. A quick follow-up for Matt. I didn't read it closely, so disclosure there, but
it looked like in terms of reporting to the Board, the Committee provided summaries, and it was more a
very high level thing, that the actual audit reports or executive summaries, none of that seemed to directly
go to the Board. Am I wrong? Is that included in there and I just didn't read it?
MATT MARINO: We could build out a little more specificity on how much-- like whether we want the entire
reports attached or if the reports would be available for review. I think there could be some benefit to
having items that are proprietary and that they could expose risks to external entities that we would
obviously work with legal counsel to redact to the extent we need to, to not expose RTD to more risk than
is necessary. But we can put some more specificity on what is to be included in those quarterly reports,
i.e. full copies of all audits or so on, if that is-SHELLEY COOK: Mr. Chair, could I follow up?
VINCE BUZEK: Yes, please.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah. Given that the Board is where the ultimate authority rests, it seems like a
redaction-- I think you need to be able to take precautions. We could sign an affidavit or what we've done
in the past to assure confidentiality, but I would be troubled by a redaction that prevents the Board as a
body from accessing information that went to the subcommittee. So just would put that out there.
MATT MARINO: Understood. I will make sure that we clarify that and work with legal counsel when we
bring this next draft forward to clarify the extent of the reporting. And that it sounds like the wishes and
interpretation of the Directors is that-- as much reporting as possible. That's basically consistent with what
the Audit Committee would be saying to the full Board, at least so that it's available for review. Whether
it's actually fully presented or discussed, I think we can work through that when we get there. But-SHELLEY COOK: OK, thanks.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks, Director Cook.
MATT MARINO: The other reason we did go with the two and three year terms specific for the external
candidates is so that we're not having to re-advertise and re-recruit the candidates. We have been very
lucky. We did receive two extremely qualified candidates for, what I would say, the financial expert role.
So we could-- if we go to the-- if we decide to use both of them as Audit Committee members, pending
full Board approval, that would be fantastic. Both of them have extensive experience and fulfill many of
the qualifications that we outlined in the RFQ, which is very good. One of them is a local government
finance director and the other one is a former partner of a public accounting firm. So both have the kind of
experience that you would generally like to see. Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you. This chart is really helpful, and I'm hoping that we can disseminate it to the
rest of the Board members in the packet for the discussion. The other thing that I wanted to remind folks,
that RubinBrown's scope in its phase three is to develop a reporting structure and a mechanism for
capturing all this information. And that will be, I think, available at any time to the Board to see what

activities are ongoing and if they want to get additional information. Rather than pushing out all of that
information to the Board, individual Board members could go through that and then get additional
information as they desire.
Am I right, Matt, that that's a task that you're going to be doing? So we are going to have this reporting
structure that's developed that will be, hopefully, very user friendly.
MATT MARINO: Yes, that is one of the many tasks. Right now we're mostly in task two right now, working
on getting our Internal Audit Function Charter updated to contemplate the use of the Audit Committee as
one of the reporting areas for that audit function. So we will bring this back at the next Board meeting on
the-- I believe it's next Wednesday, with additional attached documents that show the pictorial
presentation of the proposed terms, the updated language to the Audit Committee Charter that basically
puts that pictorial thing into words and then contemplates the limitation of the Audit Committee for the
internal Directors to being Directors that have served one or more years on the existing Board.
Any feedback with regard to that provision? I know that was much debated, but we as an Ad Hoc
Committee really felt that having a good working knowledge of the organization was extremely important
to an Audit Committee member.
VINCE BUZEK: Any comments on that from the Directors? I'm seeing none. I think that-- I see a thumbs
up. That sounds good, thanks.
MATT MARINO: Perfect. Well, we will work on getting these updated draft documents out very soon here
so that we can talk about them again at the next meeting and continue pushing forward with the ultimate
goal of, put an Audit Committee in place by the end of October or early November, as was presented at
the Finance and Planning Committee.
PEGGY CATLIN: If I might add, the next Ad Hoc Audit Committee meeting will be after the Board
meetings. I believe that's the third.
MATT MARINO: Correct.
PEGGY CATLIN: If other Directors want to call in, it'll be at 8:30 on Monday morning, following the Board
meeting. Thank you, Matt.
MATT MARINO: Peggy, you're very welcome.
VINCE BUZEK: Committee Chair Catlin, does that conclude your report?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes, it does. Thank you.
VINCE BUZEK: Very good. Thanks for that. Appreciate that. Moving through the agenda, next is the 2023
Board retreat. Never too soon to start thinking about that.
So our retreat in this year 2022 was March 26. So just a mere six months ago was our Board retreat. I
don't know that we need to have a lot of discussion right now, but I want everybody to start thinking about
this as we move forward.
Next year, the Executive Committee composition may be different. Who knows? But things to think about
are potential meeting dates, what types of matters we're going to talk about, is it going to be Board only,

Board and staff, things like that. So give some thought to that because next month at the October
meeting, I'd like people to actually give some input, OK? Don't want to catch you off guard.
Unless you've got some input now. I'm happy to hear it. But I want you to be thinking about it at least for
the next month. Anybody with any input before we move on? OK, you're all going to think about it and
give me your input next month, right? OK, good.
Next, we're going to move on to the timeline and recruitment process for the Board Office Executive
Manager. As you know, Ms. McManus is going to be leaving the agency after the first of the year, and we
are, and have been, in the process of recruiting an individual to take her place. The initial part of that
process was the modification, creation of job description, salary range. The Executive Committee has
been involved. I appreciate all of your input into that. General Counsel Snyder has been involved with
guidance on that as well.
My understanding is the job description and the opening has been posted. And typically, those things run
for two weeks, if I'm not mistaken, subject to being extended, depending upon what kind of responses we
get. So when the opening ends, when the job applications are all taken, whenever we decide that's going
to be, HR will typically do the initial screening of the candidates to make sure they meet the requirements
as stated in the job description. So they'll make that first attempt at that.
Then there's going to be a first round of interviews, and there will be an interview panel that does those
first round of interviews. Typically, that will be comprised of some Board members, I would say two, so we
don't run into open meetings issues. But two Board members, someone from HR, and a recruiter, things
like that.
So we'll work on the composition. But if any Board members present have an interest in serving that first
round of interview panel, that would be important to find out. Ultimately, there will be a final interview of
the finalists, and that will be the Executive Committee that will do that. HR, recruiting will perform all the
reference checks and all of that, and then we will develop an offer.
And so I believe the Board should have the final approval of whoever the candidate or candidates are. If
we have one person that rises head and shoulders above everybody else and that may be the only
candidate that comes before the Board, but if there are a couple that are pretty close, I would suggest
that we consider bringing however many candidates we need to before the Board for final approval. But I
want the Board to have final approval of whoever it is we see coming to the top here. Any questions or
comments on that? That timeline sound OK?
So we've got this out there now. It'll be closing in a couple of weeks. We'll get the panel put together.
Anybody that wants to give me input on that, please just reach out to me with regard to that. And then
we'll move it forward as a kind of a fluid process. So General Counsel Snyder, please go ahead.
MELANIE SNYDER: Yes, thank you. So just one reminder, we will send out the link to that posting so that
you all can share that with anyone that may be interested. And if there are specific organizations or
recruiting efforts that you would like to see happen, including who we distribute that posting to, let the
Chair know. For sure, he's going to be meeting with our lead recruiter on Monday to go over those details.
So we want to make sure that we get a broad distribution out to maximize this recruitment pool.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for that. Yeah, anybody that has ideas with regard-- we typically send this out to
a broad range of industry-specific organizations, APTA, things like that. But if you've got some others that

we could consider, please get those forwarded to us ASAP, and we'll make sure that the posting goes
out. So thanks for that, Ms. Snyder.
OK, so that seems pretty good with regard to that timeline moving forward. Are there any other matters to
discuss before we go into Executive Session? Seeing none. We're going to be going into Executive
Session in the moment here to receive legal advice in relation to pay grade and compensation.
For the Executive Manager to the Board, please note that the committee will reconvene in open session
after the Executive Session ends with no further business on the Executive Committee agenda. I will now
entertain a motion to move into Executive Session pursuant to 24-6-402 4b CRS to receive legal advice
regarding pay rate and compensation for Executive Manager to the Board. Is there a motion?
PEGGY CATLIN: So moved.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Second.
VINCE BUZEK: Catlin and Guissinger. Any no votes to move into the Executive Session? Seeing none.
We're going to leave this session and move into the Executive Session.
SHELLEY COOK: So anybody who's left, is that open to non-Executive Committee members? Because I
don't have a link.
TAI-SHRAE PARISH: That would have come from General Counsel Snyder. Let me message her.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, great. Thank you, Tai-Shrae.
