#### 1. Extension of Aconex Contract to 2020

It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents necessary to award a three-year contract in the amount of $695,400, with three one-year options at $167,000 each in the total amount not too exceed $1,196,400 to Aconex for Construction and Operational Management Software as a Service.  Funding for this contract was included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation, and will be appropriated in future year budgets.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the June 28, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, introduced Henry Stopplecamp and Lisa Dorrance to discuss this action item with the Board. Bruce Abel noted that as the P&D and FasTracks committee meetings were cancelled last week, this action item was included with tonight’s agenda.

Henry Stopplecamp, Acting General Manager of Capital Programs & Facilities, explained that RTD currently has a contract in place with Aconex as the document repository for the FasTracks program.  Their contract began in 2010 and staff is asking that the Board approve an amendment to extend the contract for another three years with three additional one-year options.  He further added that staff is trying to keep the same system in place in an effort to keep records management stable.

Lisa Dorrance, Acting Manager of Enterprise Records and Information, reiterated that Aconex has been the repository of records for FasTracks since 2010.  RTD originally purchased the system with the intent of loading 12 FasTracks projects, which has now grown to 48.  This software service works very well and staff has been able to provide use of this system to our stakeholders.  Currently, 669 organizations use Aconex, which encompass various municipalities and contractors that work on FasTracks projects.  RTD has been able to offer Aconex to those organizations for free and this system has worked out very well.  It is in the best interest of FasTracks and Commuter Rail to maintain consistency by continuing to utilize this system.

#### 1. Revised RTD Transit Service Policies & Standards

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said that as the Board is aware, three times a year there are conversations regarding service changes that are based on RTD’s service standards.  RTD’s Service Standards are objective criterion which help the agency communicate with constituents in an objective fashion about RTD’s services.  Questions staff frequently asks are: where should we provide service, what services should we provide and how are those services doing when they are provided.  He shared the last time this came before the Board was in the early 2000s.  He said there have been a number of changes in recent years so Staff is presenting a few suggested changes to the Policy and Standards.  This is not being presented for adoption, but as an overview so the Board may ask questions.  Staff will come back at a later committee meeting to ask for approval.  He further noted that it is important to recognize that the Standards are subject to RTD’s financial realities which provide the ultimate standard in regards to what RTD can or cannot do.  He noted a redlined copy was included in the June 14, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.

Jeff Becker, Senior Manager of Service Development, noted that RTD has had the Service Policies and Standards in place for a long time and that it has served the agency well.  This document provides a rational answer to why constituents cannot have certain services.  The last major revision to the Service Policies and Standards occurred in 2009; however, a lot has happened since then.  RTD has acquired a lot of new technology which has allowed us to get more ridership data and to analyze that data better.  He added that FTA regulations have either been added or evolved and RTD must comply with those.  RTD has developed a few policies for shuttles and circulators, but they have not been officially incorporated into our Service Policies and Standards.  Additionally, he mentioned that RTD has changed its services quite a bit with the deployment of the FasTracks corridors and fare media restructuring.  He highlighted the following changes:

- Express, Regional and SkyRide service classes reassigned into either Reginal or Local service

- Urban and suburban classifications defined

- Minimum Service Frequency standard added for Rail and Bus Rapid Transit

- Maximum Load Standard (Crowding) defined by research on comfortable passenger space

- Access-a-Ride requirements outlined

- Reliability defined as on time is one minute early to five minutes late

- Minimum Service Levels were added for the Call-n-Ride Service

- Shuttle and Circulator guidelines and requirements added

- Service Change Process outlined

- Cost Sharing Policy included based on financial feasibility, vehicle availability, local government and community support and performance requirements

Bruce Abel commented that the Board should contact Jeff Becker or anyone on the service development team with questions. He added that some of the revisions are procedural in nature in order to incorporate policies that RTD has been following but are not part of the Service Policies and Standards document.

Director Lubow said she does not understand most of the revisions because the Policies and Standards are so dense.  She added that a review of the Policies and Standards would be beneficial during a Board Study Session to ensure the entire Board understood this document.

Director Lubow indicated that something is coming up in Longmont and she wants to make sure that she is not approving something that could potentially hurt service there.  Boulder County is going to be pulling out of subsidizing the fare buy up and Longmont may not have the funds to pay for difference so she wants to keep options open around this program.  She added that she is concerned if she approves the updated Service Policies and Standards that might reduce Longmont’s options.  Jeff Becker explained the Policies and Standards were set up in a way that would allow RTD to work with the City of Longmont on a modified fare buy up program. He added that the Service Policies and Standards were not being approved tonight, but indicated that the Cost Sharing Policy within the Policies and Standards will set the guidelines for the Agency to follow.  He noted that RTD solicited the opinions of our various cities, counties, etc. regarding the proposed Service Policies and Standards.

Bruce Abel reiterated that staff was not asking for any action this evening. Staff will bring this item back to the Board next month for approval and added that this has been sent out to 38 municipalities and 8 counties.

Director Menten noted that in the addition to section 2.1 of the Service Policies and Standards, it states that Regional class includes routes providing high-speed service on limited access highways and inquired if there were any times Regional service might be provided on a different type of road.  She further inquired if this wording would potentially prevent needed services elsewhere.  Bruce Abel explained this was more a characteristic of the service than a classification of the highway.

Director Menten further inquired about section 2.3.5 regarding the vehicle assignment targets for the 27’ to 30’ buses.  She believes these are the Call-n-Ride buses but wondered if they were being used for any local routes.  Jeff Becker indicated that they were being used in Longmont for a while and the route through Stapleton.  Director Menten mentioned she was asking because she receives complaints from constituents asking why RTD does not utilize smaller buses for routes with lower ridership.

Director Walker thanked staff for sending this out to the various jurisdictions and municipalities.

Committee Chair Anderson thanked staff for the outline of all of the revisions, especially when it comes to outlining the Shuttle and Circulator guidelines.  She noted that she needed further clarification about revisions asked a member of staff contact her to discuss.

#### 2. 16th Street Mall Summer Activities 2016

Bruce Abel reminded the Board that staff would be working with the City and County of Denver and the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP) to provide alternative services for five weekends this summer while they conducted “Meet the Street” events.  The summer activities calendar exceeds five weekends activating the Downtown area throughout the summer, not just for the five weekends that RTD is working with the City and DDP to divert the Mall Shuttles.  He noted that staff has also had significant conversations regarding measuring the results of not only the five weeks that RTD is doing alternative services but for the entire summer when regular service is provided.  Included in the packet is a description of each event throughout the summer, beginning May 28, 2016 and ending Labor Day weekend.  For example, staff wants to measure the impact of a Rockies weekend against a non-Rockies weekend.

Bruce Abel explained that as part of our measurement activities, staff is undertaking intercept surveys.  The purpose of the surveys is to intercept people on the Mall to ask them a series of questions regarding their perception about what is going on in Downtown Denver over the weekends this summer.

Director Archuleta inquired if there were going to be any good concerts during the Meet the Street activities.  Bruce Abel noted that there are a variety of musical activities that will take place throughout the summer and further information can be found on the Downtown Denver Partnership’s website.

Director James mentioned that he had taken a trip with the Downtown Denver Partnership to New York City to visit the Fulton Street Mall.  He noted that it was an interesting comparison to Denver’s 16th Street Mall.

#### 3. University of Colorado A-Line Ridership Update

Bruce Abel explained that as part of staff’s continuing efforts to keep the Board apprised of the ridership of the University of Colorado A-Line, ridership statistics have been included in the Board packet.  Ridership totals are included through the sixth week of operations and weekly ridership totals averaged over 16,000 riders per day.  Staff has had conversations regarding some of the service interruptions and will continue to provide the Board with information as it is available.

General Manager Genova added that over the last few days there were a few incidents with the University of Colorado A-Line which impacted service.  Last night a train operator reported a lightning strike and thought they had observed one of the overhead power lines come down.  With that information, the Controller made the decision to stop train traffic until the overhead power lines could be evaluated.  A team was immediately dispatched to assess that the situation to determine if there was an issue which required immediate attention.  General Manager Genova stated on a more important note, the power system acted as it was designed to work.  It sensed the fault with the lightning strike, the breaker opened, and the system closed the breakers automatically and power was back up.  General Manager Genova said the reason for the delay in service was because Denver Transit Partners was being very cautious and safe in how they managed the situation.  This resulted in a bus bridge from 40th and Colorado to DIA for two hours, but for the rest of the system the trains were operational with only a 30 minute delay.

General Manager Genova explained that another recent incident was due to a false fire alarm at the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF).  The CRMF had to evacuate until Denver Fire could determine if the alarm was an actionable alarm or not.  Denver Transit Partners (DTP) managed that event by evacuating the building and calling all trains to get to the closest station to await further instruction.  It took 20 minutes to get the all clear from Denver Fire before the trains could resume operations.  RTD staff has reviewed how DTP managed these two events and think there are some things DTP can learn about managing these types of situations more efficiently.

General Manager Genova further highlighted that while individual incidents on the University of Colorado A-Line are garnering a lot of attention, what is not being focused on is the overall on-time performance.  In week one, the average on-time performance was 90%.  For week two it was 95% and week three was 96%.  There were a few bad weeks while DTP made modifications to the system to improve efficiencies.  Week four was at 82% and week five was 77%.  But then in week six it jumped back up to 96% and week seven was at 93%.  Out of the seven weeks that the University of Colorado A Line has been in operations, there have been five weeks where the on-time performance is 90% or greater.  If the seven week average is examined, on-time performance is at 89%.  While that needs to be better, these numbers are not being broadcast by the media.  He added that staff has discussed hosting an operations workshop so that RTD can assist DTP  in responding better to scenarios and make the proper adjustments to give our patrons a better experience.

Director Archuleta commented that he was having an issue with the multiple lightning strikes and asked for staff to explain the issue to him.  General Manager Genova explained that for last night’s incident, the system worked as it was designed.  If not for the train operator reporting to the control center that a power line was down, the system would have continued to work just fine.  He further noted that there was one other incident due to a lightning strike that caused a burned through wire.  That wire has been sent to the lab for testing to determine if it was indeed from a lightning strike or if it was from something else and staff is awaiting those results.

Director Archuleta expressed that he still did not understand why lightning strikes were a problem if the system was grounded properly.  Henry Stopplecamp, Acting AGM of Capital Programs, explained that the entire system is grounded with the exception of the live wire.  Last night when the lightning hit, it hit a surge, the breaker tripped and the system reset itself.  This is how this system is supposed to work and unfortunately there have been two incidents where lightning has hit the live wire.  He added that staff would be happy to sit down with the Board to answer questions in more detail.

Director Lubow indicated that while RTD has good on-time service averages, there have been a series of problems which the public are concerned about.  These issues are affecting RTD’s reputation and the public’s concerns are not being addressed.  She said it seems like prior line openings did not have as many issues.  General Manager Genova commented that each line has required its own adjustments; it is not atypical to have issues when a line is opened.  He stated he is not satisfied with the level of service and staff is working diligently to improve it.  He added that he is also concerned about our reputation and noted that some of his comments recently used by the media were taken out of context.

Director Lubow commented that Colorado is a high lighting strike state and it is important to get this right.  Henry Stopplecamp indicated that staff is working with the contractor.  He stated there are issues with lightning on light rail as well but RTD has had 22 years to learn what to look out for.  The commuter rail system is a brand new system so it is a learning process for DTP.  Service is not where it should be, but staff is pushing for it to be better.  He added that if you examine the trends for DTP’s operations, it is getting better.

Director Deadwyler mentioned that she too has concerns for the University of Colorado A-Line.  She commented that she has received quite a few phone calls regarding on-time performance, especially when constituents cannot get to work on time.  She added that the people she has talked to still have faith in the system and want it to work properly.  She noted that one of the things RTD did not do well was to warn the public in advance that there would be issues with the new commuter rail system and ask for their patience.  She was happy to hear that staff is conversing daily with DTP, but surprised to learn that DTP is learning as they go as she thought they had been training people all along so they were ready for operations.  She asked that staff bring DTP to a Board meeting in the future so that DTP can explain certain issues to the Board.  She said another concerning item was the false fire alarm at the CRMF as this is supposed to be state of the art technology.  She asked how much of the current issues are related to operator error versus system issues.  She reiterated that her constituents still believe in the system, but they want to get to work on time; however, an honest message needs to be communicated to the public that they should expect a few bumps along the way for the next few months so they are not surprised.

Henry Stopplecamp said he appreciates the faith of the community.  He indicated that the fire alarm at the CRMF was in the building itself.  He stated one thing DTP took away from that situation was that they needed a “go-bag” so that they could run the control center outside of the CRMF in the event of an emergency.

Director Walker commended the operator for calling in what he/she thought was a downed wire.  He added that since this is a new system there are things out there that operators might not be familiar with.  He would rather operators be safe and overly cautious to keep the riders safe.  He added that all transportation systems have their individual problems and faults, but he still encourages his friends to ride RTD.

Director Menten asked if the original plans for the commuter rail always included two sub-stations.  General Manager Genova indicated yes, and it was part of the 30% preliminary design established by RTD.  Henry Stopplecamp explained that the system is designed to run off of one sub-station, so the second sub-station is actually a redundancy.

Director Menten said she had only seen one picture of the severed wire that was currently being used by the media. She asked if that was an authentic or generic photo.  Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, explained that it was the actual photo taken by DTP.  He said there were two photos; one showed the wire dangling from the overhead catenary, and the other showed where it was severed after it was taken down.

Committee Chair Anderson added that she is extremely concerned about RTD’s reputation and she appreciates what staff is doing to make sure that the system will be running on time.  She added that she travels a lot in the Denver metro area and she recently heard RTD being compared to WMATA (Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority), which she did not like.

#### 4. Mobility Choice

Bruce Abel indicated that there have been a lot of changes in regards to mobility in recent years such as Uber, Lyft, automated cars, connected cars, etc.  The world of technology is changing the way in which people move.  There are many conversations taking place about how these new technologies are impacting individual and community mobility.  The Smart City Challenge grant application was submitted to the U.S. Department of Transportation over a week ago and staff is still waiting for the results.  This grant application is potentially for $50-$60 million dollars for the City of Denver.

Bruce Abel added that there is another conversation happening at the local level and it is titled “Mobility Choice”.  This is being led by the Denver Chamber of Commerce, and the partners in the conversation are: Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) and RTD.  He noted that staff is actively engaged in conversations with our partners in relation this initiative.  Regardless of the outcome of the Smart Cities grant application, the community as a whole wants to make sure it is thinking about how new technology is impacting the community’s ability to move.  He said a Request for Information (RFI) had been issued and one of the elements was to evaluate strategies to look at technology and how it impacts mobility in the Denver metro area.  He stated the Denver Metro Chamber and private sector have pledged money to move forward with engagement of a consultant and there are conversations about how RTD, DRCOG and CDOT might participate financially as well.

General Manager Genova added that this discussion begin with RTD when Director Sisk was Chair.  There are two pages that precede the PowerPoint included in the June 14, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet which outline the original concept.  There has been an ongoing dialog amongst the various participants about the need for additional funding.  He said the more he thinks about this effort the more important he thinks it is for RTD to have a seat at the table.  If RTD does not participate, RTD will not have a say in the planning efforts for future years.  Bruce Abel added that procedurally, this group is looking at forming a private non-profit with a Board of Directors that would have both public and private sector participants.

Director Menten inquired about the potential 2018 ballot measure mentioned and asked if staff could provide more details.  Bruce Abel indicated that staff is not in position to discuss the measure at the present time other than all options are being considered.  The consultant selected would determine if that was a viable alternative.  General Manager Genova added that it is very early in the process and that these are all possibilities or potentials as nothing has been solidified.

Director James noted he was happy to see RTD be a full partner at the table with our peers. He pointed out that there are other private and public sector entities which were not mentioned that are at the table.  He added that we are on the threshold of dramatic changes in the way transportation functions and serves the community.

#### 5. Recent FTA Guidance Regarding ADA Accessibility and Bus Stop/Shelters

Bruce Abel noted that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has always provided guidance to ensure that transit related services are accessible to individuals with disabilities.  The FTA issues guidance and publishes circulars designed to communicate to transit grantees the Federal expectations related to ADA.  At the end of 2015 a new circular was distributed which provided additional guidance for accessible bus stops and bus stop shelters.  The practice had been that existing stops and shelters were grandfathered, even if an existing stop was moved; however, per the circulator, now if an existing stop is moved it must be treated as a new stop.

Bruce Abel explained the ability to accommodate requests to move bus stops or shelters is now vastly constrained because any movement of an existing stop or shelter must be in compliance with ADA standards.  The circular acknowledges that agencies like RTD do not control all of the elements of accessibility such as sidewalk construction, but RTD must work with our partners to ensure better responsiveness for sidewalk compliance.  He added that staff is bringing this information to the Board because this will have a major impact in terms of staff’s ability to move forward with the implementation of new routing for the East corridor.  There have been challenges serving areas where there are no sidewalks so RTD has been working with our partners and municipalities to get the sidewalks built.

Director Deadwyler asked how RTD is supposed to handle this in the future and noted that the sidewalks in Park Hill were built very narrow and on stone.  She added that while RTD is not the builder of the sidewalks, there is an entire neighborhood full of small sidewalks and asked what is RTD’s responsibility in that situation.  Bruce Abel explained that the City and County of Denver is implementing a pedestrian and sidewalk committee to determine where they want to spend money expanding city sidewalks.

Director Deadwyler further inquired about areas that already exist.  She asked if the municipalities are required to expand the existing sidewalks for bus stops.  Bruce Abel explained that the cities must make the appropriate modifications.

Director James indicated that this is remarkable and it is great to see the enhancement of the partnership between jurisdictions like the City and County of Denver and RTD.

#### 6. Hiring Update

Bruce Abel indicated that the hiring update was included in the June 14, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.  He acknowledged and appreciates the efforts from the Marketing and HR departments for continuing to address the need for Operators for both bus and rail.

Director Archuleta inquired as to how many more operators are needed on the bus side.  Bruce Abel indicated that RTD is only short 50 bus operators.

Director Bagley mentioned that the number of individuals entering service is increasing, which is good news and he thanked staff for their efforts.

#### 7. Lost Service Hours Update (no back-up)

Bruce Abel reminded the Board that prior to the fall of last year we were missing 10 to 20 hours of service on an average weekday.  By late fall, it was into the hundreds and got as high as 1,000.  He said in May this was down to 88 hours and the trend is continuing in the appropriate direction.

### D. Other Matters

Director James encouraged his fellow Board members to attend the Urban Exploration trip that he took with the Denver Downtown Partnership.  He noted that he had an opportunity to visit the Fulton Street Mall in Brooklyn which is remarkably similar to the 16th Street Mall.  He added that this trip is an opportunity to learn city building and to interact with our colleagues in other agencies who serve the public.

Director Hoy commented that the Transform event sponsored by Smart Commute Metro North will be on June 29 at Digital Globe.  This event will be interesting because the featured speaker is Rutt Bridges, who wrote a book about driverless cars.  There will also be a speaker from Digital Globe that will demonstrate how global imaging can assist with transportation issues.  He encouraged his fellow Board members to attend.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Anderson adjourned the meeting at 7:09 p.m.
