BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: June 8, 2016

From:

Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General
Manager, Capital Programs

GM

Date:

June 8, 2016

Board Meeting Date: June 28, 2016

Subject:

Extension of Aconex Contract to 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents necessary to award a three-year
contract in the amount of $695,400, with three one-year options at $167,000 each in the total amount
not too exceed $1,196,400 to Aconex for Construction and Operational Management Software as a
Service. Funding for this contract was included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation, and will be
appropriated in future year budgets.
BACKGROUND
RTD’s current Aconex contract will be ending May of 2017; however, RTD will still have many ongoing
construction projects such as Eagle, I-225, SERE, North Metro as well as smaller engineering projects,
that will still be active past that date. These projects will need a document control system to capture
construction and process project closeout documentation. Also, as projects complete, Capital Programs
is required to turn over necessary operational data to Base side departments such as Commuter Rail and
Facilities Maintenance. Because these Base side departments did not have a repository to receive and
store turn over and operational documentation, an Aconex Change Order was issued in 2016 to provide
the Aconex platform to the Base side to satisfy that business requirement. Because of these ongoing
document control needs, RTD would like to extend the Aconex contract to 2020. In addition, Aconex
recognizes the benefit of having RTD as a client and has made an extension offer price that is good until
June 30, 2016. This price is close to our original contract amount and still offers RTD more usability for
the Base side departments.
DISCUSSION
Due to the number of current and future projects, the large amount of data and number of system users,
it is recommended that RTD extend the contract years to obtain a consistent document repository rather
than go out to bid on a different system. This is also the recommendation of the RTD’s Enterprise
Content Management consultant, the iQ Business Group, who is currently working with RTD to improve
our information management practices and will recommend an enterprise content management approach
later this year. Other factors include, with five of the major FasTracks projects opening this year,
Capital Programs would be hard pressed to provide the necessary resources to conduct a procurement
for another system of this type and migrate the data from over thirty-two (32) projects to another
system. Also, because many of the projects, including the new University of Colorado A-Line Commuter
Rail, have the use of Aconex set in to their contracts and/or agreements, RTD would have to work with
contractor teams on conversion to another system and provide training. By staying with the Aconex
system RTD will be able to:
 Maintain system and process continuity to its project teams and stakeholders
 Provide a system to receive track performance reports and invoice processing for the Commuter
Rail division

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

 Provide the Facilities Maintenance department a repository with which they are already familiar in
order to turn over closeout data for the FasTracks projects to Facilities Maintenance
 Avoid any contractual disputes with stakeholders
 Avoid migration costs and training
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total amount of the contract extension is $695,400, with three one-year options at $167,000 each
not to exceed the total amount of $1,196,400 Funding for this contract was included in the 2015
Annual Program Evaluation, and will be appropriated in future year budgets.
SBE PARTICIPATION
The RTD Small Business Opportunity Office established a 0% SBE participation goal for this project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents necessary to award
a three-year contract in the amount of $695,400, with three one-year options at $167,000 each in
the total amount not too exceed $1,196,400 to Aconex for Construction and Operational
Management Software as a Service. Funding for this contract was included in the 2015 Annual
Program Evaluation, and will be appropriated in future year budgets.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead, use RTD in-house staff and consultants to
develop a solution using RTD’s Legacy document control software and re-train users. This is not
recommended because the Legacy system does not have the necessary functionality to provide the
level of service needed to support RTD projects and departments both inside and outside our firewall.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not extend the contract and go back out to look for a
new system. This, also, is not recommended, because of the impact to the FasTracks and
Operations Departments and the level of effort it would require to conduct another Request For
Proposal (RFP). This is not recommended because Aconex presented the proposal that best meets
the evaluation criteria set forward in the RFP.

Discussion
RTD has had service standards in place for many years to provide a rational, equitable and sustainable
approach to developing and evaluating all its services for the benefit of the District’s constituents as a
whole. The last revision was adopted in 2002 and in 2008 RTD commissioned our Service Development
consultant to provide a thorough review of our standards in relation to transit industry peers.
Recommendations have been incorporated into the revised standards for: the service classification
system; new service warrants; service design and performance standards; demand-responsive transit;
and standards for transit-dependent riders. Since 2002 many changes have occurred in our industry as
well as to RTD needs. The acquisition of automatic vehicle location and passenger counting has
provided a profusion of valuable data for improved analytics and reporting, such as better measurements
for on-time performance and crowding. Our Geographic Information System is used to illustrate service
classification and the effects of service changes on Access-a-Ride customers. Consideration of FTA
regulations for Tile VI and Environmental Justice are now expressly incorporated into the Standards. To
address the diverse needs of the RTD constituencies, RTD has developed guidelines regarding shuttles
and circulators as well as a cost sharing policy.
These and other revisions developed since 2002 were vetted with extensive involvement of RTD Service
Development, Engineering and Planning Technical Services staff. In 2015 RTD invited review and
comment from our stakeholders and held several meetings with all those representatives who were
interested (about a dozen). As a result a number of revisions were incorporated into the document,
although some that require much more extensive analysis were postponed for future consideration.
Attachment A provides highlights of the revisions.

The following follows the Table of Contents of the document.
1. Introduction
Due to the implementation of FasTracks and resulting service restructuring, the routes
in the Express, Regional and SkyRide service classes are reassigned into either the
Regional class or the Local CBD class based on the length of the non-stop portion of
the route. Also the Urban classification is now specifically defined as having 35% or
more of route length within a ¼ mile buffer with population+employment density of
12 per acre or greater; and Suburban class with 34% or less.
2.3.1 Minimum Service Frequency
Rail and Enhanced Bus (BRT) minimums were added to the table of minimum
frequencies.
2.3.3 Maximum Load (Crowding) Standard
From the latest customer and industry research, RTD now defines the amount of
crowding on a route as the percent of total trips during a defined time period that
exceed the comfort passenger level of 4.3—5.3 square feet per standee (level-ofservice D and E).
2.4.2 Access-A-Ride
A new section was added summarizing US DOT requirements for ADA complementary
paratransit for individuals who cannot readily access the RTD bus and rail system.
2.5 Reliability
A new section was added defining on-time for fixed-route service as not more than 1
minute early to not more than 5 minutes late.
3.3 Roadway Design Goal
This now references the Engineering staff’s Bus Transit Facilities document, Transit
Access section.
4. Shelters
A new section was added defining the minimum warrant for the placement of a shelter
as 40 boardings per day at a stop.
5.2.1 Minimum Service Levels
Call-n-Ride is included as an appropriate service for areas with 3 - 12
population+employment per acre.
5.2.2 Maximum Target Service levels
This section was deleted as not needed.
5.2.2 Access-A-Ride - ADA Required Service Area Coverage
A new section was added summarizing the FTA requirements for ADA complementary
paratransit services.
6. Transit Access
A new section was added referencing the Engineering staff’s Bus Transit Facilities
document, Transit Access section.
7.2 Standards for Events
The paragraph that “RTD may also provide service at events with lower attendance
projections if the promoter is willing to subsidize such service” is deleted. This is
charter service and not permitted by FTA.
8. Shuttles & Circulators

Highlights of Revisions to the Transit Service Policies & Standards

A new section was added that provides guidelines and requirements to stakeholders in
local communities who would like to develop such services. It addresses such
characteristics as population density, major activity centers, transit friendly
environment, minimum service levels and fares.
10. Title VI Compliance
A new section was added that RTD follows FTA Circular 4072.1B “Title VI
Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration Recipients,” Chapter
4.4.
12. Service Change Process
A new section was added describing the typical runboard process for analyzing,
proposing and implementing service changes.
13. Cost Sharing Policy
A new section was added detailing this policy that facilitates partnerships with RTD to
demonstrate new or expanded services using funds obtained from grants and
voluntarily pledged by private employers, businesses or local governments. The
guidance outlines financial feasibility, vehicle availability, local government and
community support and performance requirements.

1.C.1.b

1.1 Overview
RTD continually receives requests for changes to existing service and for new service in
growing areas of the District. Additionally, RTD may be operating some services that are
not attracting enough riders to justify their cost. In order to be consistent in the
evaluation of service proposals, and to ensure that the service being provided represents
the most cost-effective use of the District's resources, a set of service standards is
maintained by RTD.
The specific standards, targets or minimum/maximum values for the standards, and a
procedure for applying these standards, are presented in this document. Since service
standards are intended to optimize usage of the District's resources, they are updated
periodically to reflect changes in the District goals and resources. The procedure for
updating the standards is described in Section 1.3.

1.2 Application of Service Standards
There are two primary applications for the ongoing use of the service standards. These
are the use of standards to evaluate existing services, and use of standards to evaluate
proposals for new service.
The application of standards to existing routes is a flexible process. The purpose of the
standards is to help identify routes which are most in need of service changes, such as
restructuring to eliminate lower productivity segments or branches, adjusting service
frequency to better reflect the demand for service, or providing additional promotion of
less patronized routes where appropriate. Routes, which do not meet standards, are not
automatically designated for elimination. Elimination of routes is only intended as a last
resort, when it has been determined that no cost-effective actions are available to improve
the productivity of the route.
The standards for evaluation of existing routes are not intended to preclude changes to
routes that meet these minimum standards. In many cases, it may be possible to improve
the productivity of routes that meet the minimum standards by making changes to
headways or trip times. Since the overall mission of RTD is “To meet our constituents’
present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable, courteous,
accessible and cost-effective service throughout the District,” these standards should not
be used to prevent changes to improve the efficiency of existing routes, as long as the
changes meet the route design standards.
The availability of financial resources, represented by the annual budget, is the bottom line
for these standards. Service expansion may occur when additional funds are available and
contraction may occur otherwise. In any case, selection of which services to provide or
curtail is based on these performance standards and no service is considered guaranteed

1. Introduction

Service Development Policies & Standards

1.C.1.b

The evaluation of new service proposals will take place as proposals are received or needs
identified. The most recent values of the standards for existing routes will be used to
evaluate the proposed new services. Decisions regarding implementation of new routes
will be made through the service planning process. New routes and services will be
expected to meet all applicable design standards described in Sections 2, 3 and 55, but
will not be expected to meet the productivity standards described in Section 2.3.2.1 until
they have been in operation for at least six months. Demonstration, experimental, and
cost sharing services are also handled in this manner.

1.3 Updating of Service Standards
The service standards are intended to support the goals and objectives of the District.
Since these objectives and the resources available to attain them can be expected to
change over time, the standards will be revised periodically to reflect those changes.
The service standards will be reviewed on a bi-annual basis. At that time, experience
with the service standards over the previous time period, as well as changes in the
District's goals and objectives, will be used to determine whether any standards should be
added or revised.
The numerical values of productivity standards will be updated each year, using ridership,
revenue and cost figures for the most recent twelve-month period for which data are
available. The rankings are based only on those routes that existed for the entire year.
Routes which were eliminated during the year will not be included because they cannot be
identified as candidates for revisions. Routes that were introduced during the year will not
be included in determining the new standards since they are not required to meet the
productivity standards until they have been in operation for at least six months. However,
these routes will be evaluated separately, using the service standards contained in this
document.
The updating procedure will compare the values of the productivity standards with those
in effect for the previous year. Operating cost data for the previous year will be revised to
account for system-wide increases or decreases in operating cost.

2. Performance Standards
2.1

Derivation and Use of Standards

The productivity standards are used to identify routes and services for appropriate
marketing and possible revision or elimination. Separate standards are identified for each
class of service. Routes are evaluated on ridership (either boardings per in-service hour or
per trip, depending on the class of service) and on the economic measure of subsidy per
passenger. These standards are based on the performance of the least productive 10
percent of the routes in each service class for either the ridership or economic measure, or

or beyond review. The RTD Board of Directors, with input from RTD staff and the public,
is responsible for making decisions on service recommendations.

Service Development Policies & Standards

on the least productive 25 percent of routes in both measures. The basis for the
standards will be reviewed in conjunction with the cost recovery standards in Section 99,
and may be revised if necessary.
New services should meet the applicable standards for their class of service after six
months of operation. All new services will be reviewed after six months of operation and
routes that have not shown adequate progress toward meeting the standards will be
targeted for cost-effective actions to increase productivity or for elimination.
For the purpose of applying the standards, Local and Limited routes will be divided into
three groups based on area-type land-use designations: CBD routes (routes which serve
the Denver Central Business District), Urban routes, and Suburban routes. These
groupings of Local and Limited routes will enable the comparison of routes with similar
service characteristics. Express, Regional and sky Ride routes will be evaluated as
separate classes due to their different service characteristics. For the purposes of
evaluating productivity, Light Rail will be measured against the standards established for
CBD Local routes, except where otherwise noted.
To meet the RTD mission to provide cost-effective service throughout the District, RTD
has developed different types or classes of service that serve specific markets and,
therefore, have different performance expectations. Due to their different service
characteristics Express, Regional and SkyRide were treated as separate classes. However,
due to the deployment of rail, BRT and resulting service restructuring, these classes are
reconfigured. The routes in these three are reassigned into a new, consolidated Regional
class or the Local CBD class. Regional class includes routes providing high-speed service
on limited access highways from suburban and outlying communities to downtown
Denver, Denver International Airport and other metro, major employment centers, and
provided at distances of approximately 6 miles or more. Local services have three subclassifications: CBD—any route serving downtown Denver; Urban—35% or more of route
length within a ¼ mile buffer has population+employment density of 12 per acre or
greater; and Suburban—34% or less. Call-n-Ride and Access-a-Ride are separate classes.
Enhanced bus and BRT routes may warrant future consideration regarding their operation
with: dedicated right-of-way; partially dedicated ROW; limited or express mode; priority
over other traffic; and various speeds appropriate to context. [Please see attachment A
Service Classes for details on how these revisions affect current routes.]
The standards for evaluating portions of routes are intended for use in identifying needed
service improvements, for making modifications to specific portions of existing routes, or
for identifying low productivity segments of routes.
These standards could be used in situations such as isolating low productivity portions of
otherwise productive routes or measuring options for bringing unproductive routes into
compliance with the overall service standards. These standards may also be used to
evaluate proposals for new route extensions or deviations on existing routes.

1.C.1.b

Service Development Policies & Standards

The RTD’s approach is to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel
markets. All services are designed to match the level of service with demand, thus
improving performance and sustainability. This results in multiple domains of acceptable
performance for the various classes of service. Standards are best set by first determining
measures of performance and objectives. The core objective is to maximize overall
ridership, to the extent allowed by the available resources.
2.2.1 Performance Objective
Service allocation is driven by the RTD adopted mission statement: “To meet our
constituents’ present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable,
courteous, accessible cost-effective service throughout the District.”
Performance Measures
 Passengers/hour (productivity)
 Passengers/trip (Regional class
productivity)
 Subsidy/passenger (cost
effectiveness)
The subsidy per passenger measure
combines fare revenue and total cost
impacts to produce a measure that
comprehensively reflects the District’s
allocation of resources. The effectivenessproductivity chart, Error! Reference source
not
found.,
presents
economic Figure 1 Effectiveness - Productivity Chart
effectiveness on the vertical axis, and
productivity, or boardings per hour, on the horizontal axis. The chart offers a convenient
comparative analysis of all classes of services, illustrating both absolute and relative
performance. When standards and guidelines are applied, judgments can be made.

2.3 Fixed Route Service Design and Evaluation Standards
2.3.1 Minimum Service Frequency
New routes shall provide the minimum frequencies specified below. Existing services that
cannot meet these minimum standards while adhering to the minimum passengers per
hour or trip standards defined in Section 2.3.2 shall be identified as candidates for service
changes or appropriate marketing promotion within available resources. These service
changes may include providing service with longer headways if no other viable alternative
exists. Elimination of the route may be considered if service changes and/or promotional
efforts do not improve productivity.
These are “policy” service levels and represent a compromise between economic
efficiency and the functionality of the system. To be sustained at these levels, a route
must meet the minimum ridership performance standards discussed in Section 2.3.2.1 and
annual calculated standards. Routes providing frequencies higher than the policy minimum
must be justified by ridership demand as outlined in Section 2.3.4.

Table 1 Minimum Service Frequency

2.3.2 Minimum Ridership Performance
This standard applies to routes operating at the minimum service frequency target. For
Local and Limited routes, the standard is passengers per hour based upon the bottom 10%
and 25% of routes in the respective class. For Express, Regional, and SkyRide routes, the
standard is passengers per trip.
These standards are derived from system averages by class of service. All routes must
meet their applicable minimum standards. Those that do not meet these standards will
need to be modified or marketed in some way in order to bring them up to the minimum
standards. Those that are not brought up to the minimum standards are subject to
cancellation. Routes that meet their applicable minimum ridership standards justify a
service level at the minimum service frequencies outlined in Section 2.3.1. Higher
frequencies must be justified by ridership as outlined in Section 2.3.4.

Maximum Load (Crowding) Standard

For Local and Limited routes in the peak, the maximum load standard is 125% of a seated
load at the maximum load point. For Local and Limited routes outside of the peak, and for
Express, Regional, and SkyRide routes at all times, the maximum load is the seated
capacity of the vehicle.
Service frequencies shall be adjusted so that the following maximum load standards are
met at least 60 percent of the time:


Local and Limited Service:
Peak periods – 125 percent of seated load on RTD's present bus fleet. The
maximum time that an individual passenger should be expected to stand on a given
trip is 15 minutes.
Off-peak periods - seated load



Express, Regional, and SkyRide Service:
Seated load at all times.



Light Rail vehicles:
Peak periods – 125 passengers per vehicle
Off-peak periods – seated load

Service Development Policies & Standards

Special events – 165 passengers per vehicle
From the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual: “From the passenger
perspective, the passenger load on a transit vehicle affects the comfort of the on-board
vehicle portion of a transit trip-both in terms of being able to find a seat and in overall
crowding levels within the vehicle. From a transit operator's perspective, a poor quality of
service may indicate the need to increase service frequency or vehicle size to reduce
crowding and increase passenger comfort.”
RTD defines crowding as a seated load plus the standing passenger space, as calculated
for each vehicle by subtracting the area occupied by seats and other objects from the
gross interior floor area. The amount of crowding on a route is defined as the percent of
total trips during a defined time period that exceed a comfort passenger level of 4.3—5.3
square feet per standee, generally having these characteristics (See page 5-24 of the
Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, 3rd Edition,
http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_rpt_165ch-05.pdf):
 Standing load without body contact
 Standees have similar amount of personal space as seated passengers
 Reasonably easy circulation within vehicle
The maximum number of standees can be computed for each vehicle by determining its
standing passenger square footage and dividing by 4.3—5.3. For any service class during
any defined period (e.g., AM early, AM peak, midday), when 10% or more of the
directional trips exceed the computed maximum standees at the maximum load point,
further investigation of potential remedies, such as changing the bus assignment or
frequency of service, is warranted. For special events heavier loads are expected and
acceptable, but when 10% or more of trips during the take-away have 4 or less square
feet per standing passenger, further investigation of potential remedies is warranted. See
Attachment D Crowding Report Examples for reference. The Percent of Total Trips chart
(lower right) with level-of-service D or E would indicate crowding.
2.3.4 Demand Based Service Frequency
Service frequency in the RTD network is based on clock-pattern schedules. This pattern
provides consistent and easy to understand schedules for our customers, and makes
possible the provision of timed transfer connection hubs, whereby multiple routes are
scheduled to meet at one location to facilitate connections. In general, routes are
scheduled to operate in even increments of 30 minutes, or every 60, 30, 15, 10, 7.5, or 5
minutes. However, other frequencies may be provided depending upon passenger
demand, or operational and scheduling needs.
For routes meeting the above frequency, ridership, and load standards, frequency better
than every 30 minutes may be provided when and where justified by ridership. This
standard applies equally to all service categories. In order to be sustainable, higher
frequency service must meet the following criteria:


Incremental frequency necessary to maintain the appropriate load standard during any
30 minute time period.




Appropriate vehicle assignment as outlined in Section 2.3.5
When a service exceeds the maximum load standard, higher frequency may be justified
during that time period and/or route segment.
If a service with better than the minimum frequency has passenger loads that can be
accommodated with a lower frequency without violating the load standard, then
frequency may be reduced.
As a general guideline, a typical productivity by service frequency, for a whole route or
a segment or time period is provided in Table 3 Demand Based Service Frequency

Small 27’-30’ Bus: Appropriate for lower volume Local routes where ridership does
not require a standard bus, or for routes where specific operating concerns preclude
use of standard buses and for Call-n-Ride.
Standard 40’ Transit Bus: The standard equipment for Local and Express Regional
services. May also be used on Regional and SkyRide trips in the Express fare category.
Articulated 60’ Bus: Appropriate for higher volume Limited and Express Regional
services. May also be used on Regional and SkyRide trips in the Express fare category.
Intercity Coach: Appropriate for Regional and SkyRide services.

2.3.6 Design and Evaluation of Portions of Routes
The standards for evaluating portions of routes cover two areas in which minor
modifications may be made to routes without changing the overall structure of the route:
 midline segments or midline deviations
 branches or end segments
The governing standards for overall route productivity were presented earlier. Since trips
provided during marginally productive hours of the day or trips over marginal segments
often increase the attractiveness of the overall service, an otherwise productive route may
be able to support some less productive trips or portions of the route. However, if a route
cannot meet the overall service standards for its class of service, there may not be
productive segments to enhance the unproductive segments. Therefore, specific
segments, branches, or trips which meet the standards for portions of routes may still be
modified in order to raise the productivity of the entire route, if the overall route does not
meet the service standards for its class of service.
2.3.6.1 Midline Segments and Midline Deviations




A midline segment or deviation of a Local or Limited route should generate enough
boardings per hour of service provided to meet the standard for its class of service
(CBD, Urban and Suburban). Boardings in both directions will be counted.
If a route is changed, the change shall not cause a reduction in the overall boardings
per hour for the route.
If a route is changed, the change shall not cause the route to violate any route design
standards as defined in Section 2.3, or the overall productivity standards as defined in
Section 2.

2.3.6.2 Branches and End Segments









A branch or end segment of a Local or Limited route should generate enough boardings
to meet the ridership standard for its class of service (CBD, Urban and Suburban).
Boardings generated along the branch are defined as all passengers boarding the bus
along the branch or end portion of the route, and all outbound passengers alighting
along this section.
Local collector portions of Express and Regional routes which meet the following
maximum travel time standard, shall meet the ridership productivity standard for the
entire route. This maximum travel time is equal to 15 minutes or 50 percent of line
haul travel time, whichever is less.
For shorter segments, the minimum ridership standard is reduced by the ratio of actual
travel time to the maximum allowable travel time. Thus, if the actual travel time along
the collector is half of the maximum allowed, it must average half the number of
boardings per trip specified in the minimum ridership productivity standard.
A new extension to a route that does not meet the minimum ridership productivity
standard must attract sufficient ridership for the entire route to meet the minimum
ridership standard for its service class.
A route extension will not be initiated if it violates any of the route design standards
found in Section 2.3, or causes the route as a whole to fall below the minimum riders
per unit of service or standards found earlier in Section 2.3.2.

2.4 Demand Response Service Design and Evaluation Standards
RTD continues to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel markets.
The goal of this approach is to match the type and level of service to the demand in a
given service area, thus improving performance and sustainability. As such, a variety of
non-fixed route services are provided by the RTD including the following.
2.4.1 Call-n-Ride
Rather than operating on a fixed route and schedule, demand responsive Call-n-Ride
service is characterized as a shared ride within a defined geographic service area and the
need for the passenger to arrange for pick-up in advance or be at a designated checkpoint
at prescheduled times. A Call-n-Ride service area averages about 7 square miles or
between about 2 to 30 square miles depending on its number of vehicles and service
configuration—predominantly station feeder or community-based service. Call-n-Ride often
provides first/last mile access to the broader RTD network of services through timed

Service Development Policies & Standards

connections at transfer centers and Park-n-Rides. Population plus employment is
predominantly 3 to 12 persons per acre. Call-n-Ride service is evaluated based on
passenger boardings per revenue hour and subsidy per passenger boarding.
2.4.2 Access-A-Ride
Access-a-Ride provides ADA complementary paratransit in the District to individuals who
cannot readily access the bus and rail system. As per US DOT requirements the
passenger’s trip origin and destination must be within ¾ mile of RTD’s non-commuter bus
route system, during the same days and hours of their operation and within the District
boundaries, and curb-to-curb service must be provided. However, RTD provides door-todoor service as a reasonable accommodation. Trips must be booked at least one day and
up to 3 days in advance; however, RTD also offers subscriptions.
All applicants must qualify for certification under the guidelines established by the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, complete a functional evaluation in person,
provide a physician’s statements to verify disability and must meet one of the following
criteria:
 Be unable to get to and from a bus stop or on and off a lift-equipped bus by yourself
 Have a cognitive disability that prohibits your understanding of how to complete bus
trips
2.4.3 Vanpooling
Vanpooling is a public transportation option in which commuters, whose residences are
geographically clustered, ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically vanpools make one roundtrip per day and
carry from 5 to 14 riders. Vanpooling offers greater opportunities for increased capacity
compared to carpooling and offers a cost-effective alternative to conventional transit in
areas of low employment density and longer commute distances. RTD contracts for this
service with DRCOG to subsidize the portion of the commute trip within the District.
Vanpool service is evaluated based on subsidy per passenger boarding.
2.4.4 SeniorRide and Senior Shopper
SeniorRide Special Events transports groups to a variety of cultural, educational and
entertainment events. The Schedule of events is published 3 times a year to the public.
Service is available on a first come first served basis. A minimum of 10 passengers per
trip is required. Scheduled events that do not generate reservations of at least 2 groups of
10 may not be rescheduled for the next 12 months.
SeniorShopper buses have established routes that provide trips to major grocery stores.
Service is available Monday through Friday. A minimum of 10 passengers per trip is
required.
RTD provides services to enhance the welfare of certain groups of persons such as the
current services offered for shopping and recreational trips for elderly persons or persons
with disabilities. Since SeniorRide and Senior Shopper service are point to point services,

2.5 Reliability
On-time for fixed-route service is defined as not more than 1 minute early to not more than
5 minutes late. RTD sets annual objectives for on-time performance by class of service
and which are reported in the Quarterly Performance Report. [Improved methods for
monitoring, identifying the causes and remedying unreliable service are currently in
development.]

3. Geometric Design Standards
3.1 Directness of Route
Routes shall be designed to be as direct as possible and to provide maximum accessibility
to transit.
 Deviations from a direct path from end-to-end of the route shall account for no more
than one-quarter of the end-to-end travel time of the route.


For a specific deviation, the total additional travel time for all through passengers
should not exceed three minutes for each rider boarding or alighting along the
deviation.
In mathematical terms, this means that the quantity
Pt * VTT < 3 minutes
Pd
where: Pt = through passengers
VTT = additional vehicle one-way travel time
Pd = passengers served by deviation

3.2 Stop Spacing Standards
Bus routes shall adhere to the following stop spacing standards. Placement also
considers: the balance between pedestrian access and route travel time; ADA
requirements; adjacent land uses; streetscape conditions and property ownership.
3.2.1 Minimum



Local and Express Regional collection, residential areas - 600'
(8 stops/mile) Commercial areas - 500' (10 stops/mile)
Limited service, limited-stop zone - 2500' (2 stops/mile)

these services are evaluated based on passenger boardings per trip. Refer to Appendix A
for current standards.

Service Development Policies & Standards

Limited service, residential and commercial areas – 1,250’ (4 stops/mile)
Limited service, limited stop zone – 8,000’ (1 stop/1.5 miles)

3.3 Roadway Design Goal
New bus routes should not be operated along streets that do not meet minimum
standards:, such as for bus turning radius, pavement strength/loading, lane width,
roadway grade, shoulder width on rural roads (for pedestrian waiting and safety) and
overhead clearance. Refer to the RTD Bus Infrastructure Design Criteria Section 1 –
Transit Access for specific details [currently in development].
 Turning radius - 35' minimum
 Street surface must be asphalt or concrete
 For deep-strength asphalt: 7" for existing street; 11" for new street
 For concrete pavement : 8.5" design thickness; 8" existing thickness
 Lane width - 10' minimum
 No speed bumps
 Bridges - rated for H-20S loading (all legal weights)
 Shoulder width on rural roads - 6' minimum
 Overhead clearance - 12' minimum (16' 6" for structures on new roads)

4. Shelters
The minimum warrant for the placement of a shelter is 40 boardings per day at the stop.
Stops with the highest average of daily boardings will take top priority for shelter
placement. [Revised standards are currently in development and will reference the RTD
Bus Infrastructure Design Criteria.]

5. Area Coverage Standards
5.1 Purpose and Application
The purpose of these standards is to define a reasonable level of service to all areas of the
District and to help RTD maintain this service level. Since the RTD service area includes
many different types of development, and population densities and land use vary widely
across the District, it would not be reasonable to expect all areas to support the same level
of service. Moreover, different types of service may best meet the needs of different
areas, and RTD's resources can be used in a more productive fashion if service can be
tailored to the needs of particular areas. Area coverage standards provide guidelines for
tailoring service to the needs of communities and help ensure that all areas receive a level
of service that is commensurate with their needs.
Levels of service for specific areas also depend on the productivity of existing services. If
existing or proposed services cannot meet the productivity standards outlined in Section 2,
RTD may choose not to provide the minimum level of service. Financial constraints may
also limit RTD's ability to meet the area coverage (or any other) standards.

The area coverage standards for areas outside the Denver Central Business District (CBD)
are based on a combined density measure. This measure adds population and employment
to determine potential demand for transportation to and from a particular area.
[Attachment B shows the density classifications overlaid with RTD services for the entire
District.]
The area coverage standards presented below deal with minimum and maximum route
spacing. Actual route spacing and service frequency will depend on demand and
productivity of existing service in the area.
For use in this document, arterial roadways are defined as follows:
 Traffic flow controlled by traffic signals as opposed to stop signs
 Carry longer distance traffic flow
 Speed limit 30 mph or faster
 Road width two plus lanes in each direction
5.2.1 Minimum Service Levels
Areas with 3-12 residents and employees per acre
 Peak period Park-n-Ride service if either the travel time to the Denver CBD by Express
bus or rail, or a bus/rail timed connection, exceeds 20 minutes.
 Call-n-Ride service.
Areas with 12 or more residents and employees per acre:
 Local service on major arterials with pedestrian access within 1/4 mile.
 Peak period, Limited, Express, or Regional service from Park-n-Rides if either the travel
time to the Denver CBD by Express bus, or a bus/rail timed connection, exceeds 20
minutes.
5.2.2 Maximum Target Service Levels
Areas with 3-12 residents and employees per acre:
 Local service along major arterials with pedestrian access within 1/4 mile.
 Peak period, Limited, Express, or Regional service from park-n- Rides if travel time to
the Denver CBD by Express bus exceeds 20 minutes.
Areas with 12 or more residents and employees per acre:
 Local service with ½ mile route spacing.
 Limited, Express, or Regional service if travel time to the Denver CBD by Express bus
exceeds 20 minutes.

each fixed route. The corridor shall include an area with a three-fourths of a mile
radius at the ends of each fixed route.
(ii) Within the core service area, the entity also shall provide service to small areas
not inside any of the corridors but which are surrounded by corridors.
(iii) Outside the core service area, the entity may designate corridors with widths
from three-fourths of a mile up to one and one half miles on each side of a fixed
route, based on local circumstances.
(iv) For purposes of this paragraph, the core service area is that area in which
corridors with a width of three-fourths of a mile on each side of each fixed route
merge together such that, with few and small exceptions, all origins and
destinations within the area would be served.
“(2) Rail.
(i) For rail systems, the service area shall consist of a circle with a radius of 3/4 of
a mile around each station.
(ii) At end stations and other stations in outlying areas, the entity may designate
circles with radii of up to 11/2 miles as part of its service area, based on local
circumstances.
“(3) Jurisdictional boundaries. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
paragraph, an entity is not required to provide paratransit service in an area outside
the boundaries of the jurisdiction(s) in which it operates, if the entity does not have
legal authority to operate in that area. The entity shall take all practicable steps to
provide paratransit service to any part of its service area.”
“Requirements for complementary paratransit do not apply to commuter bus …
fixed route bus service, characterized by service predominantly in one direction
during peak periods, limited stops, use of multi-ride tickets, and routes of extended
length, usually between the central business district and outlying suburbs.”
[§37.121]

6. Transit Access
RTD has guidelines for access to its facilities for pedestrians, bus riders, bicyclists,
passenger loading, and parking. The RTD Bus Infrastructure Design Criteria, included here
by reference, is intended to be used by RTD in conjunction with local jurisdictions in
planning transit access (including projects under construction) [separately under
development].

7. Service Guidelines for Special Events and Special Services




Protect neighborhoods from the impact of events which are so large as to overwhelm
the surrounding supply of parking, and
Serve customers by offering adequate service for events which are predictably large
enough to overload the normally available transit service, and
Protect taxpayers by only serving those events that have a predictable level of transit
demand great enough to justify the operation of special routes.

7.2

Standards for Events

RTD, within the limits of its budget, will operate special service:




For events at Invesco Field at Mile High stadium with projected attendance of over
55,000, for which the crowd is expected to all be present at one time.
For events at Coors Field with projected attendance of over 40,000, for which the
crowd is expected to all be present at one time.
At other venues where the ratio of projected attendance to available on-site parking is
6:1 and for which the crowd is expected to all be present at one time.

This service will not be provided when substantial numbers of the event patrons can be
expected to arrive in privately operated or non-profit owned buses or regularly scheduled
RTD service.
RTD will provide Express Shuttle service to Invesco Field and Coors Field from selected
Park-n-Rides for events described in this section. The General Manager must specifically
authorize Park-n-Ride service for other events.
RTD may also provide service at events with lower attendance projections if the promoter
is willing to subsidize such service. The RTD Board adopted a specific subsidy formula in
September 1987: “the prorated share of RTD’s incremental cost of service, plus a 10%
administrative service fee, the share to be based on the percentage shortfall in ridership
between the minimum ridership of 1650 passengers going to the event and the actual
number of passengers carried, based on RTD traffic checks.”

8. Shuttles & Circulators
8.1 Characteristics
Shuttle and circulator routes are not defined as a separate class of service, but are
typically proposed to serve specific, local, community-focused needs. Shuttle and
circulator routes are generally defined by the following characteristics: short routes,
usually less than 5 miles long; operate on local streets and arterials; connect major activity
centers; and serve short passenger trip lengths within a single community. Fares must be
set according to RTD Fare Policy.



A sustained average population density of at least 10 people per acre along the length
of the route is a minimum requirement; a critical mass of potential riders is needed to
succeed.



Connects community residences with major activity centers such as colleges, high
schools, middle schools, shopping districts (but not auto-centric malls), medical
centers, and downtowns that appeal to all market segments (youth, families, seniors)
and can serve a variety of trip purposes.



Transit friendly environment: pedestrian friendly, walkable streets are a minimum;
mixed land uses; areas of clustered shopping or employment; public spaces; and
bicycle parking/paths.



To attract spontaneous walk up use, the headway needs to be15 minutes or less for a
service span for the intended markets, typically 6:00 – 18:00 or longer.



Offers bi-directional service.



Does not substantially duplicate a service of comparable utility.

9. System-Wide Cost Recovery Standard
The state required system-wide minimum cost recovery ratio is 30 percent. This ratio is
calculated by the following formula:

[Farebox Revenues + Advertising Revenues + Lease Revenues + FTA Operating
Assistance + Other Non-Sales Tax Revenues ] / [Category I Costs +Category II Costs +
Local share of depreciation on RTD assets] [Category Costs applied according to RTD Cost
Model Memo, June 15, 2010, as updated (See summary below)]
Cost Model Summary
With the exception of Private Carrier costs, all costs are allocated to routes by one of
three methods: hours, miles or vehicles. The RTD Bus Cost Model has five cost categories:
Variable/Direct, Variable/Indirect, Private Carrier, Retained Costs and Depreciation. Private
Carrier costs are allocated to routes by the number of hours the contractor operates the
route, multiplied by the average hourly rate billed for that particular contract, plus the
average hourly cost for fuel.
The annual budget and six-year Strategic Budget Plan are evaluated using this cost
recovery standard.

Several factors are critical to shuttle and circulator success. As a guideline to make
informed decisions, the following characteristics must be present and considered.

Service Development Policies & Standards

If the standard is not met, several courses of action may be taken. The RTD Board has
adopted a policy of evaluating the fare structure as part of the annual budget process;
fares may be changed at that time to provide additional revenue. RTD may also choose to
market its services more aggressively to attract more customers and their fares, or RTD
may look for revenue from other sources. The productivity standards in Sections 2 and 3
may be used to reduce the costs of providing service while disrupting service to as few
passengers as possible.

10. Title VI & Environmental Justice Compliance
RTD follows FTA Circular 4072.1B “Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal
Transit Administration Recipients,” Chapter 4.4.
Title VI Protected Classes are race, color and national origin.
Environmental Justice Protected Classes are as follows:

10.11. Standard for Service for Transit Dependent Persons and
To Social Service Destinations
For purposes of these service standards, transit dependent riders are defined as riders who
either live in a household which does not own a car or who have a physical or mental
disability that prevents the transit patron from driving a car. Social Service destinations
are those destinations that are provided as a public service that may not have consistently
sufficient ridership to otherwise warrant the establishment or continuation of a route or
route segment. Examples of social service destinations would include county court
facilities, hospitals, schools, or public institutions which have been situated or constructed
in isolated locations prior to the establishment of RTD or following review and comment by
RTD of the proposed development plans of such institution or agency, by the appropriate
jurisdiction.

Purpose of the Standard

This standard is intended to provide for consideration of transit dependency in service
decisions. This standard does not guarantee a minimum level of service to all transitdependent riders. However, it will ensure that transit-dependent riders and/or the need to
have access to social service destinations are identified and considered when decisions are
made to reduce service levels in an area.

10.211.2

Determination of Transit Dependency

Whenever RTD plans changes to an existing route where there is no alternative service
available to meet the area coverage standards in Section 5 such as a change in routing or
span of service, transit-dependent riders will be identified through on-board surveys. This
survey will ask questions about riders' travel habits and demographics, and it will attempt
to identify transit-dependent riders and their destinations.

10.311.3

Application of Transit Dependency Standard

The applicable minimum productivity standards for a route will be reduced by one-half the
percentage of ridership that is defined as transit dependent. Thus, if 60 percent of the
riders on a route are transit dependent, the route must achieve 70 percent [100 percent
minus (60 percent divided by 2)] of the applicable productivity standards (ridership and
economic) in order not to be considered a poor performer.
Applicable ridership standards for fixed route services may be found in Section 2.3, and
for non-fixed route services, in Section 2.4.
If the on-board survey reveals that the route does not serve the destinations desired by
transit-dependent riders, RTD may restructure the route to improve service and increase
ridership. This could include changing the routing or schedule to serve passenger needs.
RTD wishes to provide transit dependent riders with service that fits their needs and to
provide service to social service destinations when there is even a modicum of recognized
demand.
Another consideration to be given in whether or not to eliminate a route with some transit
dependent passengers is the impact on required Access-A-Ride services. The Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that eligible persons with disabilities be provided with
paratransit service if they have trip origins and destinations within a defined service area
three-fourths of a mile from a non-commuter fixed route. If accessible fixed route service
is considered for removal from a portion of the defined paratransit service area, an
estimate of the demand for substitute Access-A-Ride service for persons with disabilities
who require lift-equipped buses must be completed and a cost-benefit analysis performed
for the alternatives (leaving fixed route versus providing Access-A-Ride service).

Service Development Policies & Standards

The following is a description of the steps necessary in developing and implementing
service changes, which are typically conducted each year in January, May and
September—also called runboards—as required by Board policy and the Collective
Bargaining Agreement.
Proposals are derived from a variety of inputs continuously throughout the year including:
periodic customer, household and employer surveys; stakeholder meetings; service
performance evaluation; and changing demographics and land uses. They are compiled for
each runboard and evaluated based on a number of factors, including RTD annual budget,
RTD Service Standards, effects on the transit network and on transit dependent markets
(Title VI), cost-effective services throughout the District and responsiveness to changes in
the communities within RTD. A Board paper is compiled and presented to the Board,
stakeholders and public for consideration.
Staff then discusses the proposals with members of the Board, stakeholders and senior
staff and coordinates with other staff including Marketing, Operations, Facilities and
Finance. Modifications are made as warranted and then the proposals enter the pubic
engagement process: formally scheduled public hearings; informal presentations upon
request; repository for customer input—service.changes@rtd-denver; responses to General
Manager and Board Member requests. Upon completion of public engagement, all
previous input is compiled and evaluated and revisions to the proposals are made as
warranted. A final Board report is prepared with a summary and details of proposed
changes and a summary of public hearings and other public input for approval of the
Board.
The approved changes then go into a comprehensive production process which includes:
schedule creation; bus and operator requirements and assignments; compliance with
privatization policy; runcutting and compliance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement;
marketing promotions and public relations; bus stop and on-street changes; printed and
electronic public information, including maps and timetables; and validation and
distribution of all data within the Transit Information Exchange System (TIES).

13. Cost Sharing Policy
13.1 Background
On June 21, 1994, the RTD Board of Directors passed a resolution, Transit Service CostSharing Policy, to provide guidance to RTD staff in responding to the increasing number of
requests for new service. This policy authorized the General Manager to pursue cost
sharing as a method of providing transit service using RTD revenues and other funds
voluntarily pledged by private employers, businesses or local governments; this has
resulted in a number of RTD partnerships in demonstrating new services. The following
incorporates this experience and provides guidance on the application and limitations of
cost-sharing arrangements.

Financial feasibility depends not only on the availability of funds, but also on consideration
of fares, cost/revenue allocation and equity.








Net operating cost (subsidy) needs to be defined so that all partners are treated
equitably. Net cost is the total operating cost less farebox revenue and other operating
revenues and any grant revenues secured on behalf of the proposed service. The
application of grant revenues prior to the net cost sharing allows all partners to
participate in the benefits of grant funding.
Cost-sharing projects need to adopt the RTD fare structure for similar services for
reasons of equity. Furthermore, this places all projects on the same revenue basis for
calculating net operating cost. Project sponsors may propose a fare that does not
follow the RTD fare structure. For these projects the partner is required to fund the full
difference in revenue between the comparable RTD fare and the project fare, based on
actual ridership. The adoption of any non-conforming (economically or technically) fare
is always subject to Board approval.
Costs associated with vehicles are addressed project by project. Vehicles can be
purchased outright by project sponsors with grant funds or provided from the RTD
inventory. Should new vehicles be required, grants should fund their acquisition and
the local share split equally by the cost-sharing partners. If no grant funds are used,
RTD will limit its share to 10%, half of the usual local share when grant funds are
used. If the RTD operates the service and agrees to provide the vehicles from its
inventory, capital costs need not be included as part of the project cost unless special
accommodations are required.
Cost-sharing projects are new or expanded transit services and RTD’s share must be
budgeted out of allocations for new services for the entire District. Thus any partner
with expectations for RTD financial or operational participation must first obtain
commitment from RTD before applying for project grants. In addition, each project will
be subject to the appropriate RTD and DRCOG planning processes, especially as
regards estimates of costs, ridership, revenue and other benefits.

13.2.2 Vehicle Availability
RTD may have, with some minor modifications, vehicles readily available to provide the
proposed service. In some cases projects require a specialty or significantly modified
vehicle that must be acquired, subject to RTD approval for fleet maintenance compatibility.
Financing these vehicles is addressed above. Sometimes the availability of operators has
been more critical.
13.2.3 Local and Community Support
Local and community entities (e.g., government, employers, businesses and associations)
generally initiate cost-sharing transit projects concomitant with other plans and
developments in the community. Thus the proposed transit project is designed to address
a specific development or perceived need. To advance their project for implementation, an
entity such as a city, will offer to share in the net costs of providing the service. RTD

Service Development Policies & Standards

1.C.1.b






Projects generally have substantial institutional support; however they are subject to
the same public scrutiny, for example public hearings, as any other proposed service
change. Implementation of any cost-sharing project will continue to be subject to
RTD’s public review process.
RTD generally provides 50% of the local share of the net operating and/or capital cost
of a project. This cost-sharing ratio may be adjusted in consideration of the District
budget and policies.
Cost-sharing arrangements for each project are of limited duration for which agreed
upon performance milestones must be reached (see below). The purpose of the test
period is to assess the sustainability of the service and decide RTD’s and its partners
continuing participation. The test period is typically set at one, two or three years, as
appropriate to the project. Performance milestones must be set and evaluated and a
recommendation regarding continuation made for each year of the project.

13.2.4 Performance
Cost-sharing services will have clearly defined evaluative criteria agreed upon within the
cost-sharing agreement and prior to implementation.








At a minimum these criteria will include average daily ridership and RTD Service
Standards within the appropriate class of service for passenger boardings per hour and
subsidy per boarding. Additional criteria may also address issues related to project
objectives, such as new riders. State mandated cost recovery may also be considered.
Expectations of performance will be laid out in the form of milestones, such as a range
or minimum attainment at the end of each year.
During the first year performance will be assessed to determine if expectations have
been met and if continuation of the service is warranted. Often an experimental
service will need to be changed to improve performance. As warranted the same
assessment will be made in each succeeding year during the test period. This
assessment and recommendation regarding continuation will be reported to the RTD
Board each year of the test period.
If the cost-share service meets expectations and RTD Service Standards during the test
period, RTD will consider extending the period of its participation and increasing its
share of net cost; however, RTD is under no obligation to continuing any service
beyond the cost-share agreement, even if it meets Service Standards. If the cost-share
service does not perform up to expectations, RTD funding participation in such project
will be reduced or discontinued. These decisions are subject to the customary financial
and Board review.
Should RTD decide to discontinue or reduce its funding of the project service, a
sponsoring partner may choose to continue its funding by entering into a cost-sharing
agreement with RTD. This agreement will specify the service to be provided and its
cost, will be annually reviewed for potential renewal and will be subject to all RTD
Service Standards, budgeting and public processes.

MOBILITY CHOICE

BLUEPRINT INITIATIVE
for the Metro Denver Area

How we move is changing. In the post-war history of mobility in our region, personal cars have
been central to nearly every trip. Getting a driver’s license was a major rite of passage for most
Americans, and owning a car was part of living the American dream. Accordingly, our
transportation planning processes were built around that expectation, with a focus on
maximizing and increasing the amount of cars our roads can hold.
But technology is changing these values. Today, Americans spend on average 17 percent of their
household budgets on transportation, largely toward owning and maintaining a car. Driving is
an unproductive commitment of personal time. Meanwhile, connected cars are already being
produced, driverless cars are coming faster than anticipated and the sharing economy is
growing. With that, transportation planning must change.
We are proposing a mobility planning effort that takes into account the types of changes we are
experiencing due to advancing technology and shifting values. By uniting the public and private
sectors we can better plan for the mobility needs of our future workforce. If we don’t act now,
our growth and congestion could work against us when it comes to attracting tomorrow’s
employers.
The Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, the Colorado Department of Transportation, the
Regional Transportation District and the Denver Regional Council of Governments are ready to
embrace a new approach to planning for connected mobility in the metro Denver area.
OUR PURPOSE
Maximize existing investments in our transportation system by leveraging technology
to plan for our future workforce and employer mobility needs and thereby increase
economic opportunities and quality of life.

Attachment: Mobility Choice Blueprint Initiative (2822 : Mobility Choice)

• Create a vision for the future of mobility in metro Denver, including key strategies to attain the
goal of increased vehicle occupancy.
• Identify options for connected mobility and choice, such as transit, personal vehicles, for-profit
mobility services, car sharing, ridesharing, bicycling and walking. This strategic direction will move the
region from dominance of personal vehicles to Mobility as a Service (MaaS).
• Develop strategies to implement more cost-effective solutions for first and last mile access to
existing transit. Identifying actions to protect and leverage the investment in the region’s rail transit
system will be a top priority.
• Achieve better roadway reliability by using new technology to support active traffic management,
including express toll lanes, signal coordination, ramp metering, variable speed limits and lane control.
• Estimate the cost and sources of funding for various projects and programs.
• Hand off implementation of the strategies to existing or new agencies.

1.C.5.a

PURPOSE of the FTA ADA Circular
•

FTA issues guidance, often in the form of circulars, to provide grantees
with direction on program specific issues and statutory requirements.

•

The ADA Circular is to provide guidance to FTA grantees, that is,

entities that receive funding through the agency, concerning the
requirements of the DOT ADA regulations.
•

Effective November 4, 2015

•

One-stop shopping for guidance on accessibility standards,
Information, and tools to help transit agencies avoid
deficiencies.

FTA’s goal is to help public transit providers meet their obligations under
the ADA by outlining and explaining the vast body of requirements in an
easy-to-use, consolidated format.

Packet Pg. 83

Attachment: RTD Circular Board Presentation 2016 (2817 : Recent FTA Guidance Regarding ADA

1.C.5.a

What the Circular Provides
• The circular provides guidance to recipients and sub
recipients of Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
financial assistance necessary to carry out provisions of
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990,
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as
amended, and the U.S. Department of Transportation’s
implementing regulations at 49 CFR Parts 27, 37, 38,
and 39.
• Reader friendly, plain English explanation and
interpretation of the DOT/ADA requirements.

Packet Pg. 84

Circular Guidance on Section 810 of
DOT/ADA Standards
• Applies to construction, alteration, or relocation of bus stops and
shelters.
• New, altered, or relocated bus stops must have a firm, stable
surface and must provide a clear length of 96 inches measured
perpendicular to the curb or vehicle roadway edge, and a clear
width of 60 inches measured parallel to the vehicle roadway.
• Bus stops must also connect via an accessible route to streets,
sidewalks, or pedestrian paths.
• Sidewalks and other features of pedestrian rights-of-way are often
outside a transit agency’s jurisdiction, an accessible pathway to a
bus stop is nevertheless an essential element of overall accessible
fixed route service.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

June 7, 2016

Board Meeting Date: June 14, 2016

Subject:

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 1st
Quarter 2016

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the first quarter of 2016 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000
miles in the 1st quarter. First Transit Denver did not meet the goal as they experienced an
increase in preventable vehicle accidents as a result of 1st quarter snow storms. First Transit and
Transdev continue to utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations
for retraining of operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at
monthly safety meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles in
the 1st quarter. First Transit Longmont did not meet the goal; however, only one of the First
Transit Longmont passenger accidents that occurred in the 1st quarter was classified as nonpreventable. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness of passenger safety to
reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 1st quarter. RTD and the contractor organizations
place a high emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as
such, the local operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
First Transit Denver, and First Transit Longmont met the target of 88% Local On-Time Service
with 88.7% and 89.5% on-time performance respectively in the 1st quarter. First Transit
Commerce City and Transdev continue to make progress with 85.5% and 87.3% on-time
performance. RTD and the private contractors continue to campaign routes and operators with
low on time performance with a strong focus on first time point departures. On a monthly basis
contractors review the OTP report and meet with operators of low performing routes to discuss
factors that are impacting their ability to reach 88% on time performance. Running time issues
are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.

1.C.8



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 28,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 1st quarter. The contractors continue to improve in this
area by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely
manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
First Transit Longmont met the target of .0004 Complaints per Boarding with .0003 complaints
per boarding in the 1st quarter. First Transit Commerce City, First Transit Denver, and Transdev
did not meet the goal and all achieved .0005, .0005 and .0008 complaints per boarding in the
1st quarter. TransDev in particular suffered from considerable amounts of lost service during the
first quarter, generating a number of customer complaints. The contractors continue to
investigate and address customer complaints with operators. The contractors utilize onboard
video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist operators in improving customer interactions. In
addition, the steps noted above regarding on-time performance should help address some
customer complaints. The contractors also continue to address complaint trends with all
operators at monthly safety meetings.

Access-a-Ride/Cab 1st Quarter Report 2016

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership increased by 1% through the 1st quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of
2015. Productivity increased from 1.19 to 1.26 passengers per hour. During the same period, Accessa-Cab ridership decreased by 10%. Combined Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab ridership decreased by
2% compared to 2015. Total boardings decreased from 225,206 total boardings thru Q1 of 2015 to
221,261 total boardings thru Q1 of 2016.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride decreased by 5% during the 1st quarter of 2016
as compared to the same period of 2015. Access-a-Ride is approximately 8% under budgeted revenue
hours through the first quarter of 2016.
On-Time Performance
Carrier on-time performance through the 1st quarter of 2016 was 94.64% a slight decrease as compared
to the same period of 2015 (94.89).
Passenger on-time performance through the 1st quarter of 2016 was 83.1% a slight increase as
compared to the same period in 2015 (83.04).
On time performance continues to be challenging as a result of operator shortages and the continuing
trend of traffic, construction, and other delays. Our private contractors continue to address the operator
shortage challenge by continuing to utilize radio and billboards as a means of attracting potential
operators. In addition, our dedicated vehicle service providers have instituted salary increases and
bonuses in order to attract additional operators.
Customer Complaints
Complaints increased through the 1st quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Staff
continues to work with our carriers and passengers to improve overall customer satisfaction.

Special Services 1st Qtr Report

RTD currently provides Call-n-Ride service in 21 Call-n-Ride service areas throughout the District. The
following is a discussion of Call-n-Ride performance through the First Quarter of 2016.

Preventable Accidents:
1st Qtr 2016 – 2 Accidents
1st Qtr 2015 – 3 Accidents
Call-n-Ride Comments:
Ridership continues to be down. Changes to how we are scheduling trips for the school children,
low gas prices and the new fare increases have affected ridership in the Call-n-Ride areas.
All Call-n-Rides operate with a computer and scheduling software. The current computers in use are
old and this affects our Call-n-Ride operations. New computers have arrived and are being
configured and are anticipated to be on board in June 2016.
Belmar – The Belmar Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line
Light Rail service. The Call-n-Ride operated with 2 peak vehicles and one all day vehicle, weekdays
only. Over the past two years, the service has been modified to improve ridership as it does not
meet the minimum of three boardings per hour. The RTD Board approved discontinuance of this Calln-Ride in April 2016.
Evergreen – A strong Call-n-Ride over the years, there are two major factors in the decline of
ridership: a school whose students rode CnR closed and the Extension program for the disabled
moved and acquired their own bus. We have met with the Seniors’ Resources Center (SRC) and
they have been actively working with the senior living communities and the schools to increase
ridership. A Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC) was formed to evaluate the service and make

Packet Pg. 105

1.C.10

recommendations for change. As a direct result of the TAC, marketing has taken place, a shopping
trip was created for the seniors, and Call-n-Ride worked to encourage school age children to use CnR
for school trips. At the end of 2015, the shopping trip was discontinued but marketing continues.
Highlands Ranch - This CnR opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Highlands
Ranch CnR replaced the poorly performing Route 426 Ranch Rider. Over the years RTD has tried
numerous adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be
discontinued twice. Highlands Ranch has carried a high percentage of Access-a-Ride qualified users.
While the subsidy is high for the CnR, if CnR were to be discontinued, this ridership would move to
Access-a-Ride where the subsidy would be much higher. Douglas County has contributed financially
to the CnR in the past. In 2015 Douglas County and Highlands Ranch provided a cost share with the
RTD for 50% of the subsidy. A TAC was formed to re-evaluate service and develop marketing to
increase ridership. The TAC came up with some ideas that were implemented in the August 2015
runboard. The school trippers have increased ridership slightly, but this requires a great deal of staff
time.
Parker – This CnR opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Over the years RTD has
made adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be discontinued
twice. In 2015 Douglas County and the Town of Parker provided a cost share with the RTD for 50%
of the subsidy. A TAC was formed to re-evaluate service and develop marketing to increase
ridership. The TAC came up with some ideas that were implemented in the August 2015 runboard.
So far, these changes have not had a positive impact on ridership.

2016 1st Quarter Complaint Analysis

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 1st Quarter of 2016. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2015.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding. The goal for 2014 was again adjusted to account for the static higher level of complaints due
to the securement area/priority seating issues, the fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability,
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line service. The 2015 goal remained at .0004
complaints per passenger boarding. The 2016 goal was again set at .0004 complaints per passenger
boarding.
For the 1st Quarter of 2016, RTD and First Transit Longmont met the goal of .0004 complaints per
passenger boarding. First Transit Commerce City and First Transit Denver had .0005 complaints per
passenger boarding. Transdev (formerly Veolia) had .0008 complaints per passenger boarding. The
combined performance for all of the private contractors was .0005 complaints per passenger boarding.
The combined performance for RTD and the private contractors was .0004 complaints per passenger
boarding.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the complaint

Packet Pg. 110

1.C.11

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
 Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
 Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices and produce a quarterly newsletter which is
shared with operations personnel.
 RTD is conducting refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
 RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
 RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis,
DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for
passengers with disabilities.
 Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
Historically, and in 2016, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 1st Quarter 2016: the complaints in this category increased 78.3% compared to
the same period in 2015. Due to on-going operator shortages at both RTD and the private contractors,
a high number of trips were either dropped or ran late. Consequently, a number of passengers
experienced times when their bus did not show. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 8.48
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 4.81 complaints per day.
Bus Early – 1st Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 3.2% compared to the same period
in 2015. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are

Packet Pg. 111

1.C.11

addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The
YTD average in this category for 2016 is 5.36 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015
was 5.60 complaints per day.
Bus Late – 1st Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 4.9 % compared to the same period
in 2015. This category was also impacted by the operator shortages. Additionally, improving on-time
performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time issues. The YTD average in
this category for 2016 is 11.01 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 11.71
complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 1st Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 21.3% compared
to the same period in 2015. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride
checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In
addition, RTD and the private contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam,
Smart Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators
continue to be counseled and retrained as needed to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety
campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is
3.77 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 4.84 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 1st Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 2.3% compared to the
same period in 2015. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 11.08 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2015 was 11.47 complaints per day.
Discrimination – 1st Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 5.9% compared to the same
period in 2015. Investigation into discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at
fault. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 0.20 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2015 was 0.19 complaints per day.
Fare Dispute – 1st Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 41.7% compared to the same
period in 2015. The implementation of the new fares and fare equipment resulted in an increase in
complaints. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The
YTD average in this category for 2016 is 1.49 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015
was 1.07 complaints per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 1st Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 6.2% compared
to the same period in 2015. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel meet on a
regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In addition, the
on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held at the
private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of RTD
passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not

Packet Pg. 112

1.C.11

following proper procedures, appropriate action is taken. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is
8.08 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 7.69 complaints per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator – 1st Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 2.4% compared to the
same period in 2015. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, the Bus
Operator Training Newsletter Team, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers are providing operators with upto-date information to answer customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average in
the category for 2016 is 0.46 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 0.46
complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 1st Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 2.4% compared
to the same period in 2015. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm buses are on
route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the stop when
the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop as the bus
passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting
directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (41 of the total 996 = 4.1%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to the
Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources will
allow. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 10.95 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2015 was 10.81 complaints per day.

Customer Satisfaction Survey
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops

1st Quarter 2016 Security Statistics & Fare
Inspection Summary

Discussion

DISCUSSION:
Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons contacted during the
quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area and conduct an onboard enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables summarize information for the months of October, November and December. These
tables list the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the estimated fare evasion
rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests made by police officers.

Packet Pg. 116

1.C.12

Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion.
This is an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have
the authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This quarter the
bus routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Security Officer Use of Force Incidents
Use of Force is defined as any hands on touching of a suspect by a security officer to detain a suspect
or make a citizen’s arrest. The majority of these issues are minor in nature. No injuries to any suspect
or officer occurred in this reporting quarter. The following table summarizes the use of force incidents
per month.
