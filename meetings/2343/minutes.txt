Retiree Awards
There were two retirees this month; however, none were in attendance. Chair Sisk
acknowledged our retirees for their contributions to RTD which are invaluable. He asked
the audience to join him in thanking them for being such great employees.
Kim D. Baker – LRT Train Operator – 22 years
Gary Lynn Hill – Dispatcher – 18 years
Special Recognition – GFOA 2015 Distinguished Budget Presentation Award
Chair Sisk believes this is an apropos recognition as later this evening the Board will be
asked to approve the Strategic Budget Plan. He recognized Todd Nikkel, Cost and Budget
Manager, for his budget presentation. Chair Sisk thinks this is such an honor. He
recognized that RTD’s budgets are very integral and complicated. He said that he is sure
he does not give the budgets the attention they deserve but he really appreciates the
amount of effort the finance department gives. He noted this is an award that RTD had
received for over 31 years but it should not be taken lightly.

V.

Public Participation
Chair Sisk noted the importance of public participation as it is a way for the constituents
to communicate with the Board members and staff. He reminded the speakers that they
would have three minutes to address the Board and asked that they be respectful of their
fellow participants.
 Kent Moorman, City of Thornton, shared that he was here on behalf of Mayor Heidi
Williams who was unable to attend the meeting due to a City Council Meeting. He
read a letter from Mayor Williams and the City Council expressing their support for





the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation for necessary aspects of Phase I of the North
Metro Rail Line to the 124th Avenue Station; however, they are very disappointed
that the 2015 APE does not include funding to completed Phase 2 of the North
Metro Line from 124th Avenue to the end-of-line station at 162nd Avenue. They
would like the Board to authorize funding this year to complete the final design to
the end-of-line station as well as negotiate an extension of the guaranteed price
option for construction of Phase 2. A copy of this letter is available in the Board
Office.
Steve O’Dorisio, Adams County Commissioner, said he wanted to begin by
thanking the Board for their commitment. He acknowledged the hard business
decisions the Board must make. These decisions are based on weighing
opportunity and risk. He stated that there is the opportunity to complete the North
Metro Rail Line thereby helping the North Metro community. He commented that
his community is asking RTD to focus on completing the line that was promised
before discussing the expansion of any other lines. He outlined the opportunities
and risks as follows:
o Opportunities
 Predictability – RTD has a guaranteed price for completion to 162nd
Avenue and a financial commitment of $3 million from Adams County
should RTD honor its commitment to finish the Line
 Permission – RTD owns almost all of the Right of Way (ROW) needed
for completion to 162nd Avenue
 Timing and Efficiency – RTD can take advantage of having design,
engineering and construction teams already mobilized
o Risks
 Waiting – RTD would have to start over with both the political
process and the design, engineering and construction teams
 Cost – RTD will lose the guaranteed cost for completion to 162nd
Avenue if we do not exercise our option with the contractor
Steve O’Dorisio hopes the Board will consider approving the guaranteed
construction price by approving construction to 162nd Avenue as well as authorizing
funding this year to complete the design. He looks forward to working with RTD
and thanked the Board and Staff for their dedication.
Gary Van Dorn, National Federation for the Blind – Colorado Chapter (NFBCO),
came to speak in his capacity as a NFBCO Board Member. The NFBCO has
concerns with the new fully electric mall shuttles that the Board will be voting on
due to their virtually silent operations. They are grateful that staff is looking into
options so the visually impaired can hear the vehicles on the mall but noted this is
not just a blindness issue. The mall is busy and noisy and the shuttles can be
difficult for everyone to hear. Gary Van Dorn noted something that RTD currently
does well is that operators ring bells and honk their horns. He hopes this





continues. He stated that the NFBCO is not opposed to the purchase of the mall
shuttles but wanted to make sure their concerns were expressed.
Julie Bennett, 9 to 5, stated that she is homeless. She wanted to discuss an
income based bus fare for people who live in poverty and are trying to get on their
feet. She commented that it is difficult to get by in this State unless you make $35
per hour. She asked the Board for their support and help so people struggling
could pay their fares every day to go to interviews, go to jobs, find housing, etc.
Yolanda Begay, 9 to 5, indicated that she too was homeless. She is a single
mother to her four year old son, a student at Metro, and lucky that she currently
receives an EcoPass. She noted that several years ago she was working a full time
job that paid over minimum wage and at times it was still difficult to pay for
transportation. She remembers the day she got a ticket in front of her son. It was
very embarrassing because it was not that she did not want to pay for the fare; it
was because she could not afford to pay for the fare. She stated it was important
for the Board to consider the many stories of people that cannot pay RTD’s fares,
not just a few. She thinks having an income based program would really help the
people that are struggling. She said she is tired of struggling.
Dre Chiriboga-Flor, 9 to 5 transit organizer, is here to share the story of a young
man who could not attend as he is not allowed on RTD property. He makes $9 per
hour at a fast food restaurant. Two years ago he had to go to court for light rail
tickets. The judge said if he received another ticket it would be considered
trespassing. She said that two weeks ago he went to a light rail station to buy a
ticket to get to work. The machine would not recognize his debit card so he got on
the train so he would not be late. On the train he was asked to show his ticket,
which he did not have, and was suspended from RTD for six months and issued a
ticket with a fine. He was told that if he was found at any buses, light rail or RTD
property he would be arrested. She expressed that it is hard to understand why
RTD would ban someone after issuing a fine since it only makes it harder for them
to get to work so they can pay the fine. This is one of many stories of people
being fined between $80 and $200 for not paying for a $2.25 fare. These people
are not paying their fares because they are trying to cheat the system but because
they cannot afford them. She said that they have heard many references to
working on an income based pass with Mile High Connects. She stated that 9 to 5
is here to hold the Board accountable. She hopes the Board will follow through
with this instead of further contributing to the financial crisis many people are
facing.
Steve Gutierez, SEIU Local 105, is an organizer with the Fight for 15 for Home
Healthcare Workers. He said he was here to speak to the Board about an income
based pass. He knows many of the Board members support this and he hopes they
continue to do so. He shared that many home health care workers make between
$8 and $10 an hour to perform this very critical job. Many are struggling already to









afford a bus pass or daily ticket. He asked the Board to look at the budget and
make an income based pass a reality.
Dana Nobles, 9 to 5, stated that as decision makers the Board chose to go against
overwhelming public input against a violent fare increase. She believes the Board
can provide protections to those that will be impacted the most by offering an
income based pass. She stated that by voting for the fare increase the Board
committed structural violence. Structural violence is defined as political economic
forces that enact unequal access to resources, services, rights and security that
limit life chances. The fare increase is directly propagating harm and exacerbating
poverty. She said that while the Board can no longer do the right thing there is still
time to do something right. She asked the Board to let go of being profiteers and
make a decision as a human being. The heart of transit is human beings and
families.
Violet Deseguin said that he is homeless. He was here to speak to the Board about
the fare increase. He does not think it is a good idea. He works for Praxus as a
volunteer. He relies on transit to get to work and back to his campsite. He stated
that he cannot afford the fare. He believes not being able to access public
transportation is affecting people’s lives. He hopes the Board can change its mind
about the fare increase.
Mary Durrent, Lakewood, is here on behalf of an organization called Praxus. She
oversees Praxus’ budget and noted that their funding has been significantly
decreased over the past 1.5 years. There have been massive funding gaps that
have meant that Praxus cannot purchase bus tickets for their youth. These youth
can no longer come to the Praxus office to access basic needs. She is here before
the Board as she has been many other times to talk about an income based pass.
She has spent many hours of her time at court to turn fees and fines into
community service for the youth that are the most vulnerable. Not only was
increasing the fare detrimental, but the penalties create an even bigger burden for
those that cannot afford the fare. She asked the Board to really think what it must
be like to choose between buying a bus pass or food or medication. They do not
get on the trains without paying because they want to go against RTD policies but
because they are unable to pay. She stated that the non-profit agencies can no
longer support the community’s transportation costs.
Doug Gragg, Denver, was recently at Denver Union Station watching the trains
come in and out when he was assaulted by a teenager. He said he is concerned
about security. A security officer did come to his aide and he was doing a great job
but unfortunately it was after the fact. He shared that every time he goes to DUS
he is worried now. He noted that the elevators at DUS also seem to be out of
service frequently. He asked RTD to put signs around the concourse letting
passengers know when the elevators are out of service. It can be quite frustrating
to walk from the middle of DUS to one end only to find that you cannot ride the





elevator. He commented that there is also an issue with several of the planters
with trees. They are all dead and it looks terrible.
Jonathan Perlmutter with North Metro Partners read a letter regarding the RTD’s
Annual Program Evaluation. A copy of this letter is available in the Board office.
The letter expressed North Metro Partners’ disappointment that the APE did not
including funding for the North Metro Rail Line to 162nd Avenue.
Brenda Lozada shared that she is a personal care provider that truly relies on RTD
for transportation. She expressed that it was going to be very hard for her to get
around with RTD raising prices and there any many people in her situation. She
really appreciates RTD’s service and drivers but she is concerned about being able
to pay for a ticket. She asked the board to look into a way to help low income
works with an income based pass.

Chair Sisk thanked everyone for their participation.

GM Executive Search Committee Update
Chair Sisk said he was pleased to report that as of last Friday the job requirements for the
General Manager position were published in a variety of publications locally, nationally and
internationally as well as on the RTD website. He noted that if anyone was interested in
the position they should contact Greg Moser of Krauthamer & Associates. He shared that
there will be a Civic Panel held with the finalists in addition to an open house, similar to
what was done seven years ago.
Chair Sisk stated that the Committee was on target to have a new General Manager

they were very impressed with what RTD has been able to achieve. She was asked the
one thing that made RTD so successful. While there really are a multiplicity of elements,
she believes the bottom line is sustained regional collaboration. She thinks RTD and the
Board can take a lot of pride in that collaboration.

XI.

 Meeting with Valley Metro from Phoenix, Arizona on Tuesday, August 18
Director Folska expressed her concern with the elevators at Denver Union Station (DUS)
being frequently out of service. She pointed out that individuals with service animals
cannot take an escalator; they need an elevator. She recognized that there have been
issues with those elevators since DUS opened. Interim General Manager Genova
acknowledged that elevators do break down from time to time. He plans to look into the
elevators at DUS to determine if there have been intermittent issues or more frequent
problems.
Chair Sisk noted that the escalators on the east side of DUS frequently seem to be in need
of repair. He thinks an important point being made is that RTD needs to be more attentive
to our passengers when there is an issue so our constituents are not inconvenienced.

Director Francone recognized Interim General Manager and Scott Reed, Assistant General
Manager for Communications, for the excellent video produced about RTD. She enjoyed if
very much and thought it was very well done.

G.

Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals

It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management
Committee that the Board of Directors approve the Interim General Manager’s goals for
2016 as defined in the attached General Manager’s Performance Evaluation Form.
Original Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to approve the
Interim General Manager’s Goals for 2016.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Anderson noted that the full Board had
received the minutes from the General Manager
Oversight and Performance Management Committee
Meeting held on August 4, 2015 where Director
Menten’s proposed changes were thoroughly
discussed. She explained that the structure of having
core and task goals was created in response to the
State Legislature’s unhappiness in how a previous
General Manager’s contract and employment
compensation where managed. The State Legislative
Audit Committee said the Board should not blur the
relationship between base salary and incentive pay by
providing additional compensation to the General
Manager for performing functions, carrying out tasks or
achieving performance goals that could be considered
standard performance expectations or core functions of
the job. She explained that out of this the core goals
were developed.
Director Anderson reiterated that the core goals are tied
to the General Manager job description. When the
Board hired Dave Genova as the Interim General
Manager the job description was not altered. Since the
job description did not change, it is Director Anderson’s
belief that Interim General Manager Genova should be
able to rely upon the current job description and core
goals in order to fulfill his Interim duties.
Director Anderson acknowledged that Director Menten
has said the core goals are stale, which may be a point
for further conversation; however, the Board is in the

process of hiring a new General Manager and part of
that process will be re-evaluating the job description
and core goals. Director Anderson recommends
waiting to update the job description and core goals
during the process of hiring a new General Manager.
She believes this is about fairness to Interim General
Manager Genova to not change the rules in the middle
of the game.
Director Anderson asked the Board to also approve the
task goals as recommended. These goals were
discussed and vetted at the Committee Meeting. She
stated that 2016 will be a landmark year for RTD and
the focus should be on our new transit lines and getting
it right.
Director Folska asked for a point of clarification. She
noted that Director Anderson referred to changing the
rules on Interim General Manager Genova. She believes
that what the Board is voting on this evening does not
change the rules in the middle of the game as these are
goals for 2016. The goals for 2015, which Interim
General Manager will be evaluated against at the end of
this year, were already approved in 2014. She asked if
it was correct that these goals are for the 2016 years.
Chair Sisk stated that was correct.
Motion to Amend
Core Goal 1:

Director Menten made the motion to amend core goal 1
to read as follows under Exceeded Expectations:
Meets Achieved Goal criteria in all areas including both
of the following:
 Achieves 90% or more of RTD Board-approved
performance measures;
 Provides outstanding and noteworthy service for
major RTD-supported special events,
conventions, 16th Street Mall events, Broncos
Ride, etc.
Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Francone asked Director Anderson to reread
the portion of her comments related to the State
Legislature regarding certain measurable goals.
Director Anderson stated the Board should not blur the
relationship between base salary and incentive pay by
providing additional compensation to the General
Manager for performing functions, carrying out tasks or
achieving performance goals that could be considered
standard performance expectations or core functions of
the job. Hence the core goals were developed and tied
to the job description for the General Manager.

Motion to Amend
Core Goal 2:

Director Menten made the motion to amend core goal 2
to read as follows under Exceeded Expectations:
Meets Achieved Goal criteria in all areas including one
of the following: 1) Displays exceptional leadership
skills as evident by the agency being called upon to
address national transportation industry issues; 2)
Recognized both locally and nationally as being clear
and transparent in agency operations.

AND
Receives a 65% approval rating from a confidential
employee survey.
Director Lubow seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Director Menten feels the current measures are really
based on external measures. She wants to ensure the
new General Manager understands it is important we
received feedback from our employees. She feels that
based on the survey that was done this year 65% is
not too much of a stretch and this will give the
employees a sense that their opinion is important.
Director Tobiassen said in in his experience surveys are
something done frequently but they should be used to
measure improvement from one year to the next. He is
concerned that this will change an employee survey
from something people can answer honestly to
something political. If there is a General Manager that
the Union does not like they can lobby for their
members to give a low score or vice-versa. He stated
that the Agency needs an employee survey that is fair,
unbiased and gives a scientific view of the temperature
of the employees.
Director Anderson thinks this is a classic example of
blurring the lines between what a General Manager
should be doing as part of his every day job and then
awarding him for doing it.
Director Folska said she appreciates the sentiments of
Directors Tobiassen and Anderson; however, the
process for evaluating the General Manager is based on
a multiplicity of factors. She reiterated that the most
important asset the Agency has is its human capital,
followed by the constituents. She recall in going to a
General Manager Executive Search Listening Session
with the employees that some areas of a 70% turnover
rate. She stated that she will be supporting this
because the employees are RTD’s best asset.

Director Walker stated he will not be supporting this
motion even though he does think it is very important
that the employees’ voices are heard. He does not
think the measure for this goal should have such a
heavy weight on subjective criteria. He thinks that the
measures in place now are objective and from people
who are not directly impacted by the decisions made by
the General Manager, some of which may be unpopular
but necessary. He does not want to put the General
Manager in a situation where he or she is being
measured by politics.
Director James believes this could result in flawed
criteria where the survey is reduced to a popularity
contest versus substantive feedback. He is also
concerned that this is being brought forward so late in
the process. This amendment has not been vetted
through the General Manager and Oversight Committee
thoroughly like the other goals have been.
Director Solano thinks this goal would be an
encouragement for a new General Manager to engage
with the employees. He shared that during his listening
session many employees did not know who the General
Manager was and were appalled to hear the amount of
money a General Manager makes. He believes the
person on the very bottom is just as important as the
person of the very top so he will be voting yes.
Director Francone shared that when she was out
campaigning she was really impressed with the people
she talked to who had been employees for 10, 30 or
even 30+ years. She was very impressed with an
Agency that could retain employees for that period of
time. She does not think some of the Board members
give enough credit to the employees. She believes they
would be giving an honest answer, not a political one.
She feels if there is such negativity from the employees
then it behooves the General Manager to change that.

She thinks this is an important component of the 2016
goals.
Director Hoy stated that it is not the percent of
employees that like the General Manager that is
important. It is really the change in that percentage.
He said that the Board does not know what the number
is today so the Board cannot really say that 65% is a
good goal. He thinks the only way this works is to
consider it later when a baseline has been established.
Chair Sisk thinks it is a valid concern about how the
Board gauges the employees’ response to the General
Manager but agrees this is food for thought in
subsequent years.

Motion to Amend
Core Goal 4:

Director Menten made the motion to amend core goal 4
to read as follows under Exceeded Expectations:
Meets Achieved Goal criteria plus two of the following:
1) The District is lauded both locally and nationally for
its SBE/DBE/WIN Programs; 2) Base system and
FasTracks DBE/SBE/WIN goals are achieved; 3)

Innovative programs in this area are pursued and
implemented; 4) FTA Triennial Reviews focusing on
these areas are exceptional; 5) Creates model and
implements structure to encourage graduation from the
DBE/SBE program; 6) Implements a hiring program for
people with disabilities.
Director Folska seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Director Menten indicated that her interpretation of the
General Manager contract is that these goals are used
in determining how much of a bonus the General
Manager receives; it does not affect the General
Manager’s salary. She asked if that was correct. Paula
Perdue, Executive Director to the Board, stated that
was incorrect. RTD does not pay the General Manager
bonuses. The Board can elect to award the General
Manager with a discretionary performance payout.
Director Menten asked if it was accurate that the last
discretionary payout made to the General Manager was
about $25K. Chair Sisk said that was the correct
amount.
Director Menten noted that if these amendments are
made then the Board would be asking the new General
Manager to perform at a level above General Manager
Washington, which she does not think is bad. She
believes now is a good time to make the changes
before there is a new General Manager.
Director Anderson thinks the idea of creating a model
and implementing a structure to encourage graduation
from the DBE/SBE program is great. She would like to
see people graduate and become bigger and better
businesses; however, the General Manager has no
control over the business plans of our DBE/SBE
contractors. Also, there is additional oversight to these
programs from CDOT and the City of Denver.

Director James thinks it is too late in the game to be
considering something like this. He said that however
much he agrees that pursuing this is a good idea it does
not belong in the goals this specifically.

Motion to Amend
Task Goal 1:

Director Menten made the motion to amend task goal 1
to read as follows under Exceeded Expectations:
Meets Achieved Goal criteria in all areas plus any one
of the following:
 Improves Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fares
Program distribution channels; OR
 Achieves a fiscally sustainable low-income fare
program; OR
 Implements a third party parking pilot program;
OR
 Revenue (excluding sales and use tax and
grants) exceeds the 2016 forecast by 5%; OR
 Receives a new capital grant award
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Tobiassen stated that he would be voting no.
He said that much of the decision to fund a fiscally
sustainable low-income fare program comes back to the
Board. It really depends on how much the Board is
willing to take from one area to give to the program.
He does not feel this is something the General Manager
can control.
Director Hoy reminded everyone that there is a task
force currently working on this issue. He thinks it
would be nice to let them do their due diligence and
come back to the Board with a recommendation. He
believes this will work itself out as the dialog continues.

There was no Old Business.

XVI. New Business
Director Lubow mentioned that there had been several very long meetings this month.
She pointed out that during the Executive Committee Meeting there was some discussion
that the meetings are too long; however, she is concerned that RTD is moving into an
incredibly busy year next year with the work already starting. To her what is better than
saying the meetings are too long is to ask how to deal with the work coming the Board’s
way. She suggested that if there is a huge amount of work for one week perhaps the
Board should think about the idea of having another meeting. She stated that she wants
to get the work done.
Director Menten agreed with Director Lubow. She felt the Board was really short changed
on the pass program discussion last week and it was just kicked down the road to the
Study Session. The Board needs to make sure they are doing the right things as elected
officials.
Director Menten shared with the Board that she had been receiving communications from
a woman, Amanda Chilton, who had been suspended from RTD property for trespassing.
She noted that Ms. Chilton was asking the Board and RTD for specific information. These
questions centered on incident reports and access to records. Chair Sisk stated that it is
terribly important that the Board does not become involved in a criminal process. Director
Menten said she would take her questions offline for John Tarbert, Acting Assistant
General Manager for Safety, Security and Facilities.
