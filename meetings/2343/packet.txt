Approval of the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE)

Directors (“Board”) increase the authority granted to the General Manager or designee to
enter into all contracts, real property transactions and intergovernmental agreements for
the North Metro Rail Line Project by $56 million to a total authorization of $689.8 million.
This authority shall include the ability to negotiate and execute all contracts; work orders;
change orders and contract modifications; agreements for the acquisition and conveyance
of property interests; and intergovernmental agreements that are necessary or advisable to
complete the North Metro Rail Line within the scope of the North Metro Rail Line Project
budget. This action is consistent with previous board actions and the 2015 Annual
Program Evaluation (APE).
D.

Approval of 2016 - 2021 Strategic Budget Plan

of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to execute a contract
with BYD Motors, Inc. for the supply of 36 – 45’ mall shuttle buses and associated spare
components in an amount not to exceed $27,100,000.

F.

Sponsorship Naming Rights Agreement

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the General
Manager or his designee be authorized to enter into an agreement with the University of

RTD would receive $905,000.00 in the first agreement year with a 5% escalation factor
for each contract year through year five, with the right to mutually extend this agreement
for an additional five years, also with a 5% escalation factor each year. Over the initial
five-year period of the contract, RTD would receive a gross amount of $5,000,696.00. It
is further recommended that the revenue from this contract be placed in the Board Reserve
Account, which gives the Board flexibility in determining its specific usage.
G.

Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals

B. CAC
Cyndi Stovall, Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Co-Chair, shared that the CAC
hosted a General Manager Executive Search public hearing where they discussed
broadly the traits that they would like to see in a new General Manager as well as
areas of focus. She noted that a summary of the meeting was provided to the
General Manager Executive Search Committee. She shared that the CAC also met
with Brian Welch, Senior Manager of Planning Technical Services, to provide
feedback on the RTD Strategic Plan.
Cyndi Stovall informed the Board that many of the CAC members volunteered at
the recent Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility event. Their next work session is
scheduled for August 19 where they will begin their ambassador training for the
2016 Grand Openings as well as discuss service integration. She said the CAC
hopes to find new ways to help the Board. They will continue to discuss what is
next in a broader agency-wide focus.
Committee Chair Hoy noted that much of the feedback from the CAC and Board
two-on-ones was related to what would be next for the CAC.
Director Folska suggested that the CAC consider reaching out to and mentoring the
youth in the District when considering how to expand their scope of service to
RTD. She thinks RTD’s future is in the hands of our children. She hopes RTD can
be more inclusive in getting their input in how RTD can meet their needs in the
future.
Committee Chair Hoy thanked Cyndi Stovall for her update.

C. Recommended Actions

• Approval of the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE)
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors approve the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The
APE provides a comprehensive financial blueprint for all FasTracks capital
projects completed, underway or planned through the year 2019.
Director Deadwyler made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the August 18,
2015 Board Meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs,
reminded the Board that staff gave an update on the Annual
Program Evaluation (APE) during the July FasTracks
Monitoring Committee Meetings. He stated there have been
no changes to the APE since then. Staff added a
supplemental chart to address the questions from the Board
about what constituted miscellaneous project costs.
Committee Chair Hoy asked if staff would be providing the
whole APE documentation at some point in the future. Rick
Clarke stated that there is a chart that shows the revenues
versus costs. Staff plans to provide the cash flow information
supporting the chart to the Board by early next week.
Director Folska inquired about the marketing and
communications budget included in the APE for the 2016
Grand Openings. Rick Clarke explained that based on previous
Openings staff has budgeted approximately $5 million.
Chair Sisk thanked staff for the information. He noted that in
the list of projects to be completed by 2019 the Longmont
Station was listed. He explained that while there is funding
for the station the City of Longmont has asked RTD to delay
funding as there are some outstanding questions about where
the station will ultimately be located. He wanted to clarify the
reason behind the delay as there has been some consternation
that RTD does not have the money.
Director Bagley inquired if the money that was programmed
for the Longmont Station would go back into the FasTracks
Internal Savings Account (FISA). Rick Clarke said no; the

Motion:

6.A

Director Bagley noted that the North Metro Rail Line budget
increased $48.8 million or 8.8%. He understands that much
of this funding will be coming from the FasTracks Railroad
Relocation Right-of-Way Contingency fund but asked if staff
could explain why the extra funding is needed. Rick Clarke
stated that there are three major reasons for the increase in
funding needed for the North Metro Rail Line: (1) additional
hazardous material costs, (2) negotiations with adjacent
property owners who were impacted and (3) additional
operations and maintenance costs that were identified as RTD
began working more with Denver Transit Partners.
Director Bagley asked if these transfers would jeopardize any
other FasTracks projects currently under construction. He also
wanted to confirm that none of the funding would come from
the FISA. Rick Clarke explained that the funds being used
were largely contingency funds set aside early in the program.
He said that as RTD moves forward with the completion of
many of the corridors staff feels we are beyond a lot of the
risk that the funding was set aside to address. He stated that
no funding for the increase in the North Metro Rail Line costs
would be coming from the FISA.
Director Bagley asked how much the North Metro communities
were contributing both for the total North Metro Rail Line cost
as well as the increases. He also asked if the contribution was
in-kind or cash. Rick Clarke stated that they were contributed
the 2.5% required local match in in-kind contributions.
Director Bagley wondered if the approval of the APE required
an affirmative vote of 10 since it is a fixed guideway corridor.
Marla Lien stated that this action did not require a vote of 10.
She said he was referring to the next item related to the
General Manager’s Fiscal Authority for the North Metro Rail
Line.
Director Lubow asked if staff had a summary of the FISA.
She wonders if it is being accumulated in the amount we
hoped. Committee Chair Hoy pointed out that the FISA’s
balance is reported every month as part of the Monthly
Packet Pg. 7

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 4, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

money will remain available for the project. He explained that
staff would actually like to begin the Longmont Station
because $17 million can get eroded away very quickly when
looking at inflation.

6.A

Director Anderson shared that there has been a discussion in
her community related to value engineering on the Eagle P3
Project. She said that some members of her community
believe that the real-time train information at the platforms
was removed as part of the value engineering. Rick Clarke
stated that he too had heard that rumor but it is incorrect.
Staff is actually working with DTP so their information can be
integrated into our system. He acknowledged that there were
really very few cuts made on the Eagle project. He believes
the public will really like what they see when it opens next
year.
Director Folska wonders if the real time information is
accessible for people with no or low vision. Rick Clarke said
that it was his understanding that there are auditory
announcements in addition to a video messaging sign. He said
that he would confirm that information. Director Folska also
asked for information on the party responsible for ensuring
that it meets ADA standards.

• Updated Authorization of Fiscal Authority to the General Manager for the
North Metro Rail Line Project
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors (“Board”) increase the authority granted to the General
Manager or designee to enter into all contracts, real property transactions
and intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Rail Line Project by
$56 million to a total authorization of $689.8 million. This authority shall
include the ability to negotiate and execute all contracts; work orders;

and conveyance of property interests; and intergovernmental agreements

consistent with previous board actions and the 2015 Annual Program
Evaluation (APE).
Motion:

Director Solano made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the August 18, 2015
Board Meeting.

Discussion:

Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs,
explained that this Board action is in conjunction with the
approval of the Annual Program Evaluation (APE). In the
previous action the Board authorized the additional funding for
the North Metro Rail Line. This action provides the contractual
authority to the General Manager that goes along with the
budget authority that was already approved.
Director Bagley asked if this action would require an
affirmative vote of at least 10 members of the Board for
approval. Marla Lien explained that she wanted to check the
language of the statute. She said that for a vote to move the
item from committee the Board would only need 8 affirmative
votes. She stated that she would confirm the number required
for approval of the Board before the August 18, 2015 Board
Meeting.

Nadine Lee, Engineering Project Manager for US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT),
introduced Svetlana Grechka, Senior Engineer, who reviewed a Power Point
Presentation with the Board that is available in the August 4, 2015
FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet. Svetlana Grechka noted

6.A

Svetlana Grechka shared that some of the current activities are:
 Phase I
o BRT platforms alteration is in progress
o BRT canopies installation ongoing
o On-call contract to do final station improvements
o In-house design of station name and direction signs underway
o Punch list walkthrough has started
 Phase II
o Traffic was switched to newly installed Westbound pavement
o Construction of McCaslin bridge is ongoing
o Eastbound mainline paving underway
 Programmatic BRT
o Coordinate civil work at BRT stations and security upgrades
o RTD Board approved proposed US 36 BRT service plan – July
28, 2015
She said that the next steps are:
 Strategic public outreach – throughout 2015
 Installation of station canopies and Public Information Displays –
summer/fall 2015
 Boulder Junction at Depot Square Open House – August 13, 2015
 BRT vehicles delivered – mid-October, 2015
 BRT stations ribbon cutting – TBD
 BRT revenue service – January 17, 2016
Director Folska expressed her appreciation of the attention to detail in the
accessibility at all of the stations as well as moving the October openings to
January. She asked if the stations would include real-time information that
was accessible to those with low or no vision. Nadine Lee said that was
something staff was working on currently. She explained that her team was
having discussions with IT about how to get that information to people who
are visually impaired but have not yet come up with a solution.
Director Folska noted the bike lane seemed very large at 10 feet. She
wondered what the standard minimum width for a traditional bike lane might
be. Nadine Lee explained that it was a bikeway, which is an off street/road
path. She stated that 10 feet is typically standard for a bikeway; however,
most bikeways do not have shoulders and the US 36 bikeway has 2 foot
shoulders on each side.

that there had been many exciting milestones with Phase I 100% completed
and Phase II nearly 85% complete.

6.A

Director Menten asked for the members of the Transit and Accessibility Task
Force. She wondered if Jadwiga Brown, who is an Orientation and Mobility
Specialist for the State of Colorado, was on the Task force. Director
Menten thought it would be beneficial for Ms. Brown to be informed of the
Task Force as she helps people with disabilities learn to use public transit.
Nadine Lee said that she was not sure of all the members but she would get
back to Director Menten with the information.
Chair Sisk thanked staff for their presentation and enthusiasm. He is very
excited about the progress. He shared that he attended a groundbreaking
for the new Google facility in Boulder. He stated that one of the key
components of picking the location at Boulder Junction was transportation.
He reminded the Board that the Westminster Groundbreaking event would
be tomorrow. Chair Sisk thanked staff for working with the stakeholders to
move the ribbon cutting ceremonies to January.
Director Tobiassen shared that the Transit and Accessibility Task Force was
a group stated about 6 years ago that meets at the RTD Administrative
Offices every month. He said this Task Force is strongly supported by staff
and people from all over the District have been participating. He encouraged
the Directors to attend an upcoming meeting.
Director Bagley commented that similar to Google, the reason Charles
Schwab located to Lone Tree and DeVita to Downtown was because of
access to public transportation. He thinks the increase in businesses
relocating to the Metro area is great.
Committee Chair Hoy pointed out that there is also a Google facility in
Thornton. Google has generously donated one of its managers to sit on the
Board of the Smart Commute Metro North. He recognized that they are very
interested in transportation. Committee Chair Hoy asked when the diverging
diamond would be open to the public. He has looked at the diagrams on the
internet but thinks it will be interesting to see how it works once opened.
Nadine Lee stated it would be done by the end of the year.

E. Other Matters
Director Anderson said she wanted to explain her no vote on the Board action to
increase the Fiscal Authority granted to the General Manager for the North Metro

Director Menten noted the South West Transit Association award that RTD
won in recognition of our ADA design elements. She asked if staff could
provide some examples of what had been done to improve accessibility.
Svetlana Grechka stated that the location of the braille signs is an example.
Staff worked with the Transit and Accessibility Task Force to establish a
common location for these signs at all stations.

Rail Line. She is still concerned about the cost per rider for that project as well as
the commitment from the local governments. She asked staff to provide her with a
breakdown of the local contribution to the project.
Committee Chair Hoy recognized that Adams County planned to contribute $3
million into further study on the completion of the Line. He asked staff to provide
additional information on the other contributions.

C. Updates

• Local Government Update - CRL Associates
Roger Sherman, CRL, stated that tomorrow, August 5, is the day that
candidates can officially pull petitions and start collecting signatures for the
November election. He said August 25 is the last day that petitions can be
turned in to be certified. He shared that CRL has begun creating candidate
profiles for those that they know are running. CRL will provide the Board
with a full and final list after August 25 when the candidates have been
certified.
Roger Sherman informed the Board that he took a tour with the Office of
Economic Development and International Trade (OEDIT) of the East Rail Line
and Denver International Airport Hotel. He explained that Jeff Kraft from the
FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee works for the OEDIT and
coordinated a tour for their office. He said there were about thirty people
from OEDIT along with Consuls from Japan, Mexico and Canada. He
thought the tour allowed for some great interaction on behalf of RTD.
Roger Sherman shared that tomorrow the Metro Mayors Caucus will be
meeting. He was hoping to report that Senator Bennet was in town to talk
about transportation funding but at the last minute was unable to attend.
He anticipates they will reschedule the discussion and will keep the Board
informed.

• State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs

Jenifer Brandeberry noted that since this is a non-election year the general
assembly are either taking time off or attending conferences. There will be
several more Transportation Legislation Research Committee meetings in the
fall. She believes that transportation will be a big issue during the upcoming
legislative session.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs, informed the Board that the Senate is still
in Washington, D.C. They decided to stay an extra week as opposed to the
House that is already on break. He said that as everyone knows at this
point the Senate was trying to be very ambitious with a long-term, six year
transportation funding plan but that did not happen as the House had no
intention of doing a long term bill.
Mike Dino explained that the biggest issue still to be resolved is how to fund
a bill that goes beyond three months. The House Republicans still want to
use a one-time repatriation tax but the Senate Republicans do not agree;
they would like to pay for a bill through the General Fund and offset it by
other tax measures. Mike Dino stated that there is no real plan to move
forward.
Mike Dino said that early in the year the House and Senate were working
together and it appeared that Fiscal Year 2016 appropriations might happen
before October; however, that is no longer the case. Mike Dino believes
there will be a continuing resolution. He noted that one small piece of good
news is that the Senate appropriations bill did have good funding increases
for transportation. He hopes there is renewed vigor in trying to solve their
issues when the House and Senate get back from Labor Day.
Director Folska wondered if Mike Dino had a sense if a broader definition of
Bus Rapid Transit would be included in a new transportation bill. Mike Dino
shared that Squire Patton Boggs was able to present a new BRT definition to
Senators Gardner and Bennet; however, rules imposed by Senator Leader
McConnell were that there would only be two amendments to the bill. He
knows that they will continue to lobby for those changes to be an
amendment and Squire Patton Boggs will continue to lobby that as well.

Jenifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry~McKenna, reminded the Directors that the

a very challenging transportation funding time. She thanked the Directors
that attended the breakfast.

C. Updates

• Real Property Policy Update
Kate Iverson, Manager for Transit Oriented Development, reviewed the Real
Property Policy Update presentation included in the Planning and
Development Committee agenda packet for August 4, 2015. She noted that
the intent of the presentation is to gather feedback from the Board before
writing an updated policy. The presentation covered the following areas:
 Current RTD Policies Governing Real Property
 Proposed Resolution

Property
 Proposed Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Joint Development or
Acquisition of Excess Property
 Proposed Unsolicited Proposal Review Process
 Proposed Excess Property Review Process

6.C

Director Menten asked for some examples of grants of property interests.
She felt that the $1 million General Manager’s delegated contracting
authority is a considerable amount of money to give up Board approval.
Kate Iverson pointed out that she could not answer this question on the
excess property side; however, under the Joint Development policy, for
example, these are surface parking lots that could be converted into a
structure parking lot and development. She noted that the land value for
most of these properties is over $1 million and that the number was chosen
because it is an existing contractual authority. She said that staff could
refine that number. Marla Lien, General Counsel, gave the example of
Denver Union Station and Ft. Lupton, where RTD leased the property. She
added that the Board has given this level of approval for all the corridors.
Director Menten asked about the timeline of the Real Property Policy for
Board approval. Kate Iverson said that staff would like to have a proposed
recommended action by September or October.
Director Lubow wondered if any specifics could be added to the policy for
items that would fall under the $1 million level that may have some political
sensitivity. She mentioned fracking as an example. Kate Iverson replied
that she would hesitate at naming specific instances in policy. She noted
that the current practice when a sensitive matter arises is to reach out to the
Director of the specific District and update the Board. Marla Lien reiterated
that these types of grants of property interests are all for the benefit of RTD.
For example, RTD might enter an agreement with Xcel Energy because RTD
needs power in our area. She noted that easements to somebody else do not
fall under this category. Director Lubow said this was not clear to her from
the presentation. Marla Lien added that maybe when writing the policy the
phrase “benefitting RTD” should be “benefitting RTD’s property”.
Director Lubow asked if $1 million or less would always be a remnant of a
property since it is the amount delegated to the General Manager. Rick
Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, used the example
of the remnants of a Park-n-Ride that was sold to the contiguous car
dealership for $1.2 million as frame of reference. He added that there could
be smaller pieces of land valued under $1 million that may not be remnants.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 4, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

During the Proposed Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of Excess
Property discussion, Kate Iverson noted that among the exceptions requiring
Board approval were:
 The dedications of Right of Way (ROW) to local jurisdictions
 The grants of property interest with a fair market value under the
General Manager’s delegated contracting authority, which currently is
$1 million per Resolution 19, series of 2007
 Non-permanent grants of property interest (for example, licenses,
temporary constructions easements, short-term leases).

6.C

Director Francone asked for clarification on the General Manager’s authority
when it comes to dedications of Right of Way to local jurisdictions. Kate
Iverson replied that the General Manager does have delegation under the
authorization of an existing infrastructure line. She pointed out that the
resolutions are silent when it comes to the redevelopment we are seeing
around the stations and how the public could access them, since most of
the stations are in industrial areas. Marla Lien noted that the Board has
given the General Manager blanket authority for disposal dedications and
easement for all the rail lines: West, East, North Metro, Northwest, I-225,
and Southeast Extension. The one that is currently being discussed will
mostly apply to Park-n-Rides. Director Francone wondered if the General
Manager had a dollar amount authority. Marla Lien clarified that the General
Manager has authority up to $250,000 for other property, not the corridors.
Director Francone noted that she had issues with these items.
Director Walker asked if the General Manager’s authority to approve grants
of property interest could also include access and utility easements. Marla
Lien replied that was correct; however, one was capped by dollars and the
other by types of easement. The General Manager could award these grants
if it were to benefit RTD. Director Walker said that these types of
permissions were very similar to the ones he interfaces with on his day job
at Xcel Energy. He understands and agrees with the authorizations as
presented.
Committee Vice-Chair Folska asked for confirmation that the actual number
that the General Manager or his designee has for authorization is $250,000.
Kate Iverson confirmed that the number is limited to leases, not easements
or dispositions of property.
Committee Vice-Chair Folska wondered if staff could sell parking spaces
from a Park-n-Ride valued at less than $1 million without the Board taking
any action. Marla Lien said this scenario was possible depending if it is not
part of a Federal interest or an Environmental Impact Study (EIS). Bill Sirois
added that it depended if it was a joint development or an unsolicited
Packet Pg. 20

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 4, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Susan Altes, Senior Manager for Property, noted that the majority of
easements and small remnants RTD owns are of very low value and that
anything of interest would be over $1 million. Kate Iverson pointed out that
staff could find another number that would be more comfortable for the
Board while still having the flexibility to not bring every $20,000 action for
approval. Bill Sirois, Senior Manager for Transit Oriented Communities, told
the Board that staff could bring examples of transactions that have been
done in order to get a general sense of size and cost, among other variables.
Susan Altes added that the type of transaction (easement, disposition)
would be included.

proposal as the process for each one is different. David Genova, Interim
General Manager, pointed out that just because it is under the authority of
the General Manager does not mean that it will not be communicated to the
Board. He suggested adding a notification mechanism to the resolution
language.

Director James suggested adding to the flow chart referred to during the
presentation further information about the options available at each decision
point. He recognized this may get a little too much into the weeds.
Director Lubow expressed that she did not understand why RTD would use
sole source at all when all projects could be competed. Kate Iverson replied
that staff has made the specifications for sole source very narrow on
purpose. Marla Lien mentioned the Federal Center Station on the West line
and the Lincoln Station on the Southeast line as examples of sole source.
She noted that on the Federal Center Station RTD worked closely with St.
Anthony’s Hospital on the property for items like joint roads, upsized water
and sewer lines, etc. that would not have worked with any other entity.
She said that similar work happened at the Lincoln station where RTD and
the adjacent owners put in roads and a shared parking garage with condo
arrangements as well as wet and dry utilities. Director Lubow appreciated
the details. She expressed her concern that some developers would be
given preference, thus limiting competition. Marla Lien said that preference
would be given to those adjacent to RTD property in a sole source situation.
She reinforced that in order to execute the contract RTD would have to
benefit. David Genova explained that sole source is not the preferred
method of business, competition is; however, there are instances where it is
appropriate. Kate Iverson added that staff would like to be more
streamlined.
Director Francone asked if the terms “adjacent” and “contiguous” were
being used interchangeably. Kate Iverson clarified that the correct term
should be “contiguous” as it implies that the property touches RTD property.
Director Francone noted that adjacent has a different meaning to contiguous.
She believes contiguous makes sense for this discussion, adjacent does not.
Director Walker pointed out that property lines are what matter in the
conversation of contiguous property. He noted that in some state counties
the contiguous property may be across the road. He found it important to
Packet Pg. 21

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 4, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Vice-Chair Folska asked when RTD could utilize sole source for
Joint Development proposals. Kate Iverson replied that the buyer needs to
show that they are the only ones that can do what they are proposing to do,
the parcel has no ability for a stand-alone development and they must own
property contiguous to RTD property.

6.C

highlight in the discussion that these exchanges are for the benefit of RTD
and that the agency would not find itself burdened. He used the analogy of
neighbors where neither one could build a garden independently but together
they could in order to clarify the use of sole source.
Director Francone expressed her thanks to staff for all the clarifications and
all their work.

Bill Sirois, Senior Manager for Transit Oriented Communities, reviewed the
Transit Oriented Communities (TOC) Update presentation included in the
Planning & Development Committee agenda packet for August 4, 2015.
The presentation included an update on the Civic Center Transit District
Plan, Title VI Equity Analyses, the Welton Corridor Pilot, the Yale Station,
the Alameda Pilot Station, the Olde Town Transit Hub, Boulder Junction at
Depot Square, and Station Area Master Plans with an emphasis on the I25/Broadway Station Area Plan.
Director James thought that the update was a good outline of everything
that is going on.
Director Francone passed on comments from one of her constituents
regarding the Civic Center Transit District plan. She said the constituent
was concerned that the station will be under construction during winter as it
would make commuting even more difficult. Director Francone asked
regarding plans for the Mineral Station, which is not in her District but she
utilizes almost daily. Dave Genova, Interim General Manager, said that
construction on the Civic Center Transit District Plan was slated to start in
January. The construction company recommended starting construction in
the spring of 2016 instead of January so construction would happen
through one winter cycle instead of two. Bill Sirois added that the City of
Littleton just selected a consultant for the Mineral Station and he would
keep the Board updated of the progress.
Director Walker mentioned that he has attended various meetings on the I25 and Broadway Station Area plan. He is glad to see citizen participation.

• Northwest Area Mobility Study Update (No Attachment)
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager, gave an overview of the Northwest
Area Mobility Study (NAMS). He said NAMS started two and a half years
ago and that it included 5 components:
 Determine if the Northwest rail could be built in segments
 Determine the feasibility of a cost effective way to reach Longmont
via North Metro




Determine if some key corridors could benefit from Bus Rapid Transit
(BRT)
Determine what would be needed to complete the US-36 BRT
Evaluate options for reverse commute/HOV lanes on I-25

Chris Quinn reminded the Board that in June, 2014 they approved
Resolution 6 accepting the consensus statement of the NAMS stakeholders.
The consensus had 5 components. Chris Quinn continued by listing all the
components followed by an update from staff:
 Complete US-36 BRT – RTD is very close to opening US-36 BRT.
There are 3 principal elements that the stakeholders believe
necessary that will not be available on opening day: expansion of the
Broomfield Park-n-Ride, improvement to the pedestrian bridge across
the freeway at the Westminster station, and moving the Church
Ranch station platform closer to the parking lot. RTD is working with
the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) on the Church
Ranch station.
 Establishing arterial BRT in the Northwest area utilizing CO-119 from
Boulder to Longmont as the preferred corridor – RTD received a
Transportation Improvement Grant (TIP) from the Denver Regional
Council of Governments (DRCOG) of $1 million towards the
completion of the environmental analysis for this project. The hope is
to begin the environmental impact study, a 2 year process, early next
year and be ready to build by completion of study assuming there will
be funding available.
 Stakeholders’ concern on the reverse commute along I-25 – RTD is
working with CDOT to put out a scope of work. RTD hopes to put
together a feasibility/analysis study in collaboration with CDOT on
this issue if grant money is available.
 Completion of Northwest rail line beyond Westminster – Stakeholders
recognize that this will not be built tomorrow but ask that it remains
in the forefront for RTD. Stakeholders requested annual updates.
RTD is in the process of creating this year’s update. RTD is checking
in on an annual basis with BNSF, whose position has not changed so
far. RTD was actually informed that freight activity in the corridor
has increased.
Chris Quinn mentioned that TIP funding was awarded to a coalition
established to determine if BRT would be an option for Highway 7. He noted
that a discussion is beginning on a coalition to study the possibility of BRT
on US-287 from Longmont to US-36.
Director Menten asked about the sloped sidewalks at the Westminster
station and who would be responsible for the cost. Chris Quinn replied that

Director Tobiassen mentioned that he read in The Daily Camera about 2 antigrowth ballot initiatives for the November, 2015 elections in Boulder. He
wondered what that may do for the future needs to expand if growth is
slowed in the area. Chris Quinn noted that Boulder is the highest ridership
point for US-36, then Westminster. He said it would be hard to comment on
this issue yet but he reminded the Directors that Boulder has always had
tight growth control. Director Tobiassen said that these initiatives will be
interesting to follow.
Director James said that Director Tobiassen’s comments reminded him of
Boulder’s Danish Plan, which aimed to manage growth from 1976 until
1995. He believed this ordinance may have dealt with growth outside of
Boulder.

• Sponsorship Naming Rights Program Update
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, introduced
Adrian Mabry, Project and Contract Manager for Marketing. Together they
reviewed the RTD Sponsorship and Naming Rights Program Update
presentation included in the Planning & Development Committee agenda
packet for August 4, 2015. The presentation included a review of the
Naming Rights Program divided into two phases:
 Phase I – Research and Valuation Phase; completed in July 2013
 Phase II – Implementation of Marketing Plan and Program; ongoing.
Director Archuleta asked what the estimated sale price for naming rights
might be. Scott Reed replied that the range could include as much as a
whole rail line for $1 million a year down to specific stops, which would be
considerably less. He noted that once one of the bigger rail lines naming
rights get sold we could see more people with offers.

D. Other Matters
No other matters were presented.

stakeholders requested an elevator and stairway instead of the current ramp.
He added that RTD accepted responsibility. US-36 is the only FasTracks
corridor where RTD established a budget instead of a scope of work. He
pointed out this was one of the items that would not be finished before the
US-36 BRT opening.

B. Recommended Actions

• Approval of 2016 - 2021 Strategic Budget Plan
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors adopts the 2016-2021 Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP).
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the August 18, 2015
Board meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager for Finance and
Administration and Chief Financial Officer, introduced Jannette
Scarpino, Senior Manager for Budget and Financial Analysis.
Jannette Scarpino reminded the Directors that the Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) has been discussed in Committee meetings
since April, 2015. The Directors have seen two previous drafts
with early assumptions.
Janette Scarpino noted that the final version presented for
Committee approval today differs from the second draft in the
following aspects:
 Reduced grant revenue forecast based on better
information

Packet Pg. 27



Additional $3.1 million in revenue from a CMAQ grant
and an equal match
Building maintenance facilities deferred:
o Bus Maintenance Facility from 2018 to 2021
o Light Rail Maintenance Facility from 2017 to
2019
Projects deferred from 2016 to 2017

She briefly highlighted the exhibits included in the Approval of
2016-2021 SBP Board report as included in the Financial
Administration & Audit Committee agenda packet for August
11, 2015 as follows:
 Exhibit 1:
o Shows no service reductions and 10% fare
revenue increases in 2016 and 2019 as per
Board policy
o Assumes zero growth in ridership
o Operating expenses increasing at an average of
3.1% over the term per the Consumer Price
Index identified by Moody’s
o Diesel lock price of $2.23 per gallon with an
average 2.5% escalation over the term
o Gas price at $3.00 with an average 2.5%
escalation over the term
o Total project request of $700 million over the
period
o Board Appropriation Fund and Capital
Replacement Fund are funded at a minimum of
$3 million per year until a $30 million balance
per fund is achieved (estimated to be achieved
by 2019)
 Exhibits 2 and 3 are lists of planned Capital and
Operations & Maintenance projects
 Exhibit 4 is a list of deferred projects from 2016 to
2017 that totals $21 million
She noted a variety of factors that are out of the Agency’s
control that will impact the SBP. Among these are Sales and
Use Tax revenue, fuel cost, cost of materials, inflation, and
economic conditions. Staff will attempt to address these
factors when developing the 2016 budget.

Jannette Scarpino reiterated that the SBP is balanced.

6.D

Director Anderson said she was very impressed with the final
version of the SBP. She noted it was a fantastic list that
highlighted what we hope to accomplish in continuing to finish
FasTracks as well as provide good service and continue the
State of Good Repair. She added that it was very thorough
and a great effort at keeping track of asset management. She
wondered if the SBP would be published. Jannette Scarpino
replied that the Board Report is a public document.
Director Francone echoed Director Anderson’s comments.
She said she is constantly amazed at the work, effort and
detail that goes into the SBP. She noted that during the
committee meeting she will be voting no due to the number of
questions she has on the document. She will reach out to
staff for further conversation. She pointed out that the
increase in the Operations budget is tied to the CPI and
wondered what has been the increase of the Operations
budget historically. Her concern stems out of RTD’s move
from Capital Projects to Operations & Maintenance. Jannette
Scarpino replied that the Operations budget has stayed within
the CPI. The next step is to determine the budget target for
the departments. Heather Copp added that the opening of the
FasTracks corridors and the transition of operating costs were
reflected on the APE presented to the Board during the
FasTracks Monitoring Committee meeting on August 4, 2015.
Director Lubow thanked staff for the monumental task of
developing the SBP. She wondered if there was anything on
the SBP about low income pass program funding. Heather
Copp replied that it is not on the SBP as staff needs more
direction in order to move forward. It will be included in the
2016 budget or the 2017-2022 SBP. She added that there
will be a presentation on the Fare Study Pass Program during
the Operations and Customer Service Committee meeting.
Director Folska commented that the SBP is a dense piece of
work yet it is easy to listen to Jannette Scarpino explain it.
She recalled there being a sum of money to further study
Packet Pg. 29

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 11, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Jannette Scarpino added that the SBP will be challenged by
changing economic visions, unpredictability of consumer
spending behavior, possibly lower future forecast for Sales and
Use Tax, continued construction projects, shifting to an
Operations & Maintenance environment, continued cost
allocations to FasTracks operations, and more acute spending
on State of Good Repair.

6.D

Director Folska mentioned the purchase of electronic mall
buses that will be discussed during the Operations and
Customer Service Committee meeting that will follow the
Financial Administration and Audit committee. She wondered
what would happen if the City and County of Denver (Denver)
decided it does not want the mall shuttles on 16th Street.
Jannette Scarpino did not recall the details of the top of her
head but would get back to Director Folska with more
information. Dave Genova noted that the mall shuttle buses
proposed for purchase could drive on any street.
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning,
explained that there are plans to do an environmental and
preliminary engineering study for HWY 119 is programmed for
$3.5 million, with $1 million of that funding coming from the
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG). He
mentioned that the other project is the Denver Multimodal Plan
for $2 million, with $400 thousand in 2017 and in 2018 as
placeholder amounts to further that partnership. Staff would
come back to the Board before proceeding with the study.
Director Folska asked if Denver would contribute financially to
the study. Bill Van Meter replied that their financial
contribution will be much more significant than ours.
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications,
explained that the $15 million allocated to Communications is
for the re-assignation of employees back to the
Communications department from FasTracks Public
Information (PI) team. Director Folska asked if all FasTracks PI
employees and contractors would be absorbed by the base
program. Scott Reed clarified that only the RTD employees
currently assigned to various projects would come back to
Communications. He added that overall there is a net
decrease in employees.

C. Updates
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager for Debt and Investments, referred the
Directors to the Second Quarter 2015 Investment Report included in the
Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet for August 11,
2015. He noted that the Liquidity Tier and the Enhanced Cash Tier are
surpassing the benchmarks.
There was no further discussion on this item.

• June 2015 Monthly Financials Status Report
Doug MacLeod, Controller, reviewed the June 2015 Monthly Financials
Status Report as included in the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee agenda packet for August 11, 2015. He noted that all elements
(S&U Tax, Ridership, and Fare Revenue) are below the budget mark while
S&U is up compared to June 2014 and Year to Date 2014, Ridership is up
compared to June 2014 but below when compared to Year to Date 2014,
and Fare Revenue is below when compared to June 2014 but up when
compared to Year to Date 2014. He pointed out that the last page of the
report has an update on the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).
Staff will bring to the Board an in-depth update on the FISA during the
October Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting.
Director Folska asked staff to explain the increase of $16 million in S&U
Tax. Doug MacLeod replied that there has been a significant recovery from
the 2008 recession that started showing in 2013. He said the increase is
mainly from restaurants, car sales, and merchandisers/big box stores.
Director Folska wondered if any of the S&U Tax was related to tourism.
Heather Copp noted that when people have more discretionary income they
tend to eat out more. Director Folska added that Colorado enjoys a high rate
of employment as well.
Director Lubow wondered when RTD should start worrying about the
decreasing trend in ridership. She asked staff if there was a variance that
bothered them. Heather Copp replied that from a budget perspective
ridership has been lower than the forecast for the past several months.

Staff will continue to monitor the trends and take appropriate action to
adjust expenses as needed.

Director Lasater mentioned he has been in conversations with different
business partners about the 10% forecasted decrease in fuel prices. He said
that in his conversations with RTD staff they cannot say the decrease in
ridership is directly related to the decrease in fuel prices, though he sees an
assumptive aspect to it. He noted that this year most arrows on the
Monthly Financial Status have been red, compared to last year when they
were almost always green. He asked staff to keep monitoring the situation
as he does not like the downward trend. He added that if the revenue is
down the Strategic Budget Plan may not be funded.
Committee Chair Tobiassen pointed out that more people driving due to low
fuel prices could mean more congestion in the roads that may lead to more
people taking transit.

• Second Quarter 2015 Internal Audit Update
Ann Marie Isaac Heslop, Manager for Internal Audit, and Kevin Parker,
Senior Internal Auditor, pointed the Directors to the Second Quarter 2015
Internal Audit Update as included in the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee agenda packet for August 11, 2015. The report included
summary statements of the completed audits for Out of District Parking Fees
and HR Purchasing Card. It also included an update on the several Audits in
the final stages of completion.
Director Folska recalled hearing about discrepancies in fuel reimbursements
for Access-a-Ride providers. She asked what actions were taken in the
instances where the discrepancies where found. Kevin Parker replied that
RTD was overcharged about $5,000 in fuel. The management within RTD
went through all the invoices to find any errors. RTD did recover the money.
Internal Audit is working with RTD management to move towards an
environment that ensures those kind of errors do not occur.
Director Menten asked staff to share with the Board the discussion about
the Xerox handheld units for fare checks as discussed in the Financial
Administration and Audit pre-committee meeting. Kevin Parker explained

Director Bagley said that Heather Copp’s answer to Director Lubow was
great. He reminded the Directors that even though it is the middle of August
they are looking at the June report. He noted that more people are driving
due to lower gas prices. He pointed out that it would be helpful to see a
worst case scenario estimation on a month by month basis. Heather Copp
replied that she would be glad to make that type of estimation and bring it
back to the Board at the September Financial Administration and Audit
Committee meeting.

6.D

Director Folska mentioned there is a couple that lives in her District who
travel all over the system, including the airport. She was curious as to how
the machine will know what type of fare to charge and if the fare checks
happen only on the train or also on the bus. Bruce Abel said that the current
SmartCards are used on both bus and rail. In the bus, there is an interaction
with the operator, the passenger and the computer system. The operator
sets the route which determines the fare. On rail validators, the passenger
pushes a button to indicate which fare they will use. Director Folska asked
if the self-service validators have an audible feature. Bruce Abel replied that
they do, yet staff is looking for a more pleasant voice for the audible feature.
He offered to continue the conversation with Director Folska off line.
Committee Chair Tobiassen commended the Internal Audit team for stepping
up their authority and looking into cyber security. He noted that the
Strategic Budget Plan presented earlier during the meeting includes some
improvements to our security systems. He added that the Internal Audit
team is a key component for RTD’s cyber security.

D. Other Matters
No other matters were presented.

that the Motorola devices RTD was hoping to use are going to be
discontinued and no longer serviced. Xerox is reviewing RTD requirements
and researching opportunities that would serve the Agency’s needs. Bruce
Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, further explained that
the operating system the current handheld fare check machines use will not
be supported in 2016. Staff and Xerox are working on finding new
technology that would serve RTD now and in the long term. Director
Menten asked if Xerox would need to purchase the new machines in order
to fulfill their contract. Bruce Abel replied that is one of the options.

B. Recommended Actions

• Award Contract for the Supply of 36 Mall Shuttle Buses
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager, or his
designee, to execute a contract with BYD Motors, Inc. for the supply of 36
– 45’ mall shuttle buses and associated spare components in an amount not
to exceed $27,100,000.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the August 18, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations,
introduced Steve Gieske, General Superintendent of
Maintenance, and Lou Ha, Senior Equipment Engineer. He
reminded the Board that the current mall shuttles are between
14 and 15 years old, exceeding their useful life of 12 years.
There are 26 shuttles required for peak service. RTD has a
fleet of 38 shuttles, of which one has been permanently
retired due to frame fatigue and another half dozen that have
been identified with potential structural issues. Bruce Abel
noted that the cost of maintaining these vehicles is very high,
in-part due to the fact that the original manufacturer is no
longer in business. He gives the maintenance team credit for

Director Lasater left early.

6.E

Bruce Abel explained that the mall shuttle buses are very
unique in design because of their unique operating
environment. Such features include:
 45’ length due to the capacity needed to move people
along the mall
 Three extra wide passenger doors to expedite the high
volume of passenger boarding
 Right-hand drive for safety in a high pedestrian area
 Manual ramps for quick boarding and de-boarding of
mobility devices
Bruce Abel noted that the vehicles will have two ride heights.
One is a lower ride height for operation along the mall and the
other ride height is higher for operation along city streets to
and from the garage. He stated that this is not a feature
where just one corner of the bus will lower but the entire
chassis will change heights.
Bruce Abel highlighted that the mall shuttle really allows RTD
to intercept buses that come in from the North and South. He
recognized that the Board has heard a lot of conversation
about last mile solutions. He stated that the mall shuttle is the
ultimate last mile solution. Ridership on the mall shuttle is
approximately 45,000 riders per average weekday with an
average trip length of one-half mile. He compared this with
the average distance someone is willing to walk as part of
their trip, which is one-quarter and one-third of a mile.
Bruce Abel commented that there has been a lot of discussion
about the future of the mall shuttle along the 16th Street Mall
and concern over moving forward with procurement of the
mall shuttles. He shared that RTD has had numerous
conversations with the City of Denver (City) and everyone
recognizes the role that the mall shuttle plays in the
transportation environment. He stated if the mall shuttles are
removed from the 16th Street Mall that function will still need
to be fulfilled somewhere in Downtown, which would most
likely be along 15th and 17th Streets. Bruce Abel noted this
would have its own challenges which would need to be
addressed with the City. He said that RTD has received
confirmation from the City that we should move forward with
our procurement. Bruce Abel said that RTD staff continues to
have conversations with City as part of the visioning process
for the 16th Street Mall.
Packet Pg. 36

their ability to manufacture parts and their ingenuity in
ordering them from places like eBay and Amazon.

Bruce Abel reiterated that these vehicles would be able to
operate along the 16th Street Mall or 15th and 17th Streets due
to their dual ride height. He pointed out that the new mall
shuttles are also fully electric. He said some of the Board
members might remember the challenges faced in previous
attempts to procure new shuttles. He believes this was
actually very fortuitous for RTD. This delay allowed the
technology to advance so we can procure an entirely electric
bus. He said this supplier, BYD Motors (BYD), has been in
business for a number of years. It is a Chinese company that
is a very large supplier of vehicles overseas. Bruce Abel
believes that RTD will be receiving a superior product that is
very well suited to our operating environment as opposed to
one that we can make do with.
Director James agrees that the opportunity to wait to procure
the shuttles, even if it was forced upon us, was fortuitous
despite being a struggle. Director James asked for
confirmation that the shuttle is fully operational at both ride
heights. He also wondered when BYD could begin delivering
the vehicles. Steve Gieske stated that was correct; the
capacity of the shuttles did not change depending on the ride
height. He said that staff anticipated delivery of the pilot
vehicle in April with services vehicles being delivered by the
end of May.
Director Folska thinks it is incredibly exciting that the entire
mall shuttle fleet will be 100% electric. She believes it will be
helpful to evaluate how this will help in Colorado’s efforts to
reach our lower emissions requirement by somewhere around
2020 or 2030.
Director Francone inquired if her understanding that RTD
would have the largest number of BYD buses in-service was
correct. Bruce Abel stated in the United States that would be
correct. BYD entered the US market approximately 2-3 years
ago.
Director Francone asked for further explanation of the financial
impact to RTD. She wonders what new monies are being
requested by staff that was not already budgeted. Bruce Abel
explained that RTD’s contribution was previously budgeted.
The FASTER grant became available after approval of the
Amended Budget that will be added on top of what RTD
budgeted.

Director Lubow shared that former Boulder County
Commissioner Will Toor sent a letter to the Board indicating
that there is additional grant money that, theoretically, could
be used for electric buses. She wondered if this was
something staff had considered pursuing. Bill Van Meter,
Assistant General Manager of Planning, said he appreciates
the information that was provided by Will Toor. Since he
received the information he has begun to research the
opportunity and there might be some capacity for RTD to
pursue additional grant funds for the procurement. The grant
is an alternative fuels program funded by the Congestion
Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. He noted in
the past there were issues related to Buy American and other
FTA compliance issues but he wants to reexamine the grant
based on Mr. Toor’s suggestions. Director Lubow commented
that the Board’s approval this evening would not be impacted
by staff pursuing the grant as the Board was just approving
the contract with BYD. Bill Van Meter stated that was
correct.
Director Walker wondered how the weight of the new shuttles
compares to the shuttles we are operating today. He also
asked how long the shuttles can operate on the 16th Street
Mall between charges. Bruce Abel stated that the weight of
the shuttles was approximately equal; however, the new
shuttles have duallies on the rear which will distribute the
weight more equally to hopefully have less impact on the
travel path. He shared that several weeks ago staff was able
to test one of the BYD vehicles. He stated that it ran an 8hour duty cycle on both Saturday and Sunday without needing
to be recharged in between. Bruce Abel stated that staff has
also been evaluating BYD buses operating for Antelope Valley
Transit Authority. Staff feels very comfortably that the
vehicles can complete our duty cycle without the battery
needing to be charged. Steve Gieske commented that the
batteries could be recharged through inductive wave
recharging during service if needed. This is an expensive
charging method but staff does not believe it will be
necessary.
Director Walker shares that he knows people with the City of
Denver. It is his feeling that they want to keep our shuttle
whether the buses operate on or off the Mall. He thinks the
City will work with RTD to make sure our operations are

sustainable as well as functional. Bruce Abel said that staff
would continue to be engaged in conversations with the City.

Director Archuleta wondered the voltage of the batteries and if
the batteries were paired. He also wondered how long the
batteries would run before they needed to be recharged and
how long it took to recharge a battery. Lou Ha said that the
batteries were around 544 volts. Steve Gieske explained that
the batteries were paired but it was really more like a
capacitor than a standard battery. He stated that staff was
projecting the shuttles would travel 100 miles before the
batteries needed to be recharged, which is far beyond our
need. Batteries can be charged in approximately 3 to 5 hours.
Director Tobiassen commended the staff for their work on this
project. He is very impressed with the 12 year battery
warranty since that tends to be one of the weaknesses of the
technology. He stated that the fact that we were able to
switch from a carbon based fuel to electric buses is very
significant in the environmental movement. He suggested
that, even if it is not worthy of a press release, it needs a lot
of attention from the public.
Director Solano shared that he read an article in a magazine
about Long Beach Transit’s Chief Engineer being concerned
that the BYD buses were too heavy and would damage their
streets. He noted that we are already having this issue with
the granite pavers along the 16th Street Mall. He expressed
concern that these new buses might be heavier. Bruce Abel
restated that the BYD vehicles are the same weight as our
current mall shuttles. He pointed out that Long Beach just
purchased their vehicles and are operating with a much
heavier battery pack due to need.
Director Bagley pointed out that the batteries for the shuttles
needed to be charged; he wanted to be clear that there is still
some environmental impact.

Director Deadwyler asked if staff had ever considered an
electric wheelchair ramp so the drivers do not have to get in
and out of the vehicles. Steve Gieske explained that there
have been electric ramps on previous mall shuttles but the
operators do not like them; they prefer to get out as it is
quicker to operate a manual ramp. Bruce Abel noted that it
also allows for the driver to interact with the customer to find
out their destination.

6.E

Director Hoy inquired if we already had the capability of
charging the buses overnight or if we would need
infrastructure improvements. Bruce Abel explained that there
would need to be infrastructure modifications but this had
been included in the budget for the project. It was also one of
the considerations when evaluating between the electric
shuttles and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles as
modifying a facility for CNG would be more expensive.
Committee Chair Anderson shared that she was recently
Downtown on a Sunday when the mall shuttles were
operating on 15th and 17th Streets. She stated that she is
convinced some major changes would need to happen for her
to consider this as a permanent solution. Committee Chair
Anderson expressed her enthusiasm over the new buses,
particularly when she has seen mirrors fall off and the drivers
have to stick them back on.
Director Folska wondered if there would be any issues with
the batteries operating in sub-zero temperatures. Steve Gieske
explained that there is a battery management system that will
help cool the batteries in summer and heat them in winter. He
said they have been running vehicles with similar batteries in
the Midwest and there have been no issues.
Director Solano expressed concern that we were defeating the
purpose of having electric buses by using a diesel engine to
heat and cool the batteries as he read about other agencies
doing. Steve Gieske explained that those were auxiliary
heaters which were very different from the battery
management systems that would be on our shuttles. Director
Solano stated that was different from what he heard but
would take the conversation offline.

Director Menten expressed concern that the shuttles would be
nearly silent since they are cleaner and quieter. She wondered
if there was any consideration for artificial noises since the
shuttles would be operating in an area with such high
pedestrian activity. Bruce Abel stated that staff has very real
safety concerns. He said that something will be done so
people know the bus is coming. That is something staff is
working on with BYD and the Downtown Denver community.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the General Manager or his designee be authorized to enter into an
agreement with the University of Colorado (CU) for the sponsorship naming
rights on the A Line and an exterior advertising position on the Flatiron Flyer
line for a five-year period, with a mutually agreed upon right to extend this
agreement for an additional five years. Under the terms of the agreement,
RTD would receive $905,000.00 in the first agreement year with a 5%
escalation factor for each contract year through year five, with the right to
mutually extend this agreement for an additional five years, also with a 5%
escalation factor each year. Over the initial five-year period of the contract,
RTD would receive a gross amount of $5,000,696.00. It is further
recommended that the revenue from this contract be placed in the Board
Reserve Account, which gives the Board flexibility in determining its specific
usage.
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the August 18, 2015 Board
Meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications,
stated that he was very pleased with how this sponsorship
developed. He recognized Todd Parker from William Morris
Endeavor/IMG (WME/IMG) and Ken McConnellogue from the
University of Colorado (CU). He said that Mr. McConnellogue
had been instrumental throughout the negotiation process.
Scott Reed believes this is a very good partnership. He can
think of few organizations that he would rather partner with.
Director Menten asked for the estimated cost to RTD for the
sponsorship. Scott Reed said that staff does not have a
definitive amount; however, RTD will receive $450K up-front
from CU in 2015 which will be used to cover our costs for
materials, wrapping of vehicles, etc. Adrian Mabry, Marketing
Project and Contract Manager, explained that this is a unique
Packet Pg. 41

• Sponsorship Naming Rights Agreement

6.E

Director Menten noted that WME/IMG will receive an annual
commission for this agreement. She wonders if they do any
legwork after the deal has been signed or if they receive a
commission without doing much. Scott Reed stated that
WME/IMG has done the legwork in identifying sponsors and
negotiating with the sponsor; WME/IMG is fulfilling their
responsibility under the contract approved by the Board three
years ago.
Chair Sisk thanked Ken McConnellogue and everyone at CU
that worked with RTD on this agreement. He also thanked
WME/IMG for their continued work. He thinks that all parties
did a great job putting this together. Chair Sisk believes this is
a great partnership to start the naming rights. He suggested
that perhaps the Boulder Junction even on Thursday afternoon
might be a great opportunity to show our partnership on the
Flatiron Flyer.
Marla Lien, General Counsel, pointed out to the Board that this
will be the first time RTD has dealt with another governmental
entity in a five year advertising contract; typically we enter
into agreements with governmental entities for things like
maintenance, construction, etc. Since CU is a governmental
entity the contract will be subject to appropriations by their
Board annually. She explained that there is a risk that the
funds will not be appropriated one year, in which case RTD
would need to find another sponsor and remove CU’s
advertising. She said that she does not think this is a major
concern but wanted the Board to be aware as we have not
done something like this before.
Director Archuleta wondered if there was any conflict between
this sponsorship and our advertising contract with Lamar.
Marla Lien explained that this was for naming rights of a line
as opposed to the advertising panels sold by Lamar. Adrian
Mabry said that staff was working with Lamar so we can
continue our positive relationship with them. Scott Reed
pointed out that advertising on commuter rail vehicles is not
part of Lamar’s agreement with RTD as it is new service.
Marla Lien stated that this is more of a lost opportunity for
Lamar as opposed to a breach of contract.
Packet Pg. 42

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 11, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

opportunity because much of the signage required to fulfill the
sponsorship agreement has not yet been created. This will
save money as there are no additional costs for the signage
branded with CU’s logo.

6.E

Director Hoy asked for clarification about the wording
indicating there was a mutually agreed upon right to extend
this agreement for an additional five years. He wondered if he
was interpreting this correctly that if either party did not agree
to extend the partnership as is it would either end or be
renegotiated. He wanted to insure that the Board’s actions
today would not commit to those additional five years. Scott
Reed stated that was correct. Staff just wanted the Board to
be aware that an additional five year option exists.
Director Deadwyler wondered how often the wrapping on the
trains would be changed and who would be responsible for the
cost. Scott Reed stated that there were no provisions for
updating wraps in the agreement. He said if a train was
damaged due to something like an accident it would be RTD’s
responsibility to replace the wrap; however, if CU just wanted
to change the messaging that would be something that would
need to be negotiated.
Director Deadwyler commented that there have been many
controversial ads on our buses and light rail vehicles lately,
many of which are very offensive to certain groups. She
wondered how CU would feel about having one of these
controversial ads on their wrapped vehicle. Scott Reed
explained that RTD’s advertising policy would actually be
discussed next. Staff is proposing changes to the policy to
address these concerns.
Director Folska stated that she will be abstaining from the vote
due to her personal business interests.

Director Lasater shared that his corporate attorneys say you
cannot count your chickens until the ink is dry and the money
is in the bank. He does not think either of those things will
have taken place by the Boulder Junction event so perhaps it
is premature to be announcing our partnership with CU.

Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the August 18, 2015
Board Meeting.

Discussion:

Scott Reed explained that for many years RTD has had an
advertising policy that accepts commercial and noncommercial forms of advertising. Under that policy it creates
a limited public forum that provides RTD limited control over
what can and cannot be advertised. He said that because it
had become an issue related to political free speech we had
the types of ads previously referenced by Director Deadwyler.
Scott Reed stated that many transit agencies have adopted a
more limited advertising policy that focuses on commercial,
government and public service announcements that allows for
a much more restrictive range of advertisements. Staff
believes this is the appropriate time to take action to prevent
these types of negative advertisements.
Director Folska thanked staff for addressing this as she thinks
it is long overdue. She believes that Board members, staff and
the constituents deserve to live in a community in which
everyone is respected.
Chair Sisk thanked staff for looking at the policy. He
recognized that RTD did not want to be drawn into a lawsuit
but this now provides a basis for saying no to certain ads that
may be offensive. He believes it was absolutely critical for the
Board to take action. He noted that there may be a temporary
reduction in advertising income but that is something he
supports. He thinks this is a very commendable
recommendation coming forward from staff.
Director James remembers having difficulty fielding questions
in the past from constituents about certain advertising. He
believes eliminating this category of advertising is a very fair
way to address the problem. He thanked our legal counsel for
their good counseling.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Director Hoy wondered what other transit agencies have
enacted similar policies and if any of those policies had been
challenged in court. Marla Lien said that staff had looked at
San Diego, New York, Boston, Seattle and Chicago. She
explained that only larger agencies are addressing this as the
smaller agencies have not been targeted with the more virulent
advertisements. She stated that this policy was modeled after
Chicago’s policy. She commented that several agencies’ new
policies were challenged in lower courts but the policy has
been upheld. Scott Reed pointed out that several of those
agencies had also been sued before changing their policy and
lost every time.
Director Walker expressed his support. He noted that there
might have been potential advertisers who shied away from
advertising with us due to these controversial ads so it is
possible we might see advertising revenue increase instead of
decrease.
Committee Chair Anderson thanked staff for their work. She
highlighted that the policy specifically calls out not accepting
advertisements for tobacco products. She would like to call
out marijuana projects as well. Marla Lien explained that there
was language stating that we would not advertise anything
that is illegal under state or federal law, which includes
marijuana.

C. Updates

• Fare Study Pass Programs
Bruce Abel and Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning,
reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the
August 11, 2015 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda
Packet. Bruce Abel explained that at this time staff was making the
recommendation that pricing for the FlexPass and CollegePass remain the
same while increasing the contracts of the NeighborhoodPass and EcoPass
by 14.4% and 18.3% respectively. He said that staff is also making

6.E

recommendations to simplify the non-profit program in several ways, most
significant of which are to provide a consistent 50% discount for all fare
media and increase access to the non-profit program.

Bruce Abel said that staff hopes to get a head nod from the Board to take
these preliminary recommendations out to the public and stakeholders for
comment. The goal is to present final recommendations for Board action in
September so the new policies can go into effect January 1, 2016.
Committee Chair Anderson recognized that it was a lot of information to
take in and that Directors probably had many questions. In the interest of
time she asked the Board to email staff their comments and questions.
Interim General Manager Genova suggested that this item be briefed again at
the August Study Session once staff had the opportunity to prepare answers
to the Board’s questions.
In an informal vote the Board did not give the staff direction to move
forward with public meetings as many did not feel comfortable moving
forward until their questions were answered. Bruce Abel stated that staff
would not solicit public input at this time and would wait from feedback at
the Study Session.

• Proposed East & I-225 Corridors Service Plan
Bruce Abel introduced Jeff Dunning, Senior Service Planner and Scheduler
for the East Team, and Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and
Scheduling, who reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is
available in the August 11, 2015 Operations and Customer Service
Committee Agenda Packet. It reviewed:
 Existing bus routes in each corridor
 Productivity of each bus route
 Service frequency during weekday peak hours, midday hours and
Saturday, and Sunday/Holiday
 Existing span of service in each corridor
 Proposed service levels for the A-Line and R-Line
 Routes with notable changes or elimination
 New bus routes
Jessie Carter shared that staff was in the process of having stakeholder
meetings, which have been going very well. The goal is to wrap-up the
Packet Pg. 46

Bill Van Meter stated that staff will continue to work with the Affordable
Fares Task Force to establish a more comprehensive low-income fare and
pass program. Bruce Abel introduced Dace West of Mile High Connects
who is the sponsor of the Affordable Fares Task Force. He thanked her and
the other Task Force members for working with RTD cooperatively as we try
to address this difficult task.

public process at the end of September with the hopes of coming to the
Board in November for approval.

Director Tobiassen said these lines do touch his area and he is very familiar
with the current service. He is thrilled with the improvements to the service
that staff is proposing. He looks forward to hearing the comments from the
public.
Director Solano expressed that this is also above his head but he thinks it is
information the Directors need to try to understand. He appreciates staff’s
efforts in educating the Directors. Director Solano stated that the Board
needs to think regionally.
Director Deadwyler expressed her excitement at the changes as well. She
hopes that staff will work to get the word out about the public meetings and
service plan those people who are really riders. She is concerned that many
of the people that provide input are not truly riders and that we miss the real
opportunity to hear from those that are directly impacted by the changes.
Director Folska shared that many of her constituents are concerned that
their Airport bus will be going away. She said she also receives many
comments about the poor to no signage at the airport directing travelers to
the appropriate RTD bus. She hopes this is something that can be
addressed if we are keeping airport buses. Jeff Dunning explained that as
part of the East Rail Line Train Terminal there will be a new bus loading area
with designated gates and improved signage for SkyRide buses. Jessie
Carter stated the Route AT, which is probably the route used by most of her
constituents, was not one of the routes that would be eliminated. Director
Folska hopes there will be audible messages in the new Train Terminal as
well.

• Proposed Gold & Northwest Corridors Service Corridor Service Plan
Bruce Abel introduced Doug Monroe, Senior Service Planner and Scheduler
for the West Team, and Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and
Scheduling, who reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is
available in the August 11, 2015 Operations and Customer Service
Committee Agenda Packet. It reviewed:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 11, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley recognized that the Directors with the most interest in the ALine and R-Line service plans are those who’s Districts the lines will cross.
He thinks it is important for staff to meet with those Directors; however, he
thinks this presentation is getting too deep in the weeds as none of these
lines touch his area. He feels the presentation is over his head as he is not
familiar with the service in these areas. Bruce Abel stated that the one-onone meetings were in process. Staff just wanted the Board to see the
overall plan because they will be asked to vote on it in November.

6.E

Jessie Carter shared that staff was in the process of having stakeholder
meetings, which have been going very well. He said there is some concern
from Arvada about the cancellation of the 72X which they will continue to
discuss. The goal is to wrap-up the public process at the end of October
with the hopes of coming to the Board in December for approval.
Director Lubow expressed concern about the 60 minute service frequency
during off peak hours for the B-Line. She stated that is not very appealing.
Bruce Abel noted that at many of the stations there would be overlap with
the Gold Line, providing increased frequency. Doug Monroe stated that the
only station that would have 30 and 60 minute frequencies on opening day
would be Westminster Station.
Director Hoy commented that there are really two lines opening in
Westminster in 2016 since both the US 36 Bus Rapid Transit and B-Line
would be opening. He wonders how staff coordinates and integrates these
two services. Bruce Abel stated that Nadine Lee, US 36 BRT Project
Manager, and Doug Monroe had been working together with their teams.
Director Hoy stated that in reference to working with stakeholders, he hoped
staff had met with someone from Westminster about the Westminster
Station. Doug Monroe said that he has not met with anyone yet but was
planning to do so as part of the public process.
Committee Chair Anderson thanked staff for looking at the service in South
Arvada, which is a lower income, higher density area. She appreciates the
effort to provide service for that area as they have not had many options in
the past.

 Marketing Update (Video)
Interim General Manager Genova stated that originally staff had hoped to
show a new promotional RTD video telling the RTD story; however, due to
the late hour he said he would forward the video to the Directors instead.

D. Other Matters

Director James expressed his disappointment and concern to see how many
Directors did not give staff the go ahead to begin the Fare Study Pass Program
discussions with the stakeholders. He is concerned about the level of trust the
Board has in staff. He said he also thinks it is futile to delay these conversations as
the information is already out there. He believes what the Board has done now is
inhibit conversation and will actually make the process slower. He stated that if a
Director voted no he invites them to think about the trust they have for staff and
stakeholders.
Director Francone said that staff asked for her opinion about beginning the
stakeholder process and she gave them her opinion. She does not intend to impede
the process; however, she is not comfortable with it moving forward when she still
has many questions. She stated it does not have to do with if she trusts the staff
or not. She has a constituency to answer to as well and does not feel comfortable
with something moving forward that she does not have all the answers about.
Director Francone thanked staff and Kiewit and everyone else involved with the I225 pedestrian bridge. She shared that it was a thing of beauty going into place
and it is a thing of beauty now that it is in place.

B. Recommended Actions
No recommended actions were presented.

C. Updates

• Civil Rights Committee Update
Zamy Silva, Senior Manager for the Civil Rights Division introduced Adrina
Gibson as the new Manager for the Small Business Office (SBO). Zamy
Silva mentioned that Adrina Gibson started with RTD as an intern in 2007
and has been moving through the ranks since then. She last served as the I225 Compliance Manager. Zamy Silva said she has confidence in Adrina
Gibson’s leadership of the SBO team.
Zamy Silva introduced Ed Neuberg, Manager for RTD’s American with
Disabilities Act (ADA) Office. She noted that tonight’s update will focus on
the ADA Office. She added that the last part of the update, captured on a
slide title “Departmental Civil Rights Division Updates”, contained general
updates on the Civil Rights Division. In the interest of time, she invited the
Directors to email her any questions on those items. The slide, along with
the rest of the ADA Office Update presentation, was included in the Civil
Rights Committee agenda packet for August 11, 2015.
Ed Neuberg reviewed the ADA Office Update presentation. The review
included the Highlights of the ADA Office since he joined RTD in April,
2015, as well as Trainings and Outreach and Next Steps as the ADA Office
moves forward.

Director Folska thanked Ed Neuberg for the update. She noted that it took
RTD 25 years to create an ADA Manager position. She said she was glad
that Ed Neuberg is in that position. She was sorry to miss him during the
ADA 25th Anniversary Celebration as she asked for him and could not find
him.
Director Folska asked Ed Neuberg to include the newer facilities, like Denver
Union Station (DUS), at the top of the list of the ADA compliance
evaluations. She noted that even though the architects and engineers who
worked on DUS reviewed facility for ADA compliance, once finished the
facility was not compliant. Dave Genova, Interim General Manager who was
then serving as the Assistant General Manager for Safety, Security, and
Facilities, previously said that his team would study the facility. Director
Folska mentioned that she talked to Jadwiga Brown, Orientation and
Mobility Specialist/Vision Rehabilitation Therapist for the State of Colorado
during the ADA 25th Anniversary Celebration. Jadwiga Brown brought to
her attention that DUS is still not compliant. Director Folska acknowledged
that the list of facilities is long and that the ADA compliance evaluation of
RTD’s facilities is a big job.
Director Folska brought to the Committee’s attention the article titled
“Reflecting on the Impact of Americans with Disabilities Act Signed 25
Years Ago”, published by the Denver Post on July 26, 2012. The article
stated that the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is 83%. She
noted that even if it was at 60%, which was the last percentage available
on this statistic, she wanted to see RTD’s resources for overall hiring,
training, educating, and also recruiting for the Workforce Initiative Now
(WIN) program, available for people with disabilities. Ed Neuberg mentioned
that he was not aware of the article or the 83% figure as the last statistic
available to his understanding was 60%. Zamy Silva added that the Civil
Rights Division is working with RTD’s Human Resources to provide ADA
training to new hires as well as to make the New Hire Training ADA
accessible. She mentioned that the WIN Program is working to make all its
documents ADA accessible. She pointed out that her team has met with
Brenda Mosby, who had contacted the Civil Rights Division previously
Packet Pg. 52

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 11, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ed Neuberg highlighted the ADA 25th Anniversary Celebration on July 25th,
in which Director Folska was a featured speaker. He pointed out that his
office is in the process of creating an Internal ADA Manual for RTD for all
departments to have as a reference. He noted that the 2016 National ADA
Symposium will be held in Denver with RTD as one of the organizing
partners. Ed Neuberg mentioned that this was the first time the National
ADA Symposium has partnered with a transit agency. He added that his
office will be performing RTD facility evaluations for ADA compliance in the
near future.

regarding the accessibility of the WIN Program documentation, to ensure
that her concerns are being addressed. Director Folska asked if Brenda
Mosby has been hired by RTD. Zamy Silva replied that Brenda Mosby does
not work for RTD; however, her team is proactively seeking her feedback as
she has raised some of these concerns in the past. Zamy Silva pointed out
that making the WIN Program ADA accessible has been a little difficult due
to the nature of the work available: short term and dependent on projects.
She wants to ensure that employment under the WIN Program for ADA
participants is feasible and long term. Director Folska noted that it is
important to make all types of jobs available and leave it up to the person to
decide if they are interested in a specific opportunity. She added that the
history of people with disabilities in the United States is long and deep and
that RTD could benefit from an overview of this history and the role that the
Agency gets to play in Denver and the state of Colorado. She noted that
transportation is the backbone to individuals with disabilities in reaching full
potential and full access to public life at the same level as everyone else.
She noted that disabled people need to be equally at the table.
Director Francone shared her excitement about the 2016 National ADA
Symposium coming to Denver. She asked staff to keep her updated as she
would like to participate.
Director Francone asked if the Internal ADA Manual will add new legal
responsibilities to RTD. Ed Neuberg said that the manual will reflect ADA
policies. Marla Lien, General Counsel, confirmed that RTD will not be
creating new policies. Zamy Silva added that RTD has several departments
that interface with ADA policies and the intent is to unify the process and
have one accessible document for the Agency.
Committee Chair Walker noted that he has interacted with Ed Neuberg on a
number of constituents’ concerns and thanked him for his quick responses.

August Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Sisk asked Interim General Manager Genova if there were any concerns or new items
added to the agenda.
Motion:

Discussion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to approve moving the
agenda forward to the full Board meeting of August 18, 2015.
Director Hoy seconded the motion.
Chair Sisk began walking through the agenda and asked if
there would be a General Manager Oversight and Performance
Management Update. Director Bagley indicated that he was
here to talk about this item when we get to the action item of
the 2016 General Manager goals.
Chair Sisk noted that under item C, Authorization of fiscal
authority to the General Manager for North Metro Rail Line
project, that Director Anderson had voted no. He asked her if
her questions had been answered. Director Anderson
responded that they had been addressed by staff both in
writing and via phone call. She had also learned that
Commerce City is taking on the issue to address condominium
law and she had received the amounts for the in-kind services.

Chair Sisk noted that item D, Approval of the SBP Budget Plan
that five Board members had voted against it. Interim General
Manager Genova indicated that Heather Copp, CFO, is in the
process of contacting the Board members to see if she could
address their concerns.
Several of the Board members commented on how well
Heather is doing and how she just jumped into this. Interim
General Manager Genova indicated she is a great addition to
the team. Director Tobiassen noted that she is also an asset
to the Salaried Pension Plan Trustee Board.
On item E, award contract for the supply of 36 mall shuttle
buses, Director Menten indicated that she still has some open
questions and would be getting in touch with Steve Gieske on
this issue.
For item F, it was noted that Director Folska had abstained on
this motion of sponsorship naming rights. Chair Sisk asked if
this should have still shown up on unanimously consent.
Paula Perdue indicated that she understands an abstention is
treated as a no vote. Some of the Board members expressed
they felt the proper course of action would have been that
Director Folska excused herself from participation in any of the
discussion. The question arose on the proper way to handle
abstention and if members need to provide an explanation.
Paula Perdue shared that yes, the Board members should
provide an explanation for abstaining. What happened in the
last update of the Bylaws is language was changed to add
what a person needs to do if they have a conflict of interest.
In the process, the language requiring them to provide an
explanation for their reason was omitted from the Bylaws.
Board and Committee members should ask for a reason for
abstaining; however, the Bylaws do not require it at this time.
Director Walker asked what the recourse was if a person did
not provide a reason. Paula Perdue said she is not sure but as
elected officials, they should govern themselves accordingly.
Some of the discussion centered on if the Board member
should have recused herself, by not participating in the

Packet Pg. 55

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 13, 2015 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

6.G

conversation or even leaving the room. There were feelings
expressed around if recuse should be treated differently than
an abstain. Director Tobiassen expressed there is a
difference. There are specific parameters around when a
person should recuse and a person can abstain for a number of
reasons, not all a conflict of interest. There are tests which
should be applied. He felt legal should have been consulted on
this issue. Paula Perdue shared that legal was consulted on if
she should abstain. Abstain is the umbrella under which
several things fall including recuse. There are different
reasons why a person may abstain but the reason should be
stated.
Director Bagley expressed that everyone needs to be educated
on the issue of abstaining and what the normal procedures
are.
Chair Sisk expressed that as Chair, he will start requesting
members for a reason that they abstained.
Item G, Approval of Interim General Manager’s 2016 goals—
Director Bagley indicated that was the primary reason that he
and Director Anderson were at the meeting. He will miss the
Board meeting next week and he wanted the Executive
Committee to understand what went down in the GM
Oversight and Performance Management Committee. Director
Bagley indicated that 5 members of the GM Oversight and
Performance Management Committee were at the Executive
Committee meeting.
He provided a precursor to the discussion. We normally do a
survey monkey twice a year, once in the first quarter and
again in October. Because the General Manager left around
that time, we did not do one in the spring and the GM
Oversight and Performance Management committee voted to
not do one in the fall of 2015. Pertaining to the General
Manager’s annual evaluation, we had a contract with Phil
Washington but since he has left, this contract is voided.
Interim General Manager Genova does not have a contract.
The option exercised by the Committee to provide a
discretionary performance payout were terms in General

Packet Pg. 56

6.G

6.G

What we have now are five core goals that come from the
General Manager’s job description. Given the updated job
description that the GM Executive Search Committee has
created for the vacancy, it makes sense to look at these goals
for the new contract. The concern he has is in the preparation
of the task goals in having a new General Manager and what
criteria we will have to have. These task goals should drive
the budget and for the 2016 budget, we are already 1 month
late.
Director Menten had provided some correspondence with
proposed changes in three of the core goals and two of the
task goals. Director Bagley noted these goals were discussed
in the GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee
and all of them were voted down either by 4-2 or 5-1 with
Director Menten always dissenting. The overall vote on this
action item was five in favor and one opposed (Menten). He
wanted to share this information for it is important that we get
these goals approved.
Chair Sisk asked a fundamental question. Did Interim General
Manager Genova take on the 2015 goals? Dave indicated
that he did. Will Dave be eligible for the consideration of the
discretionary performance payout? Committee Chair Bagley
indicated there are no contractual obligations but it is the
discretion of his committee to provide a recommendation for a
discretionary performance payout to Dave for the 2015
accomplishments. Dave will have been in charge for about 9
months of that time.
Chair Sisk asked Director Menten if she had any comments
pertaining to the statements by Director Bagley. Director
Menten indicated this was her first time on the committee so

Packet Pg. 57

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 13, 2015 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Manager Washington’s contract and would only apply to the
new General Manager should these be terms added to his
contract. The State Auditors in 2010 were concerned with
how we had done bonuses and provided some pretty
restrictive language about the need for good measurements
and goals. Any plans for a new contract will take this into
consideration.

6.G

Director Bagley indicated there was the whole issue of
employee survey. Director Menten had thought one of the
goals should be changed to require an employee survey with
90% rating. Staff had already hired a firm to do an employee
survey and there were no ratings higher than 50%. He does
not feel we should change horses in mid-stream. Director
Bagley referenced the corrected August 4 minutes and asked if
they could be sent out to the full Board. Paula Perdue
indicated that was his choice but as a matter of course, we
have not been sending out the minutes from the General
Manager Oversight and Performance Evaluation Committee nor
the GM Executive Search Committee. However, everything is
open if requested.
Director Bagley stated that Director Menten had first requested
90% and then shifted to 70% without any thoughtful
discussion or rhyme or reason for the relevancy of this
percentage.
Director Menten indicated she would like all of the minutes put
on the website. She had received inquiries from a constituent
who was looking for the minutes.
Director Menten also indicated that she had started with a
90% rating from internal survey but had moved that down to
70%. If you look at the results provided by Interim General
Manager Genova from the employee survey performed, this
70% is not too far off.
Chair Sisk concluded the discussion by stating he thought the
GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee was
the appropriate place for the discussion and he is happy that
they had the discussion. He agrees with Director Bagley that
the minutes should be disseminated to the full Board.

she was learning how things go. She had noted that in the
committee’s discussion, they had not discussed the core
goals. In looking at the core goals, she had some concerns
and felt it was the right time to bring them forward. She
thinks the core goals are stale and need to be looked at by the
Committee. This was not an option that was provided by the
Committee Chair.

Vote on the Motion: The motion PASSED to move the August agenda before the
full Board on August 18, 2015.
Unanimous Consent
A.

Approval of the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE)

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors approve the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The
APE provides a comprehensive financial blueprint for all FasTracks capital
projects completed, underway or planned through the year 2019.
B.

RTD On-vehicle Advertising Policy Update

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors adopt the attached advertising policy.



Recommended Action
C.
Updated Authorization of Fiscal Authority to the General Manager for
the North Metro Rail Line Project
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors (“Board”) increase the authority granted to the General
Manager or designee to enter into all contracts, real property transactions and
intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Rail Line Project by $56
million to a total authorization of $689.8 million. This authority shall include
the ability to negotiate and execute all contracts; work orders; change orders
and contract modifications; agreements for the acquisition and conveyance of
property interests; and intergovernmental agreements that are necessary or
advisable to complete the North Metro Rail Line within the scope of the North
Metro Rail Line Project budget. This action is consistent with previous board
actions and the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE).
D.

Approval of 2016 - 2021 Strategic Budget Plan

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors adopts the 2016-2021 Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP).
E.

Award Contract for the Supply of 36 Mall Shuttle Buses

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager, or his

designee, to execute a contract with BYD Motors, Inc. for the supply of 36 –
45’ mall shuttle buses and associated spare components in an amount not to
exceed $27,100,000.
Sponsorship Naming Rights Agreement

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the General Manager or his designee be authorized to enter into an agreement
with the University of Colorado (CU) for the sponsorship naming rights on the
A Line and an exterior advertising position on the Flatiron Flyer line for a fiveyear period, with a mutually agreed upon right to extend this agreement for an
additional five years. Under the terms of the agreement, RTD would receive
$905,000.00 in the first agreement year with a 5% escalation factor for each
contract year through year five, with the right to mutually extend this
agreement for an additional five years, also with a 5% escalation factor each
year. Over the initial five-year period of the contract, RTD would receive a
gross amount of $5,000,696.00. It is further recommended that the revenue
from this contract be placed in the Board Reserve Account, which gives the
Board flexibility in determining its specific usage.

Other Matters





Director Menten had pulled up Robert’s Rules on her Smart phone and according to
what she saw, it said abstaining should not be counted as a no vote. She stated
she agreed that Director Folska should not have participated in the discussion
leading to the vote where she abstained. Paula Perdue indicated it was her
understanding from Rolf in legal that an abstain is treated the same as a no. It
really does not matter in this discussion anyway. Just the mere fact that there was
an abstention would have moved this item to recommended action, not unanimous
consent. She will do further research.
Director Tobiassen announced that John McCuskey with E-470 has announced his
retirement. This is another important position with a vacancy.
Interim General Manager Genova provided a couple of items:
o The link to the new RTD promotional video has been provided to the Board
and the community. This is a good promotional video that tells the RTD
story of the family of services that we provide. As he has been meeting
with employees and Board members, they indicated that our story is bigger
than FasTracks so this video incorporates some of these other services like
call-n-ride.
o He wanted to provide an update on the Health and Welfare negotiations.
The Committee may recall that we had replaced the representation with
three new trustees who are doing a better job of keeping the leadership
informed. They have been working with the represented to make changes in

the plans that are offered. It is important to know that with these changes,
RTD costs could go up. They are actively studying this but appear at a
stalemate. RTD recently received a letter from the union requesting this
issue goes to arbitration. When we made the last change, the employees’
contribution costs increased and RTD also had to increase the amount for
the plan. We are not sure with arbitration what this could look like. Director
Menten reminded the Board she was not in favor of the stopgap measure
that was approved in August of 2014 that was supposed to go through the
year of 2015. What she noted was although some of the union employees
may not be participating in the plan, RTD still made contributions based on
every employee to the tune of approximately $1.7M over 17 months for
employees not in the plan.
o Interim General Manager Genova reported that on August 21, the acting FRA
Director will come to Denver to look at some of the things we are doing
including positive train control. He also said someone from Phoenix will be
coming to Denver next week.
o Interim General Manager Genova reported that the Office of Inspector
General will be doing reviews of several projects around the country. The
RTD Eagle project is one of those selected to be reviewed. Linda Gerske is
working with them to determine the scope of the review.
Chair Sisk stated that we need to find a way to shorten our meetings. We have
got to shorten our committee meetings. Interim General Manager indicated staff
has discussed this and is sensitive to this as well. Director Anderson suggested
that perhaps one way is by Board members being more responsible to read their
packets ahead of time and get their questions answered before coming to the
meeting.

Retiree Awards
Chair Sisk recognized Roy Davis, Supervisor of Service and Cleaning, for his 30 years of
service. He asked Mike Gil, Deputy Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, to
introduce him. Mike Gil said that he is very proud of Roy Davis. He is a man that can do
a lot with a little. Mike Gil noted that Service and Cleaning is an area with a high turnover
rate and he believes Roy Davis has worked with over 1,500 employees throughout his
career. He stated that Roy is a very, very dependable person. He asked Steve Gieske,
General Superintendent of Maintenance, and Roy Davis to join him.
Steve Gieske shared that he has personally worked with Roy for 22 years. They have
shared many of the struggles of getting the buses serviced and ready for work. He
pointed out that Roy Davis is the first Service and Cleaning Supervisor that RTD has every
hired. Steve Gieske stated that he has done an excellent job for RTD and will be greatly
missed. He congratulated Roy on his retirement.
Roy Davis thanked RTD. His said the ride has been beautiful for all his 30 years.

Honorable Mayor Folsom, Town of Superior and US 36 Mayors and Commissioners
Coalition (MCC) representative, said that MCC appreciates the entire dialog that has
gone into the US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Service Plan up to this point. Some
specifics that MCC specifically want to recognize are the addition of most of the
Route S trips back into the opening day plan, adding the Flatiron Station as a stop
for the BJCC Route as well as Church Ranch Station as a stop for the DWB
Service. MCC is eager to continue working with RTD staff to determine a path
forward so everyone can state that the Service Plan is a net-new service for the US
36 Corridor. To achieve this, the MCC has three top priorities they would like
addressed: (1) restoration of the remaining Route S trips, (2) restore mid-day
service along Broadway in Boulder to maximize capital investment of the US 36
express lanes and (3) see additional service to connect Boulder Junction at Depot
Square with the region, including additional service to Union Station. He reminded
the Board that Boulder County and the corridor communities contribute over $20
million per year to RTD while the proposed service level represents approximately a
5% annual return on that investment. MCC requests that this be increased to 15%
of their annual contribution and that the additional funding be used to restore
existing service and create new service along the US 36 Corridor. He stated that
the MCC is eager to work cooperatively with the RTD staff to pilot new partnership
opportunities to build new transit markets.
Honorable Mayor Appelbaum, Mayor of Boulder and MCC member, reiterated his
thanks to the Board and staff for their work to update the fares as well as the work
done thus far on the US 36 BRT Service Plan. He said that he wanted to focus on
some items that the Board may not be aware of that really jump out at the US 36
Metro Mayors and Commissioners Coalition (MCC). The FasTracks expenses
projected for 2019 for the open corridors are as follows: West Corridor - $16
million, I-225 Corridor - $16 million, North Corridor - $12 million, BRT - $1.2
million. He reminded everyone that the US 36 BRT Corridor is a FasTracks
Corridor. He stated that his area would take a $16 million budget in a heartbeat.
The subsidy per boarding for light rail is $6.20 while the B/BV Route is $2.30. He
stated that is quite a difference but that corridor cannot seem to get significant net-

signifies that when you imagine the impossible possible, you can do so many things.
Director Folska noted that there were many municipal leaders in the audience. She shared
with them a recent discussion about the need for sidewalks so people with disabilities can
access public transportation.

new service. Mayor Appelbaum pointed out that the subsidy for SkyRide service to
Boulder is less than most other SkyRide routes but the corridor cannot seem to get
half-hour service. He stated that the figures for the US 36 Corridor’s contributions
are actually understated because EcoPass dollars are allocated across the entire
system, not just along the routes that EcoPass holders use.
Mayor Appelbaum acknowledged that schedules can change and that the Service
Plan before the Board this evening is just a first pass but he is concerned that
service demand cannot be established for services that are not offered. He asked
how RTD can tell what the ridership would be on mid-day express service if that
service is not offered. He wonders how RTD can determine if half-hour SkyRide
service is warranted, especially from Boulder Junction at Depot Square, if it is not
offered. He stated that the MCC is absolutely RTD’s partners. They want to make
this work so that US 36 BRT can be recognized as the best BRT in the Country;
however, they hope that RTD will look at some of their concerns raised so that
they can be addressed in partnership between the corridor communities and RTD.
Commissioner Jones, Boulder County, appreciates the opportunity to provide
comments on the proposed US 36 BRT Service Plan on behalf of Boulder County.
Boulder County supports adoption of the Plan and appreciates RTD’s efforts to
collaborate with them on it. US 36 BRT is critical to the community and represents
the areas primary return-on-investment that the residents will receive through the
FasTracks plan until the completion of the entire Northwest Rail Corridor. She
stated it is therefore critical for the rollout of US 36 BRT to be an overwhelming
success, not just for the Boulder County voters but also as RTD’s first BRT.
Boulder County is supportive of many elements of the Service Plan; however, there
are outstanding issues that need to be addressed in the near future. First, the plan
does not provide any significant net-new investment in improved service
comparable to that provided to other FasTracks corridors. Rather it largely
reallocates the funding already provided to the US 36 Corridor. Second, no one
should experience worse service or be required to pay more for comparable service
than they do today. The latest Service Plan still has several areas of reduced
service, most notably the elimination of mid-day express service between Denver
and Boulder. Finally, the Service Plan does not adequately account for areas
experiencing significant growth like the Boulder Junction at Depot Square area. US
36 Communities contribute well over $25 million in revenues through the 0.4%
FasTracks Sales Tax each year; however, they are only receiving $900K in new
transit service over what they receive today. That is less than 5% of what the
corridor contributes to FasTracks.
Commissioner Jones stated that the Northwest Corridor is a team player. They
have supported the buildout of the entire FasTracks system but they need the team
to reciprocate and support an equitable return-on-investment. Boulder County
believes RTD needs to continue to work with the Corridor to continue to enhance



service as outlined by Mayor Folsom; however, they are confident that together it is
possible to build out the BRT network that the Corridor needs and deserves. She
looks forward to continued cooperation with RTD.
Honorable Mayor Gunning, City of Lone Tree, stated that he was here this evening
to speak in favor of the Southeast Rail Extension. He thanked the Board, RTD staff
and all the other partners for helping this project get to the next step. He said that
in the spirit of the moto “build as much as we can as fast as we can”, he wants to
talk about the impact of transit on his community’s daily lives. It allows the
employees in the workforce get to jobs they might not have access to otherwise as
well as for employers to expand their hiring base. He noted that Douglas County
has a concentration of our older population so access to transportation will be a
need going forward. He stated that it is clear that RTD rail stations have become a
driver for development so it is really a competitive issue for his region. Therefore,
Lone Tree became the core of a regional partnership to finish the Southeast Rail
Extension.
Mayor Gunning reiterated that this is a regional piece of infrastructure, not just for
Lone Tree. He said that he is proud to stand before the Board as they make their
decision this evening knowing that his area followed through on every item they
promised: $25 million in regional cash contributions, all right-of-way has been
donated and all fees and charges for municipal services have been waived. He
acknowledged that like every piece of major infrastructure there has been some
controversy. He noted that there is a dissenting opinion in Lone Tree’s City Council
concerning the use of Federal funding as well as questions about the percent of
match; however, the package that the community put on the table from day one
remains the same package today even though the projected cost has changed. He
believes they are leading the way in the Metro area with over a 12% match. He
hopes that given the funding issues across the Metro area that this model can find
some use going forward. Mayor Gunning stated that finishing FasTracks remains
his goal. RTD and the community need to find a way to fund the services that
people are demanding.
Honorable Mayor Waid, Town of Parker, thanked the Board for their time and
devotion to the citizens. He remembered standing before the Board about one year
ago. He drove to that meeting and by the time he arrived he was aggravated and
frustrated. He stated that today he followed the path the Southeast Rail Extension
would take and then took the train. He said that his experience today was one that
he can only describe with one word: enjoyable. He arrived in a good state of mind
and was excited to be here. Mayor Waid stated that he was here to extend his
vigorous support for the Southeast Rail Extension on behalf of the unanimous
support from the Town Council. This Extension gives accessibility to more people
in his Town. He noted that he could talk about the regional benefits, of which
there are many, or the time opportunities, of which there are many as well;

however, most importantly, having access to the metro area through light rail is a
benefit to his citizens. He implored the Board to vote yes.
Honorable Mayor Murphy, City of Lakewood, noted that this year the Lakewood
City Council allocated an additional $2 million for sidewalks when they normally
budget $300-500K. He thanked Director Folska for advocating for that. He shared
that about a dozen years ago the Metro Mayors Caucus joined forces with RTD to
support FasTracks. He pointed out that many of those Mayors were Mayors that
knew they would never get a FasTracks line but they understood the regionalism of
FasTracks. The great recession hit about five years later. He stated that those
were tough times but the Metro Mayors Caucus banded together again and formed
the FasTracks Task Force. He felt it was his duty as one of the towns that would
get the first line to Chair the Task Force. He is here tonight to support his friends
in the Southeast and along US 36. He stated that it is well known that the
Southeast has contributed an unprecedented local match. The dream of attracting
employers is coming true. He asked the Board to support that dream by voting yes.
Honorable Mayor Rakowsky, City of Greenwood Village, said that most of his adult
life has been in government service. He noted that the Board, District and
community had been blessed by the service of someone that needs recognition,
Rick Clarke. He stated that there would be no discussion of the Southeast Rail
Extension this evening without him. Mayor Rakowsky echoed the comment of
other elected officials. He noted that infrastructure drives the economy. He
recognized that one of the duties of a Board is to have a vision, and the vision of
the RTD Board is called FasTracks. He stated that the vision only works if there is
leadership that executes that vision. He acknowledged that FasTracks has come a
long way but there is still a long way to go. He urged the Board not to think of the
present but future generations that will recognize the laudable things they have
done.
Keith Simon was here representing Coventry Development. They are the
developers of the Ridgegate Master Plan and have been working collaboratively
with RTD since 1999. He stated the Board’s actions would move the Southeast
Rail Extension forward to the final step of securing a New Starts Grant. He urged
the Board to vote yes. The project has the opportunity to become a national model
for Public Private Partnerships and will stimulate three great Transit Oriented
Developments. It will also provide connections to the North as well as creation of a
great End of Line station. He stated that Coventry Development supports the build
out of all FasTracks lines. He hopes that the Directors will capitalize on the past 16
years of hard work to lay the groundwork for this extension with a yes vote.
Mike Fitzgerald, Denver South Economic Development Partnership (DSEDP),
thanked the Board for the opportunity to speak and for their past hard work in
building FasTracks. Denver South Economic Development Partnership helps all
businesses in the area of Lincoln to Belleview and Santa Fe to Parker Road. He

stated that nothing is more important to DSEDP’s past successes than the transit
system. There is not a week that goes by that there are not recruiters offering lush
incentives for businesses to leave Colorado. As job creation gets more difficult, the
incentives will continue to increase. He stated that Colorado is doing better at
attracting employers than most other states and the transit system is a key piece of
that. If the entire FasTracks system is not finished the Metro area will not have the
kind of success, prosperity and economic diversity that there is now. He noted
that DSEDP was one of the first organizations to support the 0.4% FasTracks tax.
He appealed to the Directors to vote to finish the Southeast Rail Extension and he
pledged to continue to fight for completion of the entire system.
Steve Klausing, Denver South Transportation Management Association and DSEDP,
recognized that his Association has had many partnerships with RTD. Today he
was reminded of the first project he worked on with Interim General Manager
Genova on the light rail platforms. In the next 24 months his area will be investing
$3 million for sidewalks, all of which will be last mile connections. He asked the
Board to remember 6 years ago when everyone was wondering not how fast light
rail lines would be opening but if it would even be possible to finish one in the next
10 years; however, in 2016 RTD will now be opening 5 lines. He stated that
FasTracks is the biggest public work transit project in the United States and the
Board had the opportunity to take one more step toward completing the entire
system. His organization was one of the first that supported FasTracks and they
are as committed as ever to building out the entire system. His organization is
happy to be contributing money to the extension. He acknowledged that the
Southeast Rail Extension has some of the broadest based support that an RTD
project has had. There are many people supporting the Extension that do not have
financial gain but see it as one more step in finishing the system. He encouraged
the Directors to vote yes.
Gina McAfee, US 36 Commuting Solutions, stated that they were very appreciative
of the work done by RTD staff to develop the US 36 Bus Rapid Transit Service
Plan. They appreciate how the plan has been modified to respond to a number of
concerns; however, US 36 Commuting Solutions remains concerned about
removing mid-day express service, converting all BX routes to all stop service, and
the lack of mid-day and airport service to Boulder Junction. She stated that the
service plan does not take into account the residential and commercial development
near the Boulder Junction station. She urged the Directors and staff to continue to
monitor the US 36 BRT and adjust as necessary.
Amber Decker, Denver, shared that she commutes to the SkyRidge Medical Center
every day on the light rail and SkyRidge shuttle. She stated that if there was a
stop closer to SkyRidge she would not have to take the shuttle. Taking RTD makes
for a no stress commute. She is the first point of contact for SkyRidge patients. If
she has a stress free commuter, she is in a better frame of mind which leads to a

better experience for her patients. She said that many times when she gets off the
train there are patients there that do not know how to get to the hospital. She
encouraged the Directors to vote yes on the Southeast Rail Extension.
Adam Steffl, Lone Tree, said that he was here not only to offer his support but also
that of Ridgegate West Village Association Board of Directors for the Southeast Rail
Extension. He stated that everyone he has spoken to is very supportive of the
Extension. It is a great opportunity to integrate transit with development in the
neighborhood. He is glad to see RTD so close to taking the next step to begin this
project.
Kim Monson, Lone Tree City Council, thanked the Board for their time and
dedication. She also thanked her colleagues that spoke this evening. She said they
are good people and have great intentions. She expressed her concern of the $92
million in Federal funds that will be used on the Southeast Rail Extension if RTD is
awarded a New Starts Grant. She stated that the Federal Government is supposed
to pay for projects that benefit everyone, not just one community. She believes
these kind of projects should be funded regionally instead of federally. She does
not believe it is fair to ask our neighbors to pay for things that will never benefit
them. She noted that the Federal Government has been running a deficit year over
year and we are passing that debt on to our children. She challenged the Board to
figure out a way to do this project regionally rather than asking the Federal
Government to do it. She stated that great people in great societies pass on
something better to the next generation.
Tom Clarke, Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation CEO and Denver
Metro Chamber of Commerce Executive Director, reminded everyone that his
organization was the single largest investor in the FasTracks tax election in 2004.
He stated that they are not only a stakeholder but RTD’s partner. His organization
is one of the most avid supporters of RTD. FasTracks has become the embodiment
of the regional culture and economic success that it created. He stated that every
day he gets to see the magnetic pull of FasTracks that brings new opportunity to
this region. He is here this evening to speak on behalf of both organizations he
represents in favor of the Southeast Rail Extension. He recognized that they agreed
with the RTD Board several years ago that this Extension should be delayed until
much of the system had a degree of certainty that it would be built; however, RTD
has made great progress since then. This Extension is a unique opportunity for
RTD to demonstrate the power of transit and the willingness of other investors to
provide significant additional funding. He asked the Board to vote affirmatively on
the Extension this evening.
Chris Waggett commented that many of the Board know him as the CEO of D4
Urban and their work at Alameda Station. He stated that is vivid proof of a publicprivate development partnership. He said that he was here this evening though as
the Chairman of Transit Alliance. Transit Alliance was one of the prime movers

behind the regional support of the FasTracks buildout. He stated that he personally
knows the power of a public-private partnership, of which this is a benchmark
example. The Southeast Rail Extension will give access to jobs and housing, both
north and south. This Extension will be a regional catalyst for economic growth.
He noted that this action is an example of how RTD can do as much as we can as
effectively as we can and encouraged the Board to vote yes.
Dennis Houston, Parker Chamber of Commerce, stated that on behalf of the Parker
area’s Chamber of Commerce, 650 businesses and 10K+ employees he wants to
express their full support of the Southeast Rail Extension. He asked each Board
member to provide their full support with a yes vote. He said that today the Board
gets the opportunity to be super heroes to the people of Douglas County. In 1982
Parker only had a few hundred residents, in 2000 they had 25K residents, and
today they are approaching 50K. As the South metro area is looking forward to
tremendous growth they are also looking forward to extreme congestion. He
recognized that CDOT does not have the funding necessary to build the needed
roads in the area. That is where the Board’s role as RTD super heroes comes into
play. He believes this is a once in a lifetime opportunity with an amazing
partnership between the Federal Government, Public Sector as well as private
investors to bring a credible solution to the table that will have a positive impact on
millions of people for years to come.
Dennis Houston asked the Board to give this opportunity their most serious
consideration. He noted that many of the Parker residents work in other areas of
the region and would welcome having a green, cost effective method of commuting
daily. They believe that the Southeast Rail Extension is not just about Parker and
Lone Tree but about the region. Tonight they ask the Board to vote yes for
thousands of new jobs, thousands of new homes, for millions of square feet of
commercial development, and the hundreds of million dollars in increase property
value. He encouraged the Directors to put on their RTD super hero uniform and
vote to impact lives, transform a region and build a better Colorado for generations
to come.
Brian McDonald, Charles Schwab, is here tonight on behalf of the Charles Schwab
employees who live all over the city. He urged the Board to vote yes on the
Extension. Currently Charles Schwab has 2,300 employees with the capacity for
4,500 when their third facility is done. He said that this indicates that access to
public transportation will be important to reduce congestion in the area. He stated
that Charles Schwab supports completion of the entire FasTracks project. He
shared there was a recent Wall Street Journal article discussing the influx of
millennials coming to Denver. Programs like FasTracks are what will help create a
viable community for employers and employees.
Linda Watson, SkyRidge Director of Public Affairs, shared that she had hoped to
introduce her employee but the employee took the light rail while Linda Watson

drove. She recognized that while the employee was out of context she thought it
was a very telling story. She said on behalf of the SkyRidge employees she was
here this evening to ask for the Board’s support. She recognized that SkyRidge
employs a variety of workers at varied pay scales, but overall hospitals are stable
employers that are often in the community for decades. She shared that SkyRidge
purchased an EcoPass for every employee and many of them depend on it to get to
work each day. She asked for the Board’s support of the Southeast Rail Extension.
Roger Partridge, Douglas County Commissions, stated that he was here in support
of the Southeast Rail Extension. He commended RTD staff and Mayor Gunning for
their work on this project. He shared that there are three Higher Education
campuses that recently relocated to the area. He was able to speak to two and
they are very supportive of the Extension. He said that he has also heard support
for the other municipalities in the community as well as his fellow commissioners.
He stated that Douglas County is prepared to make this a ridership project. He
commended and thanked RTD. He acknowledged that last year they had two Calln-Rides that were being considered for cancellation. He said because of the
partnership between Douglas County and RTD we were able to work together
collaboratively to maintain the service.
Mitchell Wilson, Denver, shared that he has Cerebral Palsy and Epilepsy. RTD is his
sole mode of transportation. He has been homeless for around 10 years and has
four daughters. He recognized the great employees at RTD but said he also calls
the Telephone Information Center almost daily with complaints. He wants RTD to
be a better company. He stated that he had a petition to give to the Board that
was started to get equal rights for parents with strollers. He also expressed
frustration that the times posted are wrong, drivers do not wait for passengers and
there are no bathrooms at our bus stops.
Mark Witkiewicz, Corporex-Hampden Inn, expressed his support for the efforts of
the Cities, elected officials, private sector, etc. for their efforts on the Southeast
Rail Extension. This is an economic engine that should not be turned down. He
thinks this is an opportunity to create jobs. He stated that all his neighbors are in
support of the Extension as well.

Chair Sisk thanked everyone for their comments.

Discussion:

Director Lasater stated that no matter how thick the bread is you still
have two sides to a slice. He believes he has a unique perspective as
he is the only Board member that was also part of the Metro Mayors
Caucus that supported FasTracks in 2004. He stated that the
economic benefit of the Southeast Rail Extension is huge. That was
indicated by the number of people that spoke in support of the
Extension this evening. However, he thinks that on the economic
development side they have not only had their side of the bread
buttered but have all the jams, jellies, marmalade etc. On the flip
side the Board has to wrestle with the financial implications of
approving this extension.
Director Lasater thinks it is respectable that staff was able to work
with the community to get a 12% match as opposed to the 2.5%
required through FasTracks. He thinks it is respectable but not
admirable because he wholeheartedly believes RTD is leaving millions
on the table. He noted that Dennis Houston from the Parker Chamber
of Commerce asked the Directors to put on their super hero costumes
but he thinks he left his at the cleaners. Director Lasater stated that
even though this is in his District and makes sense economically,
there are still aspects he does not feel comfortable with so he will not
be supporting it.
Director Lubow stated that she would be voting in favor of the
Extension as financially it is a good deal and she does not think RTD
can turn up our noses at a Full Funding Grant Agreement. That being
said, she does have several concerns that she wants on record. She
is from the Northwest and they still do not have their rail. She said
the discussion about US 36 was very interesting and she agrees
getting the Bus Rapid Transit running is important; however, she feels
people have forgotten about the Northwest Rail. She thinks RTD has
a moral and legal obligation to finish the Northwest Rail. Director
Lubow also expressed concern over the local match changing from
$45 million. She was disappointed that this figure was reduced
without a real discussion about why until some of the Directors
began to question it. She stated that despite those concerns she
would vote yes.

Packet Pg. 78

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 28, 2015 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of July 28, 2015)

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Director Folska shared that one of the reasons she was elected was
because she was committed to finishing FasTracks by the year 2020.
She still believes that is possible. She stated that the voters voted
for FasTracks so to her this discussion is kind of moot. It is the
Board’s job to now implement what the voters approved. She
expressed her appreciation at the outpouring of support for
regionalism; however, it concerns her deeply when people say that
RTD does not need to take federal money for our local activities. She
reminded everyone that last year tourism brought in over $12 billion
to the Colorado Economy. That is from people traveling that come to
our airport, riding our public transit and renting cars to drive on our
roads. Director Folska said that as far as the local match changing,
she must first recognize that the amount is still far above the 2.5%
most municipalities bring forward in things like right-of-way. She
stated there is very little cash that actually gets brought to the table.
She does not feel we are leaving money on the table but finding it.
Director Folska said for these reasons she will vote yes.
Director Francone noted that in the Board Report there is an
authorization to allow for expenditures up to $24.4 million for design,
related staff costs and some land acquisition but then requests a
budget transfer of only about $15.2 million form the FasTracks
Management Reserve. She wondered if there was a reason for the
difference. Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager of Capital
Programs, explained that it was really a timing issue. The funds were
not in the 2015 Adopted Budget so staff is transferring money from
the contingency to do the work this year. Next year when the money
was programmed in the 2016 Budget the funds will be replaced.
Director Francone stated that she will vote yes but it was a very
difficult decision for her. As a new Board member she has spent
countless hours trying to figure out how this was negotiated. She
recognized that originally there was $45 million on the table that
suddenly turned into $28 million. She said that staff, the City of
Lone Tree, and other Board members have assured her that it really
does not matter since RTD is getting the land we need without
having to pay for it; however, it seems very disingenuous to her. She
stated that the best case scenario is that it is very sloppy estimation
and she does not even want to consider the worst. Director
Francone also expressed concern that RTD will not receive $92
million for a Full Funding Grant Agreement. She stated that she will

Award of Contract for Group 26 Fixed Route Service

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Interim
General Manager, or his designee, be authorized to enter into a contract with First Transit

areas. This package of service, named “Group 26”, represents the re-bid of service
currently operated by First Transit under a contracted service package named “Group 22.”
This contract is for three years plus two one year extensions for a total of five years. The
total not-to-exceed five year contract total amount is $63,168,544 for service and
$7,019,978 for fuel.
This recommendation represents the most responsive and
responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 15-DH-064 to
provide “Group 26” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide this service is
scheduled to be effective on January 17, 2016.

Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals

It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management
Committee that the Board of Directors approve the Interim General Manager’s goals for
2016 as defined in the attached General Manager’s Performance Evaluation Form.
Director Anderson recognized that the Board works through a Committee Process. She
acknowledged that this item in particular is so important to both the Board but the Interim
General Manager as well. She shared that at 5:00 p.m. Director Menten handed out some
proposed changes to the Board. Director Anderson thinks this item needs to be taken
back to the Committee so the suggestions can be vetted and brought back to the Board.
Director Anderson made the motion to postpone Approval of the Interim General
Manager’s 2016 Goals until the August 18, 2015 Board Meeting.

XIV. Executive Session
There was no Executive Session.

Old Business
Director Bagley stated that he cannot express how proud he is of the work of the Board
staff and that of the Marketing Department for the APTA Transit Board Member (TBM) and
Board Support Seminar. He said that he has never seen the kind of materials that were
handed out at this conference for the tours. He believes it is just outstanding material. He
hopes that staff will submit these tour booklets for an APTA Award.
Director Bagley shared that he attended the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF)
Open House. He thought it was an outstanding event and was very well done by staff
and volunteers. He said that something that people might not remember is the major issue
we faced in allowing Owens Corning to continue operating in their facility just to the north
of the CRMF. He stated that staff should be recognized for the work they did in getting
this Facility built.
Director Bagley informed the Board that on Sunday while the APTA TBM and Board
Support Seminar was having their Colorado Hoe Down at Coors Field, the MAX Program
had a reception at Denver Union Station. He was able to spend about 20 minutes there on
his way to Coors Field. This program has been a major cornerstone in advancing
employees and workforce development. Director Bagley asked Interim General Manager
Genova to introduce him to every RTD employee. He said it was his honor to be there
representing the RTD Board.
Director Francone thanked Paula Perdue and the Board office for their rock star work on
the APTA Seminar. She thought everything was wonderful. It was a top notch, grade A
event.
Director Anderson agreed that it was a great event. She believes that everyone had a
wonderful time. She thought it was so nice to see old friends from all over the country
and show off what Denver has to offer. She thought the tour day was a very fun day but
she was exhausted by the time she got home.
Director Lasater also agreed that the APTA Seminar was a great event. He had the
opportunity to talk with 10 to 15 Board members from all over the country and from
agencies of varying sizes. He shared that he also recently had a tour of his District with
Anthony Graves from Mayor Hancock’s office. He said Mr. Graves was extremely amazed
at the amount of density being built while still having room for continued growth.

Director Deadwyler extended her kudos to the staff for the APTA Seminar. She said it
was so busy but so fun. She received nothing but compliments from everyone she talked
with. She was so proud of the staff for showing the rest of the country how it is done in
Denver. She also extended her gratitude to Larry Buter for providing Access-a-Ride service
to those in wheelchairs.
Chair Sisk shared that there were four people in wheelchairs on the Transit Oriented
Communities and Flavors of BRT tour. He thought the participants really saw the
accessibility of the RTD system. He thanked the Board for the time they committed and
extended his kudos to staff.

XVI. New Business
Director James wanted to share with the Board a new pedestrian bridge that has been
kept below the radar. It crosses I-25 a short distance east of Colorado Boulevard. The
City and County of Denver spent almost $8 million to build it and it really enhances access
to our facilities.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: July 29, 2015

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

July 29, 2015

Board Meeting Date: August 18, 2015

Subject:

Approval of the
Evaluation (APE)

2015

Annual

Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the
2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The APE provides a comprehensive financial blueprint for all
FasTracks capital projects completed, underway or planned through the year 2019.
BACKGROUND
RTD has been conducting an Annual Program Evaluation since 2007. Given the challenges of managing
a multi-billion dollar capital program, it is desirable to perform a complete analysis of the cost of the
program. The APE captures all project expenditures to date and all planned expenditures through the
year 2019 on a project-by-project basis. It essentially provides a baseline capital budget for boardapproved projects currently underway or planned in the near future.
Since so many of the FasTracks projects are now in construction, the major effort has shifted from
developing accurate estimates of costs to one of managing the projects within the Board-approved
budgets for those projects. The staff provides the Board with regular updates on the FasTracks projects
throughout the year.
On July 14, staff provided an update on the 2015 APE to the FasTracks Monitoring Committee with the
intention of bringing it to the Board at a later date for approval. There have been no changes to the
project information since that presentation. However, at that meeting, the Board requested additional
detail on the miscellaneous projects included in the FasTracks program. The July 14 presentation and
the additional requested detail are attached.
DISCUSSION
The project-by-project cost along with the amount spent through 2014 is shown in the attached
presentation. The total FasTracks budget through 2019 is approximately $5.6 billion, and approximately
$3.6 billion of this total was spent through the end of 2014.
Since most of the funded FasTracks projects are complete or under construction and are being managed
within the Board approved budgets, the changes to this APE are relatively small. The changes primarily
reflect updates to the project scope and accounting as shown on the attached presentation.
The project cost increases for the 2015 APE capital budget are summarized below:



Construction of additional passing sidings to improve service reliability along the corridor and
facilitate the future completion of the full corridor to 162nd Avenue, approved by the Board in
October 2014.
Additional improvements to the North Metro Corridor:

Packet Pg. 88

12.A

Additional hazardous materials costs resulting from additional engineering and soil
testing along the corridor, as well as from negotiations with adjacent property owners
o Property-related impacts resulting from detailed engineering, relocation of the single
remaining freight shipper along the corridor to mitigate impacts on its operations, and
mitigation required at the National Western Stock Show
o Operating and maintenance interface with the Eagle Project, including equipment for
additional North Metro vehicles in the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, developing
and integrating the North Metro communications and control system, and improving
service reliability along the corridor.
 Updated planning and cost estimates for the Central Rail Extension
 Additional funds required for interface between I-225 and East Rail lines at Peoria Station
 Additional closeout work for the West Rail Line
 Additional funds for staffing, marketing, education and promotion of the five corridors
scheduled to open in 2016
 Funding to conduct a federal funding feasibility analysis to identify the best candidate project
for future New Starts or Small Starts funding out of the remaining partially funded projects.
This analysis will not proceed unless a preliminary in-house analysis determines that at least
one of the remaining projects meets the current FTA criteria for entry into the New Starts or
Small Starts process.
The 2015 APE also identifies several projects that will not require the full amount of funds budgeted in
the 2014 APE, and contingency funds that are available to meet project needs:
o



Projects completed under the APE budget
o Denver Union Station
o Free MetroRide
o Wadsworth and Sheridan parking garages
 Other projects with updated cost projections
o Additional light rail vehicles
o Programwide capital costs
 Contingency funds available to meet project needs
o FasTracks Railroad Compliance Contingency
o FasTracks Environmental Mitigation
Future implementation of projects not included in the current APE would require identification of funding
sources for construction and operations, and would require approval of the Board. Therefore, the APE is
a dynamic tool, which is updated as projects move towards completion and any changes approved by
the Board are incorporated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total cost of the changes to the project scopes, net of the transfer approved by the Board in
October 2014 for the North Metro Rail Line project, is $48.8 million. These changes will be funded
through the reallocation of $34.7 million from contingency funds and projects completed under budget,
and a reduction of $14.1 million in the FasTracks Management Reserve.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors approve the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The APE provides a
comprehensive financial blueprint for all FasTracks capital projects completed, underway or planned
through the year 2019.

Packet Pg. 89

12.A

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the 2015 APE. This is not recommended
because FasTracks would not have an updated capital budget in place to manage the program
through 2019.

RTD On-vehicle Advertising Policy Update

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopt the
attached advertising policy.
BACKGROUND
Currently, RTD operates an on-vehicle advertising program that accepts both commercial and non-commercial forms of
advertising. Under current policy, RTD’s advertising program creates a ‘limited public forum’ by which public service,
nonprofit and political advertisements are allowed within the guidelines established by the policy.
RTD’s Current Advertising Policy is as follows:
Advertising Policy and Objective:
It is the policy of the RTD to utilize space on the interior and exterior of its buses and light rail vehicles for commercial
advertising, RTD advertising, Corporate Partnership Program and public service messages. The primary objective of the
commercial advertising program is to maximize the net revenues to the District within the policy and standards of the
District.
Advertising Standards:
All advertising matter displayed on or in buses, light rail and commuter rail vehicles shall be of a reputable character as
determined by the RTD. Objectionable advertisements shall, upon the request of a responsible officer of the RTD, be
removed immediately. All advertisements must be in accordance with applicable Federal, State and Municipal laws,
ordinances and regulations within the District.
Political advertisements may be displayed only within six months of the election date. Said advertising must contain the
following disclaimer: "This Ad Paid for by (sponsor/advertiser)" and shall be subject to prior approval by RTD.
The following standards for advertising, as adopted by the RTD Board of Directors, shall be strictly adhered to by the
Advertising Company:
1. The RTD will not display advertising copy which is false, misleading, or deceptive;
2. The RTD will not display advertising copy which relates to any illegal activity under local, state or federal statute;
3. The RTD will not display advertising copy which is obscene;
4. Any advertisement not relating to a commercially available product or service including political advertising shall
include a clearly visible phrase "This Ad Paid for by (the identity of the sponsor/advertiser)". These ads shall be
subject to prior approval by the RTD; and
5. The RTD will not display advertising copy, which promotes the sale and/or use of tobacco products.
RTD has Non-Commercial Advertising Disclaimer Specifications under the current policy.
DISCUSSION
The proposed RTD Advertising Policy would establish uniform, reasonable, and viewpoint-neutral standards for the
display of advertising in and on the facilities, vehicles and other property (together "Property") of the Regional

Packet Pg. 109

12.B

Transportation District and its affiliated and subsidiary agencies (together "RTD") and restrict the use of RTD's
Property for First Amendment political speech.
By accepting paid advertising for display in and on the Property, the RTD is acting in a proprietary capacity as a
provider of public transportation seeking to maximize advertising revenue to support its transportation operations.
Starting from the Effective Date of the new Policy, the RTD does not intend that the advertising permitted to be
displayed in and on the Property be created, designated, or used as a public forum for expressive activities or
general discourse or opinions.
In furtherance of the RTD's purpose of maximizing advertising revenue, the RTD in its proprietary capacity would be
limiting advertisements it will accept for display in and on the Property to paid commercial advertising, certain
public service announcements that will help provide information to the public about RTD’s own and other
government activities to help build goodwill for the RTD among its riders and the public. The RTD would continue to
retain control over the advertising that it will allow to be displayed in and on the Property by subjecting all proposed
advertisements to the Advertising Standards included in the proposed RTD Advertising Policy. This proposed
advertising policy is attached to this report.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD is currently contracted with Lamar Advertising to receive a minimum guarantee of $4,000,000.00 in 2015,
$4,100,000.00 in 2016, and $4,200,000.00 in 2017 in advertising revenues. Non-commercial advertising accounts for
approximately $1,000,000.00 annually of those revenues. Adoption of the revised Advertising Policy may result in
an initial decrease of advertising revenue, as some advertisers will no longer qualify to participate in the RTD
Advertising program. Please also note that those advertisers are currently paying a lower rate for ads than the
commercial rate, and under the proposed updated policy, we will have only one rate. Staff also observes that some
non-commercial advertisers will be able to participate in the proposed advertising program as commercial
advertisers.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the attached proposed advertising policy, effective August 18, 2015. This alternative is the staff
recommendation.
2. Retain the existing RTD On-vehicle Advertising Policy. This alternative is not recommended due to the creation of
a ‘public forum’ on RTD property.

RTD ADVERTISING POLICY
Advertising Program Policy and Objective:
It is the purpose of RTD’s advertising program to
 utilize space on the interior and exterior of its busses and rail vehicles for advertising purposes,
RTD Advertising, Corporate Partnership Program and public service messages to generate
revenue for the construction, operations and maintenance of the District’s facilities and
services,
 to provide information to the public by or about the District and which are produced by the
District
 to provide information to the public about federal state and local, government, programs and
activities when requested specifically by other government agencies (Government
Communications)in furtherance of RTD’s efforts to promote the welfare of the citizens of the
state of Colorado and to cooperate with its federal, state and local partners
Scope of Advertising Policy:
RTD uses the space on RTD rolling stock for the purpose of placement of advertisement only in those
locations made available by RTD for that purpose. This policy applies to sale of that space for advertising
purposes. Any naming rights or sponsorship of RTD lines or facilities will be governed by separate
policies and programs.
Designation of Forum:

Subject:

Updated Authorization of Fiscal Authority to
the General Manager for the North Metro Rail
Line Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors (“Board”)
increase the authority granted to the General Manager or designee to enter into all contracts, real
property transactions and intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Rail Line Project by $56
million to a total authorization of $689.8 million. This authority shall include the ability to negotiate and
execute all contracts; work orders; change orders and contract modifications; agreements for the
acquisition and conveyance of property interests; and intergovernmental agreements that are necessary
or advisable to complete the North Metro Rail Line within the scope of the North Metro Rail Line Project
budget. This action is consistent with previous board actions and the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation
(APE).
BACKGROUND
As part of the RTD FasTracks Plan, the full North Metro Corridor is an approximately 18.5-mile-long
Commuter Rail line extending from Denver Union Station through the City and County of Denver, the
Cities of Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn and parts of Adams County.
In November, 2013, the Board authorized actions related to the North Metro Rail Line project:
 Award of a design/build contract to Regional Rail Partners (RRP) for construction of the North
Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to 124th Avenue, with options to extend to 162nd
Avenue as funds become available.
 Provided the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts and
intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Rail Line Project in the amount not to exceed
the remaining project budget to 124th Avenue of $633.8 million.
 Provided the General Manager or designee with authority to accept grants or other contributions
and to increase the project budget in the amount of third-party contributions for project work
without further Board approval.
 Approved intergovernmental agreements (IGA) with the City of Commerce City, the City of
Thornton, and the City of Northglenn regarding the North Metro Rail Line project. Each IGA
includes specific terms defining the local agency contribution, coordination, and the rights and
responsibilities of each party within the boundaries of each municipality.
 Approved an IGA with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) regarding the North
Metro Rail Line project, including specific terms defining the coordination between CDOT and
RTD and the rights and responsibilities of each party associated with the construction of the
North Metro Rail Line, especially regarding interface with the state highway system.
In May, 2014, the Board approved the issuance of Certificates of Participation (COPs) to fund a portion
of the North Metro Rail Line project, using the section of the corridor from Denver Union Station to 104th

Packet Pg. 114

13.C

Avenue as collateral for the COPs. RTD issued the COPs in the par amount of $441 million in July
2014.
In October, 2014, the Board authorized the transfer of $16 million from FasTracks Railroad Right of Way
budget to a project to construct additional track sidings on the North Metro Rail Line to improve
operational reliability. The Board did not increase the General Manager’s contract authority for the
project at that time.
DISCUSSION
The intense nature of construction projects requires quick decision making capability at the project level.
Failure to provide direction to contractors in a timely manner can result in delays or expensive rework.
Delays in approving change orders can also delay payments to contractors and subcontractors.
Similarly, the ability to acquire, dedicate exchange or dedicate property and property interests, enter into
third party agreements for goods, services, funds or mutually desirable change orders may be required in
time frames that are more abbreviated than board cycles.
Providing this delegation is consistent with previous Board actions for major corridor projects. Based on
this experience, the Board delegated fiscal authority to the amount of the remaining project budget at
the same time that it approved the contract for construction of the project.
Since that time, changes to the project scope and external conditions have necessitated changes in the
project budget, as described below:


Construction of additional passing sidings to improve service reliability along the corridor and
facilitate the future completion of the full corridor to 162nd Avenue.
 Additional hazardous materials costs resulting from additional engineering and soil testing along
the corridor, as well as from negotiations with adjacent property owners
 Property-related impacts resulting from detailed engineering, relocation of the single remaining
freight shipper along the corridor to mitigate impacts on its operations, and mitigation required at
the National Western Stock Show
 Operating and maintenance interface with the Eagle Project, including equipment for additional
North Metro vehicles in the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, developing and integrating the
North Metro communications and control system, and improving service reliability along the
corridor.
The breakdown of the requested fiscal authority for the North Metro Rail Line is detailed below:
Original Project Budget
Recommended Contract Authority Increases
North Metro Sidings - Approved October 2014
Hazardous Materials, Property Impacts, O&M
Interface with Eagle - August 2015 Approval
Subtotal – Recommended Contract Authority
Increases
Updated Contract Authority

$633.8
$16.0
40.0
$56.0
$689.8

FINANCIAL IMPACT
In November, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a total budget of $633.8 million for the remaining
construction of the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to 124th Avenue. Funding for this
contract and the associated RTD cost of construction was provided through the staff identified and

Packet Pg. 115

13.C

Board approved $90 million from the Eagle project savings, use of existing fund balances, and issuance
of COPs to provide $430 million in construction funds. These funds were augmented in October 2014
through a transfer of $16 million from the FasTracks Railroad Right of Way contingency fund, and will
be augmented by $40 million in August 2015 through reallocations of budget funds from other existing
contingency funds, reallocations from other projects completed under budget, and a reduction in the
FasTracks Management Reserve.
Funding for the years 2013-2018 is included in the FasTracks financial plan to be approved by the Board
of Directors in August 2015, with the aggregate amount of remaining funding not to exceed $689.8
million. Any further increases to the project budget will be permitted only where the increase is fully
funded by a third party.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors (“Board”) increase the authority granted to the General Manager or
designee to enter into all contracts, real property transactions and intergovernmental agreements for
the North Metro Rail Line Project by $56 million to a total authorization of $689.8 million. This
authority shall include the ability to negotiate and execute all contracts; work orders; change orders
and contract modifications; agreements for the acquisition and conveyance of property interests; and
intergovernmental agreements that are necessary or advisable to complete the North Metro Rail Line
within the scope of the North Metro Rail Line Project. This action is consistent with previous board
actions and the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE).
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not increase the fiscal authority granted to the General
Manager or designee for the North Metro Rail Line Project, and leave the current limit of $633.8
million in place. This is not recommended as it could delay critical project actions resulting in delays
to the project efforts, expensive rework and delays in payments to contractors and subcontractors.

Approval of 2016 - 2021 Strategic Budget Plan

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: August 18, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the 2016-2021 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s Fiscal Policies states that “RTD will prepare and update
annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital construction and
improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating
programs.”
The SBP is RTD’s six year financial plan. Updated annually, it provides important cash flow planning
information used to determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as
services that the District can provide using projected financial resources. The first year of the SBP
serves as the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
Each year during the SBP process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed
to support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal
and interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the
District. The other major component of the SBP is the estimate of available revenues during the sixyear time period. These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will
have adequate resources to meet cash flow needs.
Capital and operating/maintenance projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits,
and to what extent they meet the RTD mission statement; projects are constrained to operate within
the forecast of revenues and funding sources available for their completion and operation.
The SBP also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit funding through the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council of
Governments. The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal
funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying SBP projects are
included in the TIP.
The 2016-2021 SBP includes service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales and use
taxes. Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2016-2021 are presented
separately in the FasTracks financial plan.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 117

13.D

The attached SBP incorporates the 2015 amended budget and includes all known adjustments and
best estimates at this time. The SBP is being presented to the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee on August 11th with a staff recommendation for Board adoption on August 18th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2016-2021 projected cash flow through the extension of
the 2015 Amended Budget. The column titled “Adjusted Amended Budget 2015” in Exhibit I
incorporates revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget and
subsequent known items.
The SBP is balanced through the six year period after incorporating into the projections both the
March sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business, and reductions, eliminations or
deferrals of SBP requested projects. No service reductions are proposed in the SBP through this
period.
Exhibit I summarizes the 2016-2021 projected cash flow activity based on the staff
recommendation incorporating the following:
 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $131.3 million in 2016 is forecast to be 10% higher than 2015 due to
a fare rate increase in concert with the new fare structure to be rolled out in 2016.
Fare revenue increases by 10% again in 2019 per Board policy of consideration of a
10% fare rate increase every 3 years. No fare rate increases have occurred since
2011. The SBP conservatively assumes zero ridership increase through 2021. (Line 1)
 Sales and use tax incorporates the March quarterly update from the CU-Leeds School
of Business for the years 2015-2021. (Line 2)
 Grant revenue estimates are based upon past trends, formula allocations, known
proceeds, and recent congressional actions. Amounts are escalated at the area
Consumer Price Index (CPI) (obtained from Moody’s) or as identified. (Line 3)
 Other income consists of advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, and IGA and
miscellaneous rental income, escalated at the CPI beginning in 2016. (Line 4)
 Operating expenses (excluding depreciation):
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates as follows: (Line 6)
2016:
3.1%
2017:
3.5%
2018:
3.3%
2019:
3.1%
2020:
2.8%
2021:
2.8%
 Service increase consists of the cost of new CMAQ-funded service projects to be
operated by RTD in years 2016-2018 to include service enhancements on Routes L
and 324, Route 73 extension, Superior and Broomfield call-n-Ride services, and
Anschutz Medical Campus Shuttle. These services are included in the DRCOG TIP.
RTD costs will be reimbursed in full by CMAQ grant funds and contributed funds from
the applicable municipalities. Determination will be made in future years whether to
continue such service at RTD’s cost. (Line 7)
 Costs of operating the West Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide and I-225 are
allocated from Base to FasTracks based on resource drivers, and thus, Base total
expenses are reduced by the amount of the allocation. (Line 8)

Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated amount through
2017 then escalated at the CPI rate for 2018-2021. (Line 9)
 Diesel fuel is budgeted at the 2016 lock price of $2.23/gallon, for a savings of $6.7
million from 2015, and then escalated at the national CPI rates as follows: (Line 10)
2016:
2.6%
2017:
2.7%
2018:
2.7%
2019:
2.5%
2020:
2.3%
2021:
2.2%
 Gasoline is budgeted at $3.00/gallon in 2016, down from $3.40 used in the 2015
Amended Budget, and then escalated at the national CPI rates above. (Line 10)
Specifically identified operating and maintenance projects (also termed “expense projects”)
are included. This is detailed in Exhibit III. (Line 11)
The FasTracks service increase, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base System,
increases by the CPI rate serially each year beginning in 2014. (Line 12)
Interest income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in investable
balances and forecasted interest rates per forward rate curves. (Line 15)
Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each year
(both current debt and future debt) by using debt amortization schedules. Projected
interest payments on future debt issues use current municipal interest rate forward curves
incorporated in debt amortization schedules. (Line 16)
Capital expenditures include all anticipated and specifically identified capital projects and
replacements. This is detailed in Exhibit II. (Line 19)
The capital carryforward estimate is shown for 2015 and 2016. (Line 20)
Per Board policy that established a Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement fund,
staff recommends that funding of the Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement
fund be maintained at a minimum of $3.0 million each year until each fund reaches the
minimum target balance of $30 million, projected to occur in 2019. (Lines 21, 22, 32,
and 33)
Debt issued represents COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition in accordance
with fleet schedules, and debt issued for building construction (assumed to be a LRV
maintenance facility in 2019 and bus maintenance facility in 2021). (Line 24)
Principal payments on debt are derived from individual debt instruments outstanding during
each year (both current debt and future debt) by using debt amortization schedules. (Line
25)
The SBP is balanced during the six-year period as shown by the positive unrestricted yearend fund balance. In 2019, the unrestricted year-end fund balance is projected to exceed
the target balance of $30 million. (Line 31)

Exhibit IV

Packet Pg. 119

13.D

Exhibit IV attached to this document is a listing of capital and operating projects deferred from
2016 that were submitted for consideration during the SBP development process. The SBP
was balanced largely by deferral from 2016 to 2017 of these projects requested for 2016. In
2017, the SBP generates sufficient cash flow to support these deferred projects from 2016.
Exhibit V
Exhibit V attached to this document is a chart of capital projects by type for the current and
last three SBP periods.
Exhibit VI
Exhibit VI attached to this document is a chart of operating and maintenance projects by type
for the current and last three SBP periods.
The 2016-2021 SBP planned capital and expense projects are totaled below, inflated at the CPI rate
starting in 2016:

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its SBP for any Title VI
Impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the SBP will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior to
final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the SBP, Title VI impacts
are reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements (repairs,
replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. The Title VI review will be provided and a
statement from the Planning Department to this effect is attached.
This action item meets policy requirements and the General Manager’s goals of Fiscal
Sustainability/Financial Plan by effecting current and long-range budgeting in a timely manner.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff-recommended SBP provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive unrestricted yearend fund balance in each year of the SBP. However, uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales
tax revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and supplies, as well as economic conditions will continue to
have an impact on the SBP and may challenge staff to present new options and solutions during the
2016 budget period.

1. Adoption of the 2016-2021 SBP, incorporating all items currently in the recommendation by
staff and the other items identified above. This is the recommended action.
2. Defer the adoption of a 2016-2021 SBP to a later date. This is not recommended because the
SBP identifies the capital programs, expenditures, and service guidelines for the 2016 budget
process and adoption of the SBP serves as a confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for
the 2016 Budget.
3. Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2016-2021
SBP. This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the SBP adoption and possible
delay in the 2016 budget process.

Project Description

LRV Purchase of 12
LRVs

This is the first request for purchase of 12 LRVs to
increase the fleet size to 184. O&M costs are for
oversight meetings and on-site inspection.

Rail Operations

LRV Purchase of 15
LRVs

In 2013, Rail Operations and the Planning Department
Districtwide
determined that eighteen (18) Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs)
would need to be purchased in order to meet the
demands of the existing LRT system and accommodate
the opening of the I-225 line in 2016. This analysis led to
the current procurement of twelve (12) vehicles that was
included in the 2015-2017 capital budget plan. In order to
bring the spare ratio to a desired 20% minimum and meet
the anticipated growth in ridership, we need to purchase
fifteen (15) additional vehicles by 2020 (Base System=15,
FasTracks=2). This will increase the fleet from 184 to 201.

Local Government
Capital Requests

Project is an annual program consisting of $300,000 for
Districtwide
transit and/or passenger related improvements, upgrades,
and/or supplemental funding of requested transit
improvements by local governments such as bus pads,
passenger waiting areas, passenger shelters and
benches. In the years of 2016 and 2017, RTD will receive
a FASTER grant stipend from CDOT for State of Good
Repair type projects. These funds will be used to fund
RTD projects that would otherwise have been funded by
RTD base system funds. However, as part of this stipend,
CDOT expects RTD to provide an additional $150,000 of
grants to local governments for transit projects. The funds
from this SBP request will be added to the SBP Local
Government pool so that RTD can meet the terms of the
FASTER stipend and have a meaningful pool of funds to
respond to local government requests.

Asset Management
Program Planning and
Implementation

Asset management, broadly defined, refers to any system District Shops that monitors and maintains things of value to an entity or Operations
group. IT asset management is the set of business
Center
practices that join financial, contractual and inventory
functions to support life cycle management and strategic
decision making for the IT environment. This is also one
of the processes defined within IT service management.
The goal of this project is to replace the current asset
management system, ZenWorks, which is inadequate for
the current and future computing size of the District. A
more robust integrated system is needed for
hardware/software compliance auditing, configuration
control, and adequate capacity forecasting. This includes
the tracking of computers, servers, software, mobile
devices, computer equipment, tablets, laptops, monitors,
etc.

This project will implement a district-wide comprehensive Districtwide
Enterprise Content Management (ECM) solution to
consolidate 65 existing systems that create, capture or
store content at RTD. The project scope will include the
development of policies, procedures, taxonomy and
metadata for the consistent identification, storage,
maintenance, retrieval, retention, and destruction of data.
The project also will include identification of personnel
and tools required to implement the policies and
procedures, implementation of the system, and the
development of training and audit tools to support the
ongoing utilization of the system.
The current project cost estimate assumes that RTD will
own and maintain the hardware and software in-house.
The first phase of this project includes an evaluation of
potential ECM tools, which will include externally hosted
systems or software-as-a-service (SaaS) systems. If a
hosted or SaaS system is selected, the cost structure of
the project will change.

Operations
used by RideChecker personnel to gather infield ridership Center
information, being managed by the same group.
Currently, there are a total of 67 mobile tablets in use: 52
Call-n-Ride and 15 RideChecker. In 2013, 20 machines
were replaced with the Panasonic H2 Tablet, leaving 47
needing replacement in 2015, with 15 in dire need. Even
though the tablets are ruggedized, they still have a higher
break rate than a standard PC that resides within an office
setting. The total number of on-shelf inventory needs to
increase to accommodate time involved with break/fix full
turnaround. An additional 8 tablets are needed in order to
reduce service interruption that has been an issue for
several years. Also, the unit hardware will be set to a 3
year life cycle. Request is based on increased unit
numbers: 55 Call-n-Ride, and 20 RideChecker for a total
of 75 in service and ready inventory tablets.

TrapezeCOM has been the only CRM tool in use for the
Civic Center
past 8 years at RTD and most departments find it difficult Plaza (CCP)
to use and limited in its functionality. Various
departments/projects like Communications, Fastracks,
and the SmartCard system use their own CRM tools to
collect customer feedback that is not integrated. The
recommendation from the Smart Card Business Process
Reingeneering (SMT BPR) is that RTD procure and
implement an Enterprise Level CRM system that would
meet the needs of all departments and projects. The first
phase (2015) of this project is to initiate an enterpise-level
study to perform a needs analysis, develop processes
and procedures, document required reports and key
performance measures, perform a gap analysis and make
recommendations on a system to meet the current and
future needs of RTD. The second phase (2016) is to
purchase and implement an enterpise CRM. If the CRM
study shows there is an acceptable hosted cloud based
offering, like salesforce.com, the required capital funding
would drop and be replaced with annual expense and IT
would only need to request 1 new FTE.

The Light Rail SCADA team and IT Network group are
Civic Center
spending a significant effort in 2015 to separate the
Plaza (CCP)
SCADA network and the corporate network infrastructure.
This separation is necessary in order to isolate and
protect the SCADA network for the safety and security of
the District. Once complete, a need still exists for RTD to
collect data from the SCADA network, which will consist
of train location data (based on track sensors) to support
the real-time project. This can be accomplished in a safe
and secure manner by implementing a bi-directional flow
of network traffic from the SCADA network to the
corporate network without allowing any access to SCADA
assets. This is implemented through a waterfall (unidirectional) firewall device. This request is to procure the
hardware necessary to implement this solution. Real
Time Passenger Information (RTPI) will provide RTD
passengers with predictive arrival times for their next bus.
IT and Marketing are working toward providing predictive
arrival times for buses via three primary delivery systems:
General Transit Feed Specification for Real Time or
GTFS-RT (which will provide the information to Google
Maps and some third party application developers),
Passenger Information Display (PID) signs, and the RTD
website.

RTD relies heavily on its storage units to house 95% of all District Shops - $
District information and computing services. A wide array Operations
of departments and applications use these storage units Center
to store mission-critical data. Computer data storage,
often called storage or memory, is a technology consisting
of computer components and recording media used to
retain digital information. It is a core function and
fundamental component of computers. The central
processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates
raw information by performing computations. In practice,
almost all computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts
fast but expensive and small storage options close to the
CPU and slower but larger and cheaper options farther
away. In computing, a portfolio of storage products,
including: online storage, near-online (nearline) storage,
storage networking, archiving, de-duplication, storage and
backup software are required to run the Enterprise.

Currently, whenever RTD acquires or disposes off any
Districtwide
property right (fee simple, easement, or license
agreement), it utilizes an external survey firm (Jacobs) to
establish the location of that property right on the ground,
and prepare Right-of-Way maps, legal descriptions and
exhibits. The contract with Jacobs will expire at the end of
2016. Jacobs has surveys, Computer Aided Design (CAD)
files, information on adjoining properties, subdivision
plats, ALTA surveys, legal descriptions, and other
electronic and paper records regarding RTD properties
going back to 1997. The extent of this information is
estimated to be 2 to 4 terabytes, which could be equated
to 76,000 to 152,000 bankers boxes of information. These
documents also include information on utilities that cross,
or service RTD stations, rail lines, Park-n-Rides, and
other properties.Organizations that have assets in various
geographic locations typically utilize Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) to record and analyze their
asset base. Utilities and local municipalities are examples
of such organizations. RTD has been using GIS systems
for about 15 years. Currently, these systems are used
mostly used by the Telephone Information Center (TIC),
Scheduling (Transtar), and CAD/AVL. RTD is also getting
started on projects like real-time train arrival information,
which would also need GIS support.This project request is
to sort through Jacobs property survey records, bring this
information within RTD, and organize it on an engineering
GIS platform. Initially, the system will house information
on properties, utilities, track, pnR’s, crossings, and
structures. The system can be expanded to include other
items like the catenary system.

Auto-Scope Upgrade

Real-Time Passenger
Information Integration
with Light Rail SCADA
System

The real-time project team is working on collecting track- Mariposa Light
based train location information from the Light Rail
Rail Division
SCADA system. In order to obtain real-time train location
information for LRVs, modifications to RTD’s light rail train
tracking system (SCADA) are needed to provide a realtime data feed from track-based events including when a
vehicle passes through TWC (train to wayside
communicator) and the beginning and end of track
segments (included in the Integration request). During a
feasibility study, we identified an issue in the Denver
downtown area where the frequency of TWCs along the
tracks are not frequent enough to provide optimal train
locations. This has been referred to as a "dark territory".
To enhance the data feed, auto-scopes (cameras) can be
used to augment data through the following events: 1)
Video track segment occupancy (VTO). This update will
occur when the control system has determined from input
received from a video camera that a train has arrived in a
section of track associated with that specific camera. 2)
Video track segment vacancy (VTV). This update will
occur when the control system has determined from input
received from a video camera that a train has departed
from a section of track associated with that specific video
camera. This request is to install new auto-scopes at key
downtown stations to enable this.

of effort in making RTPI available lies in gathering existing
information from various sources, converting this
information into a common format that in turn can feed
multiple end-user sources including mobile devices.
Current scope of the project only includes bus
information. Request is to extend scope to include data
from our LR system. To do so, we need to make

Portal Protection
Project, Revised Phase

This project is for a redesigned and revised “Phase 2”
Denver Union
resulting in a reduction of $1M in the project cost. The
Station
savings was accomplished by eliminating Automatic Bus Complex
RFID Reader Technology and In Ground Emergency
Portal Pop-up Barriers. A physical network connection to
existing “Starters Stations” and the DUS Security Office
was also eliminated. The project has been redesigned to
work in conjunction with Phase 1 Guard Booths that will
be manned by security 24/7. The project will include
redesign work and the addition of Electric Gate Arms at
each entry portal and will be manually controlled from the
Guard Booth as authorized vehicles approach. The
project will also include additional signage and a "Red
Light - Green Light" system which will be operated from
the Guard Booth and provide indication to Bus Operators

ITS
Opportunity grant to fund a capital project to reduce travel
time and increase security and ridership for 15L bus
route. The project includes: stop amenity improvements
(repair and replace existing amenities, lighting, shelters,
security cameras), bus bulbs at a few locations, transit
signal priority (TSP), and bypass lanes/queue jumps. The
project includes East Colfax from Broadway east to
Potomac (near I-225). It is important to note that from
Yosemite to Potomac, the project will only include
improved stop amenities. RTD local match is $1.83M.

Northwest Rail
Bus Rapid Transit @ SH Project is to construct approximately 18 miles of Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor to connect
Line
119
Boulder and Longmont in accordance with the
recommendation of the Northwest Area Mobility Study
(NAMS). It is anticipated that approximately half of the
total costs for this project would be grant-funded. The
establishment of BRT in the corridor would raise ridership
from approximately 1,900 to approximately 5,000 daily
weekday riders in 2035. Detailed cost estimates and
design will be established through the upcoming
environmental clearance study and preliminary
engineering, previously approved in the SBP. The project
is anticipated to take two years to construct. This request
is for the first year of construction.

DRCOG, through the Transportation Improvement
Districtwide
Program (TIP), has allocated $1 million in funding for FY
2017 for this project. RTD would be required to provide a
25 percent local match of $250,000. Given the results of
the Northwest Area Mobility Study, which showed
substantial bus ridership increases from modest capital
improvements made to arterial corridors, there has been
much interest from other areas of the District for RTD to
make arterial BRT investments in other corridors. The
purpose of this study will be to examine the potential for
arterial BRT investments throughout the entire District and
prioritize for future capital investment those corridors
which perform the highest.

include a complete street network plan for downtown,
considering vehicular mobility and one-way/two-way
conversion, future transit needs (both bus and rail),
bicycle infrastructure, and signal timing. The original
DMAP (2004) identified the need for a downtown

strategies could include:
- additional bus transfer facilities
- pedestrian improvements
- bike access improvements
- improved bike storage
- expanded or new drop off/pick up areas
- transit speed and reliability improvements on bus routes
connecting to the station
The plan would identify potential partnerships with other
public and private entities to implement these strategies.
Finally, the plan would prioritize potential improvements

Datacenter Cloud Study A data center is a facility used to house computer
systems and associated components, such as
Station
(WO)
telecommunications and storage systems. Large data
Complex
centers are industrial scale operations using as much
electricity as a small town.RTD remains as dependent as
ever on its primary data center located at District Shops to
meet its objectives. Rigorous data center capacity
planning and management is critical to serving today's
enterprise. These disciplines are required to insure that
the data center can accommodate the needs of the
business. RTD's District Shops datacenter has reached
the number of equipment / devices it can reasonably store
without causing damage RTD must look to expand the
datacenter.

This project will implement a district-wide comprehensive Districtwide
Enterprise Content Management (ECM) solution to
consolidate 65 existing systems that create, capture or
store content at RTD. The project scope will include the
development of policies, procedures, taxonomy and
metadata for the consistent identification, storage,
maintenance, retrieval, retention, and destruction of data.
The project also will include identification of personnel
and tools required to implement the policies and
procedures, implementation of the system, and the
training and audit tools to support the ongoing system.The
current project cost estimate assumes that RTD will own
and maintain the hardware and software in-house. Six
new FTEs planned for post-implementation after mid2018 (5 records analysts, 1 ECM systems analyst).

Unit Replacement

RTD relies heavily on its storage units to house 95% of all District Shops - $
District information and computing services. A wide array Operations
of departments and applications use these storage units Center
to store mission-critical data. Computer data storage,
often called storage or memory, is a technology consisting
of computer components and recording media used to
retain digital information. It is a core function of
computers. The central processing unit (CPU) of a
computer is what manipulates raw information by
performing computations. In practice, almost all
computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but
expensive and small storage options close to the CPU
and slower but larger and cheaper options farther away.

IT Managed Services Tier 1 Support

RTD needs technology to operate efficiently and to
Districtwide
compete effectively. But as reliance on IT grows, the
resources needed to support this increasingly complex IT
environment may not. In many areas, IT resources are
limited and can be quickly overwhelmed.
We have seen from prior instances that if we fall behind in
keeping up with things such as backups, patches and
security, the odds greatly increase that RTD will face an
IT outage or another problem down the road that will
negatively impact RTD business. For instance, once RTD
rolls out real- time information to the customer and we
have an outage, it will negatively impact customers' view
of RTD.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: August 4, 2015

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

July 31, 2015

Board Meeting Date: August 18, 2015

Subject:

Award Contract for the Supply of 36 Mall
Shuttle Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to execute a contract with BYD Motors, Inc. for
the supply of 36 – 45’ mall shuttle buses and associated spare components in an amount not to exceed
$27,100,000.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has initiated the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance mall shuttle sub-fleet.
RTD’s existing TransTeq mall shuttle buses are currently between 14 and 15 years old. They have
exceeded their service life of 12 years, become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep
them in service. Some of the mall buses have experienced structural fatigue failure or other major
problems that have kept them out of service. The bus manufacturer, TransTeq, went out of business
over 10 years ago. Many of the parts required for the repair of the buses are no longer available. The
current mall bus fleet is not sustainable for continued passenger service.
The mall shuttle buses are unique because of the many unique features necessary for the bus operation
in the pedestrian mall environment, such as right hand operator position, 45’ in length, 3 to 4 wide
passenger doors, completely low and flat floor, etc. Industry standard bus manufacturers, such as Gillig
and New Flyer, do not have such bus type in production and do not want to expend their resources in
the engineering and manufacture of the buses because of their low potential sales volume. A small
number of specialty bus manufacturers that produced the mall bus type in the past, such as TransTeq
and DesignLine, went out of business after a short time in existence. To allow more bids for the supply
of the new mall buses, RTD opened up the procurement process not only to domestic market suppliers
but also to the larger international market. Only two companies, both international, submitted their
proposals. No high-volume legacy US bus manufacturer’s submitted proposals. Other international bus
manufacturers that could produce buses meeting RTD requirements did not submit their proposals
because of the high cost to bring the foreign-produced buses into compliance with the US vehicle safety
regulations.
DISCUSSION
RTD issued Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-FK-005 in June of 2014. Two proposals were received on
September 9, 2014. Shaw International, Inc. proposed conventional CNG buses, and BYD Motors, Inc.
proposed fully electric buses. The proposed pricing is listed below.

Packet Pg. 164

13.E

Shaw International, Inc. – CNG Buses
BYD Motors, Inc. – Electric Buses

$666,855 per bus
$748,051 per bus

Shaw International is a distributor for King Long Bus of China. King Long Bus is one of China’s largest
coach and bus manufacturers, annually producing 25,000 buses and over 30,000 mini vans. The
proposed buses would be produced entirely in China and imported into the US.
BYD Motors is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BYD Ltd, which is 50% US owned through shareholders.
Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway is the company’s single largest shareholder with 9.9%. BYD is a
large international corporation established in 1995 with over 200,000 employees worldwide. BYD is the
world’s largest manufacturer of rechargeable batteries. It is also the largest Chinese auto manufacturer
and the world’s largest electric bus manufacturer. BYD produces over 1000 electric buses a year. BYD
has built buses similar to the mall buses with the driver position on the right for countries that have
adopted the British road rule. BYD proposed the bus chassis to be built in China, and shipped to its final
assembly plant in Lancaster, California for completing the manufacturing process. The BYD buses will
meet all US vehicle safety standards and Buy America Requirements.
Staff has evaluated the two proposals based on several criteria such as costs for initial purchase and
lifetime operation, compliance with RTD technical requirements, company’s technical and manufacturing
ability and its experience in the US transit bus market.
Costs:
Staff has performed a life cycle cost analysis of the two proposed buses to determine which bus power
configuration would result in the most cost effective, energy efficient and best value proposal.
The electric bus provides the best energy cost efficiency. Over the 12-year life span, it is estimated the
electric bus would yield a savings of $99,956, at current prices, in energy consumption over the CNG
buses. This savings would more than offset the bus purchase cost difference of $81,196. In addition,
the electric bus would eliminate many major bus components such as engine and transmission and allow
additional savings in maintenance and repair cost. The cost of ownership to include bus purchase and
operating costs over the 12-year life of the electric bus would be $139,500 per bus less than those of
the proposed CNG buses. Both power systems require modifications to the maintenance facility;
however, the cost to modify RTD’s Platte maintenance facility for operating the electric buses is
estimated at only half the cost to upgrade the CNG fuel station for operating the CNG buses,
at$405,000 for electric buses vs. $900,000 for CNG buses.

In addition, the proposed BYD electric bus cost is equally competitive to the cost, inflation adjusted, of
the diesel electric hybrid bus in previous mall bus purchases. It is lower than the RTD internal cost
estimate. It is also within the RTD existing budget for unit bus cost.

Packet Pg. 165

13.E

Technical Specifications:
The BYD proposed bus meets all of RTD’s technical requirements to include some desirable features
such as efficient use of the bus floorplan to allow a large passenger capacity of 111, full rear window,
passenger air conditioning, zero emissions and low noise, etc. The proposed King Long bus is less
efficient in passenger capacity caused by the large space occupied by the full sized CNG bus engine and
transmission connecting to a regular low floor rear axle. This results in a smaller passenger area behind
the rear axle. Its passenger capacity is 18% lower than the BYD electric bus, at 94 vs 111. The Shaw
proposed bus does not have a full sized rear window.
The electric bus is much cleaner and quieter than the CNG bus in terms of exhaust emission and noise
emission. The electric bus produces zero tailpipe emissions and is nearly silent. The CNG bus produces
higher exhaust and noise emissions. At this time, the bus industry appears to be headed toward an allelectric-bus future. In the past, the primary constraints to purchasing electric buses have been battery
capacity and cost. BYD has overcome both concerns. The BYD proposed system has demonstrated the
battery capacity to perform the mall duty cycle at a reasonable purchase cost. BYD has also eliminated a
major cost concern associated with the potential need to replace the expensive batteries, by offering a
12-year warranty on the batteries.
Bus Manufacturing Capability, Build Location and Experience in US Transit Bus Industry:
BYD buses will be assembled in Lancaster, CA. The bus build process is similar to the process employed
by a number of current bus manufacturers such as MCI and New Flyer. The bus chassis will be
manufactured outside of the US, in China, but the majority of the bus will be assembled in the US. By
being assembled in the US and containing 60% or more US contents, the proposed BYD buses will meet
the current Buy America Requirements. The BYD build process with final assembly in the US allows
RTD a greater degree of oversight during the manufacture process and faster responses to issues. As
part of its due diligence process, RTD staff has visited BYD plant in Lancaster, CA. Staff has verified
BYD’s capable bus manufacturing ability provided by its modern and efficient assembly facility.
The buses proposed by Shaw International would be built entirely in China. This provides significant
challenges for inspection, design verification, and issue resolution due to distance and language barrier.
BYD has a number of buses in service with various agencies in the US. It has recently delivered five
buses to Los Angeles MTA. It has won the contract award in Long Beach for 10 buses with options for
additional 50 buses. RTD has visited Antelope Valley Transit Authority (AVTA) in California to review its
BYD bus operation. AVTA has two BYD buses in operation since last year. The buses have been reliable
and allowed more than 200 miles of service before needing a battery charge. In contrast, Shaw
International/King Long Bus has no buses in service in the US.

Conclusion:
The evaluation by Staff indicates the proposal by BYD as the best value, lowest risk proposal providing
the most advanced and clean power technology desirable for the 16th Mall Street operation at a
reasonable initial purchase cost and lowest lifetime operating cost. BYD has proposed an accelerated bus
production process. The first pilot bus is scheduled for completion of manufacturing and delivery for
testing and evaluation in April 2016. The rest of the buses are scheduled for completion between May
and September 2016.
The 45’ mall shuttle buses are fully low and flat floor with three wide passenger doors for ease of
passenger boarding and de-boarding. For safety reasons, they have the driver platform on the right
hand side similarly to existing mall buses. They will be equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two
wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance. Their clean battery electric power system
produces zero vehicle exhaust emissions. The buses will have a passenger air conditioning system to
improve passenger comfort. They will be equipped with an automatic passenger count system and a
security digital camera system. They can carry up to 111 passengers to meet the heavy demand of
mall service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This mall shuttle purchase was included in the adopted 2015 Amended Budget by a carryforward and
new capital totaling $24,147,350. The remaining amount needed to complete the purchase will be
funded by a FASTER grant of $3.9 million that became available subsequent to approval of the Amended
Budget, providing for total available funding of $28M. The FASTER grant requires an equal match of
$3.9 million from local funds that will come from the budgeted $24,147,350. The $405,000 needed to
modify the maintenance facility to accommodate the enhanced charging needs associated with the
electric buses has been requested as part of the 2016 requested budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, BYD has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its DBE
plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the Interim General Manager to award the contract to BYD for the purchase of 3645’ mall shuttle buses and associated spare parts. This is the recommended alternative.
2. To award the contract to Shaw International/King Long Bus. This is not a recommended
alternative since the company has proposed CNG bus, requiring a higher cost of owner ship. It is
also a riskier alternative due to the lack of experience of the manufacturer in the US transit
market, its entire manufacturing process in China and its non-compliance with the Buy America
Requirements. This would also contradict the results of RTD’s procurement process.
3. Do not authorize the contract award and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it may result
in a no-bid situation in the repeated procurement process with limited qualified bidders, and at the
very least would result in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the
project. This would also result in increased problems with existing mall service due to the
difficulty in keeping the TransTeq mall buses in safe and reliable operation.

Sponsorship Naming Rights Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the General Manager or his
designee be authorized to enter into an agreement with the University of Colorado (CU) for the
sponsorship naming rights on the A Line and an exterior advertising position on the Flatiron Flyer line for
a five-year period, with a mutually agreed upon right to extend this agreement for an additional five
years. Under the terms of the agreement, RTD would receive $905,000.00 in the first agreement year
with a 5% escalation factor for each contract year through year five, with the right to mutually extend
this agreement for an additional five years, also with a 5% escalation factor each year. Over the initial
five-year period of the contract, RTD would receive a gross amount of $5,000,696.00. It is further
recommended that the revenue from this contract be placed in the Board Reserve Account, which gives
the Board flexibility in determining its specific usage.
BACKGROUND
The Long Range Fiscal Sustainability Task Force, convened by the RTD Board in 2010 to explore longrange cost reductions and revenue enhancements, issued its report to the RTD Board in June, 2011.
Under the “Revenue Enhancement” category of the report, Naming Rights were included as a
recommended source of additional revenue. Specifically, the report stated, “Consider fees for naming or
‘sponsoring’ facilities (such as stations) or services (such as rail lines).” In 2012, the RTD Board of
Directors authorized the General Manager or designee to issue a Request for Proposals for a Corporate
Sponsorship/Naming Rights partner to act as an agent for RTD to seek additional revenue through such
naming rights sponsorships. RTD received five proposals, and through the procurement process the RTD
Board approved the contract award to WME/IMG In December of 2012, Notice to Proceed was provided
to WME/IMG, to pursue Naming Rights Sponsorships on behalf of RTD. Following a comprehensive
market review, research and valuation process, RTD officially announced its Sponsorship Naming Rights
program to the public in July of 2014.
DISCUSSION
Through our agent WME/IMG, RTD staff is presenting the RTD Board of Directors for review and
approval a proposed sponsorship naming rights agreement with the University of Colorado (CU) for the
sponsorship naming rights on the A Line and an exterior advertising position on the Flatiron Flyer. Rights
and benefits to the sponsorship naming partner are detailed in the term sheet that will be included with
the final agreement and include: naming rights to the specified rail line, advertising category exclusivity
on the rail line and advertising category exclusivity on the bus line, signage on the dedicated rail
alignment, exterior advertisements on the rail and bus vehicles, and sponsor name and logo use on RTD
digital assets and RTD printed collateral which refer to the sponsor-named line. CU will also have the
right to promote this naming rights partnership through its materials. Note that CU’s payments will be
subject to annual appropriation by their Board of Regents. A copy of the term sheet (that will be included
with the final agreement), is attached to this Board Report as Exhibit A.

Packet Pg. 169

13.F

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The proposed sponsorship naming rights agreement will result in $5,000,696.00 in gross revenue to
support the operation of RTD services. In the first year of the agreement, a portion of the revenue will
need to be utilized for the implementation and activation of the naming right partner benefits, including
signage and updating of collateral materials. Per the Board’s previously-approved contract, our agent
WME/IMG will receive an annual payment of 12 percent of gross revenues.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the General Manager or
his designee be authorized to enter into an agreement with the University of Colorado (CU) for the
sponsorship naming rights on the A Line and an exterior advertising position on the Flatiron Flyer line
for a five-year period, with a mutually agreed upon right to extend this agreement for an additional
five years. Under the terms of the agreement, RTD would receive $905,000.00 in the first
agreement year with a 5% escalation factor for each contract year up through year five, with the
right to mutually extend this agreement for an additional five years, also with a 5% escalation factor
each year. Over the initial five-year period of the contract, RTD would receive a gross amount of
$5,000,696.00. It is further recommended that the revenue from this contract be placed in the Board
Reserve Account, which gives the Board flexibility in determining its specific usage.
2. Do not enter into the proposed sponsorship naming rights agreement presented. This alternative
is not recommended because it would result in the loss of sponsorship revenue.

Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016
Goals

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the Interim General Manager’s goals for 2016 as defined in the attached
General Manager’s Performance Evaluation Form.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee works with the General
Manager to enhance its oversight responsibilities for the General Manager’s performance and to develop
processes that are approved by the full Board and are transparent to the public.
On July 20, 2010, the Board formalized and approved the goal setting process for the General Manager.
That process defines the steps the Board will follow in establishing the annual goals for the General
Manager. Beginning in 2011, these goals include core and task goals. Core goals are based on the
General Manager’s job description and are generally considered part of the ongoing responsibilities of the
General Manager. The task goals are a compilation of the priorities from the annual joint Board and staff
Advance Planning Session that occurs at the beginning of the year.
One of the steps in the process is to formalize the General Manager’s annual goals using the same
salaried employee performance evaluation form that is used by the rest of the RTD employees. This
action item is to formalize that process.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair and the full committee
have reviewed these 2016 core and task goals with the Interim General Manager and approved them on
7/07/15 to move to the full Board for approval.
DISCUSSION
Please refer to the attached General Manager Performance Evaluation form which identifies the five core
goals for 2016 and the three task goals for 2016. The attached Interim General Manager Tactical Plan
for 2016 is submitted as a supplement to this document.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to implementing this policy.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept this recommended action for approval of the Interim General Manager’s 2016 goals. This
will complete the formalized process as approved by the Board members for goal setting.
2. Do not accept this recommended action. Work with the Interim General Manager to revise the
2016 goals. This will delay the schedule established for the approval of the goals.

GM TACTICAL PLAN FOR 2016
Strategic Goal #1
Fiscal Sustainability

Throughout its history, RTD has had to adapt its service levels and capital programs to
different financial conditions due to the variability in sales and use taxes, its largest source
of revenue. One of the strategic goals established by the RTD Board for 2016 relates to
fiscal sustainability in order for RTD to continue to achieve its mission to meet its
constituents' transportation needs in a cost-effective manner. As a part of this goal, the
Board and staff identified specific focus areas:










Increased Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Costs
Impact of the New Fare Structure
Affordable Fares
Identification of New Revenue Sources
Increase in Existing Revenue Streams
Parking Revenue
Service Levels, Revenue Rates and Utilization of Unused Capacity (Ridership)
Partnerships
Avoiding “Mission Creep”

Each of these areas will be addressed in 2016, with the overall intent of planning for the
delivery of fiscally sustainable and innovative financial plans for the six-year time horizon
of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), and through the 2040 horizon year of the DRCOG
Regional Transportation Plan (RTP).
Increased Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs
Increases in O&M costs will occur in 2016 from two primary areas: 1.) inflation and wage
increases, and 2.) growth in service from five corridor openings.
Those openings include the East Line, Gold Line, Northwest Rail Segment, I-225 and Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT). As revenue service begins on each of these elements, expenditures
will shift from capital to operations.
RTD has included these projected operating costs in its financial forecasts. RTD is carefully
planning the allocation of resources for 2016. For a significant portion of those costs,
RTD has budget certainty in that contracted service payments will be made to the
concessionaire for the East Line, Gold Line and Northwest Rail Segment. The O&M costs
for I-225 and BRT have been projected according to historical O&M costs.

Attachment: 2015-05-12 Goal 1 (2473 : Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals)

Background

Additional projections for O&M support services such as Security, Administration, Finance,
etc., are also being carefully evaluated. Many of the supporting costs are shared by both
the Base System and FasTracks. An allocation methodology and identification of direct
costs will be applied to ensure costs are recorded where incurred. Because the Base
1

Packet Pg. 186

13.G.c

System and FasTracks are evaluated separately as a result of FasTracks funding not being
available for the Base System, RTD will focus its efforts to apply costs to each fund
accurately with a utilization-based allocation. This will also provide for more accurate
financial analysis of results and performance.

Impact of New Fare Structure
The financial impact of the proposed new fare structure has been carefully evaluated by
the fare study contractor CH2M. The proposed changes have been modeled using
expected ridership and fare program participation data to provide reasonable assurance
that the SBP fare revenue targets are met to ensure fiscal sustainability. Staff will closely
monitor and analyze the fare collection results upon implementation.
Affordable Fares
“Affordable fares” has been identified as a strong concern by certain parties through the
fare study public participation process.
The financial impact of affordable fares,
specifically defined as discounted fares for low income residents, is being modeled under
different proposed scenarios. Note that any increased fare reductions or expanded
distribution of discounted fare products beyond RTD’s long-standing Non-Profit Agency
Reduced Fares program will have additional, negative revenue impacts to RTD. RTD is
working closely with low-income resident interest groups to identify possible changes or
additions to the Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fares program that can balance the needs of
low-income riders with ensuring that any negative impact to revenue can be mitigated for
fiscal sustainability. The financial impact of these scenarios is being modeled and, if
implemented, will be closely monitored and analyzed.
Identification of New Revenue Sources
In accordance with the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force recommendations, RTD will
continue to pursue new or additional revenue opportunities including:




Corporate sponsorships and naming rights contracts
Evaluation of monetizing parking facilities
Evaluation of fare pass programs

In addition, RTD will continue to explore revenue sources such as the sale of assets and
easements not required for transit purposes, leasing and contracting for the operation and
management of assets that can be operated by third parties at a cost savings, and
developing shared facilities where RTD and developers can combine resources and reduce
costs for both site development and operating costs. RTD will also continue to assess
other program funding or acceleration opportunities as they arise, such as federal and
state grants.

Attachment: 2015-05-12 Goal 1 (2473 : Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals)

Fiscal sustainability for these costs will be monitored closely to ensure they fall within the
forecasted amounts.

Increase in Existing Revenue Streams






Implementation of proposed fare structure to meet SBP target
Increased sales tax revenue through exemption parity with the State
Continuing partnership with the Department of Revenue to verify tax compliance
and reporting of RTD sales/use tax collections
Enhanced collection of ridership data for pass pricing

Parking Revenue
In 2015, RTD received an unsolicited proposal to monetize parking. RTD determined that
the proposal had merit and, with Board Approval, decided to further investigate the
possibility of producing additional revenue from its parking facilities.
Currently RTD has a contractor that provides parking services in which RTD shares in
parking revenues above a certain threshold. With the addition of several new parking
facilities in 2016, RTD will further evaluate their most efficient financial use.
Several concerns must be considered including private use, federal interest, and elasticity
of fares and parking rates. RTD is undertaking additional internal evaluation of the
financial potential of these facilities.
Service Levels and Revenue Rates
RTD staff and Board continue to focus on RTD's mission to meet our constituents' present
and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean reliable, courteous, accessible and
cost-effective service throughout the District. These services include fixed route bus
service, light rail service, paratransit services for the general public (Call-n-Ride) and transit
services for individuals with disabilities (Access-a-Ride) as well as services provided by
partner agencies and supported by RTD (van pools, etc.). Staff will continue to work with
the Board of Directors to ensure that services are delivered in an efficient manner while
also recognizing the financial realities facing the organization.
In order to ensure that services continue to meet the ever-changing needs of our
community, RTD implements service changes three times per year: in January, May when
school lets out, and in August when school resumes. The timing of these changes is set
forth in RTD’s Collective Bargaining Agreement with represented employees. Under normal
circumstances, these service changes or "run boards" in our jargon, allow RTD to adjust
the levels of transit service provided to better correspond to the level of service needed by
our customers. These service changes also provide the means by which RTD adjusts levels
of service to conform to prevailing economic conditions and responds to changes in
operating conditions.

Attachment: 2015-05-12 Goal 1 (2473 : Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals)

RTD will continue to pursue opportunities to increase existing revenue streams including:

3

Packet Pg. 188

13.G.c









The performance of these services (measured by ridership) based upon RTD Service
Standards (ridership per hour of transit service provided, subsidy per passenger
boarding, etc.);
The effects of the potential changes on the overall transit network (system
impacts) and on transit dependent riders;
The availability of reasonable alternative transit services;
The ability to enhance services when possible given financial circumstances;
The distribution/impacts of such changes throughout the District and throughout
the RTD Family of Services (Local, Express, Regional, Call-n-ride, LRT, etc.); and
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to be sure that services are equitably provided
without regard to race, color, national origin, etc.

In addition to the above referenced service planning considerations, RTD Service Planning
staff works closely with RTD Finance to ensure that service adjustments reflect the
financial realities of the organization. This includes the impact on revenue rates.
The consideration of these issues provides a systematic, objective and rational framework
within which RTD staff can evaluate potential changes in services in order to maximize
ridership and optimize the use of RTD's resources.
In many ways, "service standards" could also be referred to as "expectations" as they
reflect what RTD's performance expectations are in terms of ridership and subsidy for a
service (route) to be considered successful. The purpose of the standards is to help
identify routes that are most in need of service changes in order to maximize ridership and
optimize the use of RTD's resources.
In applying these standards, RTD's guidelines call for routes falling below the lowest 10%
productivity threshold based on either subsidy per passenger boarding or passengers
boarding per service hour, or below the lowest 25% productivity threshold for both
measures, to be evaluated for marketing, revision, or as a last resort, possible elimination.
These are not the sole criteria as RTD's service standards also take into account services
provided to areas of high transit dependency, and RTD staff also considers the existence
of alternative transit services in a given area when developing service recommendations.
The process to implement service changes consists of:





RTD staff develops a set of initial service change recommendations for
consideration;
RTD staff presents the initial recommendations to the Board of Directors and
presents these initial recommendations to the public for public comment;
RTD staff holds public meetings in areas throughout the District that would
potentially be impacted by the proposed changes;
RTD staff develops a final set of proposed service changes based on the initial
recommendations and potential modifications based on public comment, and;

Attachment: 2015-05-12 Goal 1 (2473 : Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals)

When evaluating potential changes in RTD services, RTD staff considers several factors.
Primary among these service planning guiding principles are:

4

Packet Pg. 189

13.G.c



RTD staff presents the final service change proposals to the Board of Directors for
final approval and/or modification by Board action.

In order to support the Board of Directors in their policy deliberations, staff provides
detailed ridership information, cost information and revenue information to help identify the
rationale behind service change recommendations. These recommendations are discussed
at both Operations/Customer Services Committee meetings and Board meetings. Staff also
presents annual service evaluation reports to the Board of Directors to help communicate
the performance of the various services provided by RTD. Staff also stands prepared to
assist with the conduct of any workshops/study sessions on this topic that might be
desired by the Board of Directors.
Partnerships
RTD will continue to identify opportunities to enhance its revenues, reduce its capital and
operating costs, and provide new and innovative long-term financing opportunities through
partnerships. Potential strategies to do so include, but are not limited to, the following:













Pursuit of partnerships with FasTracks stakeholders to obtain additional local match
funds to complete FasTracks corridors
Implementation of private public partnerships proposals for FasTracks, and for other
projects that provide benefits to RTD and fit within the financial plans
Completion of FTA New Starts process and local participation for the Southeast Rail
extension
Contracting to provide O&M services on the North Metro Rail Line
Pursuit of a long-term solution to maintaining and operating on the 16th Street Mall
Endorsing and supporting efforts to collect sales tax revenues on internet sales
Leasing and contracting for the operation and management of assets that can be
operated by third parties at a cost savings, such as parking facilities
Development of shared facilities including parking, transfer centers, plazas,
walkways and bike-facilities at transit oriented or joint development projects where
RTD and developers can combine resources and reduce costs for site development
and amenities and operating cost
Sale of assets and easements that do not interfere with existing or future RTD
operations
Sale of other assets not required for transit purposes
Continued pursuit of federal and state competitive grants as opportunities arise

Attachment: 2015-05-12 Goal 1 (2473 : Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals)

The entire service change process usually takes a period of 3-4 months from the time of
development of the initial service change proposal until implementation of the service
adjustments.

Avoiding “Mission Creep”
In meeting the Board’s goal of Fiscal Sustainability, RTD will focus on its core mission “To
meet our constituents’ present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the District”. As
5

Packet Pg. 190

13.G.c

such, RTD will avoid efforts that extend beyond its mission.

Based on the Regional Transportation Plan prepared by DRCOG and the goals and
objectives adopted by the Board of Directors, RTD develops its six-year SBP each year.
The SBP is a fiscally constrained plan which presents aggregate projected service levels
and capital and expense projects expected to be undertaken for the next six years.
Projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits, how well they meet the
RTD mission statement, and these projects are constrained to operate within the forecast
of revenues available for their completion and operation. The first year of the SBP capital
and operating program serves as the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
During the development of the SBP and Budget, RTD staff will provide the Board with
relevant information and deliver frequent updates. The Board is given the opportunity to
offer early and substantive input into the development of RTD's budget plans. Once the
SBP and Budget are adopted by the Board, RTD staff will maintain controls throughout the
year and deliver the service as approved by the Board.
The FasTracks Team conducts an annual program evaluation (APE) of scope, schedule,
costs and revenues to modify the program as necessary to meet goals. The APE allows the
agency to address trends and to make necessary modifications to the program while
keeping our commitment to be fiscally responsible, efficient and cost-effective. The
process allows RTD to be proactive in making prudent management decisions and
establishing strategies for cost containment, value engineering and innovation to complete
the program as soon as possible. In addition, in 2014 DRCOG has extended the time
horizon of the RTP from 2035 to 2040. As part of that process, RTD will be re-examining
its financial plan for the completion of FasTracks to identify other opportunities to
complete additional projects within the extended time horizon of the RTP.
RTD will continue to explore cost savings as part of the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force
recommendations as follows: 1) service optimization to match the cost of services
provided with available funding sources, 2) technology and energy innovation that involves
lighting upgrades and energy efficiency in building systems expected to produce
quantifiable cost savings, and 3) partnerships and privatizations that could include such
items as privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce
expenses. Finally, RTD will manage its financial condition by 1) reducing the volatility of
sales and use tax projections by continuing its contract with the CU-Leeds School of
Business for improved quarterly sales and use tax forecasting, and 2) adhering to its fund
balance policy based on recommended best practices and to include a Board-appropriated
fund and capital acquisition fund.

Attachment: 2015-05-12 Goal 1 (2473 : Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals)

RTD will develop and implement a Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and annual Budget for
Board approval. These plans will include innovative approaches to balance the SBP and
Budget in order to sustain service delivery and implement to the degree possible the Fiscal
Sustainability Task Force recommendations and the General Manager 2016 goals as
established by the Board.

GM TACTICAL PLAN FOR 2016
Strategic Goal #2
Opening of Five FasTracks Rail and BRT Corridors in 2016

The FasTracks program currently has over $5.5 billion committed for completed and
ongoing construction projects. In 2016, five (5) major corridors are planned to open for
revenue service to the public. These include the US36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project;
the East Rail Line to Denver International Airport; the Northwest Electrified Segment
(NWES) to Westminster; the Gold Line to Arvada and Wheat Ridge; and the I-225/Aurora
Line through the City of Aurora.
Opening so many lines in a single year is unprecedented and will require a full commitment
of staff and resources to achieve successfully. Accomplishment of this task will
underscore the success of FasTracks and continue to build confidence of the public in
RTD’s ability to deliver. The following areas are addressed:







Complete projects on time and within budget
Complete integrated testing and pre-revenue testing
Rail activation
Marketing/Special events/communication/community partnering
Service planning/bus operations/integration
Staffing, internal and external

The description below provides the tactical approaches to accomplishing this goal.
Complete Corridor Construction Projects On-Time and Within Budget
RTD has a tradition of completing its corridor construction projects on-time and within
budget. This is a commitment to the public and communities that has proven to be very
successful. Obviously, the construction projects must be completed before opening the
projects to passengers. These construction projects are vast undertakings, which have
thousands of inter-related tasks needing to be done within tight timeframes.
RTD assigns project teams to closely oversee the progress of each project. These multidisciplinary teams work closely with the contractors, stakeholders and state and federal
agencies to address any obstacles to completion. They also oversee contractor schedules,
monitor the budget and remaining contingency and oversee safety and quality. We will
assure that adequate resources are maintained on the project teams as the work is
completed.

Attachment: 2015-05-12 Goal 2 (2473 : Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals)

Background

Complete Integrated Testing and Pre-Revenue Testing
Once a train is ready to move under its own power, then the integrated testing period can
begin. Integrated testing involves the checkout of more than one system (such as vehicle,
signals and traction power) in the actual operating environment. It generally involves

1
Packet Pg. 192

13.G.d

Pre-revenue testing is done after integrated testing is complete. It closely replicates actual
operating conditions without passengers to verify and make adjustments to the projected
schedules. The testing also provides the opportunity for train operating and maintenance
personnel to acquire familiarity, training and certification on the new alignments. The RTD
maintainers utilize this opportunity to conduct pre-opening inspections and adjustments
which provides additional safety and familiarity of the equipment. Thus, a robust training
program (both classroom and field) is provided for transportation and maintenance
personnel.
A robust safety certification process is also to be implemented by RTD. Each safety
certifiable element is tracked from design, through construction and testing to assure that
it meets safety criteria. The system will not be opened to the public unless the safety
certification process has demonstrated acceptable progress. A safety certification plan
guides the overall process.
RTD assigns oversight teams to monitor and conduct the requisite testing. On the Eagle
P3 project, the concessionaire – DTP – will be performing the testing program which also
includes the acceptance of the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF). However,
RTD will maintain a strong oversight role to assure that DTP achieves RTD, federal and
state requirements. In addition, the contract provides for an Independent Engineer who
provides the final sign-off that the system is ready to open to the public.
On the I-225 project, RTD personnel will be directly involved in the testing program.
Hiring and training programs are implemented to assure that adequate personnel are
available for the new services.
Rail Activation
Five (5) rail/BRT corridors are scheduled to open in 2016. To assure the planning and
implementation of each corridor is a smooth and successful process; an activation team
for each corridor has been established to monitor the progress of start-up planning and
implementation. Each activation team is responsible for coordinating and monitoring the
project tasks/ sub-tasks, staff assignments, and timelines as developed and approved by
the RTD General Manager and Senior Leadership Team and is directed to achieving the
ultimate goal of implementing each corridor on time and within budget. The activation
teams include Senior Managers and representatives from each department within the
agency.

Attachment: 2015-05-12 Goal 2 (2473 : Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals)

dynamic testing with the movement of train(s). Each integrated test is closely monitored
to assure that it meets the criteria and safety requirements for a successful test under the
direction of a test director. One of the more significant sets of integrated tests is those at
each grade crossing. Each at-grade crossing is tested to assure that proper warning times
for bells and gates are provided, that any adjacent traffic signals preempt according to
standards, that crossing gates operate properly and that all Public Utility Commission
requirements are achieved. Each track in each direction must be tested. Each test result is
fully documented.

The second year of the activation process begins to focus on systems integration testing
as the project construction nears completion.
All systems integration tasks and
responsibilities for each department are included in each activation process.
The
implementation of the Integrated Testing Plan (ITP) is monitored through the activation
process including monitoring all safety and security items that need to be certified for
operations acceptance of the project. The IT components needed for each project are
tracked through the activation process leading up to opening day and training of new
personnel for each department is also tracked. The activation teams will also begin
preparing for the opening of each of the corridors. Station festivities, the volunteer effort
and safety and security measures for the grand opening events will be discussed through
the activation processes.
Marketing /Special Events/Communication/Community Partnering
The combined impact on our resources and employees of properly promoting to the
general public, engaging our stakeholders and elected officials, and educating would-be
passengers regarding the five new major transit investments opening in a single year
presents unique challenges and opportunities. These new services will spread out across
approximately half of the Denver Metro area, representing significant infrastructure
improvements for the municipalities through which they travel. RTD has previously
enjoyed at least one year between our major transit project openings, allowing for
lengthened public awareness campaigns and “ramp up” prior to the actual openings.
To accommodate the short timeframes between the five 2016 openings, RTD will engage
in very focused and targeted public relations and media relations efforts, including earned
media through community, local, regional, national and international outlets,
advertisements in publications that participate in our advertising trades, electronic
newsletters, website ads and publications, and social media, among other efforts.
Increased levels of education, above and beyond what is currently underway, about safety
around rail service, how to access the new services, and general public awareness of RTD
delivering on the voter-approved investment are key components to the opening activities.
Considerable energy is focused on ensuring that messaging, public engagement and public
information is created, provided and communicated via numerous channels to properly
reach all parties concerned.

Attachment: 2015-05-12 Goal 2 (2473 : Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals)

The activation process for each corridor began approximately two (2) years before the
estimated grand opening date. The first year of the activation process focuses on budget,
staffing, and the development of the bus and rail service plans. The construction schedule
is monitored as the projects move closer to integrated testing. Staffing and resources for
integrated testing are discussed through the activation process. The recruitment process
is also monitored through the activation process.

In order to support the required level of public events – the cumulative event lineup for
2016 will include a total of twenty events comprising at least sixteen event days – RTD
will mobilize a large number of volunteer ambassadors, RTD employees who volunteer
their time to directly help educate the public on how to use the new transit improvement.
Early estimates for volunteer shifts are projecting a need for up to 4,000 volunteer shifts

3
Packet Pg. 194

13.G.d

staffed by up to 700 actual volunteers; nearly triple the amount for our largest previous
events.

RTD has established successful benchmarks for these public activities over the past
several years. For example, attendance for our public events, free ride days and station
parties has been tremendous, and we are planning to meet and even exceed RTD’s
traditional levels of success with creative solutions that will positively impact each of the
grand openings.
Service Planning/Bus Operations/Integration
Opening of five (5) new corridors also demands major resources from Bus Operations.
First, the US36 project will be RTD’s first BRT operation (Flatiron Flyer). Major work is
already underway in terms of schedule planning, bus procurement, marketing and branding
and public outreach. In 2016, the corridor will see full implementation of BRT service on
US36. This will include operation on the managed lanes, bus on shoulder operation and
new stations. Training of bus operators for this new service will be a major focus, as well
monitoring of the new operation for any identified improvements.
Also, there will be major changes in bus operations throughout the new rail corridors.
Many bus routes will be re-oriented to serve the new rail stations and optimize intermodal
connections. This requires revamping both routes and schedules. These new service
plans are developed and presented to the public, which provides input to the proposed
new services, these service plans are then presented to the RTD Board for approval. A
major training program is implemented to orient bus operators to the new routes and
schedules.
The operation of the new services will be closely monitored after
implementation to identify any desirable adjustments.
Many new rail operations personnel come from bus operations. For new rail corridors, this
typically requires bus operations to backfill these positions. Therefore, hiring and training
programs are expanded in bus operations to assure that service is not negatively impacted
by the transition of personnel.
Staffing, Internal and External
Each department affected by the project openings has developed staffing and contracting
plans to identify staff and resources necessary for successful opening, operation and
maintenance. These plans are included in the development of the SBP and the 2016
budget processes. The plans are also tracked in the project activation processes.

Attachment: 2015-05-12 Goal 2 (2473 : Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals)

A dedicated grand opening team will provide the appropriate focus to be able to direct
effort and energy toward the planning and coordination between RTD departments and
partners for proper event implementation, government and public relations, media
relations, overall public outreach and promotional efforts as required for each new line.

Security
IT is expanding on its 2015 advances in IT security governance, awareness campaigns,
training, cross-agency collaboration, and cyber-incident response to perform industry
regulatory compliance and security best practice assessments for targeted critical, at-risk
areas of the business, such as systems that process credit cards, the website, and control
systems networks. Additionally, IT continues to mature RTD’s internal proactive security
stance by enabling procedural controls such as architectural reviews, access control
management and testing/auditing; and technical controls such as network segregation and
patch management that are designed to provide better wide-spread defense and incident
detection across the networked computer systems.

Attachment: 2015-05-12 Goal 3 (2473 : Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals)

Background

IT is fully engaged with RTD Security in the roll out of new networks for capturing video at
sites throughout the district, as well as adding new DVRs on all new buses. Other
components of these efforts include the creation of an environment that allows sharing of
video, data, and live resources with other agencies for incident response and crime
prevention configured to network security best practices.

Private Partnering (Innovation)

RTD is pursuing a private partnership with Xerox to host RTD’s Smart Card system. The
primary benefits of this are twofold 1) to provide industry expertise and support and 2)
create internal efficiencies by avoiding additional costs of staffing and infrastructure
support.
After implementation of Real Time Passenger Information, RTD plans to make information
available for private parties to create mobile applications that will provide real-time arrival
and departure information for bus passengers through personal mobile devices. The Digital
Communications Team will be developing an outreach plan to inform and engage mobile
application developers, and promote the availability of the new applications to riders.
As a part of the Eagle P3 project, IT is working closely with Denver Transit Partners in the
building of two new radio towers for communications. These radio resources are joint
use. RTD provided FCC licensing, requirements for the design and build of the sites, and
extended partnerships through RTD with other agencies that participate in the shared radio
and communications resources throughout the region.
RTD has interfaced with a number of local and national cybersecurity providers to bring in
top-talent to assess the network systems and recommend updates that provide RTD with
the best security return on investment. RTD has also become more involved with the
APTA Controls and Communication Systems Working Group and Enterprise IT Security
Working Groups, Infragard, Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, and other
private and public organizations for cybersecurity alerting, incident management, best
practices, and information/intelligence sharing.
Customer Facing
Providing riders with current and accurate information to enhance the rider's experience is
a key area of investment in 2016. The Communications Department is dedicated to
providing new and innovative approaches to providing timely, quality information to our
passengers. These efforts include:
Rider Facing Mobile Technologies:
The use of mobile devices to consume information is continually increasing. In 2014,
people using mobile devices to access information on RTD-Denver.com surpassed those
using a desktop or laptop (64% of all traffic came from a mobile device). In response to
this trend, the RTD website was redesigned in 2015 by the Digital Communications Team
to be mobile friendly. Communications and IT will continue to partner to explore and offer
information in formats conducive to mobile consumption. This will be accomplished
through mobile applications, automated phone systems, text messaging, and public
signage.

Attachment: 2015-05-12 Goal 3 (2473 : Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals)

In 2015, IT developed a roadmap on the strategic use of the Cloud to provide improved
systems and functionality at less cost to RTD. The actual implementation will take a
number of years.

Enhanced Traveler Information:
Providing predictive information regarding arrival or departure times for buses will improve
rider's experience. The first phase implemented at the end of 2015 includes reporting the
anticipated number of minutes before a bus will arrive or depart from a certain stop or
location and provides real-time information on the location of the bus. The second phase
occurring in 2016 involves providing this information for commuter rail and light rail
(dependent on funding approvals). Communications has identified and will partner with IT
to provide real-time information for 3rd party developers, Google maps, and Passenger
Information Display Signs. Also launching in 2016 will be a new mobile-friendly application
on the RTD website called Next Ride. This feature-rich application crafted in-house by the
Digital Communications Team and built in conjunction with IT will allow riders to find upto-the-minute real-time information for their stop, route, vehicle, current location, and
more.
Trip Planner:
IT started building the new and improved Trip Planner application in 2015 in conjunction
with Communications. This effort will finish in 2016 and will provide trip planning
information that is optimized for mobile devices. IT will also build a robust trip planning
application that matches the information being delivered to riders that will improve the
operations and efficiency of the customer contact center. A true collaborative effort, the
Digital Communications Team will be tasked with developing the user interface to match
RTD’s digital brand, creating a quality user experience, optimizing the interface to be
mobile-friendly, and integrating the application into the RTD website.
RTD-Denver.com Web Site:
The existing RTD website will be upgraded and migrated to a new platform in 2016 by the
Digital Communications Team in Marketing. This will provide Communications with the
ability to publish up-to-the-minute updates, enhance search engine optimization, provide
the ability for more users to contribute content in an easy to use interface, offer social
integration/commenting, and allow for a full-featured blog, among many other benefits.
The new platform will be the standard for all upcoming public-facing websites built
internally, and will allow RTD to move off of outdated legacy systems. New features and
enhancements will be added to the website over the coming years to enhance engagement
and provide a better experience for riders. The enhanced web experience will improve
information availability, improve internal processes, improve customer loyalty, drive
revenue, and increase campaign effectiveness.

Attachment: 2015-05-12 Goal 3 (2473 : Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals)

Passenger Information Display Systems (PIDS) included in base projects have been
expanded to further the customer experience in RTD stations and Park-n-Ride facilities. An
additional set of PIDS at Denver Union Station and additions at Oak Street Station Park-nRide are planned for 2015-2016. FasTracks projects with PIDS components requiring
specifications, designs, and network integration include East Line (DIA bus roadway) and
US36 BRT with passenger shelters at BRT stops and bus gates at the new Boulder
Junction at Depot Square.

Prioritized Resources
RTD's business depends on reliable and accurate systems for accounting, inventory
control, security, human resources, payroll, email, procurement, communications, and
more. This requires a significant investment in infrastructure and resources including items
such as: data centers, servers, networks, desktops, databases, applications, mobile
devices, and more. 2016 efforts with an IT focus will include:
Data Network:
IT will implement corporate network upgrades that provide a solid and reliable
technological foundation for all RTD systems.
Operations and Maintenance:
Nearly 70% of all technology efforts and investments go toward keeping-the-lights-on. In
2016 there will be continued attention to technology operations, sustainable activities,
ongoing maintenance, support, and upgrades of mission critical systems. IT will begin
migrating some systems to Cloud based, managed services solutions to help cut costs,
stay up to date on technology, and assist IT with their disaster recovery plans.
Enterprise Content Management:
In 2014, RTD began a comprehensive review of its Enterprise Content Management
Systems. This entails reviewing the current systems, outlining a district-wide taxonomy to
ensure compatibility across all systems, and developing a governance process and policies
regarding enterprise content management storage and retention. In 2016 and beyond,
efforts will focus on further defining taxonomy, approving and enforcing governance
procedures and policies, consolidating content, and defining and implementing retention
policies.
Enhance Services
RTD maintains and advances the use of technology to conduct its business more
efficiently and effectively. There are several technology tools that are being applied in
2016 to this end. These efforts will include:

Attachment: 2015-05-12 Goal 3 (2473 : Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals)

Website Promotions for 2016 Openings:
The Digital Communications Team will be launching specialized sub-sites for each of the
major openings in 2016 on RTD-Denver.com. The digital promotions will start months
before each opening to entice, inform, and influence riders and non-riders to use the new
commuter rail lines opening throughout the year. Each site will include service information,
fares, interactive maps, latest news, trip planning, and Grand Opening Event information.
Social media and email blasts will also be used to engage riders in digital campaigns and
giveaways for the openings.

Business Intelligence:
Business intelligence was implemented in 2014 with a limited, "out of the box" approach
and was further developed in 2015 by providing dashboards and high level financial
information to the RTD Senior Leadership Team. IT will work with the business units to

13.G.e

Financial, Operations, and Ridership Data:
Expand RTD's business intelligence implementation to provide analysis, performance
management, benchmarking, predictive analysis, forecasting, ridership, day-to-day
operations, project accounting, and other analytics that will drive business value and
decision making. This will improve access to data for RTD management across the
organization.
State of Good Repair:
Continue to improve data collection, analysis, statistics, and reporting of information for
the State of Good Repair program.
SmartCard Reporting:
IT will expand existing SmartCard analytics to provide information that will improve and
sustain the day-to-day operations of the SmartCard program, enhance fraud detection and
analysis, and build and improve analytics for enforcement of smart media usage and
tracking.
Operator Self-Service Portal:
Enhance operations and driver efficiency by improving the capabilities of the Operator selfservice portal. The portal will provide information such as extra board assignments, shift
information, run numbers, headways, real-time information, and more. Real-time
information will be provided to the operators on this portal.
Partnerships to Address:
Last Mile:
IT met with DRCOG to investigate integrating RTD’s Trip Planner and real-time passenger
information with their “Interagency Traveler Information Coordination” project. This
involves making information available to the public regarding travel plans, bike and ride
options, ticketing, events, and more. An example of this can be found at
www.waytogo.org. IT will continue working with DRCOG in 2016 to explore this
opportunity.
Smart Technology/Smart Cards:
The SmartCard program went live in 2013 with deployment of over 300,000 EcoPass and
College Pass cards and over 100 platform validators. This technology provides riders with
an electronic media card they use to tap on to the bus or rail. It also provides RTD
management with information about ridership. Continued enhancements and additional
functionality include:

provide more security should the device be lost or stolen.
Provide Wireless Connectivity for Handheld Smart Media Readers:
Today, handheld devices must be placed in their cradles in order to receive daily
updates. This is inefficient and requires additional steps by the fare inspectors.
Incorporating wireless updates on the handheld devices will improve the frequency
of updates, improve the ability to maintain the devices on the most current
software release, and make it easier for fare inspectors to perform the updates.
MyRide:
Much like a debit card, the MyRide program allows the use of a "Stored Value" on
a card to pay for a trip. The cost of that trip is debited against the prepaid card.
This reduces the product costs of the various fare programs and provides a service
to the rider. The pilot for this complex and major deployment is anticipated in 2015
with full rollout occurring in 2016.
Smart Card Portal Enhancements:
Seen as one of the key benefits to riders, IT and Marketing will be working
together to provide a more quality user experience on the Smart Card Portal prior to
the launch of MyRide. Enhancements to the portal have already been identified and
documented by the Digital Communications Team, Sales, and Customer Care to
allow for better internal processes and an optimal experience for riders managing
their cards via the Smart Card Portal.

Integration and Advancement (Holistic Approach):
Providing the technology tools to improve rider service, gain efficiencies and reduce cost is
a key focus for 2016. These efforts include:





SmartDrive:
Implementing Smart Drives on buses will help improve driver safety and
performance. This is an ongoing effort that continues into 2016. Smart Drive is a
simple camera system designed to capture 20 seconds of video and other vehicle
data surrounding an accident. It is being installed on RTD operated vehicles by the
bus maintenance group and will be maintained by IT’s Mobile Technologies Group.
IT is also providing resources for the collection of data in the garages via Wi-Fi.
