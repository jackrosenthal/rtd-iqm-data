#### 2. State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs

Jenifer Brandenberry from Brandeberry~McKenna noted that the State Legislative Session starts on January 13th.  The discussion will be dominated by the State budget.  She pointed out that Colorado is economically strong yet there will be a tug of war due to the budgeting process.  She expects transportation to be part of the conversation.

She highlighted the legislation that the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) will introduce regarding bus on shoulder operations.  Jenifer Brandeberry mentioned that the bill has bipartisan support in both chambers and will be fast tracked through the process.  She noted that there will be a more robust update during the February Government Relations Committee meeting.

Committee Chair Folska thanked Brandeberry~McKenna for their great work.

Director Archuleta asked about the $93 million in funding for the Southeast Rail Extension.  Dave Genova, Interim General Manager and CEO, explained that this will be part of the Federal Update.

Director Francone asked for details regarding the January 28th Legislative Forum at Denver Union Station.  Megan Wagner from Brandeberry~McKenna noted that the event is on the Legislature social calendar from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.  Director Francone asked for a copy of the invitation in order to follow up with her representatives.  Committee Chair Folska asked Megan Wagner to send the invitation to the all the Directors so they each could follow up with their representatives.

#### 3. Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Mike Dino from Squire Patton Boggs reported that before the winter break Congress passed a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill to fund the agencies and programs of the Federal government through September 30, 2016. The omnibus bill funds surface transportation programs at the increased spending levels outlined in the FAST Act, the 5 year authorization bill enacted in early December.  This bill was passed alongside a $680 billion package of permanent and short-term extensions of tax breaks.  He noted that this meant $150 million for the Eagle P3 Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) and $92 million for the Southeast Rail Extension FFGA.

Mike Dino said that with the passing of the multi-year authorization bill and the full-year appropriations bill the attention will then move to the US Department of Transportation (US DOT) implementations of the FAST Act. This includes converting the Surface Transportation Program to a block grant to give it more flexibility.

Mike Dino shared that there was a small victory in the language for Bus Rapid Transit (BRT).  He said that Small Starts BRTs could run 5 days a week instead of 7.  The other changes that RTD was hoping for did not come through.  He pointed out that his team would keep working on their end to push for the language change.

He mentioned that RTD submitted a budget request for $167 million for Fiscal Year 2017 since the Eagle P3 project was not fully funded.

Director Lubow wondered how RTD could continue to work with committee members on the BRT definition if the authorization is for 5 years.  Mike Dino replied that there are annual reauthorizations and RTD could take advantage of this process to see updates.  He added that this would be part of the strategic discussion with the Board for the March, 2016 APTA Legislative Conference.

Committee Chair Folska thanked Squire Patton Boggs for their contributions to the District.  She noted that it was a pleasure working with them as Chair of the Government Relations Committee.
