Re:

Update for Board

The December Revenue Forecast will be presented on December 21st. We will provide an
update to the Board on the implications of the forecast on the upcoming fiscal year.
We have been meeting with CDOT, State Patrol, Governor’s Office, potential legislative
sponsors and other interested stakeholders on the Bus on Shoulder legislation. Legislation will
be introduced in early January.
The Legislative Audit Committee reviewed the Department of Revenue’s (DOR) Local Sales
Tax Collection and found that the DOR needed to improve its tools for the mapping and
collecting of local sales taxes. There were significant findings related to the Departments over
collecting and under collecting sales tax in 2014. We continue to monitor as the Department
attempts to improve the collection system as it relates to providing funding for the District.
We monitored the Transportation Legislation Review Committee SMART Act hearings. During
the hearing Director Shalin Bhatt mentioned the importance of the bus on shoulder legislation
and are hoping to introduce this legislation early in the 2016 legislative session.
We are working with Transportation Committee staff on securing a date for RTD to present to
the Joint Transportation Committees during the session.
A friendly reminder to hold the date for RTD’s legislative reception on January 28th from 5-7pm
in the Gallery at Denver Union Station.

1.B.3.a

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: JANUARY 5, 2016


Before leaving Washington for the winter holidays, Congress passed a $1.1 trillion omnibus
spending bill to fund the agencies and programs of the Federal government through
September 30, 2016, along with a $680 billion package of permanent and short-term
extensions of tax breaks.



The omnibus bill funds surface transportation programs at the increased spending levels
outlined in the FAST Act, the five-year authorization bill enacted in early December.
o New Starts Funding: the omnibus provides $2.177 billion for Capital Investment
Grants, including $150 million for the Eagle P3 FFGA and $92 million for the
Southeast Rail Extension FFGA – fully funding both projects this year.
o The omnibus also includes a major GOP priority: repeal of the 40-year-old ban on
US crude oil exports, allowing US oil producers to sell crude in the already saturated
international market. This repeal is not expected to have an immediate effect on
crude oil prices or US gasoline prices.



The tax bill includes language making permanent the employer-provided transit commuter
benefit at a level ($255/month in CY 2016) equal to the tax benefit already afforded
employer-provided parking.



The House is adjourned until January 5 and the Senate until January 11.

US DOT Implementation of the FAST Act:


Now that both the multi-year authorization bill and the full-year appropriations bill are in
place, attention turns to how US DOT will implement many of the provisions of the FAST
Act.



New Programs and Policies: The Department is responsible for several significant new
programs and policies, including:
o Conversion of the already flexible STP program into a block grant to each State,
o Another round of environmental streamlining and accelerated project delivery
improvements,
o An expedited project delivery pilot for Capital Investment Grant projects advanced
via public-private partnerships and seeking Federal funds for less than 25 percent of
project costs, and
o Changes to all major surface transportation loan programs – TIFIA, RRIF, and State
infrastructure banks – and how US DOT is structured to oversee these programs.



More Discretionary Programs: A greater share of surface transportation funding is
distributed via discretionary programs under the FAST Act than under MAP-21, including
the newly-restored discretionary bus program and a large new program for highway, bridge,
and freight projects.
o This means a greater share of funding decisions are within the control of US DOT,
so it is increasingly important to engage with the Department in the coming year as it
issues rulemakings and guidance to implement the FAST Act.
