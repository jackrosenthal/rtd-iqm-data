passes. I am happy to facilitate meeting with any candidates in your districts, so please
don’t hesitate to ask.

Re:

June Board Update

The 2019 legislative session concluded on May 3rd. The Governor is currently on the 30-day
clock (which ends on June 4th) to sign or veto all legislation passed during the 2019 legislative
session. Unlike previous governors, who highlighted a handful of legislation to hold public
signing ceremonies, Governor Polis has been busy holding many signing ceremonies across the
State of Colorado highlighting the aggressive legislative agenda passed by the Colorado
legislature.
BBMK tracked numerous bills of interest throughout the legislative session on behalf of RTD.
Please see the attached link for complete list of this legislation.
https://statebillinfo.com/SBI/index.cfm?fuseaction=Public.Dossier&id=25636&pk=114
Now that the General Assembly has concluded its work BBMK will be spending time monitoring
the upcoming legislative interim committees which are scheduled to meet throughout the
Summer and Fall. The following committees were approved: Zero Waste, Energy legislation,
Tax expenditure, Investor Owned Utilities and Energy Choices, Making Higher Education
Attainable and Prison Population Management.
The Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) will convene on September 16th at
9:00am and October 28th at 9:00am in the Old State Library in the Capitol. BBMK will forward
the agenda for these meetings once they are posted. Another interim committee of particular
interest to RTD which BBMK will keep the Board updated on is the Sales and Use Tax
Simplification Committee. Dates for this interim committee have not been scheduled yet.
As a result of the passage of HB19-1257 the Legislature referred a ballot initiative to the voters
that if approved will allow the general assembly to retain excess revenue that is above the
TABOR cap for education and transportation. BBMK will closely follow this ballot initiative and
any other initiatives of interest to the District. To date, one ballot initiative has been approved
for circulation. Initiative 22 proposes to increase the oil and gas severance tax rate by 5
percentage points for all operators, eliminates the existing ad valorem tax credit and halves the
threshold for the stripper well exemption.
BBMK in coordination with RTD and transportation committee members will schedule tours of
RTD’s operations/facilities of interest to members. BBMK received a lot of positive feedback

Relations Committee

House Advances FY 2020 Transportation Spending Bill
On Thursday, May 23, the House Appropriations Committee’s Transportation, Housing and Urban
Development (THUD) Subcommittee approved its FY 2020 THUD Appropriations bill, after
minimal debate, by voice vote. As is the Committee’s practice, all amendments will be held until
consideration of the bill by the full committee. The legislation funds Federal transportation
programs for the fiscal year starting on October 1, 2019.
Highway and transit formula and discretionary programs are funded at or above Fixing America’s
Surface Transportation (FAST) Act-authorized levels. The bill provides $3 billion in General Fund
funding above authorized levels for highway ($1.75 billion), transit ($750 million), and aviation ($500
million) programs.
For Transit Formula Grants, the bill authorizes $10.8 billion in contract authority from the Highway
Trust Fund, consistent with FAST Act-authorized levels. The bill also provides $750 million in
General Fund appropriations above authorized levels for transit programs, including the Buses and
Bus Facilities grant program, the Low or No Emission Vehicle grant program, and a new Persistent
Poverty Program.
For the Capital Investment Grant (CIG) program, the bill provides $2.3 billion, which is the FAST
Act-authorized level. This amount funds all CIG projects with signed full-funding grant agreements
and provides $1.2 billion for future projects.
The large, multimodal discretionary Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development
(BUILD, formerly TIGER) program is funded at $1 billion, $100 million more than in FY 2019.
The full House Appropriations Committee is expected to mark up the bill during the week of June
3. There has been no action yet on the Senate’s FY 2020 THUD spending bill.

Federal Update

1.C.4.a

Infrastructure Talks Break Down

In response, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio (D-OR)
has said he will now focus on advancing a modest surface transportation reauthorization by the end
of the calendar year, rather than on an infrastructure package and new revenues for the Highway
Trust Fund. On the Senate side, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has been
focused on surface transportation reauthorization from the beginning of this Congress and never
seriously considered pursuing its own large infrastructure package. At this time, the collapse of
Congressional discussions with the White House leaves few avenues for increasing Highway Trust
Fund revenues even to a level sufficient to cover current spending.
SPB Team Continues its Advocacy for RTD Priorities
As detailed in last month’s written report, Squire Patton Boggs continues working with RTD to
secure the return of RTD’s credit risk premium (CRP) on the repaid RRIF loan for Denver Union
Station and to advance an improvement in the CIG definition of bus rapid transit in the next
reauthorization bill. An update follows on our efforts over the past month to advance both
provisions.
I.

Return of the Credit Risk Premium on Denver Union Station RRIF Loan

We are working with RTD’s Congressional delegation and staff of the House and Senate
Appropriations Committees to secure a provision in either the FY 2020 spending bill or the next
reauthorization bill that directs US DOT to return RTD’s CRP and provides funding to cover the
costs of this action.
We are also working with the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) to include our
RRIF CRP provision in APTA’s surface transportation reauthorization principles – the formal
statement of the reauthorization priorities of the Association’s 1,500 members. In May, we revised
the text of our proposed CRP solution at APTA’s request. At APTA’s mobility conference on May
19, the Legislative Committee approved its 5.0 version of reauthorization recommendations, which
includes our revised RRIF CRP language.
Additionally, we secured Rep. Perlmutter’s support for submitting a written request to the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to include our RRIF CRP provision in any
infrastructure legislation the committee advances in the coming year.
II.

Expanded CIG Funding Eligibility for Bus Rapid Transit Projects with Shared-use Lanes

Squire Patton Boggs also continued advocating in May for an expanded definition of fixed guideway
bus rapid transit (BRT) in the Capital Investment Grant (CIG) program to make projects like US 36

On Wednesday, May 22, a planned meeting between President Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,
and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer was cut short by the President, leaving in doubt the
fate of the large infrastructure package the three planned to discuss. The meeting was meant to be a
follow-up funding discussion to an April 30 meeting at which the two sides agreed to pursue a
broad, $2 trillion infrastructure package. However, the President stated at a press conference
immediately following the shortened meeting that he would not work with congressional Democrats
on infrastructure while they continued to pursue oversight investigations of his Administration.

1.C.4.a

BRT eligible for CIG funding in the next reauthorization bill. We have worked with Chairman
Tisdale, RTD senior staff, and APTA government affairs staff to advance through APTA’s
reauthorization process our provision expanding eligibility for BRT projects.

Attachment: Federal Update 5 28 2019 (3835 : Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs)

We drafted legislation and a concise explanation of our proposal for APTA staff, who then brought
our proposal before APTA’s BRT committee for consideration. After an explanation of the
language by Chairman Tisdale, the BRT committee favorably reported out our provision. The next
step for this provision is consideration for inclusion in APTA’s reauthorization principles. That is
scheduled to take place at APTA’s rail conference in mid June.
Rep. Perlmutter also voiced support for our BRT provision in his written comments to the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
