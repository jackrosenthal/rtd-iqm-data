BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: November 26, 2013

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 26, 2013

Board Meeting Date: December 3, 2013

Subject:

Disposition of Surplus Property Pilot Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager and/or his designee to market and to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary to dispose of real property owned by RTD in the vicinity of WCR 27 and WCR #6 and #8, Lot
1, Block 1, Aurora Highline Subdivision, Filing No. 4 (Alameda/Havana park-n-Ride), remnants associated
with the West Corridor Rail Line at 1395 South Zuni, and vacant land at 104 th and Riverdale, Thornton,
Colorado to at least 90% of the current fair market value as determined by appraisal.
BACKGROUND
In April, 2013, staff presented to the Board an Overview of Real Property and Transit Oriented
Development, including a discussion of regulations governing real property owned by the District and
other policy and operation considerations, including Federal State and RTD regulations, financial, current
and future operational needs, and transit-oriented development opportunities and goals to consider in the
management and disposition of RTD property.
A subsequent presentation to the Board in August, 2013 proposed a Pilot Program involving the four
properties that are subject of the recommended action of this Board Report. The Pilot Program allowed
for a diverse set of disposal considerations providing an opportunity to evaluate and review the process,
review lessons learned and propose any policy changes.
An Interdisciplinary Task Force was convened including representatives from Planning, Bus Operations,
Rail Operations, Capital Programs, Finance, Facilities, Transit Oriented Development and Real Property.
The four properties included in the Pilot Program were reviewed, discussed and studied by the Task
Force for a recommendation to dispose of the property and a plan for marketing the property.
DISCUSSION
1. Property located in the vicinity of WCR27 and WCR #6 and #8, Weld County, Colorado containing
approximately 243 acres was determined to be surplus by the Task Force with no foreseeable future
need by the District. The recommended marketing plan for this property is to post with FOR SALE
signs, develop a marketing brochure for mail and on-line marketing. On-line marketing will include
the use of on-line brokerage sites such as LoopNet.com. The property will be sold with water rights.
It is recommended that the property be sold for at least 90% of fair market value as determined by
appraisal.
2. Vacant land adjacent to the Alameda/Havana park-n-Ride also known as Lot 1, Block 1, Aurora
Highline Subdivision, Filing No. 4 consisting of approximately 2.3 acres was also determined to be
surplus. The recommended marketing plans for this property is to market to adjacent property owner
including a car dealership at this location. The City of Aurora is supportive of this approach by RTD
and has suggested that the expansion of car dealership use at that site is appropriate. It is

Packet Pg. 38

1.C.1

recommended that the property be sold for at least 90% of fair market value as determined by
appraisal.
3. Remnants of vacant land acquired as a result of West Corridor Light Rail acquisition program in the
vicinity of 14th and Zuni containing approximately 1.6 acres have also been determined to be surplus.
RTD will be required to seek Federal Transit Administration concurrence in the disposition of this
property. It is recommended based on multiple inquiries related to this property, that a request for
proposal (RFP) for the sale of this property be issued with a minimum bid based on the fair market
value of the property as determined by appraisal. The RFP for this property will include incentives to
support transit-oriented, mixed-use development at this site as identified in the recently adopted
Federal Decatur Station Area Plan by the City and County of Denver.
4. The North Metro Rail project and station at 104th and Colorado will eliminate any need for a park-nRide at 104th and Riverdale as originally envisioned when this property was acquired. The plan for
marketing the approximately 8.74 RTD owned acres at this location is to pursue joint marketing
opportunities with the adjacent property owner. It is recommended that the property be sold for at
least 90% of fair market value as determined by appraisal. Any joint marketing effort agreements
will be reviewed by legal to ensure RTD is able to participate fully in all joint efforts.
Staff will evaluate each process, review and recommend changes to process and or policies based on
results of the four anticipated sales. Staff will review any recommended changes to the process and or
policies with the Board and will seek Board approval on changes to existing Board approved policies and
procedures.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
It is anticipated that the disposition of all four properties subject to this report could total $5-10 million.
Proceeds will be added to the appropriate account – either the base general fund or the FasTracks
Internal Savings Account (FISA).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to market and to
negotiate and execute all documents necessary to dispose of real property owned by RTD in the
vicinity of WCR 27 and WCR #6 and #8, Lot 1, Block 1, Aurora Highline Subdivision, Filing No. 4
(Alameda/Havana park-n-Ride), remnants associated with the West Corridor Rail Line at 1395 South
Zuni, and vacant land at 104th and Riverdale, Thornton, Colorado to at least 90% of the current fair
market value as determined by appraisal.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to market and to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to dispose of real property owned
by RTD in the vicinity of WCR 27 and WCR #6 and #8, Lot 1, Block 1, Aurora Highline Subdivision,
Filing No. 4 (Alameda/Havana park-n-Ride), remnants associated with the West Corridor Rail Line at
1395 South Zuni, and vacant land at 104th and Riverdale, Thornton, Colorado to at least 90% of the
current fair market value as determined by appraisal.

RTD Real Property White Paper

Introduction
The intent of this white paper is to describe the real property management and disposition process at
RTD including how real property management interfaces with the TOD function at RTD. This white
paper outlines all existing RTD, state and federal regulations that govern RTD’s acquisition and
disposition of real property and identifies other policy (including TOD) and operational considerations
that need to be taken into account in this process. Also, this paper summarizes how other similar public
agencies approach real property management. Finally, this paper identifies some steps RTD may
consider to more proactively manage its real property assets.

Regulations Governing RTD Real Property
There are several state, federal and RTD laws, regulations and policies which govern the acquisitions and
disposition of properties. RTD must maintain compliance with these requirements.
RTD’s legal authority to acquire property is established in Colorado Revised Statutes C.R.S. 32-9-101 et
seq. “Regional Transportation Act” as amended. This legislation empowers the Board to acquire,
manage, and dispose of property in furtherance of the authorization of planning, building, operating and
maintaining a mass transportation system. This authority includes the power to condemn property for
public use. It is important to note that the authority granted to RTD by the state specifically defines
that RTD can only acquire property for the purposes of mass transit. Different regulations apply to the
disposition of property acquired by RTD depending on the funding source. The disposition of properties
acquired with local funding only are subject to the legal authority above and the Regional
Transportation District Resolution No. 10 Series of 1984 (Resolution Regarding Joint Development and
Disposition of Property Rights) attached as Exhibit A. Disposition of property requires RTD Board
approval.
The acquisition and disposition of property acquired by RTD for federally assisted programs and projects
are subject to acquisition and relocation policies and provisions contained in the government-wide rule
published in the Federal Register on January 4, 2005. The rules are reprinted each year in the Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 49, Part 24. All Federal, State, local government agencies, and others
receiving Federal financial assistance for public programs and projects that require the acquisition of
real property must comply with the policies and provisions set forth in the Uniform Act and the
regulation. The acquisition itself does not need to be federally funded for the rules to apply. If Federal
funds are used in any phase of the program or project, the rules of the Uniform Act apply.

April 3, 2013

In addition to the Uniform Act, the Federal Transit Administration requires Grantees to be familiar with
other regulations that specifically address the disposition of property, especially U.S. Department of
Transportation, Federal Transit Administration Circular FTA C 5010.1D Grant Management Requirements
dated November 1, 2008, Rev 1, August 27, 2012. The Circular establishes procedures to be followed by
grantees for the disposition of properties, including (1.) selling property (competitively to the extent
practicable) and reimbursing FTA its share of the fair market value, and (2) selling real property and
using the proceeds to reduce the cost of the grant if it is still open or of other FTA funded capital
projects.
A list of properties, vacant and/or underutilized originally acquired without federal funding assistance is
attached as Exhibit B and a list of properties, vacant and/or underutilized originally acquired as part of a
federally funded project is attached as Exhibit C.
As a general rule, property acquired for a construction project is not considered for disposition until
after the construction contract is complete. RTD construction contracts generally make property
acquired for the project available to the construction contractor for construction installation, access to
the site or storage.

Other Policy and Operational Considerations for RTD Real Property Management
There are multiple additional policy and operational considerations that need to be evaluated in the
context of the management, acquisition and disposition of RTD real property. These considerations
should be evaluated in the context of overriding rules and regulations on real property discussed in the
previous section.
Key considerations beyond the existing regulations that govern real property management include:


Financial – management decisions including the acquisition, disposition or transfer of some
other form of property rights are influenced by the general financial conditions of the district
and the financial status of individual capital improvement projects. Examples of this kind of
influence include:
o RTD’s Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) – the RTD Board approved the potential to sell
selected excess properties for the purpose of adding revenues to the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA). This consideration requires RTD staff to look proactively at
selling selected parcels no longer needed for transit purposes to raise revenues to pay
for FasTracks related improvements.
o Engineering decisions on capital improvement projects – financial considerations are
taken into account in acquisition of property for RTD facilities. Budget limitations on
projects often require creative thinking and design to minimize or avoid acquiring
property for RTD rail and bus facilities. RTD staff work very hard to take only property
that is absolutely required for construction and operation of RTD facilities.

1.C.1.a

o

o

Fair Market Value – RTD establishes the value of a property for disposal through a fair
market appraisal. An offer significantly below the appraised fair market value would not
be approved.
Certificates of Participation (COPs) – COPs are used frequently by RTD to leverage
existing RTD assets, including property, for the purposes of financing other RTD
obligations such as capital improvements. The utilization of COPs on RTD real property
must be considered since the disposition of property which is encumbered by a COP will
require that the COP obligation be paid off or transferred to another RTD asset.



Current and Future Operational Needs – RTD’s current and future operational needs are always
evaluated in RTD’s property management process. There are some parcels in RTD’s property
inventory that are underutilized and/or are no longer required for its original intended purpose.
In these situations, it is incumbent on RTD staff to evaluate not only the current utilization of the
property, but the potential for future RTD use. This is extremely important because disposing of
property should only be done in cases where there is no foreseeable transit need for the
property. RTD does not want to be in the situation where it sells an underutilized property and
then determines two or three years later that it did need the property after all.



Transit Oriented Development Opportunities – the opportunity for TOD is an additional
consideration in the acquisition and disposition of property. First and foremost, RTD can only
purchase property for mass transit and cannot purchase property for development. That being
said, RTD does want to encourage the development of transit oriented communities around its
stations and does proactively look for partnership opportunities with local jurisdictions and
private developers to implement TOD at stations. Forming partnerships with others may allow
RTD to avoid acquiring property for RTD’s exclusive use. Examples of this type of partnership
include the Olde Town Arvada station and the Westminster station where the local jurisdictions
acquired property to promote the integration of RTD bus and parking facilities into a larger plan
for transit oriented development.
Additional consideration may be given to TOD in the land disposition process. When certain
conditions are present including local jurisdiction support and commitment for TOD
implementation (the presence of an adopted station area plan, TOD supportive zoning and
commitment of funding for public infrastructure) and private developer commitment and
resources (ownership of land and expenditure of resources on design and entitlements) RTD
may consider reinvesting land proceeds for the purposes of enhancing the station environment
through the implementation of TOD. Examples of this include the Boulder Junction bus transfer
facility and the Alameda TOD Pilot Project where the RTD Board chose to reinvest land sale
proceeds back into the transit facilities that are being built or being reconfigured associated
with the implementation of TOD.

1.C.1.a

A review of procedures of other public agencies, including General Services Administration (GSA),
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA),
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) and
various municipalities within the RTD district was done. All emphasize obtaining the fair market value,
as determined by appraisal of the property to be disposed of and most dispose of surplus property via a
competitive sale to the public generally through a sealed bid or auction. No marketing efforts are a part
of the disposition procedures.

Potential Modifications to RTD’s Real Property Management Approach
As RTD moves forward with the build out of FasTracks and the ongoing operation of its existing bus and
light rail system, modifications to RTD’s Real Property management could be considered. The
modifications would focus on being proactive where appropriate, but understanding that RTD is only in
the business of buying and selling real estate for constructing and operating a mass transit system.
RTD staff proposes the following steps in an effort to more proactively management its real property
assets:
1. Review and Refine Inventory of Surplus and Underutilized Property. Inventories of surplus and
underutilized real properties are attached. RTD staff will evaluate all properties contained in
either inventory, federally funded and/or locally funded and will focus on larger, possibly more
marketable parcels. Small/sliver parcels and other nonmarketable parcels will not be included
in the revised inventory.
2. Conduct an Assessment of Excess and Underutilized Real Property. RTD staff will form a
multidisciplinary committee to assess the potential disposition of parcels within the inventory of
surplus and underutilized parcels. In evaluating the inventory of parcels, RTD will consider all
the factors discussed in this white paper including regulations governing RTD property
disposition and other policy and operational considerations. Following the completion of this
evaluation, RTD staff will consult with select local subject matter experts to get their
perspectives on RTD’s real property inventory in the context of the factors governing RTD’s real
property disposition. RTD staff will then inform the Board of its assessment of the inventory of
parcels. If staff were to move forward with any property disposition, the RTD Board would have
to approve the final negotiated business terms unless the Board had previously delegated that
authority to the General Manager.
3. Develop a Marketing Plan for Select Surplus and Underutilized Property. RTD staff will also
determine if there is a need to market the surplus or underutilized property. Marketing efforts
could include the development of a Request for Proposals (RFP), the installation of for sale signs
on the property to be disposed of, communication with local commercial, industrial and/or
residential property brokers who sell property in the vicinity, or other efforts to be determined.
RTD staff does not feel it would be advantageous to hire a real estate broker to market

Peer Agency Approaches to Real Property Management

individual properties. Hiring a broker would reduce the amount of funds that RTD could receive
on the property because of the need to pay a commission to the broker. It would also require a
competitive solicitation each time a need for representation was identified, adding additional
time and cost to any disposition. In addition, none of the peer public agencies we surveyed
utilized a separate, private real estate broker in the disposition of real property.
4. Ongoing Process to Evaluate TOD Opportunities – RTD TOD staff will continue to proactively
pursue TOD opportunities where appropriate. As identified earlier, RTD will seek out
opportunities for partnerships with local jurisdictions and/or private developers where RTD can
leverage other resources to enhance our bus and rail stations and integrate transit more
seamlessly with development.
Other factors including market viability for TOD and
opportunities to encourage affordable housing as identified by RTD Board policy will also be
considered in the pursuit of TOD. When necessary, RTD staff will engage outside real estate
experts, on-call consultants and others to help evaluate TOD opportunities and negotiate with
private developers (RTD staff has utilized this approach for multiple projects including the DUS
Historic Building, the Alameda TOD Pilot and the Arvada TOD Pilot). RTD staff may engage
additional, outside experts on TOD under the following conditions:





The outside party has agreed to not compete or bid for the TOD opportunity for which
they are being consulted
Each individual TOD opportunity should be evaluated independently on a case by case
basis to determine the type of outside expertise needed since every project has unique
characteristics
Outside experts advising RTD should have a local understanding of the Denver real
estate market

Summary
In conclusion, the sale of surplus property can provide needed revenue to RTD and relieve the District of
the cost to maintain these properties. RTD will take additional steps to inventory, access and market
surplus properties. However, as described in this paper, the disposition of property is a complex
endeavor that must take into account legal, financial, contractual, and future operational requirements
while also considering transit oriented development opportunities where applicable. As we continue to
improve our processes in this area, we will schedule a study session to gather input from the RTD Board
on this very important item.
