GM Oversight & Performance Management Committee
[SIDE CONVERSATION]
BOB BROOM: OK. Why don't we call the meeting to order? And it's not going to take very
long. But there's no point, I guess, just sitting here. I don't have minutes to approve.
So let's call the meeting the order. And we have a copy of the evaluation survey attached for your
review. If you have any questions or comments or proposed changes or whatever, speak now or
forever hold your peace.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes?
DAVID GENOVA: Mr. Chair?
BOB BROOM: Yes?
DAVID GENOVA: May I ask around dates? And maybe it's a question directed towards Ms.
McManus about-- or are we going to get into that in discussion, about when the survey's due and
all of that? OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: It's next on the list.
DAVID GENOVA: OK. Well, then I will withdraw my question.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Schedule moving forward.
DAVID GENOVA: OK. Oh, I see. Item D. Thank you.
[LAUGHTER]
TROY WHITMORE: D and C.
DOUG TISDALE: Move approval of the draft end of year performance evaluation survey has
submitted.
TROY WHITMORE: Second.
BOB BROOM: Discussion. All in favor, say aye.
ALL: Aye.
BOB BROOM: Opposed? Same as aye. And it passes.

DAVID GENOVA: Is it the same as this one, though?
BOB BROOM: And you also have a copy of Dave's contract attached. There's no changes,
obviously, for this.
BARBARA MCMANUS: No, there's not. It was in the manual that we passed out at the
beginning of the year. And we put it in the packet as a confidential item. So you could sign it and
read it, but the public couldn't see it.
I just wanted everybody to have the opportunity to review it and understand that there's really no
action item that we're going to be moving forward at the end of this process. It's just more of a
guidance for Dave and the understanding of how we do the performance appraisal based on the
contract as it was changed last year, especially for those who are new.
BOB BROOM: So this is year one of the three year.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
DAVID GENOVA: Five year.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Five.
BOB BROOM: Well, there's two additional years.
DOUG TISDALE: Three plus two.
TROY WHITMORE Revised last year, correct?
DAVID GENOVA: It's five. Five plus two.
JEFF WALKER: Five plus two.
DOUG TISDALE: Five year, yeah. Five plus. That's right. Yeah.
BOB BROOM: Five plus-DOUG TISDALE: Five plus two.
TROY WHITMORE: So this first year of-DOUG TISDALE: And the point is, I think, if anything, the record should reflect that in
continued efforts to provide complete transparency to this committee and to all the Board
members, even though it is part of your governance manual and you have a reference to it, to
bring it out off the shelf from time to time and show it around in the sunlight. And let people
make sure that they understand it and ask any questions that they may have.

BARBARA MCMANUS: And if any questions do come up, we can review it at that point in
time, one on one, or if you want to speak with General Counsel as well.
BOB BROOM: Does anybody have a desire, either Dave or anybody, to reopen this?
DAVID GENOVA: I do not, Mr. Chairman. I'm satisfied with it.
BOB BROOM: Okay. That's some information on it.
DOUG TISDALE: We're moving forward.
BOB BROOM: And you should have a schedule in front of you with our next meeting being
November 19, which will be after the survey has been completed.
DOUG TISDALE: So it's sent on the 1st and closes on Veterans Day.
BOB BROOM: What's it take, about 45 minutes to do this roughly? The survey?
BARBARA MCMANUS: I think the maximum time was 45 minutes the last time out. But the
average was about 28.
BOB BROOM: 28.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah.
BOB BROOM: So they ought to be able to fit that in in a 10-day period now.
DOUG TISDALE: You were think. If it's a half an hour-- because I think that was the average.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah. We didn't really have any negative discussion surrounding the
timing when we sent it out and when we went over it initially in other matters in one of the
meetings prior to it going out.
We did explain that we made some additional fields available that each of the directors could put
lengthy comments in that, if they felt strongly in a particular direction, so that Dave would have
more understanding of where they wanted him to go in the process. And so we really don't have
any feedback.
TROY WHITMORE: We're going to assume that was helpful, Dave, because there was quite a
few-- somewhat meaty comments.
BOB BROOM: Dave?
DAVID GENOVA: If I may, Mr. Chair, yes. And I appreciate that observation that it was
helpful. And I sat down and went through it with detail with Chair Broom and Chair Tisdale.

And I've done some follow-up very specifically with some board members. I think that some of
the comments were directed around, wanted to see some additional things. And so it's been very
helpful for me to make some adjustments, and the team as well. So I appreciate those.
TROY WHITMORE: It seems like we could stop and start if we got interrupted without losing
our place. Wasn't that the case?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes. As long as it's on the same machine.
TROY WHITMORE: Then that's quite helpful. It tends to get to a point where you're like, well, I
gotta come back to that and know you can instead of just rushing to get through. So that was
good, too. I thought it was a very easy process to get through. Sometimes they're not.
JEFF WALKER: And that's highlighted in boldface and underlined on the first page.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. I mean, it's really kind of amazing that we didn't have that before,
because it seems like such a natural thing to be able to do, because it's hard people say, OK, I
promise I'll finish it in this time slot.
[SIDE CONVERSATION]
BOB BROOM: So the November 1 will get Dave's comments, right?
BARBARA MCMANUS: On November 1, the comments come to me. And then I send the
survey out with Dave's evaluation and any other supporting documentation. He's been preparing
a PDF of all the Friday memos and all of the communications that he's been sending all along in
the process.
BOB BROOM: Because if you have that printed out while you're going through the
questionnaire, it's helpful.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Right. And it's a PDF that's searchable. So if you're looking for a
particular subject, if you think you might have missed something, you can look through that PDF
document and see everything that Dave has sent us to date on that particular subject. Welcome.
Let the record reflect that Director Malpiede is now attending.
BOB BROOM: And does she have any questions or comments on any other items that we've
gone through?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I do not.
BOB BROOM: OK. As advertised, this isn't going to last very long. Anything else being brought
before in the committee before we adjourn?
VINCE BUZEK: I'm glad you rushed to get here.

[LAUGHTER]
BARBARA MCMANUS: I'd just like to have everybody review the end of the year process and
make sure that everybody is comfortable with that timing. As I said, there won't be any formal
decision on all of the criteria that Dave hits his targets on are outlined and determined in the
contract, which we went over prior to you getting here, Director. Do you have any questions on
that?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No. Did this start at 3:00?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Just checking, because it's [LAUGH] just 3:14.
VINCE BUZEK: Yes, yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I just want to make sure-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
VINCE BUZEK: Bob talks fast.
DOUG TISDALE: Well, yeah. And I think it's worthwhile to say, too, just for the sake of the
record, that the year end process is, number one, very similar to what we have done in years past,
but rendered somewhat easier, perhaps, because there's not a question of trying to fight over a
bonus and deal with those issues. We've got a straightforward question of, is he in fact hitting the
marks or not?
JEFF WALKER: It's a, if I may-- It's a much easier conversation without trying to attach a dollar
figure to that.
BOB BROOM: True, true.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And then, of course, Chair Broom will, going forward, discuss an
overview of what happens in this committee at the Board meeting. And when we talked in the
beginning of the year as now, he's going to just remind that every Director gets this packet, just
as this committee does.
All are invited to come and be involved and that, if anybody has any comments that they need to
make, that the Chair invites them to either discuss with him or call the Board Office or have a
discussion with Dave if that's where the discussion lies one on one so that at the end of the year,
we don't have any discussion about people feeling that they haven't been involved.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. And I think, if I may Mr. Chair, adding to that, the fact is you can
always call in or be here in person during these meetings. You can always reach out to the Chair
of this committee. You can always reach out to the General Manager. You can always reach out

to the Board Office and, for that matter, to me or any other Director to share information with or
ideas or concerns.
TROY WHITMORE: And in fact that he's on the phone, just so you know. I'm not a member of
the committee. Which it great.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So I just have a question of this committee. So I know we still have a
little ways to go. But we've been through the process. We've been through the beginning of the
year process, which looks much like the end of the year process.
And it seems to be going very smooth in terms of, for some of the members that are new, having
the Board retreat and then the Board SLT retreat and then moving forward to Dave presenting
the tactical plan and moving everything forward to get to the point where the goals are approved.
Any comments that you have-- and it doesn't have to be now. You can think about it. I'd just like
you to bring any of those comments to me if you feel that there have been any deficiencies or if
there is something we can do that's more efficient or that you'd be more comfortable with for this
committee or whatever committee we have moving forward.
VINCE BUZEK: Great.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I would like to suggest something. And that is it would be really
great, because we have so many things on the calendar-- I mean, it's just overwhelming to look at
it-- is if this Committee could send an email to all the Board members outlining the GMOC plan
through the end of the year, just as, heads up, here's how we're going to move forward
[COUGH]. Just a personal note, I think would be really great.
BOB BROOM: OK. We can do that.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I can forward this to you, Director Broom. And then you can put any
comments you want and forward it to me. And I'll send it to the full Board from you.
BOB BROOM: OK.
TROY WHITMORE: Probably a good idea To call him. The transparency training to go with--.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes. I wasn't sure how this meeting was going to go. I just thought it
was easier to schedule them all from 3:00 to 5:00. I thought this one might be a little bit shorter.
But I think that, if you'll recall the first part of the process with the number of documents we
have in front of us, when we're reviewing the survey results and giving Dave the comments that
the 3:00 to 5:00 will be appropriate, I hope. It's a work in progress.

SPEAKER 4: Sounds good. Yeah. Pick one and stick with it. Otherwise, this dude gets confused.
And I don't like walking in a half hour late, which I did all the time earlier this year.
BOB BROOM: Shontel had that same problem. OK. I guess that's it. I can't stretch this out any
longer.
DOUG TISDALE: I think you did a good job.
[LAUGHTER]
BOB BROOM: I can't get paid any more.
[LAUGHTER]
We'll adjourn the meeting. Thank you very much for coming.
DOUG TISDALE: OK. Thank you.
DAVID GENOVA: Thank you.
