Subject:

Construction Award for IFB 37-DE 001. East
Metro HVAC and Building Automation Controls
Upgrade Project

General

Board Meeting Date: April 17, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to JCOR Mechanical Inc. in the
amount of $2,840,224 for the East Metro HVAC and Building Automation Controls Upgrade Project. It is
further recommended that the General Manager or his designee be authorized to transfer $551,222 from
the Base System Contingency funds to the East Metro HVAC and Building Automation Controls Upgrade
Project. Funding for the contract and the transfer are included in the 2018 budget.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manger’s 2018 goal - Task Goal #3 – Asset
Management/State of Good Repair.
BACKGROUND
The East Metro maintenance and storage facility was constructed in 1979 - 1980 and opened for
operations in September of 1980. The facility is approximately 351,000 square feet and is comprised of
bus maintenance, bus storage, administrative offices and driver support areas.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s East Metro Facility has a total of 17 Supply Air Units (SAU) on the roof that serve the
maintenance and bus storage areas. Four (4) SAUs were replaced in October 1986 by Colorado Piping &
Mechanical and are to be replaced under the scope of this project due to the structural integrity of the
units, availability of parts and issues with maintainability. Six (6) SAUs were replaced in 1995 by AMI
Mechanical, Inc. and remain in good condition with some repair work scheduled to be completed under
the scope of this project. Seven (7) SAUs were replaced by JCOR Mechanical Inc. in 2010 and are in
very good condition. An outside air intake hood is being provided for each of these units as part of this
project to improve the integrity and longevity of the air filters in the SAUs. Two (2) existing air handling
units (AHU) serving the south Drivers End / Administration area are 25 years old and are to be replaced
under the scope of this project due to the condition of the units, availability of parts and issues with
maintainability. The East Metro Facility existing Building Automation System (BAS) is 25 to 38 years old
and has become inefficient and unmaintainable due to the availability of replacement parts. It is to be
replaced under the scope of this project. The bus maintenance tailpipe exhaust system is also to be
replaced under the scope of this project to better control bus tailpipe exhaust air rates and improve
energy efficiency.
BID OUTCOME
The Invitation For Bid (IFB) was advertised on January 31, 2018. Bids were received and opened on
March 6, 2018. Due to the great demand for this type of work in the Denver construction market, both
the bids exceeded the approved budget. After reviewing the Scope of Work and the bids, the low bid
has been deemed appropriate. The two bidders are proposed in the following manner.

1.B.1

1. JCOR Mechanical Inc.2. Ward Construction

-

$2,840,224
$3,334,000

SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT
The SBE goal was 5%. JCOR Mechanical Inc., being a certified SBE contractor, will have the capacity to
exceed the goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All funding is local and is in the approved 2018 Budget. In order to award the project to the lowest
bidder, JCOR Mechanical, Inc., we need to transfer $551,222 from the Base System Contingency Fund
into the approved budgeted line item. Over the past year there has been unprecedented price increases
that are affecting the local building industry.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to JCOR Mechanical
Inc. in the amount of $2,840,224 for the East Metro HVAC and Building Automation Controls
Upgrade Project. It is further recommended that the General Manager or his designee be
authorized to transfer $551,222 from the Base System Contingency funds to the East Metro
HVAC and Building Automation Controls Upgrade Project. Funding for the contract and the
transfer are included in the 2018 Budget.
2. Do Not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee
to award a contract to JCOR Mechanical Inc. in the amount of $2,840,224 for the East Metro
HVAC and Building Automation Controls Upgrade Project. Further, do not recommend that the
General Manager or his designee be authorized to transfer $551,222 from the General Manager’s
contingency funds to the East Metro HVAC and Building Automation Controls Upgrade Project.
The project shall be reduced in scope and re-advertised. Reducing the scope of the project will
not keep pace with the long-term State of Good Repair Goals required for the East Metro Facility.

Subject:

Architectural / Engineering Contract with Short
Elliot Hendrickson (SEH), Contract 16 FO-017 Contract Amendment #2

General

Board Meeting Date: April 17, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to amend Contract 16 FO-017 with SEH to allow for additional
architectural / engineering design services in the amount of $2,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed
Contract amount of $2,603,096.91. Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. Funding
for this Contract will be included in the individual approved project budgets.
This Recommended Action supports two of the General Manger’s 2018 goals. 1- Core Goal #1 Successful Delivery of Transit Services. 2 - Task Goal #3 – Asset Management/State of Good Repair.
BACKGROUND
This Board Action is to increase the existing not-to-exceed limit in the Contract. All other terms and
conditions of the Contract remain unchanged. Services rendered under this Contract provide mechanical,
civil, architectural, electrical, structural, and landscaping, design and engineering services for the
development of selected projects included in RTD's SBP Program and grant funded projects. The
Contract duration was specified for a three year term from November 01, 2016 to November 01, 2019
with award being in the amount of $453,096.91. To date one Amendment in the amount of $150,000
has been added to the Contract for a current not-to-exceed value of $603,096.91 Allowable, are two,
one-year extensions to the Contract. Exercising the two, one-year extensions brings the duration of the
contract to November 01, 2021.
DISCUSSION
Consultant responsibilities include preparation of drawings and specifications, in addition to estimating
and other construction related services as defined in their original Scope of Work. The purpose of this
Contract Amendment is to assist the Capital Programs Department with design services that cannot be
completed with in-house staff. To date, six Work Orders have been written for a total value of
$574,074. The additional $2,000,000 is an estimated value anticipated for the design support needed
for stand up of the North Metro Operations, system wide civil improvements, and facility renovations
including mechanical, electrical, and tenant finishes across the District.
SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT
The DBE goal for this contract is set at 10%. To date, the consultant is at 22.3%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This Contract utilizes grant and local funds. The type of funds are dependent upon the funding source of
each individual project. Individual work orders will be funded from the budgets of the projects where the
work will be performed.

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to amend
Contract 16 FO-017 with SEH to allow for additional architectural/ engineering design services in
the amount of $2,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed contract amount of $2,603,096.91. Instead,
proceed with the implementation of a new Architectural / Engineering RFP for a contract with a
new consultant team. This is not recommended because of the delay it will cause on all 2018
projects requiring these services.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
pass the attached Property Acquisition Resolution certifying property as necessary for the construction
of the North Metro Commuter Rail Project and authorize staff to process with all requisite legal process
under state eminent domain law. Funding of this acquisition is included in the 2018 Adopted Budget for
the North Metro Project.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 goals - Core Goal #1 – Successful
Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the contractor for the North Metro Commuter Rail
Project the right of way necessary for the construction of the project. Property needs have been
identified and specific legal descriptions prepared and all acquisitions certified by the Board by
Resolutions in September 2011, June 2013, March 2014 and March 2016 have been acquired. An
additional property interest has been identified by the contractor as required for construction of the
North Metro Commuter Rail Project
DISCUSSION
State and Federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has the power of eminent domain. RTD staff and
its outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offer and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceedings to resolve property acquisitions. The attached Resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by design and authorized the
General Manager and/or the Project Manager to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed
properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this right of way acquisition is included in the 2018 Adopted Budget for the North Metro
project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Pass the attached Resolution. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the
Board of Directors pass the attached Property Acquisition Resolution certifying property as necessary

Subject:

RTD Director District Precinct Assignment

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: April 17, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the revised Director District boundary between Director District E and Director District G so that
all of Arapahoe County Precinct Number 234 falls within Director District E, which has a lower
population than District G.
This recommendation addresses General Manager 2018 Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management:
Oversees operating and FasTracks budgets, ensures compliance with local, state, and federal reporting,
and development of financing plans for future projects.
BACKGROUND
On February 21, 2012, in accordance with CRS 32-9-111(1)(a), the Board approved a revised Director
District map to reflect changes in the District’s population as reflected in the 2010 Census. Per CRS 329-111(1)(a), individual Director Districts must be comprised of whole general election precincts, as
established by the boards of county commissioners of those counties wholly or partially within the
district and by the election commission of the City and County of Denver and the City and County of
Broomfield. CRS 32-9-111(1)(a) also requires that “the fifteen directors will represent, to the extent
practical, the people of the district on the basis of population”. While the statute does not provide
specific population requirements, the Board Redistricting Committee established a threshold of five
percent deviation from the average Director District population. At the time of redistricting, the
population of District E was 173,503 while the population of District G was 179,331. The mean
Director District population was 177,847.
From time to time, the individual counties adjust precinct boundaries. Usually, the adjusted precincts
remain completely within individual Director Districts; however, Arapahoe County has adjusted its
precincts so that Precinct Number 234, all of which was previously in Director District G (Director
Mihalik), now falls across the boundary of District G into District E (Director Folska). See attached map.
While a majority of the precinct’s land area lies within District G, a majority of the precinct’s population
is within District E. Furthermore, given uneven growth rates since the 2010 Census, the estimated
population of District G is now approximately 10,000 greater than that of District E (District G: 210,290
vs. District E: 200,470). The precinct in question straddles I-25 in the vicinity of Arapahoe Road. In
order to change the Director District boundaries, the Board must take action.
DISCUSSION
CRS 32-9-111(1)(a) states the following: “No general election precinct may be split into two or more
director districts.” Arapahoe County’s new precinct map places Precinct Number 234 over the boundary
of District E (Director Folska) and District G (Director Mihalik). In order to conform to statute, the Board
must adjust the Director District boundaries so that the new precinct lies exclusively in one Director
District.

Packet Pg. 14

1.B.4

If the Director District boundaries were adjusted to include all of Precinct Number 234 into District E
(already the smaller of the two Districts in question), the population of that Director District’s population
would increase by approximately 570. If the precinct were instead assigned to District G (the larger of
the two Districts in question), that District District’s population would increase by approximately 1,370,
which would make for an even larger population gap between the two districts.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this action.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action by the Planning, Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the revised Director District boundary between Director District E
and Director District G so that all of Arapahoe County Precinct Number 234 falls within Director
District E, which has a lower population than District G.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee
that the Board of Directors and do not approve the revised Director District boundary between
Director District E and Director District G so that all of Arapahoe County Precinct Number 234 falls
within Director District E, which has a lower population than District G. Instead, the Board could
expand Director District G to encompass the entirety of Precinct Number 234, which would expand
that Director District’s population by approximately 570.

Local Government Relations Update

Below is our update for March 2018:
1. Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) – The next full caucus meeting is scheduled for April 4,
2018, from 7:30-10 AM at the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce. Agenda items of
interest include a Mobility Choice Blueprint presentation and an update and discussion on
the proposed transportation funding initiatives.
2. Transportation Funding Initiative Update – The Coalition working to identify a

sustainable, dedicated funding source to address Colorado’s transportation infrastructure
filed a fifth initiative on Friday, March 23. This initiative will support local and
multimodal projects through a .35% sales tax increase that is expected to raise up to $432
million in the first year. Cities and counties will split 80% of the new revenue while the
remaining 20% of new revenue will be dedicated toward local and interregional
multimodal projects. The initiative will also allow the state to bond up to $3.7 billion in
projects that will be paid for with existing general fund dollars.
3. Citizens Advisory Committee – The CAC will be presenting a comprehensive quarterly

update on their activities in April, but I wanted to provide a preview of one items that I
am particularly excited about.
The Committee is developing a Transit Experience Project to (1) identify prospective
riders, (2) introduce participants to the RTD system through an experiential trip, and (3)
follow up with each participant to obtain feedback. Each CAC member will be asked to
organize one group during 2018, with the goal of hosting one tour in each RTD Director
District. The project also includes a follow-up contact with each participant to determine
if the introduction to the RTD experience was effective in encouraging them to use the
system, on either a regular or occasional basis.
4. Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan – As many of you may have heard, Aurora Mayor Steve
Hogan announced Monday that he has cancer and will not be seeking reelection in 2019.
Mayor Hogan has served the city in various capacities for 34 years. I’m sure you join me
in wishing him well as he battles this diagnosis.

Board Report

BBMK is following several transportation initiatives that have been filed for possible inclusion
on the 2018 ballot. The Denver Chamber has partnered with the Colorado Contractor’s
Association, and the larger business community on a proposal called Let’s Go, Colorado.
On Friday the Joint Budget Committee closed out the 2018-19 Long Bill. Highlights of the
budget include $495 million for Transportation, $225 million to offset expected costs from the
SB18-200 PERA reform measure, $50 million set aside for the School Finance Act to further
reduce the budget stabilization factor, $18 million set aside for the Department of Higher
Education, and $5 million for orphan wells. The Long Bill leaves $40 million to fund legislative
priorities currently working their way through the system. Second Reading of the Long bill will
be on Wednesday, and Third Reading is scheduled for Thursday.
SB18-001 Transportation Infrastructure Funding sponsored by Sen Baumgardner, Sen
Cooke, Rep Buck, and Rep Carver. This legislation, supported by Senate Republican
Leadership, would require the transportation commission to submit a ballot question to the voters
in the November 2018 election that would authorize additional TRANs bonds in a maximum
amount of $3.5 billion and with a maximum repayment cost of $5 billion. The bill would repeal
Sections 3,4, and 7 of SB 267 that require the state treasurer to execute lease-purchase
agreements of up to $1.88 billion for funding high-priority qualified federal aid transportation
projects. The bill would further require 10 percent of the state sales and use tax revenue to be
credited to the state highway fund and used to make TRANs payments. Lastly, it would require
CDOT to report on the use of these funds to the House and Senate Transportation Committees.
Senator Zenzinger offered L041 which is a strike below with a start date of 2019. The
amendment includes $500 million from the general fund for transportation and a 20-year
commitment of $250 million from the general fund for the bonding. The amendment was
accepted, and the bill passed the Second Reading in the Senate. Third Reading of the bill has
been laid over.
SB18-144 Bicycle Operation Approaching Intersection sponsored by Sen Kerr and Rep
Yeulin. The bill permits a municipality or county to adopt a local ordinance or resolution
regulating the operation of bicycles approaching intersections with stop signs or illuminated red
traffic control signals. Under a local regulation, a bicyclist approaching a stop sign must slow to
a reasonable speed and, when safe to do so, may proceed through the intersection without
stopping. A bicyclist approaching an illuminated red traffic control signal must stop at the

SB18-167 Enforce Requirements 811 Locate Underground Facilities sponsored by Sen Scott,
Sen Donovan, Rep Winter, and Rep Saine. This bill creates the Underground Damage
Prevention Safety Commission in the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment; two cash
funds to support the work of the commission and increased safety education and makes a variety
of changes to the state's excavation laws to improve enforcement. It will increase state revenue
and expenditures on an ongoing basis. It will also create new expenditure impacts for local
government entities, special districts, and the statutory public entity Colorado 811. The bill
passed Senate Finance and was referred amended to Senate Appropriations but is not yet
scheduled for a hearing. BBMK has been working with the bill sponsors to address RTD’s
concerns with the bill.
SB 18-204 Limit RTD Regional Transportation District Discount Fare Programs sponsored
by Sen Neville and Rep Lewis. The bill prohibits the regional transportation district from
offering new discount fare or incentive programs adopted after the effective date of the bill
without prior legislative approval. Director Hoy and RTD General Council provided excellent
testimony before the committee. BBMK is lobbying the full Senate asking for no votes on this
legislation. This bill passed Senate Finance and is scheduled for Second Reading on April 9th
at 9:00 am.
HB18-1278 Apprentice Utilization in Public Projects sponsored by Rep Benavidez and Sen
Moreno. This bill requires contractors employed by state agencies on public projects expected to
cost more than $500,000, awarded through competitive sealed bid, and not funded with federal
monies, to use apprentices enrolled in a registered apprenticeship program for at least 25 percent
of the workforce in apprenticeable occupations. A bid or proposal for such a project may only be
considered if it indicates that at least 25 percent of the workforce in apprenticeable occupations
will be hired to work on the project. The bill requires a contractor to submit an affidavit upon
completion of a project that it complied with the requirements of the bill or made a good faith
effort to do so. The bill allows a contractor to require its subcontractors to comply with the
requirements of the bill through a private contract. The bill has passed Second Reading in the
House.
SB18-088 Taxation of Retail Marijuana Sales was signed by the Governor on February 22nd.
BBMK has provided the appropriate RTD Executive Staff to the Department of Revenue who
have asked for a meeting to discuss the implementation of this legislation.
Faith Winter asked to meet with BBMK regarding her letter about the District’s Pass Program
working group and informed us she would be sending the attached letter to the Board. We
assured Rep Winter that we would continue to meet with her and update her on our progress.
BBMK is tracking a number of sales tax bills for any impacts to the District.
Please feel free to contact us anytime if you have questions about the legislation.

Federal Update on Infrastructure Plan, FY 2018 Omnibus Appropriations, US
DOT Grants

President Signs Omnibus Spending Bill
On March 23, the President signed into law the FY 2018 omnibus appropriations bill providing
funding for all Federal agencies and programs through September 30, 2018. Several of RTD’s top
priorities were included in the final bill, including the last payment under the Eagle P3 full funding
grant agreement (FFGA) and language directing the U.S. Department of Transportation (US DOT)
to return credit risk premiums (CRPs) paid under the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement
Financing (RRIF) program. RTD and Squire Patton Boggs (SPB) successfully advocated that these
provisions be included in the omnibus spending bill.
Eagle P3 Funding
The omnibus bill appropriated $2.65 billion for the Capital Investment Grant (CIG) program,
including $63.3 million for the final installment under RTD’s Eagle P3 FFGA. This funding will
complete RTD’s $1.03 billion grant award for the Eagle project under the CIG program.
CRP on RRIF Loan for Denver Union Station Project
The omnibus bill included language directing US DOT to define a cohort of loans under the RRIF
program to be loans made in a single fiscal year. The bill also directs US DOT to return CRPs
within 60 days after all obligations in a cohort are satisfied. Before the omnibus bill was released, US
DOT had signaled it intended to define a cohort much more broadly, such that RTD’s CRP funds
would almost assuredly be tied up for decades.
Under the omnibus language, RTD’s RRIF cohort will likely be determined by US DOT to include
one other loan made in FY 2010. That loan – $17 million to the Great Lakes Central Railroad – is
still outstanding. Under the omnibus bill, once that loan is repaid, US DOT must return the $28.9
million CRP, plus interest, that was paid on the Denver Union Station RRIF loan. RTD and SPB
continue discussions with US DOT to explore all options for securing the return of part or all of the
CRP as soon as possible.

Infrastructure Funding Increases
The omnibus spending bill provided a meaningful increase in funding for surface transportation
programs above Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act-authorized levels. These
funding increases were made possible under the terms of the two-year budget deal reached earlier
this year. For transit, the omnibus bill includes $834 million for several formula and discretionary
programs, with nearly half of that total going to the State of Good Repair formula program. In
addition, the bill provides $2.645 billion – above the $2.30 billion authorized in the FAST Act – for
the CIG program.
Many consider this increased infrastructure funding to be a “down payment” on the
Administration’s $200 billion infrastructure proposal. Stakeholders want more and are pressing
Congress to remain committed to advancing a comprehensive infrastructure funding proposal
during FY 2018.
RTD Board Members, CEO, and Senior Staff Advocate for Priorities in Washington DC
Several members of RTD’s Board of Directors and senior staff traveled to Washington DC for the
annual American Public Transportation Association (APTA) Legislative Conference. During their
visit, Board members and senior staff met with senior FTA officials, RTD’s congressional
delegation, and authorizing and appropriations committee staff to discuss RTD’s priorities. These
priorities included the final installment of RTD’s Eagle P3 FFGA and the return of RTD’s CRP on
the Denver Union Station RRIF loan. Additionally, Board members and staff provided project
updates on the University of Colorado A Line, B Line, G Line, and Southeast Extension.
Federal Transit Administration
RTD’s Board Chair, CEO, and staff met with FTA Acting Administrator Jane Williams to discuss
project updates and the successful transit oriented development surrounding the Denver Union
Station project and the Southeast Extension. Acting Administrator Williams was impressed with the
level of transit oriented development along RTD’s lines and suggested that RTD update its map of
routes built with New Starts funding to include additional information on dates of each FFGA
award, the date of each line’s initial revenue service, the level of State and local funding in each
project.
Colorado Congressional Delegation
The meetings with the Congressional delegation focused on providing project updates and seeking
support for RTD’s final year of Eagle P3 funding and the return of RTD’s RRIF CRP. Senators
Gardner and Bennet and Rep. DeGette all agreed to help RTD in our efforts to secure return of the
CRP, including by sending letters to US DOT and relevant Congressional committees.
Transportation Authorizing and Appropriations Committees
RTD’s Board members, CEO and staff also met with authorizing and appropriations committee
staff in the House and Senate to provide project updates and advocate for the return of RTD’s
RRIF CRP and the final installment of funding for the Eagle project. Like FTA, transportation
Committee staff found the RTD map of New Starts-funded lines to be valuable and suggested some
additional information they would like to see included.

On March 19, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) released partial-year apportionments of FY
2018 formula funds, totaling six months of funding. FTA is expected to release the remaining FY
2018 apportionments in the coming weeks, now that a full-year appropriations bill has been enacted.

Congress Begins to Consider Infrastructure Package
Since the release of the Trump Administration’s infrastructure proposal in mid-February, several
Congressional committees have held hearings to evaluate the plan as they begin the process of
drafting their own infrastructure legislation. Per Speaker Ryan, Congress may elect to include
infrastructure provisions in other related bills slated to move in 2018, such as the Water Resources
Development Act (WRDA) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization legislation,
rather than passing a single comprehensive infrastructure bill.
