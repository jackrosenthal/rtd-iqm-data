BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: October 2, 2019

From:

Pauletta Tonilas, Assistant General Manager,
Communications

GM

Date:

October 1, 2019

Board Meeting Date:

Subject:

Federal Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Communications and Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a new agreement for Federal
Liaison Services with Squire Patton Boggs, LLC for a three-year contract at a cost of $828,000
($23,000 per month—the same rate as currently being paid) with two one-year options (option year one
at $276,000; option year two at $276,000. The total amount of the five-year contract of $1,380,000
was below staff’s internal cost estimate, and funding for this contract is included in the annual budgets.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #5 – Effective Communications & Community Outreach
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Federal Liaison Services was issued on July 30, 2019. The solicitation
was advertised in The Denver Post and Transit Talent. In addition, 13 personal emails were sent to
previous bidders to make sure they were aware of the solicitation. Fourteen entities downloaded the
RFP, and one proposal was received. This solicitation was a Best Value Procurement where technical
factors and cost were all considered. The proposal was evaluated by a five-member evaluation
committee that concurred on the recommendation to approve the Squire Patton Boggs, LLC proposal.
The recommendation of the evaluation committee was subsequently referred to the Communications and
Government Relations Committee on October 8, 2019. The Communications and Government Relations
Committee recommended that Squire Patton Boggs, LLC be offered a new three-year contract with two
one-year options. Squire Patton Boggs has been RTD’s federal lobbyist since 2000 and over the years
has assisted in RTD’s receiving over $3.28 billion in federal grants and loans. In addition to constant
monitoring of Congressional and Executive Branch activities, status reports are issued and special
reports are prepared when required by the Board of Directors or the General Manager.
DISCUSSION
Constant monitoring of federal legislative activities that relate to RTD is required, and RTD’s interests
must be conveyed to appropriate members of Congress, including the Colorado delegation and other key
Congressional committee members. The Squire Patton Boggs team has an excellent rapport with and
respect from the Colorado delegation and serves as a resource for the delegation staff. Most recently
Squire Patton Boggs was instrumental in RTD being awarded $1.03 billion Full Funding Grant Agreement
for the Eagle P3 Project, as well as the Small Starts grant of $92 million for the Southeast Extension
Project.

Packet Pg. 17

1.C.1

The FAST Act expires on September 20, 2020, so the federal lobbyists will play a key role in
representing RTD’s needs in the next reauthorization bill. With the continued build out of FasTracks, the
lobbyists will need to be especially attentive to potential federal financing options for the unfunded
corridors, and they will monitor discussions and advocate for RTD’s best interests regarding new
reauthorization language. When the bill is enacted, Squire Patton Boggs will play a key role in advising
RTD as to the contents of the bill and monitoring the rule-making process.
In addition to helping with Congressional activities, assistance is also necessary with the Executive
Branch of the federal government, including the Department of Transportation (the Federal Transit
Administration and the Federal Railroad Administration). Squire Patton Boggs will provide guidance and
assistance in applying for and receiving federal funds from the Department of Transportation.
When Board members attend the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) Legislative
Conference in Washington, DC, in March of every year, Squire Patton Boggs works to set appointments
with the Colorado Congressional delegation, as well as with key Hill committee members. As an
example of creating a beneficial trip experience, this past year former Chairman of the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Bill Shuster spoke to the group, and a separate luncheon
was convened with former US Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater along with Eno Transportation
leaders.
The Denver office of Squire Patton Boggs serves as important advisory role in RTD’s connection to
relevant national personnel and issues. In addition, annually, or as required, meetings with the Board of
Directors are also held.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a new agreement for Federal Liaison
Services with Squire Patton Boggs, LLC for a three-year contract at a cost of $828,000 ($23,000
per month—the same rate as currently being paid) with two one-year options (option year one at
$276,000; option year two at $276,000. The total amount of the five-year contract of
$1,380,000 was below staff’s internal cost estimate, and funding for this contract is included in
the annual budgets.
2. Continue the current contract on a month-to-month basis, if amenable to the current Contractor
(Squire Patton Boggs LLP). This option is not recommended because long-term continuity and
stability in liaison services are important considerations.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and issue a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for Federal
Liaison Services. This option is not recommended because RTD’s RFP process was properly
utilized for this procurement, and the proposal was reviewed and subjected to the evaluation
criteria, resulting in a recommendation from the evaluation committee—pursuant to RTD’s longstanding procurement procedures.

Appointments

Advisory

Committee

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Nominating Committee of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) Citizens
Advisory Committee (CAC) that the RTD Board of Directors reappoint three members of the Committee
to an additional three-year term and appoint two new members to the Committee to three-year terms.
Core Goal #5 - Effective Communications & Community Outreach
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Citizens Advisory Committee is comprised of residents from around the region. Members are
appointed by RTD Board of Directors and volunteer their time to advise the District on a range of issues
that affect citizens and impact the region. Five current members’ terms expired on July 31, 2019.
Recruitment for citizens interested in serving was publicly advertised through the RTD website, local
publications and stakeholder e-mail distributions. Applicants were asked to submit an application
explaining why they wanted to serve on the Committee, describing what unique experience and skill-set
they would bring to the Committee, listing their affiliations and volunteer activities they believe will add
value to the Committee, and sharing a statement of personal objectives/goals if accepted for CAC
membership.
A total of 30 applications were received. Three current members are eligible for reappointment and two
of the three expressed an interest in continuing to serve on the Committee.
The Nominating Committee decided, based on attendance, participation at meetings and Committee
consistency to recommend reappointment of the three current members who requested reappointment.
The Nominating Committee then carefully reviewed each application received and conducted interviews
with short-listed applicants to fill two positions.
The following current members are recommended for reappointment to an additional three-year term
expiring July 31, 2022:
Joseph Lamers is retired from the Metropolitan State University of Denver (MSUD), where he worked in
a variety of Information Technology positions. Since retiring he has made transportation, particularly for

FINANCIAL IMPACT

There is no additional financial impact.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Nominating Committee of the Regional Transportation District (RTD)
Citizens Advisory Committee that the RTD Board of Directors reappoint three members of the
Committee to an additional three-year term, and appoint two new members to the Committee to
three-year terms.
2. Modify the recommended appointments to the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee. This is not
recommended as the appointment is within the parameters of the Committee Structure adopted
by the RTD Board of Directors.
3. Do not adopt the Recommended Action. This is not recommended as this alternative would delay
the appointment process of the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee.

Re:

October Board Update

The Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) participated in a tour that BBMK
and RTD arranged of the 61AV project on September 27th. The tour was a great success and
highlighted the District’s commitment to include innovation in future planning. This tour was
provided at the request of the TLRC and we received positive feedback from the members who
attended. Legislators in attendance included Representatives Matt Gray, Monica Duran, Meg
Froelich and Senators Faith Winter, Dennis Hisey and Kevin Priola. Board Members in
attendance included Board Chair Doug Tisdale, Director Guissinger, Malipede, Buzek and
Whitmore. General Manager Genova, Sherry Ellebracht and Bruce Abel were also present.
BBMK will be attending a meeting with Senator Priola and other transportation stakeholders on
October 7th. Senator Priola is considering introducing legislation to address the lack of funding
for transportation. The meeting will begin with a discussion of SCR 3 from last session, a
resolution which would have would have repealed the state motor fuel tax and replaced it with an
increase in the state sales and use tax for the purpose of funding transportation projects.
RTD will make its annual presentation to the Transportation Legislation Review Committee
(TLRC) on October 28 at 9:00am in the State Capitol, room 271. The committee members
always appreciate seeing Board members at the Capitol and we strongly encourage the Board to
mark their calendars and attend the committee meeting.
At the request of Rep. Shannon Bird (Westminster), BBMK is working with RTD Senior Staff
to coordinate a tour of the B Line as part of the Colorado Competitive Council’s ( C3) October
22-23 legislative trip.
Beginning in December, BBMK will be scheduling monthly town hall calls with legislators and
RTD Senior Staff and Board Directors. These calls will provide the opportunity for continuous
engagement with legislators on issues impacting the District.
The FAMLI Task Force met for the third time and will make initial recommendations on a staterun family medical leave program by November 1, 2019. During the most recent meeting the
task force received feedback from the business community and the Governor’s Office. We have
attached the Governor’s recommendations to the task force. The final recommendation will
include an actuarial analysis, and a final recommendation on a state family and medical leave
program to be delivered to the legislature no later January 8, 2020.

The third stakeholder meeting of the 239 Taskforce was held on September 26th. The meeting
included a discussion about various alternatives for proposed fee structures to be charged on taxi,
transportation network companies (Uber, Lyft), rental car, peer car share, non-peer car share and
residential delivery. Meeting attendees were asked to respond to an informal straw poll asking
which fee mechanism was the easiest to administer and best met the goals of SB 239. A flat fee
was viewed as the easiest to administer with a fee based upon vehicle miles traveled the best
method to influence behavior.
BBMK has confirmed that Joint Budget Committee Members Senator Moreno, Senator
Zenzinger and Rep. Hansen will provide a pre-session overview on transportation funding during
the December RTD Board meeting.

Thank you for volunteering your time and energy to help the State design a paid family and
medical leave program (FAMLI) for employees in Colorado. In accordance with Senate Bill 19188, your work to help expand our understanding of and define the challenges related to
establishing an effective and affordable program is invaluable and greatly appreciated. As I
stated in my first State of the State address, I believe Coloradans deserve paid family and
medical leave. In Congress, I proudly sponsored the Family and Medical Insurance Leave
(FAMILY) Act. I also called for a maternity and paternity benefit for all state public employees
in my first budget as Governor, and I plan to try again by putting forward a family leave
request in our next budget as we position the state as a model employer.
Several members of this taskforce have asked for my input on the proposals before you, and
as someone who has worked extensively on this issue nationally, including as the ranking
member on the Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee of the US House
Committee on Education and the Workforce, and as a former private sector employer, I am
honored to share my perspective.
Paid leave has Democrat and Republican champions nationally; the first bipartisan federal
paid family leave proposal was just recently introduced by Senators Cassidy (R-LA) and
Sinema (D-AZ). It is my hope and belief that Congress will act within the next ten years to
finally pass comprehensive paid family and medical leave legislation, and state legislation
should contemplate the likely federal policy.
Because of my commitment to making paid leave a reality in Colorado as quickly as possible, I
would like to share a few thoughts about how your work can best support this goal in the 2020
legislative session. My suggestions build on the debate in the 2019 legislative session as well
as the broad directives in SB19-188.
SB19-188 requires the taskforce to issue a report and accompanying actuarial analysis of a
proposed state paid leave program that is administered either by the state or by a third party
vendor. The bill also provides that the task force thoroughly analyze these options and
includes a number of factors key to the success of any paid leave program.
It is my view that the task force would be well served to consider a third option: requiring
employers above a certain size to provide a defined minimum paid-leave benefit to
employees, which an employer could choose to administer either by itself or through
insurance provided through the private market.
The goal of SB19-188 is to provide both the General Assembly and me with enough
information to choose the best possible paid leave program. Without a thorough analysis of
this third option, I do not believe we will have all of the information we need.

Attachment: Polis - FAMLI Task Force Letter (3946 : State Update - Brandeberry McKenna)

Dear Colorado FAMLI Task Force members:

1.D.3.c

In my view, taking into account the immediate needs of workers, there are several additional
goals that are needed to successfully implement FAMLI legislation. Below are some issues I
believe are worthy of consideration:
1.
Colorado’s program should use the federal family and medical (FMLA) leave program
eligibility as a foundational starting point, while charting the path forward by expanding
eligibility requirements to include other vulnerable populations, such as victims of domestic
abuse, and by lowering the employee threshold to a number lower than the 50 employees
required under federal FMLA.
2.
Colorado’s program should not reduce any employee’s existing paid benefits, or
penalize or cost employees who are already receiving these benefits, nor cost employers who
are already providing benefits above the minimum level proposed in this legislation. Model
employers who provide more than the minimum benefits set in the state legislation should not
be negatively impacted.
3.
Colorado’s program should provide employees with paid leave benefits as soon as
possible; my hope is that this program will be in effect by January 2021, with the intent to
responsibly expand the program over time (including potentially increasing the duration of
paid leave and potentially decreasing the size of employers subject to the requirements).
I hope these suggestions are helpful and will inform the debate legislators will face during the
2020 legislative session. CDLE Executive Director Joe Barela and other key members of my
team will continue to keep me apprised of your efforts. If you have any concerns or questions
about these comments, or any other matters related to this important FAMLI effort, please
don’t hesitate to get in touch with me through them.
Again, thank you for your work and commitment to bringing a viable paid family-leave benefit
to Colorado and its workers. This would realize the goals and dreams of Coloradans, including
Former Representative Pat Schroeder, who helped write FMLA and sought to make the leave
paid back in 1993. This is critical work whose time has come, and I am grateful for your
contribution.
Sincerely,

Jared Polis
Governor

Similarly, I suggest that your report include an analysis of a range of options for many of the
18 specific elements (including duration and wage replacement levels) that the Task Force
has identified for inclusion in the report. I also believe we will benefit from hearing various
viewpoints from members on these elements (majority, minority, and even individual points
of view), and I urge you to include these as well.

Federal Update for October 8, 2019, Board Meeting

Congress Buys Time to Resolve Differences in FY 2020 Appropriations Bills by Passing a
Continuing Resolution
On September 27, the President signed an eight-week continuing resolution (CR) to fund the
departments and programs of Federal government through November 21. None of the twelve fullyear FY 2020 appropriations bills, including the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development
(THUD) bill, have been sent to the President. Congress has now begun a two-week recess and will
return on October 14 to continue its work on those FY 2020 spending bills.
Rostenkowski Test
The CR includes a suspension of the Rostenkowski Test, which is a provision in law intended to
ensure programs funded by the Highway Trust Fund are sufficiently supported by HTF revenues.
The suspension of the Rostenkowski Test for the eight weeks the CR is in effect blocks a 12 percent
across-the-board cut to Transit Formula Grants that had been due to occur on October 1. These
cuts are triggered automatically when unfunded authorizations of the Mass Transit Account of the
HTF are projected to exceed receipts for the next four fiscal years.
While the CR’s suspension of the Rostenkowski Test is only in place for the term of the CR, the
House-passed THUD bill also includes this suspension, and it is widely believed that the final
THUD appropriations bill for FY 2020 will include the suspension as well.
Senate Appropriators Pass FY 2020 THUD Spending Bill out of Committee
Before the recess, on September 19, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved its FY 2020
THUD bill. Notably, the bill provides:


FAST Act-authorized funding levels for transit formula and discretionary grant programs
funded through the Highway Trust Fund;

47 Offices in 20 Countries
Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP is part of the international legal practice Squire Patton Boggs, which operates worldwide through a number of separate
legal entities.

$1.978 billion for the CIG program (less than the House bill and FAST Act authorized levels
of $2.3 billion);
$390 million in additional General Fund funding (above FAST Act levels) for the Buses and
Bus Facilities grant program;
$40 million in additional General Fund funding (above FAST Act levels) for the Low or No
Emission Bus grant program; and
$1 billion for the BUILD grant program.

RRIF Credit Risk Premium Issue
The Senate THUD bill and report language do not now include a fix for RTD’s RRIF CRP issue.
However, when a CRP provision for early RRIF loans (Cohort 1) was included in the FY 2019
Omnibus appropriations bill, it was added in conference after appearing in neither the House nor
Senate Committee-approved THUD bills. The House Appropriations Committee has indicated that
the Senate should be responsible for any CRP fix for our Cohort 3 loan, since it has been the Senate
appropriators that have made RRIF program changes in prior years. Accordingly, we continue to
work with RTD’s Congressional delegation, and in particular Senators Gardner and Bennet, to
secure language returning RTD’s $29 million CRP, with interest. Senators Gardner and Bennet
introduced legislation earlier this summer, the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing
Equity Act (S. 2213), that would direct the US Department of Transportation to return RTD’s $29
million RRIF CRP, and we are working to include that legislative text in the final negotiated THUD
bill or Omnibus appropriations bill later this fall.
