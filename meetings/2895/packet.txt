Committee Purpose:

employment litigations, including oversight of the costs and expenses associated
with such litigations, which oversight shall be conducted in consultation and
collaboration with RTD General Counsel, with such ad hoc committee reporting to
the full Board in Executive Session as needed. The Board of Directors protects the
public and provides oversight and guidance to the organization in the achievement of
its goals and objectives and only the Board may make any policy decisions concerning
major civil litigations. The ad hoc committee has no independent decision-making
authority. The purpose of this committee is to review important information arising
from the major civil litigation addressed under this charter, and summarize it for
inclusion in the monthly reports to be provided by the Ad Hoc Committee to the full
Board.

Operating Procedures:

and would update the committee on the same general schedule unless significant
developments warrant added reporting.
The ad hoc committee members and Legal staff will review all items to make sure all
information and backup is correct for reporting to the full Board on a monthly basis.
It is to be determined whether informational items will be brought forward to the
Board and whether or not an Executive Session is warranted.
Robert’s Rules (the Board’s established parliamentary authority) will be applied in the
discussion of any item.
The currently adopted Board of Directors Operating Guidelines are to be followed at
all meetings.



The Committee Chair and Vice-Chair may jointly agree to cancel or postpone a
scheduled committee meeting.

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the second quarter of 2019 attached.
The U.S. economy and household spending continued to expand at a moderate pace during the second
quarter of 2019 although business fixed investment has been soft. The U.S. unemployment rate
remained low over the period and general inflationary pressures remained tame.
RTD invests in short-term fixed income securities so the activities of the Federal Reserve Open Market
Committee (FOMC) are very influential on our portfolios. In order to support continued progress toward
maximum employment and price stability, the FOMC chose to lower the target range for the federal
funds rate to 2.00% from 2.25% on July 31. The FOMC stated “This action supports the Committee’s
view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near
the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about
this outlook remain.”
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

2nd Quarter

Y-T-D

RTD cash and cash equivalents:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 3-month U.S. T-Bill Index

0.622%
0.639%

RTD enhanced cash:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index:

0.948%
0.950%

1.759%
1.733%

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through the second quarter of 2019 was 2.3%, which
would produce annualized earnings of approximately $4.3 million. The current yield for the month of
June was 2.26%.
Historical performance of RTD Liquidity Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy benchmark is
reflected in the following graph:

Historical performance of RTD Enhanced Cash Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy
benchmark is reflected in the following graph:

In addition to the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s portfolio, all other reserves are
invested in accordance with state law and additional guiding documents such as bond indentures,

DISCUSSION

Smart Media Technology
The Smart Card Program is an Electronic Fare Collection and Payment System designed to increase fare
payment convenience for our customers, reduce and optimize fare collection costs for the agency and
reduce fraud associated with paper based fare media. The contract was signed with Xerox Transport
Solutions, Inc. (now Conduent) in mid-2010. A smart card is a plastic card onto which customers load
and reload RTD fare products. There are currently 4 products; EcoPass, CollegePass, Neighborhood
EcoPass and MyRide Stored Value available on the smart card.
All bus and rail validator installations are complete. Additional validators will be installed as new buses
and rail stations are commissioned into service.
The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass and Neighborhood EcoPass customers on
January 1, 2013. There are approximately 335,621 active cards in circulation. During the month of
July 2019, 1.47 million taps were recorded.
Starting the morning of January 4, 2016 MyRide Stored Value cards were dispersed to the public pilot
program participants at the RTD retail outlets. On Wednesday May 17, 2017, the MyRide web portal
went live to the pilot participants and on May 24, 2017, the MyRide web portal was launched to the
public. Value can be loaded onto the card online, at RTD sales outlets and at retail outlets (Safeway and
King Soopers). As of June 1, 2017, customers can load cash value onto their MyRide cards at 47
Safeway retail stores. Since launch, Safeway has $156,705 in cash value loads. As of July 1, 2017,
customers can load cash value onto MyRide cards at 86 King Soopers retail stores. Since launch, King
Soopers has $184,102 in cash value reloads.
Effective 3Q 2019, RTD and Conduent have been conducting steps to wind down/close out the base
Contract with Conduent in an effort to redirect resources towards the new Account Based Fare
Collection System. Effective June 2019, RTD and Conduent have reached an agreement in principle to
close out the base contract provided a resolution for the PV screens is achieved and we have a
Hardware/Software maintenance contract in place. We expect to have the wind down contract
negotiations memorialized by Q3 2019.

Mobile Ticketing
The RTD branded mobile ticketing app was launched in November 2017, and was very well received.

monthly passes are sold in the RTD branded mobile ticketing app. LiVE discount 3-hour and day passes
went on sale in the RTD branded mobile ticketing app on August 5th. As of June 2019, 12.4% of fare
revenue is from the mobile ticketing app.
In May 1, 2019, RTD launched a new sales channel and became the first transit agency in the world to
sell mobile tickets in the Uber app. This unprecedented collaboration between a Transportation Network
Company and Public Transportation Agency was made possible by RTD’s mobile ticketing vendor
Masabi. Through July, RTD has sold 3,592 tickets in the Uber app. All mobile ticket types are sold in
the Uber app, and tickets cost the same as they do in the RTD branded mobile app. RTD plans to
continue innovating and integrating with other 3rd party apps. An integration with CDOT Bustang and
Transit app are in progress. Early plans are underway to experiment with Masabi’s cash digitization
feature allowing unbanked and underbanked populations to purchase mobile tickets with cash at RTD
sales outlets.

RTD conducted a mobile ticketing customer satisfaction in April 2019. Key mobile ticketing survey key
findings:


Data suggest Mobile Tickets users ride RTD services infrequently. 38% of users did not
use the app to pay their fare in the past 30 days. Another 22% used the app once in the past 30 days.
Overall, users rate the app favorably. 91% of users report they are likely to recommend
the app to someone else. Similarly, 91% are likely to use the app to pay their RTD fare in the
future.


A higher percentage of users are satisfied in 2019 vs. 2017. 89% of users in the current
survey are satisfied with the app overall compared to 85% in 2017.


Though ratings remain high, users rate the app’s ease of use lower in 2019. 93% of users
rated the app’s ease of use as a 4 or 5 in 2017. Currently, 90% of users rate the app’s ease
of use as a 4 or 5.


Users often describe the app as easy, quick, fast, and convenient when explaining the
reasons for their satisfaction. Many users are satisfied with the app, as it enables them too
quickly and conveniently purchase fares. Those dissatisfied with the app tend to cite one or
more of the following reasons: login issues; difficulty storing credit card information; app does
not offer discounted tickets; slow loading times; tickets expired before use; accessing Trip
Planner and NextRide forces a user to leave the app; not all ticket options are available
through the app.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

LiVE Program Update

Board Meeting Date: August 13, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND:
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group recommendations and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from
RTD’s full fare rates for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live
within the District, have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be
between the ages of 20 and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are
ages 19 and under and ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program will be
discontinued after December 31, 2019.
DISCUSSION
In order to use a LiVE discount fare, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE eligibility card to
bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must apply through the
State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) system. The PEAK system is the
application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an option to apply for the
LiVE program. Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and
fall under the income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical
eligibility”) for the LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements.
Applicants that do not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well.
After an applicant has submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE
program and has uploaded a photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system
are reviewed for eligibility by Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility
requirements and have uploaded a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor
for production, mailing, and card administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their
eligibility card within about two weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility
requirements or do not provide the correct information are notified by mail.
The PEAK application to be eligible for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29,
2019.

As of August 5th, 367 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 173 have been approved, 99
have been denied and the remaining 95 are pending. Of the 99 denied, 72 of them were denied because
of age, i.e they were 19 or younger or 65 and older which entitles them to a better discount. Twentyfour were denied because their address was out of district, one because it was a duplicate application,
and two because they didn’t meet the income threshold.
In addition to going live on July 29th, the following actions have been completed:
 LiVE fares are available through RTD’s mobile ticketing application
 LiVE fares are available on LiVE MyRide smart cards. The cards can be ordered through the
MyRide portal and have been made available for purchase at RTD sales outlets as well as King
Soopers and Safeway stores
 LiVE airport upgrades are available on buses and from Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs)
 Order forms for LiVE 10-ride tickets have been made available to organizations in the RTD
nonprofit program.
 RTD Operations staff and Security staff have been trained on the LiVE fares and eligibility
requirements
 Marketing, training, product readiness and communications activities have been deployed
 Step-by-by step instructions for applications as well as other materials are available through the
RTD LiVE web page. A LiVE Program handout has been created and printed.
 The LiVE application process in PEAK is available to applicants in both English and Spanish.
 RTD customer service is answering LiVE program questions and referring customers to the
appropriate parties for assistance.
 Denver Human Services is verifying income for those not categorically income-eligible through
public assistance programs.
 Denver Human Services is providing LiVE eligibility customer service by phone and e-mail.
 Ongoing LiVE application software testing and “bug” fixes are occurring.
 The livecard@rtd-denver.com mailbox is active and being utilized to field questions.
 A feedback form about the LiVE application experience is available on the RTD website.
Next Steps:
 RTD will refine Marketing materials and communications based on experience gained since rollout.
 RTD is working with nonprofit agencies to ensure a smooth transition from the current nonprofit
program rules procedures to the new ones that go into effect.
 RTD staff is planning additional Marketing and Outreach activities.
 RTD will conduct a survey of LiVE customers for feedback on all aspects of the LiVE program
