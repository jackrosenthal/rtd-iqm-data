BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Monthly Government Relations Report – September 2025

September 25, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2025 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session
to provide an avenue for Board-adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency
staff.
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives
better through connections.
It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and federal elected
officials. To achieve these goals, Board members and staff must be proactive in educating and
informing the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared
goals.
In furtherance of the program, the agency’s Government Relations Officer coordinates and develops
strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve as a point of contact
for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable government relations highlights at the federal, state, and local levels since
the last Executive Committee meeting held on July 24, 2025. This report was prepared on September
11, 2025, and will be updated verbally as needed during the Executive Committee meeting scheduled
for Thursday, September 25, 2025.
Federal
At the federal level, Congress was on recess for all of August and returned to Washington, DC at the
beginning of September with less than one month to take action to pass or extend funding for federal
agencies and programs. The federal fiscal year concludes on September 30, 2025. Progress on

Packet Pg. 5

1.4.1

appropriations bill negotiations suggest that a short-term extension will be needed to provide time for
Congressional appropriators to see if a path forward can be reached. A short-term extension is not
guaranteed, and if no action is taken, the federal government could shut down. As a reminder, the
federal government is currently operating on a Continuing Resolution, which was an extension of
funding approved during the Biden Administration. In the event of a federal government shutdown,
there will be impacts to the programs administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation, but
formula funding provided through the Highway Trust Fund is expected to be available for
reimbursement. RTD staff will continue to keep the Board updated on any impacts to the agency.
State
In state matters, the legislature’s joint House and Senate interim Transportation Legislation Review
Committee (TLRC) held two recent meetings. On September 8, 2025, RTD’s Chief Financial Officer and
Government Relations Officer were requested to give a brief presentation on RTD’s funding sources
and financial overview, personal safety and security, customer boardings, and EcoPass sales. During
the September 9, 2025, meeting of the committee, the members proposed and approved five legislative
concepts to be drafted by legislative staff. None of the five bills approved for drafting has any direct
impact on RTD. The TLRC is scheduled to meet one final time before the end of the year on October 21,
2025.
Regarding state grant funding for transit operations, the Clean Transit Enterprise (CTE) has been
working since the passage of SB24-230 to establish a grantmaking process and administer funding
generated from oil and gas production fees. The CTE Board of Directors is scheduled to approve and
implement the fee in the coming months. A notice of funding availability was published and requests
for the formula grant program, which is roughly 70% of the total oil and gas fees. The notice of funding
does outline that eligible uses of the funding are for operations and do not include capital investments
other than rolling stock purchases. Applications are due by September 19, 2025. RTD’s staff has been
working closely with the CTE Executive Director to plan, develop, and submit eligible uses for potential
state funding.
Lastly, the RTD Accountability Committee created by SB25-161 has begun to hold meetings which will
culminate in a report being delivered to the Governor and Legislature making recommendations on a
series of topics. Staff is engaged in the process and working to provide information requested by the
Committee by the Governor’s staff, Committee consultants, and Committee members.
Local
At the local level, staff continues to actively arrange engagement opportunities with local municipal
partners. On August 28, 2025, staff and Director Whitmore we able to present an update on a variety of
topics to the North Area Transportation Association that included Mayors, Commissioners and
Councilmembers from the Adams County region. Additional engagements will be updated verbally
during the Executive Committee meeting scheduled for Thursday, September 18, 2025.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2026 Draft Legislative and Government Relations
Program

September 25, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
As part of the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, staff initiated a process to develop and implement an annual
Legislative and Government Relations Program. The RTD Board of Directors approved the agency’s first
Legislative and Government Relations Program in October 2021. The Legislative and Government
Relations Program is adopted by the Board of Directors annually and serves as a guiding document for
Government Relations staff, and external advocates, to pursue goals related to legislation and policy
matters. Additionally, the Legislative and Government Relations Program serves as an organizing
document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to provide an avenue for Board
adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
DISCUSSION
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative and Government Relations Program are
designed to make lives better through connections. It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to
the region’s local, state, and federal elected officials. To achieve the adopted goals, RTD must be
proactive to educate and inform the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities
available to advance shared goals. Equally important is building trust through partnership that fits
within the framework of RTD’s financial forecast. The draft 2026 Legislative and Government Relations
Program, included as Attachment A to this Board report, outlines priority actions on a variety of issues
that staff believe are achievable through advocacy and collaboration.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
While legislation may have a financial impact on RTD, the Board’s approval of this document has no
any immediate financial impact on the agency.

2026 Legislative and Government Relations Program
PURPOSE
To establish a set of Board-approved legislative and advocacy policies that benefit the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) and assist in guiding staff’s actions and efforts during the 2026 legislative
session that support the priorities and success outcomes of the agency’s adopted 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan.
STRATEGY
Developing and maintaining relationships with myriad stakeholders is central to RTD’s strategic
approach to government relations. Staff will work to communicate, educate, inform and partner with
the agency’s Congressional delegation, the Governor’s Office, the state General Assembly delegation,
and local elected officials to advocate for Board approved policies.
Additionally, staff will continue to work with its industry associations – such as the America Public
Transportation Association (APTA), the Colorado Association of Transit Agencies (CASTA), regional
transportation management organizations/associations (TMOs/TMAs), Chambers of Commerce, and
other stakeholder organizations – to partner and collaborate on shared goals to advance and seek
support for legislative positions approved by the Board. Specifically included within this strategy is staff’s
collaboration with the Board of Directors to utilize relationships to advance policies. Lastly, tactics
included in the Legislative Program will be guided and informed by the priorities set forth in the agency’s
Board-approved 2021-2026 Strategic Plan – Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, Financial Success.
EXECUTION PLAN
Contained herein are specific priorities and actions that outline areas of focus for the 2026 Legislative
and Government Relations Program. Beyond the actions listed in this program, specific legislative
matters are likely to arise that warrant consideration by the Board of Directors.
To allow staff flexibility for consideration of items to be changed, added, or deleted as a result of
legislation introduced during the legislative session, the recommended change must be presented to the
Board as part of the Board Executive Committee or another Committee deemed appropriate by the
General Manager/CEO and Board Chair. If time does not allow for an item to be agendized for a
Committee meeting for discussion by the Board, RTD will remain neutral on the legislation in question.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Board Office Budget Review

September 25, 2025

REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Board Office Executive Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
At its meeting on December 3, 2024, the Board of Directors approved amendments to the Board’s
Bylaws further clarifying the roles of certain standing committees. The adopted amendments added
explicit responsibilities to the Executive Committee, one of which is to annually review the Board Office
budget.
Additionally, at the December 3, 2024, Board meeting, the Board adopted the 2025 agency budget
which appropriated $1,481,610 to the Board Office for the 2025 fiscal year (FY) The Board Office budget
is divided into two main categories of expenses, those supporting the operations of the Board Office
and those expenses primarily attributable to individual Directors. This discussion was originally
scheduled for the Executive Committee’s meeting in April but was subsequently delayed.
The majority of Board Office operations budget is comprised of the salaries and benefits for four (4)
full-time employees. Additional operational expenses have been allocated primarily to cover costs
related to the production of board meetings as well as to pay annual licensing fees for the software
used to create, publish, and maintain records of board meeting packets and agendas.
The majority of budgeted Board Member expenses are dictated by the RTD Act ($12,000 annual stipend
paid to Board members) as well as the Board’s Expense and Reimbursement Policy, which allocates
certain dollar amounts to Directors for expenses related to the conduct of their official duties. This
includes funds to cover monthly internet/phone costs (up to $140 per month), local business expenses
(up to $4,000 per year), conference registration fees (up to $1,800 per year), and out-of-district travel
costs (up to $6,000 per year).
Totals for the 2025 Board-approved Board Office budget appear in the table below.

Combined total = $1,481,610
Beginning with the 2024 budget cycle, the Board Office has focused on aligning budgeted needs to
actual expenditures, subsequently and continuously identifying numerous areas to curtail budgeted
expenses. Overall, the budget increased slightly from FY 2023 to FY 2025 owing primarily to an increase
in salaries and benefits for Board Office staff (commiserate with similar agency-wide increases) and
one-time budgeted expenses for one-time procurement needs. Setting aside, one-time procurement
related expenses, the FY 2025 Board Office budget would have been nominally on par with the FY 2023
budget. The table below shows the Board Office’s budgeted and actual expenditures for FY 2023
through FY 2025, with FY 2025 actual expenditures listed as full-year estimate based on actual spending
through August of 2025.

$1,481,610

$1,148,067 $1,275,000*

*Projected

Actual expenditures have increased from FY 2023 through FY 2025 primarily due to the return to inperson meetings in the late spring of 2023, the filling of the Executive Manager position in mid-June of
2023, the return of more regular Director travel following the end of the pandemic in mid-2023, and the
introduction of CART services to the Board’s meetings beginning in late 2023.
DISCUSSION
Moving forward to 2026, the Board Office is anticipating several cost increases, including a slight
increase in costs for providing regular CART services ($5,000) and the addition of a monthly phone and
internet stipend ($3,360 total for year at up to $140 month) for the external members of the Board’s
Independent Audit Committee.
The Board Office, in response to feedback from Directors and the Board’s goals set at the Board’s
retreat on February 1, 2025, put forward a proposal to add two full-time equivalent staff members
focused on constituent engagement and policy development. The Board Office has been informed that
there is no capacity in the 2026 agency budget for these new positions. The Board Office will continue
to advocate for these positions in future budget cycles.
The Board Office has been asked to identify additional sources of potential budget reductions for FY
2026. The Board Office has identified three potential areas for the reduction of budgeted expenses
including:
1. Identifying a new Board paperless packet software provider
2. Hosting retreats onsite at the RTD administrative facility and utilizing internal retreat facilitators
3. Having the Board pass a resolution to limit Director travel, conference, and local expenses for

Packet Pg. 15

1.4.3

the FY 2026 cycle*
*In 2021, the Board approved Resolution No. 9 Series of 2021- Reduction of Directors Expense Budget
Lines to Offset Revenue Shortfalls Due to COVID-19 Impacts, which eliminated travel expenses,
conference registration fee budgets, and reduced local expense allocation by $1,000. The Board may
wish to consider whether a similar action is warranted for the FY 2026 budget cycle.
The Committee is asked to review the information provided in the report above and the attached
presentation, and provide general input, feedback, as well as raise relevant questions and concerns.
The Board Office budget will be included in the agency budget, which is set to be reviewed by the
Finance and Planning Committee in October and voted on by the Finance and Planning Committee in
November. The agency budget is set to be voted on at the Board’s regular monthly meeting for the
November meeting cycle, which has been scheduled for Tuesday, December 2nd to accommodate the
Thanksgiving holiday.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact that arises from the Executive Committee’s review of the Board Office
budget. The FY 2026 Board Office budget is dependent on the Board’s approval of management’s
recommended budget for the agency and any one-time action the Board may take relative to the annual
travel, conference registration fees, and local expense allocations provided to each Director.

• Opportunity for significant annual cost savings (ongoing reduction)

§ Director Travel, Conference Registration, and Local Expense allocation limitation
• In 2021, Directors acted via Resolution No. 9 Series of 2021 (Reduction of Directors’ Expense Budget
Lines to Offset Revenue Shortfalls Due to COVID-19 Impacts), to eliminate all travel and conference
registration expenses and decrease local expense allocation by $1,000 (25%)

• For example: Board could cut travel expenses to $3,000 (50% reduction), limit conference registration
fees to $1,000 (enough for one conference as opposed to two), and limit local expenses to no more
than $3,000 (25% reduction) for a budget reduction of $72,000 (one-time)

§ Limit expenditures on retreat(s) by hosting on site and foregoing external facilitation
• Potential to reduce budget ~ $26,000 on January/February retreat (one-time or ongoing reduction)

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Access-on-Demand Program Modifications As Amended

September 10, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
September 30, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve modifications to the supplemental, premium Access-on-Demand
(AoD) service for RTD’s paratransit customers as amended and described herein effective January 1,
2026**.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Erin Vallejos, Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
On February 27, 2024, the General Manager and CEO, commissioned a peer review of RTD’s paratransit
service delivery, to be conducted by subject-matter experts selected by the American Public
Transportation Association (APTA). APTA convened the peer review panel, which included a
geographical representation of panelists from across the country. During the months-long review, the
panelists leveraged their expertise and professional experience to assess both RTD’s Access-a-Ride
(AaR) service, the agency’s complementary American with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit service,
and RTD’s AoD premium supplemental paratransit service.
The overarching goal of the peer review was to help the agency better understand strengths and
opportunities, with respect to both ADA complementary paratransit and premium supplemental ondemand service, and to note potential improvements that support long-term sustainability. The panel
conducted a review of RTD’s paratransit operations to identify (1) best practices employed by similar
transit agencies, including demand-response programs; (2) model program parameters, including
responsible cost controls and sound customer-facing processes; and (3) software, hardware, or other
tools to ensure optimal service performance and program cost-effectiveness.
The on-site portion of the review was conducted between May 20 and 24, 2024. In advance of the onsite visit, RTD provided the panelists with documentation for their edification. While on-site at RTD
facilities, the panelists assessed RTD’s paratransit operations through further documentation review,
field observations, and a series of briefings and interviews with agency staff, contractors, paratransit
customers, and community stakeholders. The final report formalized the panelists’ observations and
recommendations.

2.9.1

Staff provided the Board with a summary of program modifications that were developed as a result of
recommendations from the APTA peer review in November 2024, and after extensive public feedback,
data analysis, industry research, and a survey of other transit agencies, as well as input provided from
the Board, several iterations of recommendations have been explored.
DISCUSSION
Based on Board guidance, public outreach, and community feedback, staff recommended the following
modifications to the AoD program during the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee meeting held
on July 16, 2025:
•
•
•
•
•

$6.50 upfront base fare/$3.25 for LiVE eligible customers
$20/trip subsidy
60 trips/month cap
Service area that mirrors AaR*
Service hours that mirror AaR

*During the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee meeting on July 16, 2025, the committee
amended the proposed modification to the AoD Service Area as follows:
The AoD service area shall also include all origins and destinations that lie within three-quarters
(¾) of a mile of any RTD fixed-route bus service, including commuter and regional bus routes.
During the monthly Board meeting held on July 29, 2025, the Board made amendments to the
proposed AoD program modifications and then committed the program modifications as amended
back to the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee. This was done to allow staff time to analyze
the proposed modifications and provide the Board additional estimated cost projections for the AoD
program. As of July 29, 2025, the proposed program modifications as amended are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Standard fare: $2.50 upfront base fare/$1.25 for LiVE eligible customers
Trip cap: 60/month
Trip subsidy: $20/trip
Service area: All locations within current RTD service area
Service window: Current AaR service hours
Waiting Period: No waiting period to begin using AoD once appropriately certified as paratransit
eligible
Multi-stop trips: Explicitly allow multi-stop trips and leave it up to individual transportation
network company (TNC) to decide whether to provide this functionality

At the September 10, 2025 Operations, Safety, and Security Committee, the following amendments
were made to the program modifications:
•
•

Base Fare: $6.50
LiVE Fare: $3.25

Packet Pg. 36

2.9.1
•

•

Multi-stop Trips: Customers may schedule multi-stop trips with a maximum of two destinations
per origin (e.g., from home to daycare location to work location), utilizing providers that allow
multi-stop functionality, with the initial destination not counting toward the monthly trip cap or
requiring an associated base fare
Effective date of modifications: January 1, 2026**

As of September 10, 2025, the proposed program modifications as amended are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

Standard fare: $6.50 upfront base fare/$3.25 for LiVE eligible customers
Trip cap: 60/month
Trip subsidy: $20/trip
Service area: All locations within current RTD service area
Service window: Current AaR service hours
Waiting Period: No waiting period to begin using AoD once appropriately certified as paratransit
eligible
Multi-stop trips: Customers may schedule multi-stop trips with a maximum of two destinations
per origin (e.g., from home to daycare location to work location), utilizing providers that allow
multi-stop functionality, with the initial destination not counting toward the monthly trip cap or
requiring an associated base fare
Effective date of modifications: January 1, 2026**

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of the current proposed modifications is estimated to be $30,031,797 annually (see
attachment C). Staff analyzed additional proposed modifications and the cost estimates for those are
outlined in the accompanying memorandum designated as Attachment A.

Re:

Access-on-Demand: Cost Updates – CORRECTED

This memorandum serves to update the Board of Directors (Board) regarding staff’s cost projections for
various Access-on-Demand (AoD) program scenarios. These scenarios were brought forth during the
monthly Board meeting held on Tuesday, July 29, 2025. Additionally, this memorandum provides
important FY 2026 budget information that will aid the Board in determining the optimal path forward
for the program.
As illustrated herein, the AoD program has grown considerably since its inception less than five years
ago, more so than could have been anticipated. Along with that precipitous growth has come precipitous
program cost increases. In order to ensure the program remains sustainable in the long term, cost
controls must be established.
I recognize the real-world implications of the decisions the Board will need to make regarding this
program. I myself do not take lightly the responsibility of ensuring equitable transit access for people
with disabilities. I and members of my leadership team are empathetic to the diverse needs of RTD’s
customers and take great pride in providing transit services to the greater Denver region. RTD’s
functional mission as memorialized in the RTD Act is “to develop, maintain, and operate a mass
transportation system for the benefit of the inhabitants of the district.” To meet the region’s transit
needs, the agency must make sound business decisions to ensure its long-term sustainability while
simultaneously delivering excellence and value to customers and community.
History
AoD was launched as a limited pilot program available within four ZIP codes in November 2020 as part
of an expanded supplemental, premium service available to registered, eligible Access-a-Ride (AaR)
customers. The program’s goal was to provide a responsive, on-demand platform for paratransit
customers, which was similar to the agency’s Access-a-Cab program as it existed at that time. While
AaR remains an accessible paratransit option for individuals who cannot use AoD for a variety of reasons
(e.g., certain individuals require door-to-door service while others are unbanked or unable to use apps
to book ride share trips, etc.), AoD provides a viable, convenient transit option for a significant number
of individuals with disabilities who have come to rely on RTD as their mobility provider of choice.

2.9.1.a

Following a successful pilot, the Access-a-Cab and AoD programs were merged, and the Board approved
an initial not-to-exceed (NTE) amount of $9.3 million for three years commencing January 2023. Since
that time, the Board has approved increases to the total program not-to-exceed (NTE) amount, which
now stands at $37.8 million through December 31, 2025, a four-fold increase from the original projection
due largely to the popularity of the AoD program.

2026 AoD Scenarios
In an effort to maintain consistency, assumptions regarding project costs and parameters have been
presented in a similar manner since the start of discussions in November 2024; however, this has created
the possible misconception that the cost controls under consideration would yield either cost savings or
increased revenue for the agency in 2025, when in fact the program costs will eclipse the amount
budgeted. To better illustrate the impacts of each scenario, this memorandum highlights projected costs
for each of the scenarios as contemplated in the 2026 Budget. Projections have been developed based
on a variety of historical data and assumptions relative to customer behavior based on the associated
fare. Following are further details for each scenario.
Information previously presented to the Board has illustrated the actual trip subsidy paid by RTD to the
four service providers and has not, prior to the dissemination of this memorandum, included the
Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle (WAV) costs that should also be considered as part of the overall program
costs. These costs have been included in the scenarios as described.

WAV Cost

(Note: For comparison, factoring in WAV costs, staff anticipates a total annual AoD program cost of

$24,826,448 in 2025. This total assumes a sustained average monthly increase of 3.8% in customer
demand, with the average customer taking 22 trips per month within existing program parameters.)
2026 Budget
While the 2026 Budget is still being developed, staff anticipates that significant reductions in budgeted
operating expenses will be required to ensure fiscal sustainability and prudent stewardship of taxpayer
dollars, given RTD’s change in net position from +$19M in 2023 to -$282M in 2024.
Should sufficient operating expense savings not be realized in the 2026 Budget, fixed-route service
modifications would be necessary beginning in 2026. For purposes of the 2026 Budget, each 1%
reduction in annualized fixed-route bus service delivery would yield a budgetary offset of approximately
$4 million in operating costs.
Simply put, an increase in program costs of approximately $13.1 million, i.e., the difference in program
costs between staff’s recommended scenario presented in July 2025 and Scenario 6 as described, would
necessitate an equivalent reduction of approximately 3.3% in fixed-route bus service. For comparison,
the relative costs to operate the following highly utilized bus routes in 2024, the costs for which are
comparable to the cost variance among the above scenarios:

For further context, the anticipated AaR budget for the provision of services in 2026 is $53,419,030.
This cost is in addition to any AoD costs outlined above.
Impacts to AaR
As discussed during the monthly Board meeting held on Tuesday, July 29, 2025, WAV vehicles used for
AoD service are provided by RTD through the agency’s existing AaR service contracts. As demand for
AoD, and subsequently WAV service, increases, the service capacity of RTD’s federally mandated
complimentary paratransit service decreases correspondingly. Additionally, the demand for WAV trips
provided through both AaR and AoD services continues to increase; for AoD specifically, demand has
risen from a daily average of 79 trips in January 2025 to 116 in July 2025, a 47% increase. During this
same period in 2025, monthly AaR on-time performance has decreased, from over 90% in January-April
2025, down to 86% by the end of July 2025. Staff attributes this performance decline at least partially
to the impact of AoD WAV trip demands on AaR service.
I along with staff look forward to continued discussion regarding this matter during the Operations,
Safety, and Security Meeting scheduled for Wednesday, September 10, 2025, and, if approved, the
monthly Board meeting scheduled for Tuesday, September 30, 2025.
Thank you.

2.9.1.b

The committee amended the proposed program modifications to the AoD service area to include all origins and
destinations that lie within 0.75 miles of any RTD fixed-route bus service, including commuter and regional bus
routes.
During the monthly Board meeting held on Tuesday, July 29, 2025, the Board further amended the proposed AoD
program modifications and later referred the program modifications agenda item, as amended, to the Operations,
Safety, and Security Committee to be considered in September 2025. This was done to allow staff time to analyze
the revised modifications and provide to the Board estimated cost projections for the AoD program given the
amended modifications.
Given the increased program costs associated with all other scenarios contemplated by the Board, staff’s
recommendation is for the Board to adopt the program parameters highlighted above, not to include the change
to the service area boundaries adopted by the committee on July 16, 2025. If approved, these program
modifications would go into effect January 1, 2026, to allow staff sufficient time to coordinate with third-party
AoD service providers prior to implementation, as well as leverage a communications campaign to educate and
inform customers of the forthcoming modifications.
Thank you.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Access-on-Demand Contract Extensions

September 10, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
September 30, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into sixmonth contract extension amendments with existing providers for the Access-on-Demand (AoD)
program effective January 1, 2026, through June 30, 2026, raising the not-to-exceed (NTE) amount from
$37.8 million to $47.2 million.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Erin Vallejos, Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In January 2023, RTD’s AoD program, a premium, supplemental paratransit service available via four
contracted private providers, was expanded to all eligible Access-a-Ride (AaR) customers. These
contracts were for a three-year contract term that is set to expire December 31, 2025. When these
contracts were approved by the Board of Directors in November 2022, the original NTE for the full
three-year period was $9.3 million.
To ensure customers continue to have equitable and sustainable access to the agency’s services, RTD
commissioned a peer review of the agency’s paratransit service delivery in February 2024. The on-site
review was conducted by industry subject-matter experts (SMEs) in May 2024. These SMEs engaged in
a holistic review of the paratransit program, including both the AoD program and the AaR program. As
part of the review, changes to the AoD program were suggested.
Staff has developed a draft solicitation for new AoD contracts to replace the existing contracts set to
expire, but finalization of the terms of that solicitation is dependent upon Board approval of AoD
program modifications being recommended by staff concurrently with this action. Staff will incorporate
the Board approved modifications into the solicitation and intends to advertise no later than November
7, 2025. This will allow sufficient time for proposers to develop proposals, for the Board of Directors to
consider recommended actions to effectuate the contract extensions, and for the execution of contracts
prior to the term date of the extensions. Program modifications approved by the Board will be
incorporated into these amendments if this recommended action is adopted.
DISCUSSION

2.9.2

In adopting this recommended action, RTD seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Priority of
Customer Excellence. This recommendation allows registered, eligible customers to continue using
AoD while new contracts are solicited.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the provision of AoD services effective January 1 through June 30, 2026, will be included in
the 2026 Proposed Budget as presented to the Board of Directors for approval.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
District Shops Hoists Replacement Contract Award

September 9, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
September 30, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with Rhinotrax Construction for the renovation of nine in-ground hydraulic bus hoists at the
RTD District Shops Division building. This includes replacement of eight hoists and the removal of one
hoist at the District Shops Bus Maintenance Facility. The base bid award amount of the contract is
$4,003,792.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Acting Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
As part of the agency’s standard asset management renewal process, staff identified 11 original bus
hoists for replacement, repair and removal as part of RTD’s asset management protocols. The existing
hoists were installed during the original building construction in 1989 and have been repaired and had
parts replaced for over 35 years. Repair costs and efforts become increasingly challenging as the hoists
age. RTD will replace eight of the 11 hoists and remove one. The remaining two hoists will be
addressed in the future.
The new lifts are to be scissor and platform lifts.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Priorities
of Community Value, Employee Ownership and Financial Success.
On April 18, 2025, RTD issued Request for Proposal (RFP) 125FJ003 via RTD’s online solicitation
platform, OpenGov, for a contractor to complete the Hoist Replacement project at District Shops based
on RTD’s prepared plans and specifications. This project included a 15% Disadvantaged Business
Enterprise goal. Proposals were due on June 4, 2025. RTD’s evaluation committee met to review,
evaluate and score responsive proposals based upon the published evaluative criteria for this RFP. As a
result, the evaluation committee voted to recommend Rhinotrax Construction for award as providing
the best value to RTD.

Packet Pg. 68

2.18.B

Should the Board approve this recommendation, the contractor will phase installation of the lifts to
accommodate maintenance operations. The project is expected to be completed within 13 months
following contract award.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Up to 80% of the cost of this project will be paid through a federal grant. The remaining cost will be
funded from existing capital improvement dollars allocated in the 2025 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Tap-to-pay and Cash Digitization Retail Network Title VI
Fare Equity Analysis

September 9, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
September 30, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board to adopt the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis report for the introduction of tap-to-pay fare
payments to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Director of the Civil Rights Division
Martin Romero, Transit Equity Manager, Civil Rights Division
Jake Bruemmer, Electronic Fare Collection Manager, Finance Department
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD
to evaluate fare changes, prior to implementation, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The FTA defines a fare
change as an increase in the price of fare media, decrease in the price of fare media, creation of new
fare media, or the discontinuance of current fare media.
On May 28, 2025, the Board adopted the 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update, which included updates to
this definition. RTD defines a fare change as any increase or decrease in the price of fare media; the
introduction or discontinuation of fare media (e.g., cash, paper passes, mobile tickets); and changes to
fare products (e.g., Day Pass, Monthly Pass), fare levels (e.g., Standard, Airport), or customer categories
(e.g., full-fare, seniors, individuals with disabilities, Medicare recipients, LiVE participants and youth
under 20). Additionally, fare changes encompass modifications to Ticket Vending Machine (TVM)
access, including changes in the number of machines, fees, or payment options. The introduction of
contactless tap-to-pay fare payments allowing credit cards, debit cards, prepaid debit cards and mobile
wallets to be accepted as valid fare payment media on RTD bus and rail validators meets this definition.
Thus, an analysis is required to be brought before the Board for approval. The complete Title VI Fare
Equity Analysis report is included in Attachment A.
Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Policies

Packet Pg. 70

2.18.C

Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a
Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. The Board-adopted policies
and their applicable thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
Disparate Impact Policy: A fare change should not adversely affect Black, Indigenous and People
of Color (BIPOC) populations 5% more than the overall population’s ridership; this level of
impact is considered a disparate impact. “BIPOC” is defined as all persons who identify as being
part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A fare change should not adversely affect low-income
populations 5% more than the overall population’s ridership; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
200% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
The purpose of this analysis is to assess whether the proposed fare change would result in disparate
impacts on BIPOC populations or disproportionate burdens on low-income populations. When a
proposed fare change results in a disparate impact, RTD must consider alternatives to avoid, minimize,
or mitigate the impact, demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the change and ensure that
no less-discriminatory alternatives exist that would achieve the same program goals. In cases where a
fare change results in a disproportionate burden on low-income populations, RTD will consider
practicable modifications to mitigate the impact as necessary.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends the introduction of contactless tap-to-pay fare payments allowing credit cards, debit
cards, prepaid debit cards and mobile wallets (including Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay) to
be accepted as valid fare payment media on existing RTD bus and rail validators. This is often referred
to as acceptance of “Open Payments” in the transit industry. The recommendation includes the
addition of new fare payment methods but proposes no elimination of existing fare media and no other
changes to fare policies. Tap-to-pay fare payments will be available to customers using RTD’s fixedroute services.
Currently, RTD offers a significant fare policy benefit in the form of daily and monthly fare capping to
customers, but only to those customers paying with their MyRide account, either via mobile phone or
smartcard. Customers paying with cash or using paper fare products do not benefit from fare capping.
With the acceptance of tap-to-pay fare payments, fare capping benefits will be extended to customers
paying with contactless credit cards, debit cards, prepaid debit cards and mobile wallets. This
recommended fare change aims to provide RTD customers with additional electronic fare payment
options that enable them to receive benefits from fare capping.
Methodology
For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, on certain transit
modes, or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD must analyze any available information generated

Packet Pg. 71

2.18.C

from customer surveys and other relevant data sources. Customer survey analysis indicates whether
BIPOC and/or low-income customers are disproportionately more likely to use the mode of service,
payment type, or payment media subject to the fare change.
The assessment included data from its 2024 systemwide onboard survey (2024 Onboard Survey), which
included 18,285 weekday responses (66% bus, 33% rail), weighted to reflect 170,000 average weekday
trips. Systemwide, BIPOC customers made up 55% of boardings and low-income customers 63%. As
part of the 2024 Onboard Survey, respondents were asked, “Do you have a credit or debit card,
including prepaid debit?” This question formed the basis for much of the fare equity analysis (i.e.,
assessing the accessibility of fare media across different respondent populations) and the
determination of adverse effects.
Additionally, RTD utilized the results of the demographic analysis of the MyRide “cash digitization”
retail network to discern fare media implications for survey respondents that do not currently have a
credit, debit, or prepaid debit card. Specifically, this analysis seeks to understand how this subset of
customers may participate in tap-to-pay payments and take advantage of fare policy benefits such as
fare capping. The Geographic Information System (GIS)-based analysis used demographic data from
the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates for years 2018 to 2022 at the
census block group geographic level.
Summary of Findings
According to the 2024 Onboard Survey, approximately 90% of respondents across all customer
populations indicated that they have a credit or debit card, including a prepaid debit card, or were
observed using a credit or debit card. Across different respondent populations, the percentage having a
credit or debit card or were observed using a credit or debit card is consistent; 90% of all respondents,
89% of BIPOC respondents and 89% of low-Income respondents indicated that they have a credit, debit,
or prepaid debit card. This finding in isolation suggests that a substantial majority of customers, across
customer type, have access to the types of cards that would enable participation in tap-to-pay fare
payment media.
However, approximately 6% to 8% of respondents do not currently have a credit, debit, or prepaid debit
card, depending on the type of respondent. The percentage that do not have a credit or debit card but
do require fare payment media is relatively consistent; 5.6% of all respondents, 6.5% of BIPOC
respondents and 7.8% of low-income respondents. Among this subset of respondents, the most
popular product and fare media choices are 3-Hour Passes and Day Passes purchased with cash
onboard the bus, indicating ongoing reliance on cash.
A supplemental demographic analysis of the MyRide “cash digitization” retail network (i.e., adding 460
to 500 retail locations) found that the new retail locations will serve a population that is around 43%
BIPOC and 27% low-income, indicating greater proximity to these populations. Many of these retailers
sell prepaid debit cards. Therefore, if these locations are considered to be a representative sample of
retail locations that sell contactless, prepaid debit cards throughout the Denver metro area, then the

Packet Pg. 72

2.18.C

ability of BIPOC and low-income populations to access or participate in tap-to-pay fare payments is
favorable.
Of the remaining respondents without a credit, debit, or prepaid debit card, a sizeable share (3% to 5%
of overall respondents) are exempt from paying an RTD fare (e.g., Zero Fare for Youth program
participants) where fare media is not required, or were participants in an RTD Pass Program where
customers use their own smartphone or use a MyRide card provided to them.
Conclusions:
Based on the responses from the 2024 Onboard Survey and the access results from the MyRide “cash
digitization” retail network demographic analysis, this Title VI Fare Equity Analysis strongly suggests
that there would be no Disparate Impact on BIPOC populations and no Disproportionate Burden on lowincome populations. Taken together, the recommended fare change will advance RTD’s goals under its
2021–2026 Strategic Plan, particularly the priorities of delivering Community Value and Customer
Excellence, while ensuring continued compliance with Title VI federal regulations.
Staff concludes that the recommended fare change does not result in an inequitable distribution of
benefits or burdens. The acceptance of contactless tap-to-pay fare payments should provide greater
convenience and fare media options to all customer populations, including BIPOC and low-income
customer populations. Moreover, the expanded cash digitization network locations are suggested to
improve access for the subset of customers that may not have a credit, debit, or prepaid debit card. As
such, the recommended fare change should proceed as proposed.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

1 Introduction
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VI”) ensures that “no person in the United States shall, on the basis
of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” The Regional Transportation
District (“RTD” or “The District”) has committed to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Title VI objectives set
forth in Circular 4702.1B, ensuring that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are
equitably distributed without regard to race, color or national origin.
This analysis of the acceptance of contactless credit cards, debit cards, prepaid debit cards and mobile wallets
(“Open Payments”) was prepared in conformity with the guidelines laid out in Chapter IV and Appendix K of FTA
Circular 4702.1B, Service and Fare Equity Analysis Questionnaire Checklist.
The Fare Equity Analysis described herein assesses whether the proposed change in fare payment media
acceptance is expected to result in Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) and low-income customers
bearing a greater share of negative impacts compared to customers overall, or whether BIPOC and low-income
customers would experience a lesser share of the positive impacts compared to customers overall.
Based on an analysis of the 2024 Onboard Survey and the access results from the MyRide “cash digitization” retail
network demographic analysis, this Title VI Fare Equity Analysis strongly suggests that there would be no Disparate
Impact on BIPOC populations, and no Disproportionate Burden on low-income populations. The acceptance of
contactless, Open Payments should provide greater convenience and fare media options to all RTD customer
populations, including BIPOC and low-income customer populations.

2 Overview of Proposed Fare Changes
RTD has proposed the acceptance of contactless credit cards, debit cards, prepaid debit cards and mobile wallets
(including Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay) as valid fare payment media. This is often referred to as
acceptance of “Open Payments” in the transit industry. The proposal includes the addition of new fare payment
methods, but proposes no elimination of existing fare media and no other changes to fare policies. Open Payments
will be available to customers using RTD’s Fixed Route services. The proposed change is summarized in greater
detail in the following sections.
Currently, RTD offers a significant fare policy benefit in the form of daily and monthly fare capping to customers,
but only to those customers paying with their MyRide account, either via mobile phone or smartcard. Customers
paying with Cash or using Paper fare products do not benefit from fare capping. With the acceptance of Open
Payments, fare capping benefits will be extended to customers paying with contactless credit cards, debit cards,
prepaid debit cards and mobile wallets. This fare change aims to provide RTD customers with additional electronic
fare payment options that enable them to receive benefits from fare capping.

2.1 Changes to Pricing, Fare Products, Customer Category Discounts
RTD’s fare structure, including fare pricing, fare products and customer category discounts, will remain unchanged
during and after the launch of Open Payments. Fare prices for Local and Airport services will remain unchanged,
and transfer policies will remain unchanged. Customers using contactless credit, debit and prepaid debit cards
and mobile wallets will continue to receive daily and monthly fare capping benefits when using the same fare
media and will pay the same amount per trip, per day and per month as customers making identical trips while
using other fare media including paper passes, MyRide Stored Value and mobile tickets. Customers using
contactless credit, debit, prepaid debit and mobile wallets will have the opportunity to register their card to their
RTD MyRide account (or register after opening a free RTD MyRide account) and receive fare discounts (Senior,
Persons with a Disability, Medicare and LiVE income-based discounts) that they are eligible for, using their
contactless fare media. Customers eligible for Zero Fare programs, including Youth, will continue to ride RTD at
no cost. There will be no additional fees charged by RTD to pay with contactless credit, debit, prepaid debit and
mobile wallets, and MyRide cards will remain free for RTD customers. As there are no changes in fare pricing, fare
products, customer category discounts or card fees, there are no anticipated changes in the systemwide average
fare or product-specific average fares, in aggregate or across customer populations.

2.2 Changes to Fare Media & Fare Distribution
The introduction of contactless, Open Payments is an incremental form of fare media which RTD customers are
free to adopt. No existing forms of fare media are being eliminated or altered. The addition of contactless credit,
debit and prepaid debit cards and mobile wallets should increase customer opportunities to acquire fare media.
The introduction of contactless credit, debit and prepaid debit cards and mobile wallets supplements existing fare
media choices for RTD customers. Cash will continue to be accepted on-board buses, at TVMs, at ticket book and
pass vending machines at select stations, and at RTD’s four Sales Outlets. Paper fare products will still be available
from RTD Sales Outlets, at Safeway and King Soopers retailers, from ticket book and pass vending machines at
select stations, and through online purchase. MyRide fare payment via mobile phone or smartcard will continue
to be accepted. MyRide smartcards will continue to be free to RTD customers. Mobile tickets will still be available

in the MyRide, Transit, and Uber apps. While some unbanked and underbanked RTD customers are unlikely to
have ready access to contactless credit and debit cards issued through banking establishments, contactless
prepaid debit cards are widely available at retail outlets throughout the service area without the need for a formal
banking arrangement or credit history check. Although the exact number of locations within the RTD service area
that vend prepaid debit cards is unknown, the forthcoming introduction of the MyRide “cash digitization” retail
network provides some sense of scale. The InComm-based VanillaDirect cash digitization network aims to add
approximately 460 to 500 retail locations including convenience stores, gas stations, pharmacies, grocery stores,
large retail outlets and dollar stores. These types of retailers are frequently sellers of prepaid debit cards, so it is
likely that there are approximately 460 retail outlets or more in the RTD service area and surrounding communities
that sell prepaid debit cards. The introduction of contactless, Open Payments increases fare media choice and RTD
customer convenience while retaining all other existing fare media options and distribution channels for RTD
customers.

3 Title VI Policies
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 601 states:
“No persons in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded
from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any
program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
It is RTD’s objective to avoid, minimize or mitigate disproportionately high and adverse impacts on BIPOC and lowincome populations. As a recipient of financial assistance from the FTA, RTD is required to comply with Title VI of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its own Title VI Program adopted in accordance with same by evaluating major
service and fare changes at the planning and programming stages to determine whether those changes have
discriminatory impacts, including Disparate Impacts on BIPOC populations and/or Disproportionate Burdens on
low-income populations.
According to the Federal Department of Transportation, equity in the provision of transit service is "providing
equal levels of service to minority and non-minority residents of the urbanized area. Levels of service, in turn, are
defined in terms of capital allocation and accessibility." 1 The metrics of discrimination that could be monitored
for disparate treatment include fare structures that could consistently cause minority-group customers to bear a
higher fare burden than the overall riding public, access to specialized fare media, or methods of communication
to populations with Limited English Proficiency. However, a Title VI Equity Analysis should not replace good
program planning, which should be an ongoing process that considers equity among other factors when designing
fare changes, service changes, or discretionary policies and programs.
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a Disproportionate
Burden Policy for evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. As part of the 2025
Title VI Program Update, RTD maintained their 5% threshold for determining a Disparate Impact or
Disproportionate Burden of a fare modification as established in RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact or Disproportionate
Burden Policy. The RTD Board-adopted 2025 Title VI Program Update also clarifies what constitutes a Fare Change.
The detailed policies used by RTD for analysis of proposed fare changes are found in the following sections.

3.1 Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policies
The FTA requires that transit agencies assess whether a proposed fare change or major service change would have
a “Disparate Impact” on minority populations, or “Disproportionate Burden” on low-income populations, under
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title 49 C.F.R. Section 21.5(b)(2) and (b)(7), and Appendix C to Title 49 C.F.R.
part 21. Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B, FTA requires public transit agencies operating 50 or more fixed route
vehicles in peak service, and located in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people, to clearly establish, with input
through a public engagement process, threshold definitions for measuring Disparate Impacts and
Disproportionate Burdens.
RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies establish threshold standards for evaluating
the equity impacts and the distribution of adverse effects caused by any fare change or major service change.

These thresholds enable RTD to determine whether BIPOC and low-income customers would be
disproportionately impacted by the adverse effects of the proposed changes and, by inference, whether the
overall ridership would disproportionately benefit from the proposed changes when compared to the protected
populations (BIPOC and low-income). These thresholds are based on the cumulative impact of the proposed
service or fare change.
The policies and their applicable analyses and thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
●

Disparate Impact Analysis
A disparate impact analysis is a review of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by BIPOC persons
as a result of any fare price change, which shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed
by the overall population ridership. “BIPOC” is defined as all persons who identify as being part of
racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.

●

Disproportionate Burden
A disproportionate burden analysis is defined as an examination of the difference in the adverse effects
absorbed by low-income persons as a result of any fare price change, which shall not be greater than or
less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall population ridership. A low-income population is a group
of households who are at or below 200 percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty
Guidelines.

3.1.1 Fare Changes
RTD defines a Fare Change as an increase in the price of fare media, decrease in the price of fare media,
introduction of new fare media or the discontinuance of current fare media, changes in fare types or products,
changes in fare levels, changes in customer category definitions/eligibility, and modifications to Ticket Vending
Machine access. Fare Media are defined as forms of payment for transit service (i.e., cash fare, paper pass, etc.).
Based on federal guidance, prior to adopting a fare change, RTD must conduct a Fare Equity Analysis and analyze
specific elements of the proposed structure and changes to fare media along with the recommended pricing
schema, to determine whether the changes would result in impacts that exceed the threshold established by the
policies. As referenced in C4702.1B, some fare changes are excluded from being the subject of a Fare Equity
Analysis, such as instances where all passengers ride free such as “Zero Fare for Transit Equity Day”; fare changes
undertaken during an emergency such as a natural disaster, if the change is intended to address an immediate
need; minor fare changes that do not affect the fare structure (e.g., minor fare rounding); and
temporary/promotional fare reductions, so long as the temporary fare reduction or promotional reduction does
not last longer than six months.

3.1.2 Adverse Effects
For the fare equity analysis, adverse effects include an increase in cost or a reduction in accessibility of fare media.
Benefits include a decrease in cost, increase in discounts for certain fare types or customer populations, or
increase in accessibility of fare media.

4 RTD Customer Characteristics
Several data sources were considered when evaluating the demographics and access characteristics of RTD
customers, namely the 2024 Onboard Transit Customer Survey and the demographic analysis of the MyRide “cash
digitization” retail network.

4.1 2024 Onboard Transit Customer Survey
As part of this equity review, RTD is committed to understanding which customers may be impacted by the
proposed introduction of contactless, Open Payments. Demographic characteristics summarized in this section
reflect results from RTD’s recently completed 2024 Onboard Transit Customer survey (2024 Onboard Survey). The
2024 Onboard Survey was an on-board, customer intercept survey undertaken between August 2024 and
December 2024, and captured 20,062 survey responses across 99 bus routes and 10 rail lines. For analysis
purposes, respondents who indicated they were visitors to the Denver metro area were excluded from the survey
results. After processing the survey results, approximately 10,092 of a total of 18,285 completed surveys (55% of
weighted survey responses) identified as BIPOC, and 8,800 of a total of 14,359 completed surveys (63% of
weighted survey responses) identified as low-income using a definition of 200 percent of the federal poverty level.
As part of the 2024 Onboard Survey, respondents were asked “Do you have a credit or debit card, including
prepaid debit?” This question formed the basis for much of the analysis in this section; however, it’s important to
acknowledge some potential shortcomings of the use of this question. First, the question does not specifically ask
whether respondents have contactless credit/debit/prepaid debit cards, which is a requirement for use as Open
Payments media. It is likely that some respondents who confirmed having a credit/debit/prepaid debit card may
not have a contactless card that would function as payment media on RTD services. It is worth noting that
contactless (cEMV) card penetration has increased rapidly since the COVID-19 pandemic and it is expected that
by 2027, virtually all credit/debit/prepaid debit cards are likely to include contactless payment technology, based
on California Air Resources Board (CARB) research 2. Second, the phrasing of the question could be interpreted as
possession of a credit/debit/prepaid debit card, or access to credit/debit/prepaid debit cards. Care should be
taken in the interpretation of survey results, given that respondents may have interpreted the question in
different ways.
According to the 2024 Onboard Survey, approximately 90% of respondents across all customer populations
indicated that they have a credit or debit card, including a prepaid debit card, or were observed using a credit or
debit card (financial data from RTD indicates that 99.4% of all MyRide Stored Value transactions and mobile ticket
purchases by value were made with a credit or debit card, so respondents indicating that they paid with MyRide
were included in the percentage possessing a credit or debit card). Across different respondent populations, the
percentage having a credit or debit card or were observed using a credit or debit card is consistent; 90% of All
Respondents, 89% of BIPOC respondents, and 89% of Low-Income respondents indicated that they have a credit,
debit or prepaid debit card.

or use a MyRide card provided to them. The remaining 6% to 8% of respondents are those who do not currently
have a credit, debit or prepaid debit card, but do require fare payment media and may be interested in using Open
Payments. Across different respondent populations, the percentage that do not have a credit or debit card, but
do require fare payment media is relatively consistent; 5.6% of All Respondents, 6.5% of BIPOC respondents, and
7.8% of Low-Income respondents. Among this subset of respondents, the most popular product and fare media
choices are 3-Hour Passes and Day Passes purchased with Cash onboard the bus, indicating ongoing reliance on
cash.

Currently, customers who would prefer to pay with electronic fare media but do not have a credit or debit card
are limited to reloading their MyRide account or card using Cash at RTD’s four Sales Outlets. The forthcoming
introduction of the MyRide “cash digitization” network aims to add approximately 460 to 500 retail locations
where customers could use cash to reload their MyRide account/card, dramatically increasing electronic fare
media access and customer convenience. Many of these same retail locations are likely to sell prepaid debit cards,
providing even more electronic fare payment options to RTD customers, particularly those who remain cash
reliant.

4.2 Demographic Analysis of MyRide “cash digitization” Retail Network
RTD is planning for the introduction of the MyRide “cash digitization” retail network. The InComm-based
VanillaDirect cash digitization network allows customers to bring cash to a variety of retail establishments and
load value to their MyRide digital account or card by exchanging cash for electronic stored value. The planned
cash digitization network aims to add approximately 460 to 500 retail locations including convenience stores, gas
stations, pharmacies, grocery stores, large retail outlets and dollar stores.
The demographic analysis of the introduction of the cash digitization network indicated that the population within
RTD’s District comprises around 38% BIPOC residents, and that the new retail locations serve a population that is
around 43% BIPOC, indicating greater proximity to RTD’s BIPOC populations. Similarly, while the District’s lowincome population averages around 21%, the new locations serve a population that is around 27% low-income,
indicating that these locations are in greater proximity to RTD’s low-income populations.

5 Discussion of Equity Implications
The proposed fare change is not anticipated to result in any changes in average fare, but fare media access
implications are discussed further.

5.1 Average Fare Implications
The fare change proposal includes no changes in fare pricing, fare products, customer category discounts or card
fees. The impact is that there are no anticipated changes in the systemwide average fare or product-specific
average fares, in aggregate or across customer populations.

5.2 Fare Media Access Implications
As discussed in Section 4.1, the 2024 Onboard Survey suggests that nearly 90% of RTD customers have a credit,
debit or prepaid debit card. The share of customers indicating that they have credit/debit/prepaid debit cards is
consistent across BIPOC, low-income and all survey respondents. This finding in isolation suggests that a
substantial majority of RTD customers, across customer type, have access to the types of card that would enable
participation in Open Payments fare payment.
However, approximately 6% to 8% of respondents do not currently have a credit, debit or prepaid debit card,
depending on the type of respondent. The survey suggests that this group is cash reliant, relying heavily on cash
payment onboard RTD buses. For this subset of customers, it is not clear why they rely heavily on cash payment,
but this analysis seeks to understand how this group may participate in Open Payments fare payment and take
advantage of fare policy benefits such as fare capping.
Access to traditional credit and debit cards is often through a customer relationship with a bank or credit union.
While these groups continue to provide services that are increasingly customer friendly (e.g., elimination of service
fees, provision of overdraft protection), regulations often require that the customer have a Social Security Number
(SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) in order to open a bank account. For recent immigrants
to the country or undocumented residents, this requirement may pose a barrier to establishing a banking
relationship, and acquiring a credit card and debit card. Traditional credit cards often require additional steps,
such as a credit check, which may pose additional barriers. For this reason, the availability of prepaid debit cards
through retail establishments may be the more attractive option for this subset of customers.
Prepaid debit cards are generally widely available at retail locations, but there is no widely available source of
information that comprehensively lists every location within the Denver metro area that sells prepaid debit cards
for a GIS-based access analysis. However, the upcoming introduction of the MyRide “cash digitization” retail
network can be viewed as a sample or subset of retail establishments that are likely to sell prepaid debit cards. As
discussed in Section 4.2, the InComm-based VanillaDirect cash digitization network aims to add approximately
460 to 500 retail locations including convenience stores, gas stations, pharmacies, grocery stores, large retail
outlets and dollar stores, retail locations that also typically sell contactless, prepaid debit cards. If these locations
are considered to be a representative sample of retail locations that sell contactless, prepaid debit cards
throughout the Denver metro area, then the ability of BIPOC and low-income customer groups to access these
locations is favorable. The demographic analysis of the introduction of the cash digitization network indicated that
the population within RTD’s District comprises around 38% BIPOC residents, and that the new retail locations

serve a population that is around 43% BIPOC, indicating greater proximity to RTD’s BIPOC populations. Similarly,
while the District’s low-income population averages around 21%, the new locations serve a population that is
around 27% low-income, indicating that these locations are in greater proximity to RTD’s low-income populations.
Taken together, nearly 90% of RTD customers already have a credit, debit and/or prepaid debit card that enables
participation in Open Payments fare payment. The remaining 6% to 8% that do not have a credit, debit or prepaid
debit card are likely to have 460 or more locations where prepaid debit cards can be acquired, and these locations
tend to be located in parts of the RTD service area that have a higher proportion of BIPOC and low-income
residents.

6 Fare Proposal Outreach
RTD’s Communications and Engagement Department developed a comprehensive bilingual communications and
outreach strategy to ensure successful implementation of the two major initiatives. Each campaign will include a
dedicated plan, with integrated efforts from the Transit Equity Office to ensure underserved populations will be
engaged and informed. The launch of these campaigns will commence in November 2025.
Open Payments
The outreach strategy will implement a comprehensive and multifaceted communications strategy to ensure that
customers and the broader public are fully informed about the open payments option. This comprehensive
approach encompasses several key elements designed to maximize reach and effectiveness. The objectives will
emphasize education, accessibility, and equity. Customers will receive clear information on how Open Payments
work, the benefits of fare capping, and how to link cards to MyRide accounts for discounts and trip history. The
plan includes multi-channel education through RTD’s website (available in 10 languages), social media, videos,
infographics, validator signage, and email alerts. Targeted outreach will highlight benefits for reduced fare groups
such as LiVE participants, seniors, and individuals with disabilities. Customer feedback loops will be incorporated
through surveys and online forms to guide improvements.
The Transit Equity Office will supplement this effort with bilingual participation in multicultural in-person events,
and direct engagement with customers at community gatherings. RTD will also distribute bilingual news releases,
Read-n-Ride articles, and direct emails to LiVE and Transit Assistance Grant recipients. This will ensure BIPOC, lowincome, and reduced fare populations received timely and accessible information.
Retail Network Cash Digitization
In parallel, this outreach strategy will implement a comprehensive, multi-channel strategy to ensure customers
are fully informed about cash digitization. Customers will be educated on how to obtain a new MyRide card, load
cash at retail outlets, and manage balances through the MyRide app or online. Outreach for this initiative will
include multi-channel education through web and mobile platforms, instructional videos, infographics, FAQs, and
station signage. RTD will conduct targeted engagement with reduced fare groups and community organizations
serving low-income and unbanked customers.
The Transit Equity Office will support these tactics by coordinating bilingual outreach at community events,
distributing information through newsletters and direct communications to discount program participants, and
ensuring materials are accessible in both English and Spanish and additional languages as requested.
In summary, through these combined efforts, RTD will implement a consistent, equity-focused outreach strategy
across each communication and outreach campaigns. By providing multilingual materials, engaging directly with
underserved communities, and leveraging multiple communication channels, RTD will ensure that all customers
have clear, accessible, and timely information about the new fare media payment option and the expanded cash
digitization retail network.

7 Next Steps
Based on the responses from the 2024 Onboard Survey, there is strong evidence that a substantial majority of
RTD customers have a credit, debit or prepaid debit card and that the percentage having a credit/debit/prepaid
debit card is virtually identical across BIPOC, low-income and all respondents.
There are, however, approximately 6% to 8% of respondents who do not currently have a credit, debit or prepaid
debit card, depending on the type of respondent. For this subset of customers, the equity analysis considered
whether there is access to contactless fare media. The analysis assumed that the form of contactless fare media
that would be easiest to acquire would be prepaid debit cards, and considered the 460 – 500 planned MyRide
“cash digitization” retail network locations as a sample of retail locations where customers could a acquire a
prepaid debit card. The MyRide “cash digitization” retail network demographic analysis indicated that cash
digitization network locations are in greater proximity to RTD’s BIPOC and low-income populations, suggesting
improved access for those customer populations.
Based on an analysis of the 2024 Onboard Survey and the access results from the MyRide “cash digitization” retail
network demographic analysis, this Title VI Fare Equity Analysis strongly suggests that there would be no Disparate
Impact on BIPOC populations, and no Disproportionate Burden on low-income populations. RTD can proceed with
the proposed fare change without any further changes or mitigations. The acceptance of contactless, Open
Payments should provide greater convenience and fare media options to all RTD customer populations, including
BIPOC and low-income customer populations.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2026-2030 Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF)

September 10, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
September 30, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2026-2030 Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Kelly Mackey, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 2026-2030 Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF) is the financial forecast used as the basis for the
development of the 2026 Proposed Budget and provides guidance for future years’ financial planning.
The development of the FYFF seeks to balance planned expenditures with anticipated available funding
sources in alignment with RTD’s Strategic Plan. The FYFF is prepared on an annual basis or can be
produced more frequently if material changes in assumptions and inputs occur. The previous financial
forecast, the 2025-2029 FYFF, was approved by the Board in September 2024.
The 2026-2030 FYFF is prepared using currently available information to assist in planning. The FYFF is
a forecast or projection of financial results, is not an appropriation of funds, and is non-binding.
During the July 15, 2025, Finance and Planning Committee, staff presented a discussion item that
described the purpose of and assumptions used in the 2026-2030 FYFF.
DISCUSSION
The 2026-2030 FYFF has been prepared using currently available information and does not include
assumptions regarding future potential changes, such as new grant funding from SB24-184 Congestion
Impact Fees and SB24-230 Oil and Gas Production Fees. The FYFF only includes funding sources and
use projections that have reasonable certainty to occur in accordance with RTD’s Board-approved Fiscal
Policy.
Other requirements of the Fiscal Policy to consider for the FYFF include the following:
• A balanced budget in which beginning reserves plus total anticipated revenues is greater than or
equal to expenditures will be prepared

Packet Pg. 109

2.19.A

•

Debt financing will not be issued to support operating expenditures

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2026-2030 FYFF projects continued adherence to Fiscal Policy requirements and maintenance of
adequate reserves to continue to cash-fund expenditures while providing the necessary funding to
support currently known Transit Asset Management Plan needs.

BACKGROUND
Pursuant to § 32-9-119.5(2)(a), C.R.S., RTD operates a system under which up to 58% of the agency’s
non-rail vehicular service may be provided by qualified private businesses, nonprofit organizations, or
local governments pursuant to competitively negotiated contracts. The agency currently contracts
approximately 45% of its fixed-route service, 100% of complementary paratransit service (Access-aRide), and 100% of FlexRide service, for a total amount of contracted transit service of approximately
56%.
DISCUSSION
The last option year of the current contract for the provision of fixed-route bus service to the Longmont
and Boulder area expires January 9, 2026. A Request for Proposals (RFP) to replace this service package
was published using the online solicitations platform on May 7, 2025, with proposals due June 17,
2025, to allow adequate time for a comprehensive procurement process.
A panel of staff subject matter experts assessed responsive proposals using pre-determined objective
evaluative criteria. Based on the overall evaluation, the panel recommends awarding the contract to
Transdev Services, Inc., as the best value for RTD in support of the agency’s Strategic Priorities of
Community Value and Financial Success.
The service package consists of 61 buses providing approximately 165,000 revenue hours in the first
year. The routes provide service to the cities of Boulder, Erie, Lafayette, Longmont, Louisville, and

Superior, and the City and County of Broomfield. The term for the contract will be for three years, with
two one-year options, for a total of five years.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding will be included in the 2026 Budget for the provision of Longmont and Boulder fixed-route
services effective January 10, 2026. Funding for future contract years is contemplated in the agency’s
financial forecast and will be presented for the Board’s consideration annually, as identified within each
year’s respective budget.
