2019-12-05 Special EC
DOUG TISDALE: Are we live?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
DOUG TISDALE: All right. For the sake of the record, we will now convene the Special
Executive Committee Meeting of Thursday, December 5, 2019. It is 3:30 PM, Mountain
Standard Time.
And we are convened in the Board Office in the Chair's office due to the reservation of the Board
conference room. Therefore, we only have an audio tape of this meeting rather than a video and
audio recording of the meeting. And for the sake of the record, the people in the room are the
five members of the Executive Committee, together with the Executive Manager of the Board
Office. You have before you a couple of items. We had to call-PEGGY CATLIN: Excuse me, Chair. Are there any other Board members who may have wanted
to call in?
DOUG TISDALE: Did anyone expressed an interest or desire in calling in? Did anyone
communicate with you? Did anyone communicate with you?
BARBARA MCMANUS: We only sent this to the Executive Committee.
DOUG TISDALE: Oh, OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Because those were the five that you talked to.
PEGGY CATLIN: I just gave people a heads-up that you did convene a special meeting of the
Executive Committee, just so that I notified each individual Board member not on the
committee. And so I didn't know if any of them had expressed a desire.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We didn't hear from anyone.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I talked to several Board members as well, to let them know that
we were having this meeting today.
SHELLEY COOK: Just to interject, at that point, if we could set the series of meetings coming
up, then people could know.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And that people can call in or come for the comment part of it,
too.
DOUG TISDALE: In fact, the Treasurer brings up one of the topics we will be discussing. It's
the series of meetings to come. In order to do that, we had to meet today. And when we
discussed this with Executive Manager and with First Vice Chair, we agreed sooner was better

than later for the simple reason that we have a very, very tight time frame. It's a very timesensitive matter. And we need to address it.
So without giving a whole lot of introduction to that because we want to keep this within a
reasonable time period. As was stated in the call for the meeting, the motion that was adopted by
the Board delegated the process to the Executive Committee. So now it's up to the Executive
Committee to flesh out the process.
The Executive Manager, with some input from the Secretary, has drafted this document that is
called Interim General Manager Executive Search Committee Meeting/Event Work Plan and
Schedule 2019 that addresses this Executive Committee Meeting of December 5 and lists a
bunch of things for us to discuss. I know you've just seen this. But let me just ask first, does
anybody have any other thing they want to bring up other than-- and we called this for one
reason. That's to set up this process. Does anybody have anything else that they want to say first?
SHELLEY COOK: You know, I kind of went from Jeff's good list in preparing for the meeting.
And I'd like to work from it right now if we could because that's what we've gone to.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, there's additional elements that need to be taken care of and
decided on. And all of Jeff's are incorporated in mine.
SHELLEY COOK: So I haven't seen the interim job description.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Is there one?
DOUG TISDALE: Yes, you were given one on Tuesday night.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah. We didn't know if that was specifically-PEGGY CATLIN: That was Dave's.
DOUG TISDALE: Let me just-SHELLEY COOK: But it's not an interim job description.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That was a regular job description.
DOUG TISDALE: I was about to finish my sentence. That's what we used last time for the
interim. They took what was the job description at the time. And it's morphed since then. There
were changes in between 2010 and 2015. But they took what was in place as of 2015 as the
General Manager Description and used that as the Interim.
Then in April of 2016 when it was finalized, that's what it was. Do we have other copies of that,
too?

BARBARA MCMANUS: There were two changes. The current one was used for the Interim.
There were changes made to the job description prior to going out for the-DOUG TISDALE: You do have it.
BARBARA MCMANUS: -for the Permanent General Manager. And then it was changed again
to reflect the responsibilities in the contract, which is this one that we currently have.
SHELLEY COOK: So we could reference this as the current GM job description, correct?
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
SHELLEY COOK: Without having to modify it too much. I mean, this is it. This is what it is.
DOUG TISDALE: I think that's the goal, yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. So instead of approving elements of the Interim, which I probably can't
do right here on the bat, we could just agree that there would be a link to this existing GM job
description. Does that sound right?
BARBARA MCMANUS:That would be part of what we offered.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. Would we in fact attach this as part of the packet that we're sending
out to people?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
DOUG TISDALE: Because what the treasurer said was create a link. But I thought we would
just give it to people.
MCMANUS: Yes.
DOUG TISDALE: Give it to people.
SHELLEY COOK: Oh, can't we do both?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Can't we put it in a link as well?
DOUG TISDALE: Oh, absolutely we'd do both. Yeah. But I mean, we would give them a hard
copy too, right?
SHELLEY COOK: But let's label it clearly as the existing GM job description, or something like
that.
DOUG TISDALE: All right, is there any objection to labeling this as, "existing job description"?

SHELLEY COOK: Or linked to the GM's job description currently or something.
DOUG TISDALE: Well, we're doing both we just said. Is there any objection to labeling it
"existing"? That's the question.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No. No.
DOUG TISDALE: No? OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think it provides clarity.
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK, the only thing I'd like to say about the job description is that HR
has advised us that when we put it out, there should be no salary range in it. So the numbers
would not be there.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think that's wise.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK.
SHELLEY COOK: Why did they advise that, by the way?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Pardon me?
SHELLEY COOK: Because we'd be committing to that range? Is that what it was?
PEGGY CATLIN: Mm-hmm.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK. So when you do announce a job, though, you usually show the
range, right? That's generally approved?
BARBARA MCMANUS: In executive search, you usually don't.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: Right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So we'll relabel the current job description as-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: "Current job description."

BARBARA MCMANUS: --as-- right.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: "existing."
BARBARA MCMANUS: Right. And then it will say for a job title, "Interim General Manager,
"Chief Executive Officer."
DOUG TISDALE: So we would insert the word "Interim" in the job title before "General
Manager, Chief Executive Officer."
BARBARA MCMANUS: Good.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: And I suppose, we could take out the 2015?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, the established 2015 and revised 2016?
DOUG TISDALE: Well, I mean, we can leave that-- "establish"-PEGGY CATLIN: No, just after "Executive Officer."
DOUG TISDALE: --because that's what it was.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: But in the job title itself, you see it says, "2015"?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Mm-hmm.
DOUG TISDALE: So I think we'd take that out, right?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yep.
DOUG TISDALE: OK. And the rest of it is after. I mean, it was approved April 2016. The point
being, we have to give people something that describes what they're looking at. Yeah?
JEFF WALKER: Thank you. I'm thinking that all of the revised dates and approval dates should
be updated so that if somebody gets a hold of these sum changes just to the title alone, and they'll
know that.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
DOUG TISDALE: Well, the only reason I'd be a little nervous about doing that is that-PEGGY CATLIN: Hey, Natalie. Come on in.

SHELLEY COOK: Hey, Natalie.
DOUG TISDALE: Hi, Natalie. Come on in. You can grab us a chair from outside. The only
reason I'd be a little nervous about doing that is that, other than the Executive Committee looking
at this, nobody's approved it.
JEFF WALKER: When it is approved.
NATALIE MENTEN: Thank you.
JEFF WALKER: If there are going to be changes when it is approved, it should be-BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, that won't be for interim though, that will be for the final search,
right? We're not changing it now at all for the interim.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Natalie?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Or at least-- yeah.
JEFF WALKER: Other than the changes-- adding "Interim" there, removing the [INAUDIBLE].
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
JEFF WALKER: It's a different version. You know, the changes are minor stuff, the conversion,
that can cause confusion if somebody has two different documents, two different dates, but
slightly different from this year.
DOUG TISDALE: But this would be the one thing that we would send out.
BARBARA MCMANUS: That's distributed. This would be the one distributed.
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
SHELLEY COOK: With the label that says-BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: --it's the existing. OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: I'd like to bring something up.
DOUG TISDALE: Mm-hmm.
PEGGY CATLIN: If it's an interim, my thought is, because we have so much to do between now
and the end of May, I would suggest that perhaps we put in maybe subject to an action plan or a

work plan that covers these six elements. That being Metro, North Metro, the operator shortage-I mean, those are some of the key things that we want an interim GM to focus on.
DOUG TISDALE: To address?
PEGGY CATLIN: And I just think that maybe putting together some sort of an action plan or,
these are the expectations of the Board-- that these things take priority.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So would you set it up as-- you said that these are the six items
that we expect to be worked on during your interim.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And then they give us an action plan or develop their own
strategy of how they would achieve that.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Plus, I think that would be something really important to do, but we'll need
to work with the Board to do it.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: So I don't know if we're going to be able to attach it to this job element.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, that may be-PEGGY CATLIN: That's a good point.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --a point when we funnel down through some-ALL: Mm-hmm.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --resumes.
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, then what we may want to do is just reference that the Board will be
setting priorities-SHELLEY COOK: Will work with the GM.
PEGGY CATLIN: --and that there will be an expectation that these prior-- and we can issue an
addendum, if you want.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Could we maybe just say, if we're doing a cover letter, "these are
our five priorities-- how would you address them?" in the cover letter.

PEGGY CATLIN: WIthin the next six months.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: But we haven't agreed on that.
DOUG TISDALE: I was just going to say, are you going to take responsibility for setting those?
JEFF WALKER: Didn't we do that last March at our retreat?
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, those are, in fact, the strategic goals for next year.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: But no, what I'm thinking is not setting up new ones-- is saying,
here's what we anticipate to happen in the next six months.
SHELLEY COOK: We'll set these things, we'll set these key goals-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, and then-SHELLEY COOK: --and we'll do them quickly.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --if you could address them in your cover letter, that would be
great.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, so the only thing we have to rely on that the Board's already adopted
is what we did last year. And the problem with that is there's so much that's happened that it will
almost seem disconnected.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Overboard. Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: So much has happened, circumstances have changed, some of the strategic
objectives cannot be met due to the operator shortage and the fact that we're doing a revised
service plan. I just think think at the next Board Meeting, we could probably agree on what those
priorities to get done in the next six months are. I mean, and that's something that staff has been
concerned about is, we have so much to get done between now and May. And I just think I
would put it out there rather than leaving it very nebulous.
SHELLEY COOK: Can we say, "work with the GM to set priorities, and here are some of the
areas." And also, it's just not fixed [INAUDIBLE].
PEGGY CATLIN: "Such as." You could say-SHELLEY COOK: "such as--" mm-hmm.
PEGGY CATLIN: "Such as."

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We could say, "may include, but is not limited to"-- so that it's
broad. Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: But I think we have to hit on the operator shortage.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, absolutely.
PEGGY CATLIN: We have to hit on the service changes, we have to hit on the opening of the N
Line, we have to hit on-- I mean, those are some things that-BARBARA MCMANUS: They are, but we also have to count on a senior leader doing a little bit
of homework and knowing what the issues are before they come to us.
[SCATTERED AGREEMENT]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, that's right.
SHELLEY COOK: Don't want to narrow it down too much. I want it to indicate what we're
going to be doing and it's clearly needed.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I mean, that's what I would be doing.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, I think you're right. I think the interim can't be all things to all people.
And I think that it has to be task-focused as opposed to career-focused for an interim.
BARBARA MCMANUS: But there's also an agency to run and they're tasked with that as well.
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, that's a task, yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: And the tasks, I think she's saying, or perhaps beyond just the four or five
that you might identify.
PEGGY CATLIN: I agree.
DOUG TISDALE: And I think the concern is well stated by the Treasurer, that, we have to be
very, very careful in listing such things because we've got 10, or at least nine, other people who
haven't heard what we might be listening and say, well, wait a minute. Who told you to do that?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, I think we have time to do that.
DOUG TISDALE: So you mean circulate something to the whole Board?
SHELLEY COOK: And go through a facilitated process of hammering it out?

DOUG TISDALE: Before we send this out? OK, we can do that if you want.
PEGGY CATLIN: No, not before. I think we can say that it will be established and we can
amend this.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK, so what we do-- so I'm going to pass this next thing out since
we're into this portion. This is a draft of a press release that I didn't even read myself, it literally
just came into my email as this meeting started, that we can add some specific challenges and
opportunities section to that outline some of the things we're talking about.
PEGGY CATLIN: That would be fine.
SHELLEY COOK: I mean, not being definitive and not being the end-all, but just giving them
an example of some of the challenges that are here-[ALL AGREEING]
--over and above the job description. Does that work?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
DOUG TISDALE: That, I think, yeah, that's a nice way of framing it.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think that's good way.
DOUG TISDALE: And I think to put it in here doesn't put us in a situation where we're saying to
the Board, well, we've decided what you want to do and we're going to express that.
PEGGY CATLIN: No, and that wasn't my intent.
DOUG TISDALE: OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: I just think that we-DOUG TISDALE: And some of that, when it says, "the Board is looking for the following
qualifications," they can include "ability to address a number of issues that we're facing in the
near term."
PEGGY CATLIN: "Urgent issues in the near term."
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, "urgent issues in the near term." Right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK, so I just want to see if everybody is on the same page here. We're
looking to send all the materials and the press release out tomorrow at 1 o'clock.
[ALL AGREEING]

So a lot of decisions have to be made here, such like the one we just did. And some of them may
have to be compromises and have to be worked through as we move through the process with
some of these candidates.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: The only thing that I request is everything that we are working
on right now and this whole plan that we're putting together, at 1 o'clock when you send it out,
before you do that, you send all of it to the Board so that they can see what's been done.
SHELLEY COOK: And they can forward it too.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, I will do a synopsis of what we're working on here today and
send it out to the Board. And then work with the changes on the press release. And I'll also be
working with HR-- when we get down to that section of the outline, there are some things that
I've worked on with HR too about distributions because I knew that there would be questions
about that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Did you get one?
NATALIE MENTEN: Thank you.
DOUG TISDALE: So in terms-PEGGY CATLIN: Before you came, we talked about eliminating salary range for the interim.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And adding in interum to this and taking $215 out.
NATALIE MENTEN: This agreement, this is already arranged?
PEGGY CATLIN: Mm-hmm.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, just the dollars.
NATALIE MENTEN: Interesting.
SHELLEY COOK: Are we doing the interim one yet?
DOUG TISDALE: Are we OK-SHELLEY COOK: This is current job description, right?
PEGGY CATLIN: Existing.
DOUG TISDALE: --with--

SHELLEY COOK: Existing job description. OK, good.
DOUG TISDALE: --this notion of this document together with the press release, which can
include among other things we're looking at-- we have another copy of that, you know?
PEGGY CATLIN: No, I was just showing him my mark up.
DOUG TISDALE: Oh, OK. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, that's it.
DOUG TISDALE: It's the same thing we had on Tuesday night.
PEGGY CATLIN: I was just showing her what changes we had proposed prior to her walking in
the door.
DOUG TISDALE: Right, and they're just cosmetic at the beginning here, right? So are we
agreed on that, in terms of, this is the job description and we'll add some narrative language in
here saying, "ability to address pressing--" what did you say?
PEGGY CATLIN: I said "urgent--"
DOUG TISDALE: "Urgent," yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: "--priorities.
DOUG TISDALE: "Urgent needs that we have--"
PEGGY CATLIN: "in the near term."
DOUG TISDALE: "--in the short-term--"
PEGGY CATLIN: "In the short-term." Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: "--including--" And then to enumerate the operator shortage, service
reductions, N Line opening-- what else did you?
SHELLEY COOK: I'll get a list from Pauletta and I'll send it to you all so we'll make sure that
we're including everything you're thinking about.
PEGGY CATLIN: Service reductions, operator shortage, opening of the N Line-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Budget-DOUG TISDALE: Those are the three, yeah.

PEGGY CATLIN: --the budget, audit.
DOUG TISDALE: Good. So just make sure that those are in there. We may not want to have a
huge, long laundry list because if everything is a priority, nothing is a priority.
PEGGY CATLIN: Exactly. But I just thought, maybe talk about, "please be prepared to address
an action plan to accomplish."
DOUG TISDALE: Mm-hmm.
PEGGY CATLIN: These and other-DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. Yeah, it's not intended to be an exclusive list.
PEGGY CATLIN: Right. Right.
DOUG TISDALE: Right. OK.
SHELLEY COOK: So are we going through this?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, on the press release, where we talk about, "materialS
should be submitted to email address or sent postal mail to RTD 1660 Blake. Applications can
also be brought to the agency in person." --to be forwarded to the Board Office, Is what I would
add because they-DOUG TISDALE: Mm-hmm.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Like right at the end of this agency in person.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Oh, OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: To the Board Office.
PEGGY CATLIN: "Attention."
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: "Attention Board."
DOUG TISDALE: "To the attention of the Board Office."
PEGGY CATLIN: That's a good catch.
DOUG TISDALE: And we're actually going to get to that in just a minute because Barbara
already thought of that. But I think you're right, we can put it in there too. And I think the other
thing-- if you want, we can go through the press release now. I think they're probably covered in
this list, but we absolutely have to go through that first, if you'd like.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, we need to add a bunch of stuff in this press release.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Mm-kay, like what?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: "The Board's looking for the following qualifications in
applicants--"
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Like the highlighted stuff, here.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS:: Oh, yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: Well, we reference the current job. I mean, that's actually-DOUG TISDALE: Mm-hmm.
SHELLEY COOK: And then-- [CHUCKLES]
DOUG TISDALE: That's where we could out in that, "In addition to the other urgent projects."
SHELLEY COOK: Mm-hmm.
PEGGY CATLIN: Do we have an expert?
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: So it's both, the job description can be found at and you have to be able to-PEGGY CATLIN: Is attactched.
SHELLEY COOK: What do you have-DOUG TISDALE: --address or attach to, yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, I'm hoping that they-SHELLEY COOK: --dynamic or collaborative-BARBARA MCMANUS: --can have it at the bottom-SHELLEY COOK: --aggressive, and what was [INAUDIBLE]?
BARBARA MCMANUS: --of this.

PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Because there's no link right now-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: [INAUDIBLE]
BARBARA MCMANUS: --and I don't know how long it would take to create one.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --community-PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --has a very extensive management-BARBARA MCMANUS: But we probably could put it on the new stuff.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --oversight, passion-BARBARA MCMANUS: I'll put that as a question.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --and financial expertise or access to.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, and in terms the this, "the Board is looking for the following
qualifications.--" and it's seeking "a dynamic, collaborative, and progressive, proven leader."
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: Something. We're going from this description and it's the first paragraph of
the-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Mm-hmm.
SHELLEY COOK: --is the only thing that, at this point, we'd include in the-- "The Board is
looking for the following qualifications in applicants." Does that sound right?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: "A dynamic, collaborative, progressive executive to lead the
organization--"
SHELLEY COOK: Or a "proven leader" instead of "executive proven leader--"
DOUG TISDALE: Mm-hmm.
SHELLEY COOK: "--to lead the organization as its Interim General Manager/Chief Executive
Officer."

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: And on job description, if you look at page two, the first full paragraph-that's kind of an amplification on that same thing. And that may capture some of what you were
just saying.
PEGGY CATLIN: Mm-hmm.
DOUG TISDALE: The ideal-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Maybe that's what we put in.
DOUG TISDALE: --candidate would be passionate-SHELLEY COOK: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: --dynamic, and-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: "The ideal candidate." I like that.
DOUG TISDALE: --forward-facing leader with strong interpersonal so forth.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Balanced leader.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. So I think they're looking at-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --political conflicts. Did you see it?
BARBARA MCMANUS: The ideal candidate?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: This one right here. Yeah. The ideal candidate.
SHELLEY COOK: "Forward-thinking leader with strong interpersonal communication skills and
exceptional negotiating skills. A balanced leader who has the ability to manage and lead in a
highly political, complex, and transparent environment." Yeah, this sounds good.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, this is all good.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah. So the CBA negotiation is part of that list, as well, that we need
to add.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: That's right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Oh, my gosh. Does it come up in the next six months?

BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, it comes up next year.
SHELLEY COOK: Oh, my god. Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: You know there's going to be a big vote there on Tuesday for the
new leader.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, Wednesday's the announcement.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Mm-hmm.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, "proven leader" instead of "executive," or something like that?
DOUG TISDALE: Well, I'm sorry, we were looking at the second page.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, can't we just put this-DOUG TISDALE: OK. The first paragraph of the second page, that's just a little amplification
on what you just read. They use a summary of that in the first paragraph, but then on the second
page-BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, it expands a little bit.
DOUG TISDALE: --they kind of expanded it.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I liked it. I liked the second page.
BARBARA MCMANUS: This one off the second page-SHELLEY COOK: OK. OK, that sounds good.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --OK? Add to the press release.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So we should talk about who's going to be quoted first, right? So
even the time frame is short, we'll conduct a thoughtful, permanent CEO said-SHELLEY COOK: I assume that's-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I assuming that's the Chair.
SHELLEY COOK: Mm-hmm.

DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, I mean, it has been [INAUDIBLE]-BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, I posed to them the Chair or the Executive Committee.
DOUG TISDALE: We could say the Executive Committee if you want.
ALL: OK.
SHELLEY COOK: [SCAN READING AND MUMBLING] both-- OK, good.
DOUG TISDALE: Yep.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think those were the only things I had.
[PHONE VIBRATION]
SHELLEY COOK: OK, down here-- do they need to submit it-- like, do they specify PDF of
Word or do you even care? Does that just come in how it comes in?
PEGGY CATLIN: It comes in how it comes in.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK. Is there going to be a link to the extent that this is emailed? Is
there a link for them to submit it? Is that what the email address is?
PEGGY CATLIN: No, it's an email address.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And who's email address will it be?
PEGGY CATLIN: It comes to the Board Office. It's dedicated.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, what you mean is, it's RTDGMSearch. If you look on the first page-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, OK.
DOUG TISDALE: --it's on the agenda here.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I'm just looking at this.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, let me know.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We didn't have it then from when you put it in.

DOUG TISDALE: The press office didn't have that.
BARBARA MCMANUS: All of this has been happening in the moment.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you for doing all this.
DOUG TISDALE: But it was already set up, RTDGMSearch@RTD-Denver.com.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And then "the group will return to the Board on January 3 to discuss
the recruitment process and present the application recieved" is what I would say because that's
what the motion said.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Right. "Board on January 3 to"-SHELLEY COOK: "Discuss the recruitment process and present the applications received."
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK, so I had a question about that.
SHELLEY COOK: Mm-hmm, yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So it says, "the Executive Committee will present to the Board all
submittals indicating, if it wishes"-- which I'm hoping that we're to the point where we have
articulated some folks-- "--the top two internal, external candidates," or however many there
wind up being, "by January 3."
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So in that case-SHELLEY COOK: Talk to each of internal and external, yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Right.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So in that case, if you're looking on the outline that I put together,
Elements of the Interim GM Review Process-- Scheduling Time Frame. So we would be
accepting applications up until close of business on the 24th.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.

SHELLEY COOK: The 23rd?
PEGGY CATLIN: 23rd.
SHELLEY COOK: 24th is a-DOUG TISDALE: The 23rd.
SHELLEY COOK: --Saturday.
DOUG TISDALE: The 24th is when we-BARBARA MCMANUS: 23rd, I'm sorry. 23rd. And then on the 24th-DOUG TISDALE: We get our binders.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --we would put together binders for each of the Executive Committee
members with all of the applications that we've received.
SHELLEY COOK: Is there any way to start giving them to us earlier so we don't have to review
them all in a day or something.? I mean-DOUG TISDALE: It somewhat prejudices the process.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, it does. We should really be looking at everything at the same
time.
SHELLEY COOK: How about an update from you about who's applied or something like that so
we're getting a sense of how many we're getting in.
DOUG TISDALE: What do you think, Peggy? You've gone through this before.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I don't know.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think an update about the number would be good.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK, just the number of applications we're getting in?
SHELLEY COOK: Some sense of who they are.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: Or how many are external, how many are internal.

BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, you know, what we're going to also be providing with you,
based on the job description, which I'll work with HR to put together, is a list of criteria that
you'll be looking for.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And some folks are just going to fall off right away, you're not even
going to read theirs because they don't have a four year education or they've never been a C-whatever the criteria is that you're going to be evaluating them against.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think, "leading x number of people" is important because you don't want a-SHELLEY COOK: Significant organization, yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: You don't want to have somebody that's a good leader that only has had a
staff of 14 or something like that.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, right.
PEGGY CATLIN: So you [INAUDIBLE] have some threshold?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, so there will probably be a threshold size organization. They'll
probably be based on the APTA's indication of small, medium, or large for transportation, and
how certain external folks look at the size of their agencies by-PEGGY CATLIN: Do we want to limit it to transit or do we want to limit-BARBARA MCMANUS: No, no. We'll have both. We'll add external and transit as part of the
criteria. And we have a tiny bit of time to look at what HR provides to us for a criteria list. I
mean, you're going to have questions some are going to be on the borderline, and-PEGGY CATLIN: I think basic understanding of RTD, that will-BARBARA MCMANUS: Right.
PEGGY CATLIN: That'll be criteria that shows if they've done their homework or not.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Right.
SHELLEY COOK: So this is the criteria for us-- to identify the top two in each catagory.
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
SHELLEY COOK: We make that available to the Board, but we're submitting all of the
applications--

BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, this is what we'll ask you to do. We'll ask you-- the folks that
don't meet qualifications at all, you separate.
DOUG TISDALE: They still go to the Board.
SHELLEY COOK: Still go to the Board.
BARBARA MCMANUS: But everything is going to go to the Board.
DOUG TISDALE: Everything goes to the Board, let's make that clear.
BARBARA MCMANUS: But this is what we're going to be tasking you to do with the binders
that you get, is articulate internal or external-- if you funnel those down, if that's where the
powers fall. All of the applications that you feel meet the criteria, but for one reason or another,
you didn't find to be candidates, and the not qualified. So then the binders that we'll provide to
the rest of the Board, which we're planning on distributing to them on December 30 after we will
meet on December 27.
DOUG TISDALE: I was going to say because you jumped ahead a little bit.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I know I did.
DOUG TISDALE: We were still talking about December 23rd.
BARBARA MCMANUS: But I'm trying to answer the questions without going through the
outline from start to finish.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So when the Board gets their binders, is there going to be a
requirement that they can only look at them here or can they take them home and look at them?
BARBARA MCMANUS: No, they have to sign a confidentiality agreement that they don't share
or talk to anybody-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right, but then they can take them home-BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --and read them?
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, they can take them and read them.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: But there is a nondisclosure agreement.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right, and I know that.

BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, that everybody will sign.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So there'll be four sections. There'll be any internal or external
candidates, two separate sections that this group has articulated, everybody else that they felt that
met the qualifications but for one reason or another wasn't considered, and the people that
weren't qualified. So they'll get a binder with four sections. But they will have an opportunity to
see everything, but they will already be vetted and separated out for them. But they can do with
what they please with the information that we give them.
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
PEGGY CATLIN: So the meets qualifications and not qualified-- is there going to be a brief
summary of why a person was not qualified.
BARBARA MCMANUS: If you guys want to provide that to them.
SHELLEY COOK: I would just note that the only thing we said we'd do with the Board was
turnover, if we wish, the top two and the top two in each category, and this sounds like a lot to
do.
BARBARA MCMANUS: No, it says, "the Executive Committee will present to the Board all
submittals."
SHELLEY COOK: Uh-huh, right. And then, "indicating, if it wishes, the top two each of internal
and external applicants."
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, that seems to me like "and" not "or."
SHELLEY COOK: "Indicating, if it wishes, with that--" yes, "--and the top two each of internal
and external applicants." But-DOUG TISDALE: I think the idea that Barabra was trying to get at that she expressed to me
was, let's assume for a moment-- we should be so lucky-- let's assume for a moment we get 50
applications in. But let's assume that one is from Fred Flintstone, one is from Barney Rubble, one
is from Donald Duck. We're going to give that to the Board, but we might just put it at the end
and say, by the way, Fred Flintstone worked in a quarry in Bedrock. He's not qualified but here it
is. You make your own determination, it's there. Because some Board members might say, if you
just throw all of them at me and you haven't done any work at all as an Executive Committee to
tell me that they're even qualified and you're asking me to read the resume of a convicted serial
killer. I exaggerate to illustrate.

SHELLEY COOK: But we can gauge that too based on the number of people we get and how
elaborate-DOUG TISDALE: Oh, yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: --we want to screen.
DOUG TISDALE: You directed that we sign up for that.
SHELLEY COOK: Mm-hmm.
PEGGY CATLIN: Shelley, I think the way they've categorized these in the binders for the full
Board, it meets [INAUDIBLE].
SHELLEY COOK: We're going to come up with qualifications that will determine that threshold
sometime here in between now and then.
BARBARA MCMANUS: It'll be based off the job description and then any additional verbiage
that this team decides on. But we-SHELLEY COOK: I just want to keep that fairly loose. I mean, I'm just thinking back when Cal
applied, he came from a small Florida agency. And so, I want to keep us open to people who
wouldn't, strictly speaking, fall within what we consider the qualified area. So if we can make
that fairly loose and not too rigid that would be great.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, I don't know what that looks like because-DOUG TISDALE: Let me suggest one thing, if you look at the job description again, if you'll
look at page two and you look just above Duties and Responsibilities, that last paragraph, it says,
"interested candidates should possess a bachelors degree, graduate degree preferred in
management planning, public administration" and so forth, "at least 10 years of senior
management, executive management experience." Blah, blah, blah. "in lieu of a bachelors,
relevant work experience, the experience in the public sector." Blah, blah. You see that? That's
already stated in the job description.
PEGGY CATLIN: Do we want experience in the public sector to be an absolute because there
might be a CEO of a-DOUG TISDALE: It's not.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: It's not an absolute. It says, "experience working in the public sector, public
transportation, local government, or transportation or related is highly (EMPHASIZES)
desirable."

PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, it's not exclusive. Oh, no, it's not a limitation. But at some point, we
need to say, it's a transportation agency.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And, you know, if we set up the criteria and you find that there is a
candidate that's on the ledge there, then we can confer with HR and find out what the
implications are of doing a hire that doesn't fit the criteria of what we put out to-SHELLEY COOK: This is a negotiated-BARBARA MCMANUS: --candidates.
SHELLEY COOK: --position that isn't quite as-- you don't have to adhere so strictly to all those
kinds of things. So I'm just saying, to the extent we can, let's make those loose enough so that we
can consider a broader range of people than we might otherwise.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: Well, remember, we're considering everybody.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, but if they've already been branded as-DOUG TISDALE: Doesn't matter.
SHELLEY COOK: --unqualified, that's going to be a bit of a hurdle.
DOUG TISDALE: That may be not a good way to describe it. We might come up with a
different phrase. I see what you're saying, you're focused in on the fact that the fourth pot, if you
will, is labeled "not qualified."
SHELLEY COOK: You could say "less" or I don't know.
DOUG TISDALE: "Does not meet all qualifications." We could say something like that. Yeah, I
think so. "Does not meet all qualifications," instead of "not qualified." Because that sounds a
little judgmental, and I think that's what the concern is the Treasurer's raising.
SHELLEY COOK: Mm-hmm.
DOUG TISDALE: You know, again, we've jumped ahead. Can we just kind of go back-SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, sorry. Sorry, Chair. [LAUGHS]

DOUG TISDALE: Well, I mean, because here's the thing, we're going to have all this stuff and
we're creating a list of things that people have to do, they have to tell us, it has to be addressed
through the Executive Committee, they've got to specify salary requirements because we're not
putting it in. So they're gotta say, no, I need to be paid on an annualized basis $400,000 a year.
SHELLEY COOK: If they say-DOUG TISDALE: Or $150,000.
SHELLEY COOK: --commensurate with the position. Can we let them do that?
DOUG TISDALE: Say it again?
SHELLEY COOK: Well, we're not even offering a range-DOUG TISDALE: Right.
SHELLEY COOK: --so they may say, hmmm, I don't know. I don't want to say something that's
going to disqualify me. So maybe they say, "commensurate with the position"-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Current. With the current.
SHELLEY COOK: With current or if they-- in other words-DOUG TISDALE: So how do we judge that person then? Their assumption of commensurate is
$500,000 a year.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, I'm just thinking about the people who might apply and we'll negotiate
that with him, won't we? We'll negotiate a pay.
BARBARA MCMANUS: But if they're at $384,000 and right now we're paying $295,000 you're
not going to negotiate down to $295,000. And also, I want to throw into the mix here that this is
not a negotiation for a yearly salary, per se. We're going to see, probably, a higher dollar amount
range for short term interim than we would for what this range is here. I mean, right now, I think
Dave makes maybe, I don't know what it is, $20,000 a month.
JEFF WALKER: $24,000.
BARBARA MCMANUS: $24,000.
SHELLEY COOK: How about this is an option-- we know that the Board will select some
number, probably a fairly small number but not finalists, to interview and then we can ask him
that. What are you looking for for pay? And that way, not have it become something that either
causes people to become disqualified needlessly.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, we wouldn't disqualify anybody on that. That's not a--

SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, but who wants to get pinned down at this early? They're just barely
submitting the indication of interest, you know? And so to pin them down on a number that
quickly, I'm a little bit nervous about it.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I know, but we're not talking about you and I, we're talking about a
seasoned senior leader. This is what they're used to. If we cave in-DOUG TISDALE: Let me ask, Peggy, what's your opinion? I'd like to hear what you think.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think that you can reasonably ask for their expectation of compensation.
DOUG TISDALE: OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think, because it's a starting point.
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
PEGGY CATLIN: And then just say-SHELLEY COOK: Do we too?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, thanks for asking. Yeah, I do. I think that these are
seasoned, experienced people. There's a lot of information out there in the community to know
how much Dave is making, it's not a secret. So they could do their homework and kind of figure
out where they are on that spectrum. I think that's [INAUDIBLE].
PEGGY CATLIN: I think you're right.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, I assumed you were like that too. I just-JEFF WALKER: With whatever they bring to the table-BARBARA MCMANUS: I mean, it was out in the news on Monday, the top 37-DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, I was going to say, the wages of everyone in senior leadership was in
the newspaper.
BARBARA MCMANUS: They know it's going to be higher than the highest senior leadership
and they know they're probably not going to be higher than the General Manager. So again, if
they do their homework, they know what they're looking at.
SHELLEY COOK: Can you say a "range or estimate" or something? Or something that's not a
requirement.
DOUG TISDALE: Well, no.

SHELLEY COOK: --an expectation.
DOUG TISDALE: And typically, yeah, I mean, when you say specify salary requirements, at
least my independent, I'll look at Peggy because she's probably been in many more searches than
I've ever been in. But when it says "specify salary requirements," usually you post a range or
something is how you respond to that. I would need something at least this, but not more than
this.
PEGGY CATLIN: I would say, "candidate to specify salary expectations."
DOUG TISDALE: OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: "Salary expectation range." I think that-DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: That gives you a little bit more wiggle room.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, and that, I think, addresses your concerns.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes, it does. Thank you.
DOUG TISDALE: Shelley-bot making sure you're not turning people off.
PEGGY CATLIN: Pin people down. Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: And a lot of times, the resumes I've seen for senior leadership, it specifies a
range, and then most of the time, they will put in parentheses, "negotiable."
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Right.
PEGGY CATLIN: So I think-- well, and I mean-DOUG TISDALE: No, that's fine. I'm just trying to make sure we get done within the next two
hours, you know?
BARBARA MCMANUS: So generally, too, in an interim position, it may or may not include the
benefits, it may or may not include the need for a per diem, if it winds up being someone not
local that's chosen.
JEFF WALKER: Car allowance, house allowance.

BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes, I mean there's-SHELLEY COOK: But if they are not benefited, that implies you could pay a little bit more. So,
you know, all the more reason-DOUG TISDALE: Exactly.
SHELLEY COOK: --to kind of leave it-BARBARA MCMANUS: Right.
SHELLEY COOK: --a little bit-- fluid.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. And then, again, we're talking about specifications for the Letter of
Interest. We tell people you've got to tell us that it's addressed to us, you've got to give us your
salary expectation range. Tell us when you're available, because if they say, "and I can start
March the 1st." That, obviously, is not going to be someone that-- we will, of course, send it to
the entire Board, the full Board reads every single resume. Just in case there's any confusion on
that-- the full Board will read every resume received. But some of them they'll probably spend
less time on.
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, I mean, the availability is also something I think we could have some
flexibility with.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, we need some-DOUG TISDALE: How so?
BARBARA MCMANUS: --by the 20th of January.
SHELLEY COOK: Mm-hmm. Ideally.
DOUG TISDALE: What flexibility do you think we have?
PEGGY CATLIN: There could be an opportunity to put somebody in an acting position, not an
interim position, but an acting position, for a period of a couple weeks.
DOUG TISDALE: So we'd do an acting interim.
PEGGY CATLIN: I have been an acting Chief Engineer, CFO-SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, she knows the acting part.

PEGGY CATLIN: I have been acting and that could be an internal person. It was never down to
me.
DOUG TISDALE: Before the interim or before a final? Before a permanent?
SHELLEY COOK: No, before the interim, I think, is what she's saying.
DOUG TISDALE: You were acting bofore a permanent hire?
PEGGY CATLIN: Before a permanent.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, I've seen that with some [INAUDIBLE].
PEGGY CATLIN: Nevertheless-DOUG TISDALE: You're talking about an acting interim.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So let me-DOUG TISDALE: I mean, if that's what you guys want.
PEGGY CATLIN: I'm just suggesting.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Uh-uh, I don't like that.
SHELLEY COOK: Or acting GM. When a city manager goes out of town I would commonly
say, in my absence, deputy so-and-so is acting as city manager. So you could say, they'd be
acting as GM and-PEGGY CATLIN: It just gives us a little flexibility. If the ideal candidate can't start 'till March
15th, can we have somebody acting for two months?
DOUG TISDALE: Well, the Board hasn't approved that, you'd have to go back to the Board and
ask.
PEGGY CATLIN: Of course, they haven't. I'm just throwing out some ideas.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And that's good, I just want to get my hands around it though. So let's
say you go back to Dave's succession plan, but Mike Meader winds up being one of the
candidates. Then before everything's out-- you know, like it just gets to be-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: A conflict.
SHELLEY COOK: I know.

BARBARA MCMANUS: It gets to be a little bit of a conflict.
PEGGY CATLIN: I mean, that's a good point.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So I'm just throwing it out there like all of you are, because we're here
to just figure out that-DOUG TISDALE: Kind of brainstroming, just come up with a process.
SHELLEY COOK: But the point is, let's try if we can, not to make it, like, you (EMPHASIS)
must start on the 20th if we had a really good candidate.
PEGGY CATLIN: If we have a really good candidate-DOUG TISDALE: And again, all we're asking-PEGGY CATLIN: I want to give some opportunity.
DOUG TISDALE: --we're not dictating anything. We're saying, you tell us you're availablity.
That's all this is. You tell us, what's your availability?
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Tell us your availibility.
BARBARA MCMANUS: If they say March 15, you may say, OK, we're going to move on to
the next candidate.
SHELLEY COOK: And say availability, you know, your availability schedule and term-DOUG TISDALE: That's what it says. Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: I know, "schedule and term. And you may indicate up to 14 months" or
something that, is what we indicate.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, it said-- yeah, four to 14.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, no, that's what she was saying. In terms of the frame, the idea is-- and
we're asking a lot of Board Office staff, but they're committed to do this-- that on the 23rd by
close of business, we have them all in. They put together the binders for us. This is not for the
full Board at this point, they'll get them later. But for us, and we get them on Christmas Eve.
PEGGY CATLIN: So this is purely selfish reasons, I have a boatload of people coming in on
Christmas Eve, which is when we celebrate our Christmas.
DOUG TISDALE: Mm-hmm.
PEGGY CATLIN: I'm not sure I'm going to be able to come down here and pick one up.

BARBARA MCMANUS: I believe we would courier them to you.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, no. There's no sense to that.
BARBARA MCMANUS: There's no sense to anybody coming down.
DOUG TISDALE: We're not asking people to come here.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I don't know when we're going to be able to get them done. So we'll
schedule a courier to get them to you.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you. And I very much appreciate that.
SHELLEY COOK: Maybe on the 26th, would you be?
PEGGY CATLIN: Mm-hmm.
DOUG TISDALE: Well-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
DOUG TISDALE: --here we said the 27th. If you want to do it the 26th, we can do it the 26th, I
suppose.
SHELLEY COOK: I was thinking setting meetings for the next few Thursdays.
PEGGY CATLIN: I'd prefer the 27th, I think.
SHELLEY COOK: Is that Saturday?
DOUG TISDALE: No, it's Friday.
BARBARA MCMANUS: It's a Friday.
DOUG TISDALE: Friday.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, that works.
PEGGY CATLIN: I already put it on my calendar.

SHELLEY COOK: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, Friday the 27th is what we're talking about.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And I said noon because I don't know how long it will take. And then
after that, myself and my team have to put together everything that you've collated and
everything that you've decided on into the binders for the full Board-PEGGY CATLIN: For December 30th?
BARBARA MCMANUS: --and get it to them.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. And the thing is, we may not finish on the 27th, we may have to meet
again on the 28th. Because the idea is-SHELLEY COOK: Saturday?
DOUG TISDALE: --the reason that she came up with the 30th was because the motion says we
get things to the Board by January 3rd.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm fine with Saturday, as well.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, I'm open. So whatever we need to say for mine is good.
DOUG TISDALE: OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: I hope to be open but again, I still have family in town but that's all right.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: Is everybody actually here over the holidays? Are we lucky or what?
DOUG TISDALE: I'm in town, yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: I'm in town.
PEGGY CATLIN: I'm in town.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I am now.
PEGGY CATLIN: Oh. [LAUGHTER] [INAUDIBLE]

DOUG TISDALE: On Communication Plan-- these are cumulative, just to emphasize. It's not
that this is a choice thing, but the motion said, "use all possible means." So we'll use whoever
HR uses, whatever-BARBARA MCMANUS: And I have a list of those.
DOUG TISDALE: OK, let's pass that out.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Could we also add in here-BARBARA MCMANUS: Director Cook.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --sending out the packet to Board members so they could send it
out to people that they-DOUG TISDALE: If you look at the last bullet, that's exactly what it says.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We're preparing a packet for Directors, specifically.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, good.
DOUG TISDALE: No, we got that in there because I know that was important because that's in
the motion too-SHELLEY COOK: It is, yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: --for the Board members to be able to communicate. So that's the idea. So the
Board members will each get probably an electronic version so they can email it, but if you want
it in print, we can do that, too. But you'll get an electronic version that will have the
announcement, the press release, the job description, the whole ball of wax.
SHELLEY COOK: So OK?
PEGGY CATLIN: I've reached out to Board members saying we really appreciate any input you
may have as to the qualities that we would like to see in a general manager. So some of those are
filtering in but I'll compile those as I get them and share with the rest of the group.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I'll get mine too because I've been having those same
conversations. That'd be great.
PEGGY CATLIN: I just think that the rest of the Board would appreciate being engaged to the
extent-BARBARA MCMANUS: And that's great.

PEGGY CATLIN: We're taking it upon ourselves even though the discussion is here. I just
wanted to-SHELLEY COOK: Hopefully relieve you of some of that.
PEGGY CATLIN: And that's great but I want to also just mention, again, the press release is
going out tomorrow at 1 o'clock.
DOUG TISDALE: Mm-hmm.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And it'll have the link in there.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, so if you have some specific thoughts, probably sooner rather than
later.
PEGGY CATLIN: Right.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: Right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And I suspect-PEGGY CATLIN: That's fine.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --most will be captured in the job description.
PEGGY CATLIN: I haven't seen anything come in that is not-DOUG TISDALE: Already covered-BARBARA MCMANUS: That's not here already?
DOUG TISDALE: --somehow? Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. Right.
PEGGY CATLIN: Or there may have been a few that I doubt that the full Board would agree
with.
DOUG TISDALE: Mm-hmm, yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: So I might not--

DOUG TISDALE: Good idea.
PEGGY CATLIN: --suggest that they be included in the press release.
DOUG TISDALE: The real question that we want to confirm is, are these dates OK with you all?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: So we get the close of business 23rd, we cut off receiving these things and
we'll accept it, you see in the press release, and all kinds of forms.
PEGGY CATLIN: So the letter of interest and resume by close of business.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: We ought to add that.
DOUG TISDALE: Well, yeah,
PEGGY CATLIN: So it's not midnight?
DOUG TISDALE: Well, I was going to say, unless you want to say midnight. Because the
motion didn't detail which, I just always assumed it was close of business. But if you want to say
midnight, we could say midnight. It's up to you guys.
SHELLEY COOK: Close business is reasonable. If we specify it. If we got one in at 10 o'clock
that night-BARBARA MCMANUS: And I'll put close of business, 5:00 PM.
SHELLEY COOK: --what the hey?
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. Close of business, 5:00 PM MST.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, that's a good one.
DOUG TISDALE: I mean-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That's a good one.
DOUG TISDALE: --avoid any confusion. Because somebody gets it in at 8:00-- I had a state
senator ask me the other day, he said, you know, I just filed something and they told me it was
late because it was 10 minutes after the deadline. And I said, you're a lawyer too, right?
[LAUGHS] You know what I mean? So then December 24th we get the binders, then December
27th, we meet at noon, keep open the possibility-- I mean, that may not be the case. It may be

that it's a limited enough group that some people jump out. Because our only job is, should we
choose-SHELLEY COOK: Mm-hmm.
DOUG TISDALE: If we elect to do so to recommend top two internal and top two external.
That's all we're doing. The Board gets the whole package no matter what. We're just picking, if
we wish-- top two internal, top two external. That's why I think Friday afternoon probably is
enough time. Then the Board Office puts this together so they get everybody everything on
Monday the 30th.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Will they also get those couried to their homes as well?
BARBARA MCMANUS: I'm assuming yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, I think we just have to bite-- there were some budgetary issues that
we're running into..
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, there are.
DOUG TISDALE: And we're spending money on this process.
SHELLEY COOK: So that's a question-- yeah., how much and can we avoid that to the extent
possible-BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, if you want them couriered, I mean, there's a cost.
SHELLEY COOK: Oh, I see what you're saying, that kind of budget. Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: But I was thinking for the advertising-- we have subscriptions currently that
we can take advantage of, right?
BARBARA MCMANUS: So Communications and HR will absorb that into their budget as part
of the search. Anything that they can't absorb, they'll let me know ahead of time and I will keep a
spreadsheet of so that I know where I have to find my budget for and I'll let this group know.
SHELLEY COOK So I'm kind of sensitive to not spending a lot of money on it for this interim.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Me too.
SHELLEY COOK: Is there a range that we know that they can absorb so we'd have an idea of
what we're looking at in terms of the total cost?

BARBARA MCMANUS: For this plan right here, they're able to absorb everything.
SHELLEY COOK: OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: Can. I offer a suggestion to add to this list? Can you put the CDOT
commissioners?
SHELLEY COOK: That's a good idea.
PEGGY CATLIN: You've got Denver City Council, but it seems to me that-SHELLEY COOK: I see that. Yeah, I do.
PEGGY CATLIN: There are some-- the CDOT Commission.
DOUG TISDALE: Did somebody get two copies of that because I didn't-- oh, no. I have it. I
have it. I have it. Yeah, good point. Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: And-SHELLEY COOK: DRCOG, Metro Mayors, who knows?
PEGGY CATLIN: Can we-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: The Color Association of Nonprofit Organizations they have a
job board.
DOUG TISDALE: They do.
BARBARA MCMANUS: What's it called?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: CANPO.
PEGGY CATLIN: C-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: C-A-N-P-O, Colorado Association of Nonprofit Organizations.
PEGGY CATLIN: And I would also-- well, you have Chambers of Commerce. Does that include
CACI, Colorado Association of Commerce and Industry?
BARBARA MCMANUS: I don't know. CASY?

DOUG TISDALE: CACI, Colorado Association of Commerce and Industry. But the point is just,
in terms of these outreaches, they ought to just have everybody on this list. So that's great. And I
think [INAUDIBLE]
BARBARA MCMANUS: A lot of individual folks.
DOUG TISDALE: Non-profit.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Like I said, all of this just got to me, so I haven't looked at it.
DOUG TISDALE: No, no. We're just-BARBARA MCMANUS: I know. Adding is great.
DOUG TISDALE: Whether it's on there or not, you don't have to double check that. You just tell
them make sure your list includes CDOT Commissioners, Colorado Non-profit Association,
CACI, DRCOG, Metro Mayors.
SHELLEY COOK: Governor's Office.
PEGGY CATLIN: I was going to say the Governor's Office
DOUG TISDALE: I think that's already there, isn't it?
PEGGY CATLIN: I didn't see it.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: What about the legislature?
SHELLEY COOK: Or leadership in the legislature?
BARBARA MCMANUS: State of Colorado offices? I don't know what that includes.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. That's why I say I think the Governor's Office is already there. But to
confirm-- that's all we're saying is just confirm to us-- that it includes Governor's Office and-PEGGY CATLIN: Would Legislative Council be appropriate rather than the entire legislature?
BARBARA MCMANUS: I don't know. I think legislators have been really interested in a lot of
this stuff. Just to get the information-DOUG TISDALE: We probably have a distribution list for them. Why not send it?
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
JEFF WALKER: The City Council, Denver City Council needs to be updated.

DOUG TISDALE: It is. It's on the last page. Oh, the list needs to be updated, you mean. So it's
out of date.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: But then [INAUDIBLE] Denver City, you probably need to put
in all the municipalities, like Lakewood or-SHELLEY COOK: Send it to the Mayor's Office for each municipality.
PEGGY CATLIN: If we send it to Metro Mayors, wouldn't that be-SHELLEY COOK: Yeah. Then we would get them all.
DOUG TISDALE: I think they send it separately. But it would all be listed, Denver Metro cities.
So, again, assuming they're doing their job, it does list all the cities.
JEFF WALKER: Is APTA on the-BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes. It's on the front page, Jeff. It says RTD website, CareerBuilder,
Indeed, LinkedIn, NEOGOV, APTA, Transit Talent, and Railway Agent. Time got away from
me, but I did want to-PEGGY CATLIN: I would like to add the Executive Director of TRB Transportation Research
Board Neil Pederson, P-E-D-E-R-S-E-N.
SHELLEY COOK: So can we get these? These are really good to submit. Can we get it to her
after this even?
PEGGY CATLIN: Because this has a 30,000 person reach.
DOUG TISDALE: Yep.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Where is he from again? Sorry.
PEGGY CATLIN: He's Executive Director of Transportation Research Board, TRB. We're a
member. But there are a lot of Transit Committees, but there are other, so many people that
touches. And so-BARBARA MCMANUS: Great.
DOUG TISDALE: I think the idea is-- and let me see if I can summarize it-- if anybody thinks of
anybody who should be included-SHELLEY COOK: Give it to her, OK? That's good.
DOUG TISDALE: And just make sure they are on the list.

BARBARA MCMANUS: So rather than just pelting you with it here, we could get you a list, or
something like that.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. I've got over 10,000 social media contacts. I already put it up on
LinkedIn today.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Right. So tomorrow at 1 o'clock, it will go to everybody on this list.
Anybody that's added they can forward it at any time. It makes the deadline tighter, but we can
forward it at any time.
DOUG TISDALE: Absolutely. All right, so that's-- so as it says on the communications plan,
that's the points of publication, when we say HR process, you have a copy now of what the HR
process is.
BARBARA MCMANUS: You have a copy of the press release. We went over that already
DOUG TISDALE: And we tweaked it, right? And the News Stop on the RTD website will have
it as well. This is that email that we were talking about, RTDGMSearch. And then absolutely
each individual Board member will get their own packet that you can send a link to anybody in
the world. And then the next question is, OK, if the Board receives their binders on the 30th,
when do you want to have the first Special Board Meeting? And I say first because, obviously,
there's more than one.
PEGGY CATLIN: They receive it on the 30th.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, 30th of December is when they'll get the binder. We gave ourselves
three days, one of which is Christmas, to review the binders.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: They get it on the 30th. The 3rd is-PEGGY CATLIN: Friday.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --Friday. So and then you got New Year's in there. So and then
the 31st is New Year's Eve. So-PEGGY CATLIN: I don't know. I'm not a New Year's Eve reveler, so I could be reviewing
something on New Year's Eve. But I'm not sure that-SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: What if we had a Board Meeting, Special Board Meeting on the
2nd, and then on the 3rd, like if we needed to do two days we could do it that way? I mean, I
don't know who's traveling in and out.
DOUG TISDALE: We have a Board member who's not an Executive Committee member here,
how do you feel about that?

NATALIE MENTEN: I need to make on these dates that I've written down. So December 23,
deadline for applications.
SHELLEY COOK: Close of business.
NATALIE MENTEN: Close of business.
DOUG TISDALE: Close of business 5:00 PM Mountain Standard Time.
NATALIE MENTEN: December 24, Executive Committee gets binders. I'm missing what the
purpose or intent of the meeting is for the December 27 12:00 PM meeting. Is that Executive
Committee meets-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: To review.
NATALIE MENTEN: To come in. They've had binders.
PEGGY CATLIN: To try and narrow them down to the top two.
SHELLEY COOK: Or at least designate the top [INAUDIBLE]
DOUG TISDALE: The Executive Committee, if it chooses to do so, to designate the top two
internal and the top two external.
NATALIE MENTEN: OK, so I would-- number one, since the committee is getting binders the
24th, that there's two copies just here some Board Director can come and sit and look at. I know I
mentioned I like to take things home. But meanwhile, if there's two copies sitting here, you're
giving a Board Director a little more opportunity to keep up with the Exec Committee.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, we always have file copies, so they'll be here anyway.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think that's a good idea.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We always have a copy of everything we send out.
NATALIE MENTEN: And Monday the 30th is really when Board Directors would get their own
separate copy.
DOUG TISDALE: Their full set, which will at that time include if the Board-- Executive
Committee chooses to do so, recommendations for top two internal and top two external. And
then coming down to the published date so far, I think, January 3rd is when the Board sits down
as a body to discuss.
NATALIE MENTEN: And you're asking about January 2.

DOUG TISDALE: Well, it's not that it's sit down and doesn't-- we haven't set that yet. All we
said on the motion was that the materials would be sent by January 3rd. That's all the motion
says.
NATALIE MENTEN: So we're expecting though that we're doing that in advance because we're
doing it on December 30.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. The question is, when do we have the first full Board Meeting?
Because we're treating this essentially as a committee of the whole. So when does the Board
meet as a body to talk about this? One thought is January 3. And the recommendation was how
about if we meet on January 2 and January 3? And we're asking your thoughts.
NATALIE MENTEN: What are the days of the week of that?
PEGGY CATLIN: Thursday and Friday.
SHELLEY COOK: Because New Year's is Wednesday.
NATALIE MENTEN: January 2 is a Thursday?
PEGGY CATLIN: Thursday.
NATALIE MENTEN: And you think that helps get us going as soon as possible. It's a Thursday,
which is consistent with a lot of these.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE Special meetings. Yeah.
NATALIE MENTEN: So I'm OK with either date.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: With either January 2 or 3?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, we've put the second one in there in case we couldn't come to
consensus on the one.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, so an option for a second date on Friday.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. And that's why the reason this is called first Special Board Meeting is
that it's anticipated the first meeting will be lots and lots of discussion, hopefully over a great
field of candidates. If that's the case it may take us a while to winnow it down. So there might
have to be a second Special Board Meeting.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And correct me if I'm wrong. We're hoping to be able to do that in
executive session.
DOUG TISDALE: Yes.

PEGGY CATLIN: Because it's a personnel related matter.
DOUG TISDALE: But let me-- yeah, that's my assumption. But what does the Committee feel?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I agree with that.
PEGGY CATLIN: I agree.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Because it was a question mark on our list there.
PEGGY CATLIN: No, I think it should be executive session.
NATALIE MENTEN: So I have a question then. The purpose of the January 2, or 3, or both, is
to-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Discuss.
NATALIE MENTEN: Discuss and make a discussion.
SHELLEY COOK: I think we decide if we determine who to interview too.
NATALIE MENTEN: [INAUDIBLE] make a vote?
DOUG TISDALE: I was going to say, in the first instance to review everything. And if the
Board says, you know what? It's so clear. We're ready to vote. Yeah, you can vote because it'll be
posted as a meeting.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Outside of executive session.
DOUG TISDALE: But remember that it was also anticipated that we might want to do
interviews. Remember, this is all just a paper chase.
SHELLEY COOK: That's right. It's really critical. So we may talk to-- I mean, I would want to
interview them myself.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. So the point is the Board meets either January 2 or 3. I would suggest
the third because I think some people might not want to have-- but that's a thought. That's all it
is. We meet January 2 or 3. At that time, what we do is-- and I believe the way the resolu-- the
motion was adopted was, the Board would then select an appropriate number. Isn't that what you
wrote?
SHELLEY COOK: Individuals to interview.

DOUG TISDALE: The Board will then determine some appropriate number of individuals to
interview. So that's what you voted on Tuesday night. So it's not anticipated unless
circumstances change dramatically. And they might. It's not anticipated we will make a decision.
Anticipated-- what is that? Leaking? We'll discuss, and then determine some appropriate number
of individuals to interview.
NATALIE MENTEN: And then do we make a-- do we have our regular first-- what do we call
it-- Special RTD Board Meeting?
DOUG TISDALE: It's called a Special Board Meeting, and that's on the 7th.
NATALIE MENTEN: OK. And then just back to January 2 and 3 is the attempt to have this up
5:30, and not in mid-afternoon or something-PEGGY CATLIN: I think out of respect for our fellow working Board members that 5:30 needs
to be-SHELLEY COOK: It's kind of where they get time.
DOUG TISDALE: So you want to do 5:30 on Thursday?
PEGGY CATLIN: I would prefer the 2nd.
DOUG TISDALE: In that case, that may be better. Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Great. But we may need both.
PEGGY CATLIN: We may.
SHELLEY COOK: I think it was wisely.
DOUG TISDALE: But I think the goal that we're hearing-- and let me ask if there's consensus-first Special Board Meeting Thursday, January 2, at 5:30 PM Mountain Standard Time.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yep.
DOUG TISDALE: OK. That helps.
BARBARA MCMANUS: With the possibility of one also on Friday.
DOUG TISDALE: Possibility to carry over on Friday if there's a reason. But, again, the job of
the Board at that January 2 meeting is to determine some appropriate number of individuals to
interview.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So I guess my question would be, is on the second, we will all
be talking about the top candidates in determining who we would be interested in.

DOUG TISDALE: And we'll we talking about everybody.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right, OK.
SHELLEY COOK: They'll at least have that option, yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: But then could we determine there who we want to interview
and maybe the next night actually do the interviews?
BARBARA MCMANUS: We won't get people in a day's notice.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, especially if they're [INAUDIBLE].
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Because we were saying, what, to have the person step in. So
then when we do interviews the following week-ish?
DOUG TISDALE: Wouldn't you think?
BARBARA MCMANUS: We'd have to. And then and then there's contract negotiations.
SHELLEY COOK: There are. it's very tight, no two ways about it. That's why when Peggy
talked about some option for an acting, as in in an absence, if that's an option, that gives us a
little tiny bit of extra.
PEGGY CATLIN: I wouldn't assume that. But let's consider that-DOUG TISDALE: No, I hear what you're saying. And I personally like the idea. But you're
going to have to go back to the full Board and get at least eight votes.
PEGGY CATLIN: Exactly. I know.
SHELLEY COOK: Plus, you've got the issue of whether one of the finalists is-- or not a finalist.
Sorry.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: One of the interim, or whatever, the acting person is applying.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Right. And if they're not, they may not be interested in being an
acting.
SHELLEY COOK: In for a couple weeks or something.
DOUG TISDALE: Because they would say, wait a minute. That's kind of jinxes me.
NATALIE MENTEN: And one more question. So then when the Board is sitting down-- you
have this January 2 or January 3, do we have that response, pretty short response that we got
from that applicant, one, their salary or salary range, two, their start date.

DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. That's going to be-BARBARA MCMANUS: If they've provided us. We've asked them for it. We asked them for it
as part of the-DOUG TISDALE: Letter of intent or interest.
NATALIE MENTEN: Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: And can I ask one question? I'd like to touch base by meeting if possible
sometime between now and the deadline, like a week from today or two weeks from today or
something like that, just to see if issues have cropped up-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: If we've got applicants.
SHELLEY COOK: If we got applicants, yeah, if we need to go out and knock on doors or what,
you know?
DOUG TISDALE: No, so we are in any event recognize that we have a meeting on January-- I'm
sorry-- December whatever. What's our Exec Committee? 19?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Executive Committee is next Thur-DOUG TISDALE: December 12. So we're December 12.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Oh, we can get an update then, right? OK, good, good.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. So I think we're already there. But it's a good thing to mention because
that will give us a chance to kind of take the pulse of the process Thursday next week, right?
BARBARA MCMANUS: And please, let me know if we think we have to have a specific and
non-general conversation. Because if we need an executive session-SHELLEY COOK: We need to have it noticed.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah. That would be preferred. And then we need to set up a-- this for the
interim. We need to set up another meeting to talk about the final.
DOUG TISDALE: We don't have the authority to do that. The Board didn't instruct the
Executive Committee to do that.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, just the interim.
PEGGY CATLIN: Just the interim. OK.

SHELLEY COOK: Judy sure would have liked that motion that got us going. And I think that
was [INAUDIBLE]
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, I just want to throw out there, too, that we're looking at January
2 and 3 to try to come up with a decision. The following Tuesday we'll have a new Executive
Committee. And this committee may or may not be disbanded.
SHELLEY COOK: Which is good point. So that's one reason for tying it to January 3 because
you can kind of complete our task here, as we are still this current committee. And then the
Board kind of takes over and decides what and whom then. So I think it works OK timing-wise.
But in terms of the permanent, I just felt there was a lot of sentiment for beginning to think about
that.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, I think we should because some of the processes are-- However
it's determined to move forward, It takes time.
SHELLEY COOK: It does.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I did find out from HR that the average amount of time for the AGM
hires that we've done has been between six and nine months.
DOUG TISDALE: And we know that we got Dave in nine months. We got Phil in a comparable
time trame.
BARBARA MCMANUS: 11 months.
DOUG TISDALE: 11 for Phil? OK. And what we've told people is four to 14. And nine is
exactly halfway between four and 14. And so nine to 10 is a pretty realistic estimate of what it
will take. But that really doesn't commence until we start it. And we haven't started it yet.
PEGGY CATLIN: We won't start it until after the 7th.
DOUG TISDALE: It'll be the first thing that I think the Board has to address after January 7.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Right. And just as a reference of commitment, there were 28 General
Managers Search Committee Meetings. And they were all held during the day, not that they have
to be. But that's the amount that they took. And then there also is a pretty rigorous outreach plan
that has commitments from each of the Board members in their districts as well.
SHELLEY COOK: So one of the first decisions we'll make is whether, and then finally, if we
decide to, which search firm. Can we get some idea of what they do as a way of getting ourselves
acquainted with their services. What kinds of things?
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, I talked to Brian about that, and they have a list of about 15 or
something that they would cast a broad net. I referenced the fact that I've been through this one
search that was really well done. And so I went back in my records. And they have shifted.

BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah. You want to add someone-PEGGY CATLIN: Well, they shifted their focus from governmental and transportation, which
they had done Texas, and Missouri, and some other states. They have now shifted their focus to
the health care industry.
DOUG TISDALE: So they're not interested.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: What is the salary or the range to paying for that service?
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, we paid $140,000.
BARBARA MCMANUS: No, we paid $104 of the $110,000 contract the last time.
DOUG TISDALE: But that was just for the search firm because then the total came up to $250
or something.
PEGGY CATLIN: Because we had a strategic advisory firm, which happened to be CRL. I'm not
sure that we would want to do that. But I have a couple of thoughts about that. But we can talk
about that.
DOUG TISDALE: I was going to say, that really is-- yeah, that's a January discussion. I don't
want to Board thinking that we're somehow supporting.
PEGGY CATLIN: We will likely have a new GMOC Committee Head.
BARBARA MCMANUS:JEFF WALKER: Well, I would like to propose this. Just because of all
of these processes being so labor intensive-- and I'm not thinking about my office, I'm thinking
about the Board members as well-- that whoever is determined to be the General Manager
Search Committee is also the GMOC Committee because they will become more intimate with
the person coming on and the interim person, that they would be able to follow them because
they will be evaluated. If they are only here for four months, then it won't matter that much, and
then we'll only be evaluating the permanent person for whatever amount of time that they're
there.
PEGGY CATLIN: I completely agree. That was sort of where I was headed when I said we're
going to have a new GMOC Head...Chair. And so that, a minimum needs to be a person
involved. And that does beg the question if we want to extend a more direct invitation to Bob
Broom for the remainder of this year.
DOUG TISDALE: Well, by default, he's Chair through December 31. And on January 7, the
Board will decide who they want as an Exec Committee, and the Chair decides-PEGGY CATLIN: I know that. I'm just saying that he is still head of the GMOC. He's the Chair.
DOUG TISDALE: Absolutely, yeah.

PEGGY CATLIN: And as a courtesy for the next couple meetings, do we want to make a special
invitation to him for input?
SHELLEY COOK: It wasn't part of this.
PEGGY CATLIN: It wasn't part of that, but just for input.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, yeah. That's fine. The one question is whether anybody-- I've heard the
sentiment expressed that maybe people want the GMOC to be a committee of the whole. So we
haven't taken that up. I don't even know if it's something that we will take up. But just for what
it's worth, that may be a topic of discussion.
DOUG TISDALE: No, I hear you.
SHELLEY COOK: And so, OK, just putting that-PEGGY CATLIN: [INAUDIBLE]
DOUG TISDALE: No, that's a bylaw change that we'd have to process.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And that decision would have to be made pretty quickly as well
because the retreat, the Board Retreat is February.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: All right, so the question is in terms of this process, it's great to explore these
other topics too. But I want to make sure that we actually are all satisfied that we've all-- because
you had a list of concerns. And I think we've addressed them pretty much. And I just want to
make sure that everybody feels that we've addressed every question or concern or issue that they
have.
PEGGY CATLIN: I did-- well, this isn't for this committee to decide, but I did get an email from
Director Williams who says no money spent on an executive search firm. We feel we could do
that in-house. I politely disagree. I think that the reach of an executive search firm is far greater
than our HR Department.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: But not for the interim.
DOUG TISDALE: That's going to be an issue for the Board to talk about in January.
SHELLEY COOK: One reason I was interested in knowing their scope of work and if it varies
cross firms, I really think that the idea-- this came from Angie's friend-- that we kind of get a sort
of a common sense or a common understanding of where we think we need to go with a GM, for
a permanent GM. I think that's time well spent. And that may shift what we think in terms of our
need for an executive committee, or the type of executive committee-- or I mean--

PEGGY CATLIN: Executive search firm.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, that's why I said I did a little bit of research on the one that had done a
great job for me in 2013. But it's no longer relevant because they're going where the industry's
going, which is health care.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Right. And I can't remember what Brian said the timing was getting
one on Board. But I think-PEGGY CATLIN: He said it was six to eight weeks.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Six to eight weeks.
DOUG TISDALE: To get them signed up and on. Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: And he's ready, willing, and able to do it whenever we give the direction.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well we have all our RFPs ready, ready to review whenever we have
someone to review them.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, as soon as we do it. And that's great. Again, that's borrowing work. Is
this work done? That's what I want to know. Are you all satisfied with-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm good with this plan.
PEGGY CATLIN: I'm good with this.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think it's thorough. I really appreciate it. And I'm excited to
start sending it out because I have started receiving phone calls of people who are interested.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, so have we.
DOUG TISDALE: And so we talked yesterday. And thank you all for your flexibility. And it
was a hard call. And that's why I absolutely picked up the phone and called Peggy first and said,
OK, are you happy with doing this tomorrow?
PEGGY CATLIN: The other option was tomorrow afternoon, or tomorrow. And I said, I have
tickets to the Monet exhibit with an out-of-town guest. I've got [INAUDIBLE].
DOUG TISDALE: Yes. Director Menten, any final thoughts? Questions?
NATALIE MENTEN: Yes. So first of all, on the job description-PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, we're labeling that "current".

NATALIE MENTEN: One edit.
DOUG TISDALE: "Existing" is the word we used.
NATALIE MENTEN: One edit that I don't think has been edited is in the second paragraph of
"description of work," it shows 2,600 employees.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I think that's low.
NATALIE MENTEN: That should be edited. We're right now, approximately 2,863.
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
PEGGY CATLIN: Approximately 286-DOUG TISDALE: And what we can do is because, again, the job description was approved by
the Board. We cannot unilaterally change this. That said-- no, no-- that said, we can do bracket
current estimate 2,863. We can add that as a bracket.
NATALIE MENTEN: That'll be fine. Also then on the news release, knowing how people read
things-- and we would hope that somebody applying for general manager would read this very
thoroughly-- but might I suggest that on the paragraph that says candidates should submit a letter
of interest, that it is restated just once more, candidates for interim?
DOUG TISDALE: That's a nice touch.
NATALIE MENTEN: And I only say that because your ending paragraph on "The Board of
Directors plans to pursue a national nationwide recruitment for a permanent general manager,"
there is just a possibility that somebody could-DOUG TISDALE: Think that somehow this is their-- yeah, no.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yeah, so I would only suggest that to the Board. Then one last item, the
header on this press release, an eight-footer still has 1600 Blake Street.
DOUG TISDALE: You know, the interesting-PEGGY CATLIN: And also, discuss applications January 2 now.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, that's right.
SHELLEY COOK: And are we presenting the applications received? So discuss the recruitment
process and present the applications received?
DOUG TISDALE: Yes. And we already had the word "present".

PEGGY CATLIN: To the Board on January 2. To address the Natalie's comment about "the
RTD Board of Directors plans to pursue", you might want to say "subsequently the RTD Board
of Directors plans to pursue a nationwide recruitment".
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE:The other thing I'm wondering is if we shouldn't-- I'm sorry,
candidates for interim, that interim be like italicized or something so that it pops a little bit more.
DOUG TISDALE: Well, that's the comment I was going to make. It's a bit of an intelligence test
for candidates, too, to see if they can read.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, that's true.
NATALIE MENTEN: And really depending on our intelligence-- They really applied for interim
when [INAUDIBLE].
DOUG TISDALE: I have no objection to including this. But I really do wonder, do you want a
person who can't tell the difference? But it's your call.
PEGGY CATLIN: Do you have enough to go on for this?
BARBARA MCMANUS: We're adding second paragraph on page two in its entirety.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. And then to the extent you update this, can you get it back out to us,
and/or the Board can get-BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah.
SHELLEY CATLIN: OK, cool.
DOUG TISDALE: Yes, indeed. OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I am wondering about languages for the press release, like
sending it to Telemundo and those places.
SHELLEY COOK: It should be translated?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, you know, I don't know, just as an outreach kind of thing.
Let me think about that, because clearly-BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, if there's any emails you wanted us to forward it to, just add
them with the rest that you want. It's not a big deal.
DOUG TISDALE: That's a very good point. Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: This was fun.

SHELLEY COOK: Thank you, everybody.
DOUG TISDALE: Well, you guys did a great job. We set aside two hours, and it's been less than
an hour and a half. And that's why I wanted to just keep bringing us back to-- Let's get this work
done.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, this work has been crafted, so--.
DOUG TISDALE: So thank you all very much. And again, on that point, any names you want to
make sure are circulated, just get it to her, and we'll do it. All right, so-PEGGY CATLIN: Do you want to set salary expectations, [INAUDIBLE] upload resume
[INAUDIBLE] salary expectations.
DOUG TISDALE: Salary range expectations.
PEGGY CATLIN: So this is the-DOUG TISDALE: The attachment to your agenda.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHELLEY COOK: And if somebody says-BARBARA MCMANUS: Oh, to the schedule?
DOUG TISDALE: No, look at page two of your agenda.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Oh, yeah. That's what I [INAUDIBLE] the second page.
PEGGY CATLIN: Upload resume, letter of interesting, salary range expectations.
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
SHELLEY COOK: And so just to be clear too, if somebody says to be determined, or they're
evasive or something, I don't want to rule them out on that basis, on that small basis.
DOUG TISDALE: Remember, this committee's not ruling out anybody. This committee is not
ruling out anybody. This committee will offer recommendations if it chooses. We're not ruling
out anybody.
SHELLEY COOK: In terms of your screening, I don't want anything ruled out because it doesn't
sort of in particular meet any of these, OK? So it all comes to us.

BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, like I said, I'll tell them that you don't want it to be that
stringent. I'll see what they come up with. We'll look at it. Maybe on Thursday, maybe I can get
him to get it done by Thursday. And then we can figure out where we need to go from there.
SHELLEY COOK: But generally, they would all come to us. And whether we decide they're
qualified or don't meet all the qualifications will be based upon those criteria.
DOUG TISDALE: That's right. But everything comes to the full Board.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, exactly.
DOUG TISDALE: If somebody submits something on the back of a brown paper sack, it's going
to get distributed to the whole Board, everything.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, thank you, Chair.
JEFF WALKER: And anybody can make an argument for any candidate, even if it's not
[INAUDIBLE].
BARBARA MCMANUS: Anybody who sends it to the email address that we've set up, they're
going to get a thank you receipt.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, good.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So they'll know that we have received it. Down on my-PEGGY CATLIN: We might have to test that.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Down at the front desk, when they receive something, they timestamp
it.
DOUG TISDALE: We've already talked about that, because there are going to be people who
say, well, I thought I just could pass it on there. Timestamp it and have it brought upstairs.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
DOUG TISDALE: All right, for the sake of this record, then as of 5:53-BARBARA MCMANUS: 4:53.
DOUG TISDALE: I'm sorry, 4:53. Thank you. I thought we were running late. 4:53PM on this
date we adjourn the Executive Committee Meeting. Thank you all very much.

SHELLEY COOK: Thank you.
