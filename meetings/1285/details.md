#### 1. 2013 - 006 : RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF UNIFORM SALES TAX

Chair Anderson called for a motion to approve the resolution No___ Series of 2013, Resolution I support of Uniform Sales Tax

Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to approve the resolution in support of Uniform Sales Tax.

Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Menten asked for clarification on the procedure relative to calling a Special Board meeting.  Marla Lien, legal counsel stated that a Special Board meeting can be called by the Chair of the Board or by 3 Board members in writing.  A Special Board meeting must be noticed at least 24 hours in advance and posted.  This specific Special Board meeting did meet this requirement.

Director Walker noted a couple of typographical errors which will be corrected before the resolution is signed.

Director Daly stated his support and shared that Eric Hansen had testified before the committee in favor of this bill.  He also stated that it passed Committee 8-4.

Director Sisk thanked all of the Board members for their support and stated his belief that this bill will simplify and take the complexity out of the sales tax process and allow RTD to get its fair share.  He stated that this bill is being sponsored by Hullingshorst in the House and Steadman in the Senate.  He stated this represents a true partnership.  The question has been asked of RTD “what can you do to help yourself at home?”  Well, this bill is one of those things we are doing to help ourselves to generate more funds.

Director Menten inquired about the authority to dedicate the funding to the northwest.  This is a forever tax increase which does not sunset.  It will have a negative impact on people who are already struggling.  How do we determine where this money is going and what is our priority?

General Manager Washington reminded the Board that in December, they had approved the Risk Allocation Matrix which identified 8 items staff was looking at to move forward the build out of FasTracks.  This RAM identified 3 of the items that are now stated in this resolution.  The Board authorized staff to pursue the Parity bill.  He stated that is how we can insure the funds will be spent in the north by putting it in writing.  Staff will come back to the Board to award a contract; what they have tried to do in this resolution is to provide a level of flexibility that will allow the market to be creative in their approach to leveraging money.

Director Hoy stated that he testified before the House Representative Committee. He perceived a sense of fairness and this allows RTD and the state to be aligned in how they collect sales tax.  He stated that the Downtown Denver Chamber is in favor of this bill also.

Director Deadwyler stated she had many challenges with this bill.  We are relying on politicians to tell us what to do when they do not have a pulse on the community.  When she looks at her corridor in Five Points, she sees her corridor being put last in this priority which affects those transit dependent people who can least afford it.  We are wanting to impose taxes and we need to re-consider this position.  She took the north tour this afternoon and what struck her were the farmlands, scarcity and lack of population density along this corridor. If density is one of the factors that we look at, she does not understand why this corridor has moved up in priority. We need to be thinking more clearly in terms of equity.  The African American community continues to be left behind and taken advantage of because they have no voice in these type of decisions being made.  She cannot support this resolution.

Director Daly pointed out that this bill just extends to candy and pop.  It does not affect things more substantive or life blood.

Chair Anderson stated her support for this uniform sales tax resolution.  She believes it is more uniform for the small mom & pop businesses who can now complete one form for taxes versus the different ones they are currently providing.

Vote on the Motion:              The motion passed eleven in favor (Anderson, Bagley, Daly, Folska, Hoy, James, Lasater, Lubow, Sisk, Tobiassen and Walker and 2 against( Deadwyler and Menten).  Directors Rivera-Malpiede and Solano had left early.

Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. 2013 Resolution - 006 Resolution in Support of Uniform Sales Tax

### D. Other Matters

- Chair Anderson shared that she had attended the WIN media event that morning and congratulated Director Deadwyler and Rivera-Malpiede for their role in promoting this program.

- Chair Anderson shared that Director Folska has been selected as one of the 12 Colorado Women of Influence by the Denver Post.  The Board extends its congratulations to Director Folska.

- Director Bagley stated that he also attended the WIN event.  What was impressive to him is the number of staff and media who were involved in this event.  What he thinks is important as a major part of FasTracks is being an economic development engine for this region that also impacts the full Front Range, state and other states in proximity to Colorado.  We are putting people to work and they are getting jobs.

- Director Bagley stated that as he makes presentations in various communities (i.e. Highlands Ranch, St. Andrews, etc) he includes a slide in his presentation about the WIN program and how this program is in partnership with other employers in this area.

- Director Lubow wanted to underscore that Director Folska was honored in the Denver Post.  She felt this was a great honor for Director Folska and RTD and asked if staff might consider doing a press release.

- Director Menten referenced the polling by the Board office on changing the start time for meeting from 5:30 to 5:00 p.m.  She stated that she was not in favor as a number of her constituents work from 8-5 p.m. and would not be able to get here.  She estimates that for every 1 person who speaks at public participation, there are another 20 who could not get here but had something they would like to say.  She believes this will create an unnecessary hardship for our constituents.

Paula Perdue shared that of the 8 Directors who had responded, 2 had stated they were OK with the time change but indicated some concerns and 1 had indicated not in favor. The others were good for the change.

### E. Adjourn
