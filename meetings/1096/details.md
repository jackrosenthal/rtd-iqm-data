#### 1. Rocky Mountain Performance Excellence Award

Kim Griffith, Executive Director of Rocky Mountain Excellence Award announced that RTD received the 2012 Rocky Mountain Performance Excellence Award at the Timberline Level for the FasTracks Program.  She mentioned that they have a very rigorous process and RTD earned this award.

Director Cohen congratulated Rick Clarke and the entire FasTracks team, as this award represents a commitment to excellence and the rigorous review process really shows the caliber of staff at RTD.

Director Gore asked if there are other levels.  Ms. Griffith stated that the highest level is the Peak Award and the RTD staff stated that they are working to achieve that level.  Having the outside perspective gives them the feedback they need to improve.

General Manager Washington thanked the staff and the RTD Board as this is a total team effort.  He also mentioned that the completion of the FasTracks program is what is driving the staff.

Director McMullen stated that he appreciated that award and seeing FasTracks working.

#### 2. Patton Boggs Annual Federal Update

Kevin O’Neil introduced himself and the Patton Boggs team.  RTD has a lot to be proud of and his team looks forward to working with the newly elected Board members.

Mr. O’Neil reviewed the major RTD successes which include $1.03 billion Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) for Eagle P3 among others listed in the presentation.  He stated that this is a very impressive display of success and that RTD has achieved these milestones while implementing the only successful public-private partnership for Eagle P3 which resulted in RTD receiving the World Finance Award.

RTD is also committed to workforce development through the WIN program which was recognized by the White House under the “Champions of Change” initiative.  This is very significant as it might become one of the signature initiatives of the Obama administration.

The key elements for RTD’s success have been a unified government support and being able to advocate as a region. RTD also meets or exceeds ridership projections and maintains a strong base system.  The exceptional staff relationships with FTA, strong labor relations and having comprehensive plan for the region contribute to RTD’s success.

Jared Fleisher provided an overview of the Moving Ahead Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) which was enacted by President Obama on July 6th, 2012.  This includes a two year reauthorization at current level plus inflation which will expire on September 30th, 2014.  The act transfers $22 billion into the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) to cover the funding gap.  This shows the importance of transportation infrastructure.

It eliminates most discretionary programs and expands formula programs.  What this means to RTD is that it eliminates bus and bus facilities grant programs.  Patton Boggs has worked with RTD to secure grants under this program.  It also combines remaining bus funds with rail modernization funds to create a new “State of Good Repair” formula program; this eliminates legacy earmarks and provides more funding for newer systems.  Ultimately the state of Colorado and RTD receive the same amount of funding but receive guaranteed funding instead of the “ups and downs” of discretionary grants.

In 2012, Colorado Transit Funding received $89 million based on formula funding and $14 million in discretionary bus grants for a total of $103 million in 2012.  Under MAP-21, Colorado Transit Funding will receive $103.9 million in formula funding for 2013 and $105.4 million in formula funding for 2014.

RTD received $48.3 million in Urbanized Area Formula, $7.4 million for Bus and Bus Facilities Discretionary/Formula Program and 6.8 million in Rail Modernization/State of Good Repair for a total of $62.5 million in 2012.  Under MAP-21 RTD would receive $48.8, $4.4 and 8.5 million for a total of $61.7 million for 2013 and $49.5, $4.5 and $8.6 for a total of $62.6 million in 2014.  The amount is constant; what changes is the way it is calculated; it’s a flat rate.

MAP-21 creates new transit oriented development (TOD) pilot programs which provides a potential funding source for TOD planning along RTD’s new transit corridors.  It also expands TIFIA programs which provide financing opportunities for RTD; however, they are subject to RTD’s revenue and debt constraints.  RTD needs to leverage the money through this new program.  MAP-21 also streamlines the NEPA process which was designed to accelerate project delivery to save money and time.  West Corridor and Eagle P3 should qualify for this.

MAP-21 is what we wanted from RTD’s perspective.

Anne Miano thanked the Board for working with Patton Boggs and stated that it helped to make their work in Washington, D.C. easier.  RTD has become a model for transit authorities and is very well known for what it is doing.  RTD is being studied all over the country.  She thanked the Board members that are leaving and mentioned that Patton Boggs will need the support from the incoming members as the new legislative agenda is developed.  MAP-21 expires September 30, 2014.  At that time Congress will have to reauthorize MAP-21 and determine how to pay for it.

RTD’s priorities will be to avoid program cuts and preserve dedicated transit funding.  A priority is also to ensure that RTD and Colorado get their fair share of transit funding, streamline the new starts process and maintain eligibility for BRT projects that do not use bus-only lanes.

With regard to the impact of the election, Congressman Bill Shuster has been elected Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure (HT&I) committee and has expressed his desire to stabilize the HT&I with long-term dedicated revenue.  Kevin mentioned that it is important to bring him to the Denver area as soon as possible.  It will be interesting to see how things shape up.  Soon after the election, many politicians started to cut the deals they needed.  A lot of insiders are frustrated because only some of the stakeholders are present in the negotiations.

With regard to the “Fiscal Cliff” Anne stated that in order to avoid the fiscal cliff Congress must act quickly.  If sequestration happens it will not impact highway trust funds programs; however, it would impact new start programs.  She mentioned that they expect a deal will be achieved, which will probably set the framework for fiscal reform and include spending cuts this year.  The federal transportation program is funded mainly by the gas tax which has been set at a fixed 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993.  This tax has declined due to more fuel efficient vehicles on the road, which has created a $15 billion funding gap per year.

If nothing happens, taxes will go up and sequestration will happen automatically.  As late as this afternoon the President did not accept the counteroffer that House Speaker Boehner had offered.  Anne stated that her team tends to believe that some solution or agreement will happen in December.

On revenue, whatever deal they put together 2013 will be the most aggressive in terms of fiscal reform.  The Simpson-Bowles proposal would raise the gas tax and allocated 100% of that revenue for transportation funding.

The key issues and priorities for RTD include avoiding cuts to the new starts program as part of the resolution to the fiscal cliff; advocate for funding for the Eagle P3 in FY2013; and in case of programs cuts, RTD will need to prioritize projects such as Eagle P3 that are more advanced in the FFGA process.

With regard to new starts funding, Patton Boggs will work with Congressional Delegation and FTA to lay the groundwork and make the case for continued investment in the Denver region.

Patton Boggs believe that RTD’s projects are very well set up.  They think that for the P3 project, since it is the only one in the country, a case can be made in order to have Congress find the money to finance it.

Patton Boggs plans to look at any programs that have some carry over funds and make sure that RTD’s programs are in line for those funds.

Director Bagley thanked them for the presentation and asked what the timing is to know if the $150 million appropriations for 2013 will be available.  Kevin stated that Congress has negotiated a lot of the bills, but they can’t determine the transportation part due to the fiscal cliff.  One of the elements of the present plans is that they include $150 million of infrastructure.  Patton Boggs will have a good sense of where we are headed once they achieve a deal at the end of December.  There are three possible outcomes.  First they hope to get the whole amount RTD was expecting for the Eagle P3 project.  The worst case scenario would be RTD getting about $12-15 million less than then was originally planned for.  Mid outcome would be that once they have the agreement they will sit down and figure out how to allocate the money.  The completion of the appropriation process is done in the spring.

Director Malpiede asked about the relationship with Secretary LaHood and if he is staying.  Kevin stated that the staff like him but it is unclear at this point; he might want to go back to Illinois and run for office there.  There have been some names thrown in the mix.  Among them is the Mayor of LA, the former Governor of Pennsylvania, Ed Rendell, and Chuck Hagel, the former Nebraska Senator.

Director O’Boyle asked if MAP-21 keeps the amount of funding the same but increases the number of organizations that are eligible.  Jared stated that a realistic view is that they did expand eligibility.  For MAP-21 they look at agency reputation and how much money the agency brings to the table.  Anne explained that MAP-21 is one account that is not allocated between funds. This also takes away some of the competitors for FasTracks.  The set of core projects that benefit New York and Chicago also benefit Denver.

Director Gore asked how the national sales tax for internet sales will be collected.  Kevin stated that internet has exploded and brick and mortar companies feel that they are at a disadvantage.  They are working on getting a standard system for states to collect; RTD will need to figure out how to get its fair share.  Director Gore also asked if with regard to the $0.15 increase on gas tax if there is a different tax for diesel and mentioned that Colorado is also considering a $0.10 increase which would make it a $0.25 increase and asked if RTD’s budget prepared to handle that.  Jared stated that the gas tax has been the most difficult item for the government politically; they have not been able to raise the gas tax since 1993.  Some congressmen will probably vote for the Simpson-Bowles since they would not be voting for tax increase directly.  Many Republicans would rather go into the cliff to avoid having to vote for tax increases.

Director McMullen thanked them for the work they have done.  He mentioned to the newly elected Board members that when they go to Washington in March the Patton Boggs team will be organized and prepared.  He asked the Patton Boggs group how well they know Congressman Schuster.  Kevin stated that they had a relationship with him before he came to office.  They supported his campaign and his Deputy Chief of Staff worked closely with Jared and Kevin.  They know him well and respect him.  He jumped the ladder very quickly and jumped over many others with more seniority and received their support.  He will be bi-partisan in his approach.  They would want to have him here for the ribbon cutting in the spring.

Director Daly asked what sequestration is.  Kevin stated that when the needed to address the deficit line and cut a deal to raise the credit line they created a super committee.  With regard to the fiscal cliff, if that super committee fails the sequestration process happens and cuts will be made across the board.  Sequestration will cut half of the defense side but it cannot affect manpower or veterans which leaves research and medical accounts.  The other 50% comes from domestic discretionary expenditures.  Everything is in there; transportation is largely in there except for new starts.  On January 1, if nothing happens we could be looking about 10% in cuts for the rest of the year from every program and account.   There are several other scenarios like “kick the can down the road” which creates a framework form.

Director Daly thanked them for their presentation and stated that he looks forward to seeing them in March.
