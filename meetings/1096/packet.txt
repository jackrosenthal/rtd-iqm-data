2.2.a

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

Overview
• On July 6, 2012, President Obama signed into
law the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st
Century Act (MAP-21)
– Two year reauthorization at current levels plus
inflation
– Expires September 30, 2014
– Transfers $22 billion into the Highway Trust Fund
(HTF) to cover the funding gap, and completely
exhausts the HTF
– One of the most significant pieces of legislation
enacted this past Congress, demonstrating the
importance of transportation infrastructure

Packet Pg. 17

2.2.a

MAP-21 Provision
• Reforms and
streamlines the
New Starts
process

Significance for RTD
• Expedites the New Starts process by
eliminating / consolidating phases
• Removes the ratings requirement for
approval to enter the process
• Creates a new category for projects that
add capacity to existing lines
• Preserves Small Starts eligibility for BRT
projects that do not operate in a dedicated
right of way
• Creates a pilot program with greater
flexibility for projects that use innovative
approaches
• Ultimately, MAP-21 provides for a faster
process but expands eligibility, likely
increasing competition

Highlights of MAP-21: New Starts

2.2.a

MAP-21 Provision
• Eliminates most
discretionary
programs and
expands formula
programs

Significance for RTD
•

Eliminates Bus and Bus Facilities grant programs
and replaces them with smaller formula program
Ø We worked with RTD to secure significant
grants under this program over the past few
years, expecting it to be formularized

•

Combines remaining bus funds with Rail
Modernization funds to create a new State of Good
Repair formula program
Ø New program ends legacy earmarks, providing
more funding for newer systems

•

Ultimately, Colorado and RTD receive essentially
the same amount of funding, but receive
guaranteed funding instead of the “ups and downs”
of discretionary grants

Core RTD Priorities

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

Summary: Core RTD Priorities
MAP-21

• Avoid program cuts and preserve
dedicated transit funding
• Make sure that RTD and Colorado get
their fair share of transit funding
• Streamline the New Starts process
• Maintain Small Starts eligibility for BRT
projects that do not use a bus-only lane

Packet Pg. 23

2.2.a

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

The Next Reauthorization
• MAP-21 is a two-year bill. The next Congress
will have to reauthorize or extend MAP-21
• The fundamental issue remains the financing
question, i.e., how to pay for it
– The federal surface transportation program is funded
primarily through the gas tax, which is set at a fixed 18.4
cents per gallon
– The gas tax has not been increased since 1993
– Gas tax revenue has steadily declined as cars have
become more fuel efficient, resulting in what is now a
~$15 billion funding gap per year

Packet Pg. 24

2.2.a

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

The Short-Term Solution
• Since 2008, Congress has transferred $56 billion into the
Highway Trust Fund to maintain its solvency
– General Fund transfers break the link between the dedicated
user fee (the gas tax) and federal transportation spending
– This, in turn, threatens the special budgetary status of the
surface transportation program, such as having:
• Multi-year bills with guaranteed funding that do not have to
compete with other priorities in the appropriations process
• A “firewall” that keeps gas tax revenues solely for
transportation purposes
• An exemption from automatic spending cuts

• Continued General Fund transfers at this pace are ultimately
politically unsustainable

The Long-Term Problem

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

2.2.a

Implications of the Election, the
“Fiscal Cliff” and the Agenda
Ahead

Packet Pg. 27

2.2.a

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

The Fiscal Cliff
• Congress must act to avoid a “fiscal cliff” that
includes $503 billion in tax increases and
automatic spending cuts (“sequestration”) set to
take effect January 1st
• Sequestration would not impact Highway Trust
Fund programs but would impact the New Starts
program because it is funded from the General
Fund

Packet Pg. 28

The Fiscal Cliff
• Most observers believe there will be a deal to
avert the fiscal cliff
– Potential outcome is short-term deal combined with
framework for comprehensive fiscal reform in 113th
Congress
– Deal may include some spending cuts this year

• RTD’s priority is both to avoid “sequestration”
and avoid / minimize any New Starts cuts
resulting from fiscal cliff deal

2.2.a

2.2.a

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

Transportation Funding
• Congress will confront the HTF shortfall and
transportation funding in the context of a
comprehensive focus on fiscal issues
• Alternatives for the future of the surface
transportation program:
– Raise new revenue
– Cut the program
– “Kick the can down the road”

Packet Pg. 30

2.2.a

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

Transportation Funding
• Key questions:
– Will transportation funding be addressed as part of
comprehensive fiscal package?
• Many stakeholders believe that a comprehensive deal
offers the “political space” to reach a solution

– Within a larger package or on its own, what are the
options for raising revenue?
• Raise the gas tax?
• Tie transportation funding to new energy revenue?
• Use the “peace dividend”?
• Use revenue from tax reform, or other
non-transportation revenue?

Packet Pg. 31

2.2.a

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

The Impact of the Election
• Congressman Bill Shuster
(R-PA) will take over as
Chairman of the House
Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee
• MAP-21 largely settled policy
issues; focus is on the
revenue question

Packet Pg. 32

2.2.a

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

The Impact of the Election
• The election puts the elements in place for a
deal that increases revenue, rather than an
approach that cuts the program
– President Obama campaigned on infrastructure
investment
– Bi-partisan support for transportation investment in
the Senate
– Chairman Shuster has expressed his desire to
stabilize the HTF with long-term dedicated revenue
– Hurricane Sandy further reinforced importance of
transit infrastructure

Packet Pg. 33

2.2.a

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

The Impact of the Election
• Puts the focus squarely on solving the revenue gap
• But an extremely challenging question
– Gas tax has not been raised for 20 years
– Gas prices at near-record highs
– Complications with other revenue sources
• Ultimately, the current path is not sustainable and
“something has to give”
– Calls for continued engagement and vigilance by
stakeholder community

Key Issues and
Priorities for RTD
Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

2.2.a

Packet Pg. 35

Key Issues and Priorities:
New Starts Funding
• Avoid or minimize any cuts to the New Starts program as
part of the resolution to the “fiscal cliff”
• Advocate for full funding for the EAGLE P3 in FY2013
under the FFGA
– $150 million scheduled for FY2013
• If there are any program cuts, work to prioritize projects
such as the EAGLE P3 that are more advanced in the
FFGA process

2.2.a

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

Key Issues and Priorities:
New Starts Funding
• Work with the Congressional Delegation and FTA to
lay the groundwork and make the case for continued
investment in the Denver Region
– The slow growth in New Starts funding, combined
with increasing demand and reforms that expand
program eligibility, create new challenges in
competing for New Starts funds

Packet Pg. 37

2.2.a

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

Key Issues and Priorities:
FasTracks
• Continue to work with the Colorado Delegation as key
stakeholders in the FasTracks build-out
– I.e., Provide constant updates on Northwest Area
Mobility Study, progress on other FasTracks
corridors, etc.
• Monitor tax reform debate for potential revenue
implications
– I.e., Online Sales Tax legislation

Packet Pg. 38

Key Issues and Priorities:
Transportation Policy
• Represent RTD’s interests in MAP-21 implementation
and the New Starts rulemaking process
– Potential issue with calculation of ridership
• Advocate RTD’s policy priorities looking towards the next
reauthorization, with continued focus on the BRT
eligibility issue
• Ensure that RTD is a key player in the debate over the
future of the surface transportation program
