BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Regional Partnership Commitment to Ensure a Welcoming

Committee Meeting Date:
April 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
April 12, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2022, regarding the Board’s
commitment to regional stakeholder partnership to ensure that the transit-user experience across RTD’s
system is reflective of the agency’s mission of making lives better through connections.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Public transit reflects and is interwoven into the fabric of the communities it serves. Public spaces and
services throughout the Denver metro region, including those within Denver’s urban core, and in particular
Denver Union Station (DUS) and its bus concourse and surrounding areas, have recently been harshly
impacted by individuals engaging in unwanted activities, such as illicit drug use and the sale of those drugs,
vandalism and destruction of property, prolific littering, and acts of aggression and violence. These activities
have also significantly affected other RTD facilities and transit services, as well as customers and the frontline employees who perform the agency’s core function of transit service delivery.
Recognizing that RTD cannot solve these societal issues alone, in November 2021 the General Manager and
CEO, closely coordinating with then Board Chair Angie Rivera-Malpiede, the Chief of Police and Emergency
Management and Transit Security Division employees, began to explore novel strategies to address the
unwanted activities occurring at DUS and elsewhere.
The detection of trace amounts of fentanyl prompted the immediate closure of the public restrooms within
the DUS bus concourse in December 2021. In that same month, RTD established partnerships with external
entities to bolster existing police and security resources, which included:
• The Department of Homeland Security’s Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in its
deployment of Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response (VIPR) teams
• The Guardian Angels, a non-profit international volunteer organization of unarmed crime-prevention
personnel
In January 2022, the GM and CEO leveraging close coordination with the City and County of Denver
convened the “Reclaiming DUS” Steering Committee in conjunction with the Denver Police Department,
as well as the Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1001; RTD’s Chief Operations Officer; members of the
Transit Police Division; RTD then Chair Angie Rivera Malpiede; Denver Sheriff Department, senior
members of Denver Mayor Michael Hancock’s administration and other municipal departments with the
aim of holistically addressing the unwanted activities impacting Denver’s central core.
Since that time, the Denver Police Department with support from the Denver Sheriff Department as well
as RTD’s sworn police force, have increased arrests in the area of DUS. Further, the Denver City

Packet Pg. 3

4.A

Attorney’s office has been successful recently in securing area restrictions for individuals deemed to be
of serious concern, meaning that, once the restriction is issued for an individual, the person cannot
return to the DUS area without facing severe judicial consequences.
While these efforts have mitigated some of the challenges surrounding DUS, local jurisdictions cannot
arrest or enforce their way out of these issues. Coordinated public health and safety campaigns have
also been mobilized throughout Denver to assist those experiencing addiction, mental illness, and
homelessness. Compounding these challenges, though, is the fact that many of the individuals who are
contacted by these campaigns are not accepting of services. Further, these individuals are easily able to
obtain dangerous, inexpensive and addictive illegal drugs; recent legislative changes in Colorado have
made use and possession of these substances in an amount less than four grams a misdemeanor
offense. Those arrested are often released within a short amount of time, only to resume their illegal
drug use and other destructive behaviors soon thereafter.
In sum, there are no simple solutions to these complex challenges, and restoring a welcoming transit
environment and ensuring the safety and security of RTD’s employees and customers remain top
priorities throughout the 2,342 square-mile service area at facilities and aboard revenue vehicles.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action and the associated resolution, the agency strives to meet the
2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community Value and Customer Excellence. Recognizing the
importance of close collaboration and continual communication with representatives of the jurisdictions
within each Director’s respective district, the Board will endeavor to engage in stakeholder partnerships
to provide a welcoming transit environment throughout the region for RTD employees and customers, as
well as adjacent residents, business, and visitors, through the reduction of sales and use of illicit drugs
as well as aggressive and destructive behaviors by way of coordinated law enforcement, security, legal,
and social/health and human service efforts.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact relative to the adoption of this recommended action and the associated
resolution.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Board Position on SB22-180

Committee Meeting Date:
April 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
April 12, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt a support position on SB22-180, Concerning Programs to Reduce
Ground Level Ozone through Increased Use of Transit, as the bill was introduced.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2022 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
DISCUSSION
SB22-180 creates a grant program within the Colorado Energy Office for RTD and other Colorado transit
agencies to apply for funding to implement a minimum of 30 days fare-free transit service for all transit
services offered between June 1 and August 31. RTD is eligible to receive up to $11 million per year for
the ozone season in 2022 and 2023. RTD must provide 20% of the funding necessary to implement a
fare-free program for at least 30 days. If RTD implements a fare-free program using funding available
through SB22-180, the agency is required to submit a report on the use of the funds as well as
estimated ridership as compared to previous and subsequent months. Additionally, RTD will be audited
on the use of the funding during the regularly scheduled state performance audit in 2025.
Included in the Governor’s FY23 State Budget outline was $28 million for “Ozone Season Transit Fares.”
SB22-180 is the legislation to formalize the budget recommendation. Prior to the Governor’s budget
release, as part of the recommendations and culminating public discussion between staff and the RTD
Accountability Committee (committee), commitments were made to explore and utilize available federal
funding for a program similar to “Spare the Air Days” that was implemented in the San Francisco Bay
Area in 1991 up until 2008. Internally, staff convened a working group develop an implementation plan
for “Spare the Air Days” in response to the commitment the agency made to the committee. Due to
people power problems and larger societal issues that have created operating challenges for RTD, the
working group recommended a cautious, incremental approach to fare-free transit that expands over
time. This approach was not embraced by state and local leaders. The General Manager and CEO, in
partnership with the leadership team and in collaboration with leaders from the Amalgamated Transit
Union Local 1001, concurred that providing one month of fare-free service is an implementable approach
to exploring the potential benefits of a fare-free transit service delivery model with the commitment of
regional support to provide security and social/health and human services.

Packet Pg. 7

4.B

Limited data and research exist showing the outcomes of fare-free transit on large metropolitan transit
agencies, such as RTD, but studies do illustrate that ridership can increase as a result of offering farefree transit. Comprehensive research on the topic of fare-free transit conducted by the Transportation
Research Board (TRB) of the National Academies states that fare-free transit largely exists in smallurban/rural transit systems, resort or vacation destinations, universities or ski towns. As cited in the TRB
report, large urban transit systems do not adopt fare-free policies primarily due to farebox revenue
replacement challenges, whereas smaller transit agencies do not rely as heavily on such revenues to
fund operations. RTD’s financial constraints limit budgetary flexibility to fund programs such as a
potential fare-free initiative to encourage ridership. SB22-180 presents a unique opportunity to replace
fare revenue and experiment with fare-free transit in the region.
RTD staff recommends the Board of Directors support SB22-180 in alignment with RTD’s strategic
priority of Community Value. RTD has been encouraged by state leaders, local elected officials, and
stakeholders to support the Governor’s proposal to fund fare-free transit during Colorado’s ozone
season. Specifically, the Metro Mayors Caucus and the Boulder County Board of Commissioners have
issued letters in support of agency efforts to offer at least 30 days of fare-free transit service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
As currently written, SB22-180 requires a 20% match of the total cost to implement a fare-free program
as outlined in the bill. Should SB22-180 be signed into law, staff would prepare for the Board’s
consideration a recommended action regarding matching funds for the purposes of submitting a grant
application pursuant to the process detailed in SB22-180.

(a) Ground level ozone poses health risks to all Coloradans,

5

especially to vulnerable populations including the elderly, young children,

6

and people with asthma or other respiratory diseases;

7

(b) The negative effects of ozone exposure include pain when

13

Attachment: 2022a_180_01 (4636 : Board Position on SB22-180)

to provide at least 30 days of new or expanded free transit services during
ozone season. The RTD may use grant money to cover up to 80% of the
costs of providing free transit for at least 30 days on all services offered
by the RTD during ozone season. Eligible transit agencies and the RTD
can use the money to cover lost fare box revenues and to pay for other
expenses necessary to implement the program, including expenses
associated with an increase in ridership as a result of the program. The
RTD and a transportation association receiving a grant are required to
report to the office on the services offered and estimates of the change in
ridership as a result of the program.
The office is required to establish policies governing the program
and to report to the house and senate transportation committees by
December 31 of each year of the program. The program is repealed,
effective July 1, 2024.
The transit and rail division (division) in the department of
transportation is required to create a 3-year pilot project to extend
state-run transit services throughout the state with the goals of reducing
ground level ozone, increasing ridership, and reducing vehicle miles
traveled in the state. The division is required to report to the
transportation legislation review committee on the pilot project. The pilot
project is repealed, effective July 1, 2026.

(d) Ozone is one of the most common ambient air pollutants along
