Audit Plan
We identified the following areas during our brainstorming session related to
significant risks of misstatement:
•
•
•

Management override of controls
Proper recording of revenue, including accounting treatment for grant funding
received by RTD including accuracy and completeness of the Schedule of
Federal Awards (SEFA)
Risk related to management’s process for developing accounting estimates as it
relates to the net pension liability

In response to these identified significant risks, we will perform the following:
•

Testing of journal entries recorded in the general ledger and other adjustments
made in the preparation of the financial statements

•

Review for any significant fluctuations to revenue as well as assess whether
grant funding was spent in accordance with related agreements and that related
transactions are recorded correctly in the general ledger.

•

Test and assess the completeness of the SEFA in conjunction with the Single
Audit of Federal Awards and reconcile grant revenues to amounts recorded in
the financial statements

•

Review and obtain support for the inputs, methods and assumptions used by
management in arriving at the estimate related to the net pension liability

Audit Plan
• We will gain an understanding of accounting processes and key internal controls
through a review of the accounting procedures questionnaires and control
procedures questionnaires prepared by management.
• We will confirm through observation and inspection procedures that accounting
procedures and controls included in the questionnaires have been implemented.
• We will not express an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting; however, we will communicate to you significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses identified in connection with our audit.
• The concept of materiality is inherent in our work. We place greater emphasis
on those items that have, on a relative basis, more importance to the financial
statements and greater possibilities of material error than with those items of
lesser importance or those in which the possibility of material error is remote.

BACKGROUND
The Internal Audit Function Charter requires that:

each internal audit engagement at least quarterly. Internal audit results must also be

On May 31, 2023, the Board approved the Proposed 2023-2024 Internal Audit Plan, which
recommended audits to be undertaken through the end of 2024. Each proposed audit had been selected
in response to the results of the enterprise risk assessment.

Report Rating Definitions

Report ratings are utilized to communicate the aggregate compliance or risk observed for the in-scope location,
process, or system.

Satisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are generally in compliance with applicable policies and procedures. The design and
effectiveness of internal controls appear to be adequate. Exceptions noted were isolated and/or minor, and
departures from leading practices are minimal (as applicable).

Needs Improvement

The in-scope areas of the project, although generally in compliance with policies and procedures, have certain
deficiencies with the design or effectiveness of internal controls which should be improved. Some departures from
leading practices have been identified, creating opportunities for process or efficiency improvement or for improved
financial statement accuracy.

Unsatisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are in substantial non-compliance with policies and procedures, and the design or
effectiveness of internal controls is not adequate. Multiple and/or significant departures from leading practice may be
present, creating operational inefficiency. If such deficiencies are not corrected, the company can be exposed to loss
or financial misstatement.

1.F.2.a

Priority of Internal Audit Report Observations

Risk/Impact: Observation that presents a high risk to the agency and/or is of high importance to business success/achievement of goals. Conditions exist or
situations could occur which could have a significant adverse impact (i.e., financial, reputational, etc.) to the business. Significant audit observations may include
conditions dealing with irregularities, illegal acts, financial reporting errors, inefficiencies, waste, ineffectiveness, conflicts of interest, and control weaknesses. In
addition, an observation is considered High Priority if a finding creates a large exposure that could result in a loss of system control, access, application control,
and/or exposure of data via the compromise of administrative accounts and/or other system functions. It could also create an exposure of confidentiality or
integrity.

High Priority

Moderate Priority

The relevant risks associated with the observation may be considered high due to one or more of the following conditions:
• Significant financial impact for location/site audited
• Prevalence of issues or exceptions
• Circumvention of controls, Management wrong-doing and/or willful disregard of company policy or regulatory requirements
• Non-compliance with US/Local laws or regulations
• Disruption to operations and/or significant reputational exposures
• Unremediated previously identified control observations or a history of similar issues, although minor, may be considered a high priority
classification.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective action is required within three months, or other time period deemed reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.
Risk/Impact: The observation in the report relates to ineffective or insufficient controls to manage key business risks. The risks associated could lead to financial
statement errors and losses, operational inefficiencies (including financial system and IT issues), or result in instances of policy and regulatory non-compliance as
well as potential reputational damages, fines, and penalties.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective actions should be implemented within the next six months, or other time period deemed reasonable by both Management and
Internal Audit.

Low Priority /
Process
Improvement

Risk/Impact: Other findings identified during fieldwork that are isolated or minor control gaps for business cycles not in-scope for the audit, observations to
improve financial and/or operational efficiency, or are designed to assist management in improving the operating capacity of the department and/or activity.
These recommendations do not impact the overall rating.
Urgency of Action Plan: While not necessarily a priority, corrective action should occur within the next 12 months.
