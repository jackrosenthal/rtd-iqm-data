Internal Audit Function Charter

The Internal Audit Function is an independent and objective assurance and consulting function that is guided by
a philosophy of adding value to improve the operations of the Regional Transportation District (RTD). The Internal
Audit Function assists RTD in accomplishing its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to
evaluate and improve the effectiveness of RTD's governance, risk management, and internal control.

PURPOSE:
The purpose of the Internal Audit Function is to strengthen the Regional Transportation District’s ability to create,
protect, and sustain value by providing the RTD Board of Directors and RTD Executive Leadership Team with
independent, risk-based, and objective assurance, advice, insight, and foresight.
The Internal Audit Function enhances:
•

Successful achievement of its strategic goals.

•

Governance, risk management, and control processes.

•

Decision-making and oversight.

•

Reputation and credibility with its stakeholders.

•

Ability to serve the public interest.

RTD’s Internal Audit Function is most effective when:
•

Internal auditing is performed by competent professionals in conformance with The IIA’s Global Internal
Audit Standards, which are set in the public interest.

•

The Internal Audit Function is independently positioned with direct accountability to the RTD Board
Directors’ Audit Committee (Audit Committee).

•

Internal auditors are free from undue influence and committed to making objective assessments.

RTD’s Internal Audit Function will adhere to the professional requirements of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, Global Internal Audit Standards, best practice guidelines, and any applicable public
transportation regulatory requirements.

AUTHORITY:
The Internal Audit Function, with strict accountability for confidentiality and safeguarding of records and information,
is authorized full, free, and unrestricted access to any and all RTD records, physical properties, and personnel
pertinent to carrying out any engagement. All RTD employees must assist the Internal Audit Function in fulfilling its
roles and responsibilities. The Internal Audit Function and Chief Audit Executive (CAE) have direct access to the Audit
Committee and the Board.
The Internal Audit Function’s authority is created by its direct reporting relationship to the Audit Committee. Such
authority allows for unrestricted access to the Board.

INTRODUCTION:

1.D.1.a

Subject: Internal Audit Function Charter
Page 2

INDEPENDENCE:

Internal auditors must not have direct operational responsibility or authority over any of the activities audited.
Accordingly, internal auditors must not implement internal controls, develop procedures, install systems, prepare
records, or engage in any other activity that may impair the internal auditors’ judgment.
Internal auditors must exhibit the highest level of professional objectivity in gathering, evaluating, and communicating
information about the activity or process being examined. Internal auditors must make a balanced assessment of all
the relevant circumstances and not be unduly influenced by their own interests or by others in forming judgments.
The CAE must confirm to the Audit Committee, at least annually, the organizational independence of the Internal
Audit Function. If the governance structure changes in a way that does not support organizational independence,
the CAE will document the characteristics of the governance structure limiting independence and any safeguards
employed to achieve the principle of independence. The CAE will disclose to the Audit Committee any interference
internal auditors encounter related to the scope, performance, or communication of internal audit work and
results. The disclosure will include communicating the implications of such interference on the Internal Audit
Function’s effectiveness and ability to fulfill its mandate.

ORGANIZATION:
The CAE will be positioned at a level in the organization that enables internal audit services and responsibilities
to be performed without interference from management, thereby establishing the independence of the Internal
Audit Function.
The CAE will report functionally to the Audit Committee of the Board and administratively (for example, day-today operations) to RTD’s General Manager and Chief Executive Officer (GM/CEO).

OVERSIGHT:
To establish, maintain, and ensure that RTD’s Internal Audit Function has sufficient authority to fulfill its duties,
the Audit Committee, subject to Board approval, will:
•

Discuss with the CAE and RTD Executive Leadership Team the appropriate authority, role, responsibilities,
scope, and services (assurance and/or advisory) of the Internal Audit Function.

•

Ensure the CAE has unrestricted access to and communicates and interacts directly with the Audit
Committee.

•

Participate in discussions with the CAE and RTD Executive Leadership Team about the “essential
conditions,” described in the Global Internal Audit Standards, which establish the foundation that enables
an effective Internal Audit Function.

•

Review and approve the Internal Audit Charter annually with the CAE to consider changes affecting the
organization, such as the employment of a new chief audit executive or changes in the type, severity, and
interdependencies of risks to the organization; and approve the internal audit charter annually.

•

Approve the risk-based Internal Audit Plan.

•

Ensure there is sufficient budget to reasonably fulfill the Internal Audit Function’s objectives during the calendar

The Internal Audit Function must remain free from interference by any party in RTD regarding matters of audit
selection, scope, procedures, frequency, timing, or report content to permit maintenance of a necessary independent
and objective mental attitude.

CHIEF AUDIT EXECUTIVE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Ethics and Professionalism
The CAE will ensure that internal auditors:
•

Conform with the Global Internal Audit Standards, including the principles of Ethics and Professionalism:
integrity, objectivity, competency, due professional care, and confidentiality.

•

Understand, respect, meet, and contribute to the legitimate and ethical expectations of the organization
and be able to recognize conduct that is contrary to those expectations.

•

Encourage and promote an ethics-based culture in the organization.

•

Report organizational behavior that is inconsistent with the organization’s ethical expectations, as described
in applicable policies and procedures.

Objectivity
The CAE will ensure that the Internal Audit Function remains free from all conditions that threaten the ability of
internal auditors to carry out their responsibilities in an unbiased manner, including matters of engagement
selection, scope, procedures, frequency, timing, and communication. If the chief audit executive determines that
objectivity may be impaired in fact or appearance, the details of the impairment will be disclosed to appropriate
parties.
Internal auditors will maintain an unbiased mental attitude that allows them to perform engagements objectively
such that they believe in their work product, do not compromise quality, and do not subordinate their judgment
on audit matters to others, either in fact or appearance.
Internal auditors will have no direct operational responsibility or authority over any of the activities they review.
Internal auditors will not implement internal controls, develop procedures, install systems, or engage in other
activities that may impair their judgment, including:
•

Assessing specific operations for which they had responsibility within the previous year.

•

Performing operational duties for RTD.

•

Initiating or approving transactions external to the Internal Audit Function.

•

Directing the activities of any RTD employee that is not employed by the Internal Audit Function, except
to the extent that such employees have been appropriately assigned to internal audit teams or to assist
internal auditors.

•

Discuss the Internal Audit Plan with the Audit Committee and RTD Executive Leadership Team and submit
the plan to the Audit Committee for review and approval.

•

Communicate the impact of resource limitations on the internal audit plan to the Audit Committee and RTD

plan for review and approval. The internal audit plan consists of a work schedule as well as budget and resource
requirements for the next fiscal/calendar year. The CAE communicates the impact of resource limitations and
significant interim changes to Executive Leadership and the Audit Committee. The internal audit plan is developed
based on a prioritization of the audit universe using a risk-based methodology, including input of Executive Leadership
and the Board. The CAE reviews and adjusts the plan, as necessary, in response to changes in RTD’s business, risks,
operations, programs, systems, and controls. Any significant deviation from the approved internal audit plan must be
communicated to Executive Leadership and the Board through periodic activity reports.

REPORTING AND MONITORING:
The CAE prepares and distributes a written report upon the conclusion of each internal audit engagement at least
quarterly. Internal audit results must also be communicated to the Audit Committee at least quarterly.
The internal audit report may include responses from Executive Leadership and corrective action taken or to be taken
regarding the specific findings and recommendations. Responses from Executive Leadership, whether included within
the original audit report or provided thereafter (i.e. within thirty days) by management of the audited area, should
include a timetable for anticipated completion of action to be taken and an explanation for any corrective action that
will not be implemented.
The Internal Audit Function is responsible for appropriate follow-up on engagement findings and recommendations.
All significant findings remain in an open issues file until they are cleared.
The CAE periodically reports to RTD Executive Leadership Team and the Audit Committee on the Internal Audit
Function’s purpose, authority, and responsibility, as well as performance relative to its plan. Reporting must also
include significant risk exposures and control issues, including fraud risks, governance issues, and other matters

Executive Summary
Background

Overall Summary/Highlights

In 2022, RTD contracted with RubinBrown LLP to serve as its
Internal Audit provider to perform internal audits and other
consultative functions.

The audit team rated two audit observations as Moderate
Priority, and one audit observation as Low/Process
Improvement. As a result, an overall report rating of
‘Satisfactory’ was assigned.

This Financial Performance Metrics review is a Board-approved
Internal Audit Plan project.
RubinBrown LLP and Dietrich Partners prepared the report for
use by the Board of Directors, Audit Committee, and RTD
management. Recommendations for improvement are
presented for management’s consideration, and management is
responsible for the effective implementation of corrective action
plans.

Objective and Scope
The objectives of this review were to:
•

Evaluate whether the financial performance metrics based
on relevant financial data are consistently calculated,
measured and assessed.

Based on Internal Audit’s review of the July 2024 Colorado
Office of the State Auditor’s RTD Performance Audit Report,
several areas were deemed out of scope for this review. The
areas deemed out of scope for this review included: Reporting
of Statutorily Required Cost Efficiency Information, RTD Budget
Review and Approval process, Strategic Planning, and the
status of recommendations noted in the 2021 RTD
Accountability Committee Report.
The scope of this review consisted of recalculating a sample of
financial performance metrics and how the metrics are
presented and reported on RTD’s website for the test period of
March 31, 2024, through August 31, 2024. The scope also
included collaborating with RTD’s Chief Financial Officer of the
draft Agency Performance Scorecard, Financial Success section.

The report’s Internal Audit Observations and
Recommendations section describes the observations,
recommendations, and RTD’s management responses to
address each audit observation. Management has committed
to completing the agreed-upon action plans.

Internal Audit Observations and Recommendations
Observation 1
Observation Title:
Incorrect Calculation of Performance Metrics

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
The review of the August 2024 financial reporting packet noted the following metrics were not accurately calculated:
•
•
•

Operating Expenses per Boarding (excluding depreciation) calculation utilized the incorrect depreciation expense
balance. The Operating Expense per Boarding (excluding depreciation) was $12.07 per the August Financial
Reporting Packet versus $12.65 per Internal Audit’s calculation.
Revenue by Type did not agree to the 2024 Adopted Budget for the Sales & Use Tax and Grants & Others
category. The Sales & Use Tax Revenue and Grants & Others per the August Financial Reporting Packet was
$888,096 and $393,511, respectively versus the 2024 Adopted Budget of $932,541 and $349,066, respectively.
The Standard and Poor’s (S&P) credit rating for RTD’s FasTracks bond did not reflect the accurate credit rating.
The August Financial Reporting packet reflected the credit rating as AA+ versus AAA per S&P.

Cause:
This is due to the financial metric process still being built out and finalized.
Risks:
Inaccurate financial information may lead to misguided decisions that negatively impact the agency’s strategic direction
and operational efficiency.
Recommendation:
Management should consider establishing and documenting the approach for what is included in each metric calculation
and the source document to ensure consistency.
Management Action Plan:
RTD is in the process of finalizing the steps taken to complete the monthly reporting and establishing consistency and
accuracy in the numbers used to calculate the metrics shown. These should be in place beginning with January 2025
reporting which will be completed by the second week in March. Monthly reporting cannot be completed until final sales
and use tax amounts are received from the state. This normally does not occur until at least 40 days after the close of the
month in question.

Observation 2
Observation Title:
Incorrect Reporting of Performance Metrics on RTD Website

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
The following metrics were not reported accurately on RTD’s website:
•
•

•

The S&P’s Credit Rating per RTD’s website (About RTD, Performance Dashboard, Financial Performance) noted
an incorrect rating of AA+ for the FasTracks Revenue Bonds. The rating per S&P is AAA.
The Annual Budget per RTD’s website (About RTD, Performance Dashboard, Financial Performance) noted
incorrect amounts for Sales & Use Taxes ($888,096) and Grant Revenue & Other Income ($393,511). The
amounts per the 2024 Adopted Budget for Sales & Use Taxes and Grant Revenue & Other Income were $932,541
and $349,066, respectively.
The Operating Expense per Boarding (excluding depreciation) metric per RTD’s website (Open Records, Financial
Information, Financial Reports, Monthly Financial Status Report) reflected an incorrect amount of $12.07. The
correct amount is $12.65.

Cause:
This is due to the financial metric process still being built out and finalized. See Observation #1.
Risks:
Inaccurate reporting of financial information to the public may damage the credibility of the Agency.
Recommendation:
Management should consider establishing and documenting the approach for what is included in each metric calculation
and the source document to ensure consistency.
Management Action Plan:
RTD is in the process of finalizing the steps taken to complete the monthly reporting and establishing consistency and
accuracy in the numbers used to calculate the metrics shown. These should be in place beginning with January 2025
reporting which will be completed by the second week in March. Monthly reporting cannot be completed until final sales

Observation 3
Observation Title:
Not All Financial Health Ratios Calculated

Risk Rating:
Low Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
The RTD Accounting Department was in the process of implementing the Nine Financial Health Ratios the Colorado State
Auditors calculate to assess the health of the agency. The August 2024 Financial Reporting Packet was the first month
the nine financial health ratios were included in the packet. Five of the nine ratios were not calculated in the August 2024
Financial Reporting Packet. The five ratios were:
•
•
•
•
•

Unrestricted Net Ratio
Debt Burden Ratio
Principal Payments to Total Outstanding Debt
Tax Revenue per Capita
Expenses per Capita

Cause:
This was due to the financial metric process still being built out and finalized as well as 12 months’ worth of activity were
needed for the calculation.
Risks:
Lack of calculating the financial health ratios may hinder visibility into the agency’s overall financial health and strategic
direction of the agency.
Recommendation:
Management should consider either annualizing the balances or using a rolling 12-month period for ratios that require 12
months of activity.
Management Action Plan:
All Financial Health Ratios have been added as of the completion of the September 2024 financial package and will
continue for each month going forward.

Appendix 2: Report Rating Definitions
Report ratings are utilized to communicate the aggregate compliance or risk observed for the in-scope location, process, or system.

Satisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are generally in compliance with applicable policies and procedures.
The design and effectiveness of internal controls appear to be adequate. Exceptions noted were
isolated and/or minor, and departures from leading practices are minimal (as applicable).

Needs Improvement

The in-scope areas of the project, although generally in compliance with policies and procedures, have
certain deficiencies with the design or effectiveness of internal controls, which should be improved.
Some departures from leading practices have been identified, creating opportunities for process or
efficiency improvement or for improved financial statement accuracy.

Unsatisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are in substantial non-compliance with policies and procedures, and
the design or effectiveness of internal controls is not adequate. Multiple and/or significant departures
from leading practice may be present, creating operational inefficiency. If such deficiencies are not
corrected, the company can be exposed to loss or financial misstatement.

Appendix 3: Priority of Observation Ratings

Risk/Impact: Observation that presents a high risk to the agency and/or is of high importance to business
success/achievement of goals. Conditions exist or situations could occur which could have a significant adverse
impact (i.e., financial, reputational, etc.) on the business. Significant audit observations may include conditions
dealing with irregularities, illegal acts, financial reporting errors, inefficiencies, waste, ineffectiveness, conflicts
of interest, and control weaknesses. In addition, an observation is considered High Priority if a finding creates
a large exposure that could result in a loss of system control, access, application control, and/or exposure of
data via the compromise of administrative accounts and/or other system functions. It could also create an
exposure of confidentiality or integrity.

High Priority

The relevant risks associated with the observation may be considered high due to one or more of the following
conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Significant financial impact for location/site audited
Prevalence of issues or exceptions
Circumvention of controls, Management wrong-doing and/or willful disregard of company policy or
regulatory requirements
Non-compliance with US/Local laws or regulations
Disruption to operations and/or significant reputational exposures
Unremediated previously identified control observations or a history of similar issues, although minor,
may be considered a high priority classification.

Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective action is required within three months, or other time period deemed
reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Moderate
Priority

Risk/Impact: The observation in the report relates to ineffective or insufficient controls to manage key
business risks. The risks associated could lead to financial statement errors and losses, operational
inefficiencies (including financial system and IT issues) or result in instances of policy and regulatory
non-compliance as well as potential reputational damages, fines, and penalties.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective actions should be implemented within the next six months, or other time
period deemed reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Low Priority/
Process
Improvement

Risk/Impact: Other findings were identified during fieldwork that are isolated or minor control gaps for
business cycles not in-scope for the audit, observations to improve financial and/or operational efficiency, or
are designed to assist management in improving the operating capacity of the department and/or activity.
These recommendations do not impact on the overall rating.
Urgency of Action Plan: While not necessarily a priority, corrective action should occur within the next
12 months.
