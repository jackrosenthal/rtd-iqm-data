What is the basis for TOD?
Based on Partnership for Sustainable Communities – Department of Transportation (DOT), Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), and Housing and Urban Development (HUD)

• Integrates station areas into communities
• Promotes higher density development (growing up instead of out)
• Supports local economic development
• Improves station security (“eyes on the street”)
• Increases ridership
• Creates affordable housing opportunities
• Leverages private and other governmental investment

Originally adopted by RTD Board 4/18/06, amended 9/16/08 and 9/21/10

• Promote multi-sector, cross-jurisdictional partnerships
• Encourage livable communities and sustainable development that
supports the transit system
• Ensure a hierarchy of multimodal access; and
• Protect and enhance RTD’s transit assets

2.1.a

Estimating Land Value
Developers and appraisers arrive at a Fair Market Value estimate to facilitate negotiations,
using the three approaches below. RTD uses Fair Market Value as a basis for all its
transactions, including acquisitions and dispositions.
1.

Sales Comparison Approach

2.

Cost Replacement Approach

3.

Income Approach

• Evaluates sales of properties that are similar to a subject property.
• Most accurate when numerous sales of comparable properties are available.
• Becomes more challenging to apply when development program of asset is specialized.

• Sets value of property based on the cost of reproducing a substitute property, incl. land, building,
parking, etc.
• Costs are ‘all in’ and include hard, soft, land, profit, etc.
[addressed in detail in subsequent slides]

• Most appropriate when land is under consideration for future development.
• Works well when context offers few comparable sales or when the surrounding uses do not represent
the highest and best use of the property.
• Measures the present worth of a future income generated by a property, and its eventual resale value.
• Determines the residual land value after accounting for total development costs and sales revenues.

2.1.a

Determining Project Value
• Project Value is a function of the net income it
will produce over time
• Developers compare potential projects based on
expected income vs. land costs
• Project value and project costs are calculated
independently, using different factors

10

Packet Pg. 12

Project Cost
Project development can be broken down into four elements:
1.

Hard Costs (~60% of total cost)
• Construction materials
• Labor

Residual Land Value (~13% of total cost)
• Project Value – Project Cost = Residual Land Value

Attachment: TOD Value - Board Study Session 103117 - v4 (3297 : Transportation-Oriented Development

2.1.a

Residual Land Value (cont.)
Key Considerations

• In most markets, hard and soft costs are fixed
and do not vary substantially between
submarkets
• Higher land values correlate to higher density
and higher market pressure
• Greater net income provides greater project
value and flows directly to land value

15

Packet Pg. 17

Attachment: TOD Value - Board Study Session 103117 - v4 (3297 : Transportation-Oriented Development

2.1.a

Residual Land Value (cont.) 2
• Several factors can cut into residual land
value:
• On-site costs for RTD replacement facilities
• Affordable housing or other community facilities

• In some cases, RTD may wish to prioritize:
• Revenues to the agency;
• Construction of transit-related facilities; or
• Affordable housing or other community facilities

16

Packet Pg. 18

2.1.a

Residual Land Value (cont.) 3
• Costs for RTD facilities, affordable housing
or other additional costs can be partially
offset by
• Jurisdiction Subsidies
• Tax Increment Financing
• Metro District Taxes or Fees

Approaches to TOD
How does the FTA approach TOD?
How do peer agencies approach TOD?
How has RTD approached TOD in the past?
How should RTD approach TOD going forward?

Packet Pg. 20

Attachment: TOD Value - Board Study Session 103117 - v4 (3297 : Transportation-Oriented Development

2.1.a

How does the FTA approach TOD/JD?
From FTA Guidance on Joint Development (JD), Circular 7050.1A

• FTA understands tradeoffs are necessary to achieve benefits of
development
• FTA encourages Joint Development that satisfies four criteria:
1. Creates economic benefit
2. Enhances public transportation
3. Partner provides a fair share of revenue
A. RTD must receive revenue equal or greater to original FTA
investment
B. UNLESS the project is a community/public facility or affordable
housing

4. Tenant pays a fair share of costs
