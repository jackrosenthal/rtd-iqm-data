INFORMATION
The FasTracks financial plan anticipates the financing of certain components of FasTracks projects
related to the design, construction, procurement and/or acquisition across the FasTracks corridors. The
RTD Board has previously adopted resolutions related to the financing of certain FasTracks projects.
Specifically, the Board adopted Resolution No. 1744 (Series of 2013) on November 26, 2013 expressing
its intent to raise capital to fully finance the North Metro corridor commuter rail to 124th Avenue through
the issuance of Certificates of Participation (COPs).
Staff is currently preparing for this financing through the issuance of COPs with an aggregate principal
amount of approximately $470 million. The certificates are expected to be issued during the second
quarter of 2014 with the final maturity in 2044. Interest rates have increased since RTD issued
certificates in 2013, but still continue to be attractive for this financing and within the assumptions
previously made in staff’s financial model.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the anticipated May 2014
issuance and sale of the certificates, including assembling financial information related to the District and
begun drafting a preliminary official statement, continuing disclosure agreement, certificate purchase
agreement and the Resolution for issuance of the certificates. Staff expects to present these documents
to the Board in April and request through the Resolution authorization to issue the certificates, to
establish the parameters and to approve agreements required in connection with the issuance of the
certificates. Documents will be made available for review in the Board Office in April.
Staff will request updated credit ratings from Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch for the COPs.
Current credit ratings on outstanding RTD COPs are as follows:
Moody’s: Aa3 with a stable outlook
Fitch: A with a negative outlook
Standard and Poor’s: A- with a stable outlook
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors, Butler Snow
LLP as Bond Counsel and Hogan Lovells and Bookhart & O’toole as Disclosure Counsel in regard to the
COPs. The COPs will be underwritten by a team including J.P. Morgan (55%), Loop Capital (10%),
Piper Jaffray (15%), BMO (15%) and Harvestons (5%).

BACKGROUND
The 2014 Summary Budget Calendar is structured to provide the Board the opportunity to offer
early, substantive input into the development of the RTD 2015 Annual Budget. The purpose of the
attached calendar is to assist the Board members in anticipating and planning their input into the
development of the 2014 Amended Budget, 2015-2020 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), and the 2015
Budget. The four General Manager strategic goals approved by the Board at the March 1 Board
Planning Session will be incorporated into the 2015 Budget plans.
DISCUSSION
In the course of the development of the three financial plans mentioned above, staff will look to the
Board to provide guidance and collaboration in:
(1) 2014 Amended Budget and proposed FasTracks multi-year project approval
(2) Determining the objectives of the 2015 Budget
(3) Understanding the key drivers of costs in the District’s annual budget
(4) Determining the required adjustments to RTD programs and fund balance levels
(5) Developing an understanding of departmental operating expenses and capital projects
(6) Establishing and adhering to a calendar of critical milestones that make it possible for the
District to satisfy State Statutes relative to budget formation and monitoring

CONCLUSION
The suggested topics and timing in the accompanying calendar are proposed with the intent of
keeping the Board informed on critical budget information as it becomes available and allowing the
Board to develop an understanding of the key financial plans. Staff is seeking the support of the
Board in moving ahead with this plan.

Subject:

Fiscal
Sustainability
Recommendations

Task

Force

BACKGROUND
A Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (Task Force) was formed in November 2010 for the purpose of making
recommendations, through a written report to the RTD Board of Directors, detailing opportunities for
operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal
sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members with 12 of those members being external to
RTD. The Task Force presented its recommendations to the Board of Directors in June 2011. The
Board of Directors subsequently approved those recommendations and directed Staff to pursue
implementation of each recommendation. The Task Force reconvened for a final meeting in July 2012
to be briefed on the progress of their recommendations and provide an opportunity for feedback.
DISCUSSION
The Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy recommendations to
the Board of Directors which were approved for further consideration and/or implementation. The status
of those Task Force recommendations is as follows:
Recommendations - Completed
Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
RTD contracted with the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business – Business Research Division
(Leeds) to provide sales and use tax forecasts beginning in March 2011. Each quarter, Leeds provides a
forecast containing short-term (one year by quarter), medium-term (six year SBP period) and long-term
(30 year APE period) sales and use tax projections. This was implemented to provide RTD with expert
economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using sophisticated financial modeling techniques not
available internally. These forecasts are intended to provide a better analysis of RTD’s expected sales
and use tax collections which comprise approximately 2/3 of RTD’s recurring revenues.
Service Optimization
In 2012, RTD implemented modifications and reductions in service representing approximately $10.7
million or an 8% net reduction in service. Service optimization was recommended by the Task Force and
implemented with Board approval in order to match services provided with available funding sources.
Since that time, some service has been gradually restored as needed within budgetary constraints.
Fund Balance Policy
Due to the volatility of RTD’s largest single revenue source, sales and use taxes, the Task Force
recommended implementation of a more robust fiscal policy regarding fund balances. Fund balances
represent financial assets that are available to RTD after allowing for obligations that have been incurred.
Fund balances increase when fund sources exceed fund uses and vice versa. Fund balances therefore
exist as a form of savings account to be used for specific purposes when needed and replenished when
economic circumstances allow. In response to this recommendation, RTD implemented a fund balance

Packet Pg. 10

1.C.3

policy with a target level of $90 million for the Base System, which is approximately three months of
operating expenses. This target was established based on levels recommended by the Government
Finance Officers Association (GFOA) best practices. The Fund Balance Policy further categorizes the
available fund balances into the categories of a Board Restricted Fund, a Capital Replacement Fund and
an Unrestricted Fund. At 12/31/13, unaudited fund balances for the Base System totaled $45.3 million,
consisting of the Board Restricted Fund of $16.2 million, the Capital Replacement Fund of $9.0 million,
and the Unrestricted Fund of $20.1 million.
Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
In Colorado, legislation establishes products and services that are subject to sales and use taxation and
those that are exempt from taxation. The state, cities, municipalities and special districts in Colorado
each have different sales and use tax rates and often have differing items subject to taxation due to
legislation establishing exemptions. RTD introduced legislation which was passed in May 2013 to
establish parity with the state regarding items subject to sales and use taxation. Exemption parity was
identified by the Task Force as providing a benefit to RTD during difficult economic conditions when the
state implements exemption changes and vice versa. In addition, exemption parity removes the
complexity to vendors of RTD having different taxable items than the state. Exemption parity has taken
effect 1/1/14. RTD estimated that parity will generate a net increase of $2.7 million in 2014 based on
2012 figures. This will be difficult to track due to the way vendors report sales tax components.
Technology and Energy Innovation
RTD conducted a comprehensive energy audit of the oldest and largest operating division (the Platte
facility) to determine the potential scope of savings that may be available through equipment and lighting
upgrades. The audit identified that facility lighting upgrades could result in potentially significant energy
savings. Areas for minor energy savings were identified for other building systems, however, these have
a very significant capital investment and long pay-back periods. Based on this information, RTD has
budgeted for energy upgrades throughout the District in the Strategic Budget Plan, and we will address
energy efficiency in building systems as on-going projects are completed. We have evaluated a variety
of solar applications which also require significant capital investment with a relatively long-term pay-back
period. RTD was successful in receiving a grant to install solar panels at East Metro and this project is
now complete. We have also completed a lighting upgrade at East Metro replacing older metal-halide
fixtures with energy efficient fluorescent fixtures. Lighting upgrades are also underway at other RTD
operating facilities. We hope to quantify cost savings in a few months.

Recommendations – Ongoing
Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
The Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) collects and audits sales and use taxes for RTD. The Task
Force identified an opportunity for revenue enhancement by performing additional sales and use tax
compliance reviews based on the favorable collection experiences of Colorado cities and municipalities
that implemented these reviews. Compliance reviews consist of RTD providing additional resources
from a contracted provider to supplement the DOR’s audit function. Due to the complexity of sales and
use tax filing requirements and tax boundaries in Colorado, this recommendation is intended to provide
the DOR with the additional resources necessary to ensure complete and timely tax compliance by
vendors. An Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between RTD and the DOR was completed and an RFP
was issued for compliance review services. RTD has contracted with Revenue Recovery Group (RRG)
who has substantial experience providing compliance review services to several Colorado municipalities.
Recent meetings have taken place with RTD, DOR and RRG to discuss the scope of work, procedures

Packet Pg. 11

1.C.3

contained in the IGA, identify audit candidates, and determine next steps. We expect the actual audit
program will be underway by March 31.
Naming Rights
The Board approved RTD securing the services of a corporate sponsorship and naming rights consultant,
and RTD entered into a contract with the internationally known firm IMG. IMG presented to the Board in
2013 an inventory and financial analysis of RTD facilities, services, and assets that may lend themselves
to naming/sponsorship value-added contracts. IMG has initiated the next phase of the contract and is
making recommendations for specific naming/sponsorship value-added contracts.
Any contract
opportunities will be presented to the Board for approval on a case-by-case basis.
Partnerships and Privatization
The Task Force described this recommendation as a broad area that could include items such as
privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce expenses. RTD has undertaken
some actions under this recommendation such as the lease of the DUS historic building, IGAs for
improvements to US36 and the East Line, as well as TOD activities. RTD continues to look for
partnership and privatization opportunities on an ongoing basis.

Recommendations – Low Near-Term Priority
Recommendations made by the Task Force and categorized at the 2012 Board Retreat as having lower
near-term priority and their status are as follows:
Charge for Parking
RTD currently charges out-of-District patrons parking fees to use parking facilities as well as fees
charged to in-District patrons parking for longer than 24 hours. The Task Force identified charging
parking fees to all patrons as a possible revenue enhancement source. This recommendation could
be perceived as a fare increase. In 2013, the state legislation regarding RTD charging for parking
was amended to allow a third party to charge in-District patrons as long as RTD receives no revenue.
Tolling and Managed Lanes
The Task Force recommended investigating the possibility of RTD generating additional revenues
through charges for tolling and managed lanes. Enacting this recommendation would require
coordination with CDOT and other agencies. The US36 BRT project is an example of how tolling and
managed lanes can enhance RTD operations and save costs. The agreement guarantees running
times, allows for bus on shoulder operations to facilitate schedule adherence on local service, and
provides for maintenance of managed lanes with no contribution from RTD. Prior to entering into
agreements with CDOT for managed lanes, RTD contributed to maintenance and snow removal on
the I-25 HOV lanes.
Home Rule Initiative
The Task Force recommended that RTD consider becoming a “Home Rule” entity which would allow
RTD to collect and audit its sales and use taxes instead of the DOR. This initiative would require
legislation. RTD met several times with the DOR to discuss this initiative as well as sales and use
tax compliance reviews. Although the DOR did not object to RTD performing these services itself,
the Colorado Municipal League and other entities recommended against it. “Home Rule” is a state
constitutional authorization for creating municipalities. It could only be secured for RTD by statewide
constitutional amendment. As discussed earlier in this report, RTD has entered into an agreement
with DOR to facilitate better tax compliance and monitoring, which has been coupled with

Packet Pg. 12

1.C.3

simplification of state and RTD taxation through legislation that provides for uniformity on items
taxed.

Fourth Quarter 2013 Performance Measures

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Fourth Quarter 2013. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and the
citizens of the District. Of the 22 performance measures tracked, RTD met 15 of the goals in their
entirety in the fourth quarter. The following are the exceptions to goals:
Goal 2.1 – The average number of facilities maintenance complaints per month remains above goal
at the end of 2014, however, the goal was met in Q4 and the measure has been on a declining trend
throughout 2013. Complaints are related primarily to paving and lighting issues, elevators and
shelters. Complaints were highest in Q1 due to issues about snow/ice and shelter clean-up from
snow and several instances where shelters have a one-time per week maintenance schedule. The
overall system growth is challenging our resources to consistently meet this goal.
Goal 3.1 – On-time performance data is being generated on-line and is more accurate due to the
implementation of the new CAD/AVL and APC systems. Staff continues to study individual route
and driver performance in order to focus on the worst-performing routes and staff is identifying the
resources needed to improve. The GM has asked to review current action steps and will consider
changes that may be necessary to improve performance.
Goal 3.3 – RTD as a whole fell slightly short of the 26,000 mileage between lost service road calls
due to shortfalls in the transit bus and articulated bus categories. This is due to the aging of the
fleet and deferral of fleet replacement. The number is improving as we expected it would because
the 2013-2014 fleet replacement cycle is underway.
Goal 4.2 – Although initial response to customer complaints was within goal, final resolution of
customer complaints slightly exceeded the goal by 0.9 business days, reflecting the impact of the
West Line and personnel staffing in various areas. The measure improved by 3.9 days from Q3 as
the issues reached resolution. It should be noted that this measure reports on resolution of customer
complaints across all subject matter throughout the District and the number includes all departments
utilizing the Trapeze system for commendation and complaint research. We are investigating our
ability to report more meaningful data.
Regarding complaints per boardings, we have seen customer complaints increase across the entire
system due to several factors including the fare enforcement campaign, increasing ridership, and
heavy/longer load times. Top reasons continue to be “bus did not show,” “bus early,” “bus late” and
“operator discourtesy.” Staff continues to review CAD/AVL playbacks to determine the validity of

Packet Pg. 14

1.C.4

these complaints and to work with operators to address valid complaints. Complaints have reached
a static level. Staff has provided an analysis of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer
Service report.
Goal 6.3 – RTD did not meet its goal for EcoPass revenue in Q3. Revenue declined slightly in this
category due to continued migration from EcoPass to other fare media.
Goal 6.4 – RTD did not meet its goal for number of internal audits for 2013. The actual number was
down by 1 from goal of 20, which is attributed to a vacant Manager of Internal Audit position for 3
months in 2013. The new manager completed 6 of 7 audits remaining to be completed with the final
one in progress at the end of the year.
Goal 6.5 – RTD exceeded its vacancies goal in both bus mechanics and bus operators. We are
experiencing an unusually high level of vacancies in this category and recruitment efforts are
continuing. Vacancies are the result of retirements, system growth, and a strongly recovering local
economy.

The goal was met in Q4 and the trend has been decreasing throughout 2013. Overall system growth in facilities is challenging our
resources to consistently perform at goal.

On-time is arrival at a location no more than 1 minute early and no more than 5 minutes after the scheduled arrival time.
2
The measure is lowered in 2013 due to system complexity added by the West Line, which will bring with it more single-track
chokepoints on the west end of the line and more crossing points in the CPV. Delays are also coming from signal timing changes
in the downtown district which is affecting performance.
3
Due to the new CAD/AVL and APC systems, on-time performance data is being generated on-line and is more accurate. We
continue to focus on the worst routes and continue to identify the resources needed to improve. The GM will review the action
steps currently being taken and consider changes that may be necessary.

The measure reports on resolution of customer complaints across all subject matter throughout the District and the number includes all
departments utilizing TrapezeCOM system for commendation and complaint research. The 2013 number reflects the impact of the West Line and
a vacant position earlier in the year.
3
Top complaints are “bus did not show,” “bus early,” “bus late” and “operator discourtesy.” Staff continues to review CAD/AVL playbacks to
determine the validity of these complaints and to work with operators to address valid complaints. Staff provides an analysis of complaints as part
of the Operations/Customer Services report. Customer complaints increased across the entire system due to several factors including the fare
enforcement campaign, the stroller policy, and heavier/longer load times; this higher level of complaints has been consistent for the last 2 years and
is not increasing.

Subject:

January 2014 Financial Summary

BACKGROUND
Staff presents the monthly financial status report to the Board each month as an information item during
the Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting. Due to the year-end financial audit each
year, financial information for January is incomplete for timely presentation. For this reason, staff only
presents Dashboard information, including ridership, fare revenue and sales and use tax results for the
month.
DISCUSSION
Ridership, fare revenue and sales and use taxes for January 2014 were as follows:
