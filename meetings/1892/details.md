### B. Recommended Actions

No recommended action was presented to the committee.

#### 1. Certificates of Participation Issuance and Ratings Agency Update

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, introduced Brenden Morgan, Manager of Debt and Investment, to the committee.  He updated the Directors on the FasTracks financial plan as they anticipate the financing of certain components of the FasTracks projects related to the design, construction, procurement and/or acquisition for the FasTracks North Metro corridor.  Staff is preparing for this financing through the issuance of Certificates of Participation (COPs), with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $470 million during the second quarter of 2014 with final maturity in 2044.  Staff expects to present these documents to the Board in April and request through the Resolution authorization to issue the certificates, to establish the parameters and to approve agreements required in connection with the issuance of the certificates.  Mr. Morgan introduced Marshall Crawford, Pedro Ramos, and Mitchell Schmidt from J.P. Morgan, Brad Langner from Piper Jaffray, Chad Fuller from BMO Capital, and Bob Walsh from Loop Capital to the committee.  These gentlemen represent the institutions which, along with Harvestons, a DBE firm, will underwrite the COPs.

Director Hoy asked how the recent credit rating downgrade of RTD from Fitch Ratings affects the COPs.  Mr. Morgan replied that it is hard to say as this will depend on market conditions, but overall it is not good and will be of some cost to RTD.

Chair Sisk pointed out that rates have gone up and asked what the rates would be for these COPs.  Mr. Morgan said that he didn’t have a solid number with him but could make it available.  With a cost of issuance of $470 million, he said it would be at about 1% though that percentage is flexible.

#### 2. 2014 Amended Budget, 2015-2020 SBP, 2015 Budget

Terry Howerter introduced Jannette Scarpino, Budget and Financial Analysis Manager, to the committee.  Ms. Scarpino presented to the committee the 2014 Summary Budget Calendar and reminded them of the calendar’s purpose: to assist the Board members in anticipating and planning their input into the development of the 2014 Amended Budget, the 2015-2020 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), and the 2015 Budget.  She looks forward to Board collaboration in creating RTD budgets.

Director Bagley thanked Ms. Scarpino for going through the budget with him last October.  He emphasized to the Directors the importance of the budget and exhorted his colleagues to reach out to Ms. Scarpino if they had any questions regarding the budget as her team works so hard to prepare it and to have the Directors’ input.

Director Folska asked if Ms. Scarpino had an idea what might be presented in the amended budget.  Ms. Scarpino said that specifics were difficult right now but there are a couple of capital projects that need to be straightened out with better numbers.

#### 3. Fiscal Sustainability Task Force Recommendations

Mr. Howerter said that staff will provide quarterly updates to the committee on the recommendations of the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (FSTF) to keep the Directors informed of the progress.  Ms. Scarpino updated the committee on key completed and ongoing recommendations from the FSTF, such as adherence to the fund balance policy, sales and use tax exemption, technology and energy innovation, and naming rights.  She directed the Directors to pages 61-64 of the Operations and Customer Service Committee/Financial Administration and Audit Committee Packet for the March 18, 2014 meeting for a comprehensive list of updates on the FSTF recommendations.

Director Hoy complemented Ms. Scarpino on the written update as it was the best reading in the packet and laid out a lot of items that he had forgotten.  Ms. Scarpino thanked Director Hoy for reading the written update.

Director Menten asked for a legal update on the challenges for the sales tax parity.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, reported that the measure for preliminary injunction that would’ve stopped implementation of the sales tax parity bill was denied, so the bill has taken effect. State is collecting taxes in accord with 2013-1272 that brought sales tax parity.  RTD filed a motion to dismiss because the plaintiff in the case was a 501(c)3, a non-tax entity.  Instead of refuting, they added a tax payer (person) on February 20th, allowing the plaintiff to amend its complaint. The motion to dismiss will not proceed. RTD will be filing an answer to the complaint next week.

Director Folska made a comment on naming rights, specifically about ING as they are a fine group to be associated with.  She also noted that Denver Union Station will be known to most people as the Crawford Hotel so it is important for RTD to differentiate the train, bus, and plaza from the hotel.  She congratulated Ms. Scarpino on the work with naming rights.  Ms. Scarpino noted that Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, was in the audience and that the point is taken.

#### 4. Fourth Quarter 2013 Performance Measures

Bruce Abel joined Mr. Howerter and Ms. Scarpino for this update.  Mr. Howerter pointed the Directors to pages 65 and 66 of the Operations and Customer Service Committee/Financial Administration and Audit Committee Packet for the March 18, 2014 meeting for the self-explanatory report.  Ms. Scarpino highlighted some problem areas, such as facility complaints, response to customer complaints, and the high level of vacancies in bus mechanics and operators.  She also noted that the Assistant General Managers were in the audience to answer any questions.

Phil Washington, General Manager, commented the areas pointed out are not problems, but rather challenges.

Chair Walker agreed with Mr. Washington adding that what is a problem today may be seen as a benefit in hindsight.

#### 5. January 2014 Financial Summary

Mr. Howerter noted that his team is still working on closing the December, 2013 ledgers.  Preliminary numbers for January can be found on page 77 of the Operations and Customer Service Committee/Financial Administration and Audit Committee Packet for the March 18, 2014 meeting.

He explained the 1% sales tax on retail and medical marijuana as January, 2014 was the first time RTD received the retail sales tax. The 1% for January, 2014 totaled $999,415.  As a point of reference, he explained the state collects 12.9% (2.9% regular tax, 10% additional tax) for retail marijuana sales, and that number for January, 2014 was $1.8 million.  This number projects about $21 million for the year.  They also collect additional taxes, like a 15% on growers and additional revenues for issuing licenses.  The Governor’s budget for the 2014-2015 fiscal year anticipates $133.6 million in revenue from retail and medical marijuana, which seems a bit optimistic when using the January, 2014 numbers.

Director Solano pointed out that the subject of retail marijuana may have a humorous undertone; however, retail sales are here to stay and that potentially means lots of revenue to RTD.

Director Folska noted that the numbers might accelerate as businesses keep opening and that this point of revenue will be interesting to follow.

### D. Other Matters

No other matter was presented.

Committee Chair Walker adjourned the meeting at 7:53 P.M.
