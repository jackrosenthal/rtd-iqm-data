PRESENTATION LENGTH

BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan) was approved by the Board during a Special Board
Meeting held on Tuesday, August 10, 2021.
The Strategic Plan establishes the agency’s four Strategic Priorities, which serve as the functional pillars
used to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance:
•
•
•
•

Community Value: RTD strives to be a strong community partner, providing value to customers
as well as to the broader Denver metro region while sustaining planet Earth
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently deliver high-quality customer service
Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management of all financial resources

Each Strategic Priority is associated with a measurable Success Outcome.
Leveraging data garnered through Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership
surveys, staff held strategy sessions in late 2022 and throughout 2023 to develop tactics to improve
agency performance in specific areas. These tactics were distilled into three overarching Strategic
Initiatives for 2023 and 2024:
• Back to Basics: RTD strives to enhance the reach and impact of internal communications and to
redouble agency efforts to maintain assets in a state of good repair leveraging sound asset
management principles.
• People Power: Recognizing the critical importance of its people, the agency’s most important
resource, in achieving the agency’s mission, RTD seeks to vigorously address impediments to
recruitment and retention efforts and to foster a culture of learning and development.
• Welcoming Transit Environment: RTD seeks to reduce the impacts of criminal behaviors and
Code of Conduct violations on agency services and workplaces and, in doing so, to improve

community and employee perception of personal and public security on RTD property and
vehicles.
For the performance period commencing September 1, 2023, and concluding September 1, 2024, each
non-represented employee was required to develop and strive to achieve “stretch” goals developed
using the SMART framework and based on the Strategic Initiatives.
These goals have been intentionally designed to drive and incentivize individual performance, which in
turn improves the performance of the agency overall. Moreover, the initiatives reflect a renewed
collective focus to deliver meaningful progress toward achieving the Success Outcomes.
DISCUSSION
During the Board’s annual retreat in 2024, Board members discussed opportunities to enhance agency
transparency and bolster communication and engagement with jurisdictional partners, stakeholders, and
customers. At that time, Board members collectively discussed the development of a series of openended questions intended to probe whether the agency is meeting its performance goals:

Community Value

Customer Excellence

Employee Ownership

Financial Success

How is RTD achieving its
vision to be the trusted
leader in mobility?

How is RTD meeting
customers’ needs?

How well is RTD
attracting highly skilled
and engaged job seekers?

How has RTD delivered
value to the communities
it serves?

How is RTD creating a
welcoming transit
environment?

What is RTD doing to
inspire employees to build
a career?

How has RTD
demonstrated good
stewardship of taxpayer
dollars?
How has RTD developed
trust as the leader in
mobility?

In alignment with this effort, staff is developing a public-facing agency performance dashboard
(performance dashboard) that will provide answers to these questions and serve as an easily accessible
repository for performance data related to the Strategic Plan. The performance dashboard will also house
information related to the agency budget and financial reports, people power statistics, and other key
measurements. The performance dashboard will enhance agency transparency and assist the
Performance Committee’s efforts to assess the agency’s progress toward Strategic Plan Success
Outcomes.
During the Performance Committee meeting scheduled for Tuesday, May 21, 2024, staff will present an
update on the performance dashboard in keeping with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value and
Financial Success.
Staff anticipates the performance dashboard will launch in early June 2024.
