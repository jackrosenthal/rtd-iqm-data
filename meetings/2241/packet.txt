BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: January 28, 2015

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

January 28, 2015

Board Meeting Date: February 17, 2015

Subject:

16th Street Mall Intersection Improvements,
Funding Intergovernmental Agreement with the
City and County of Denver

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager, or designee, to execute an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA)
between the City and County of Denver (CCD) and the Regional Transportation District. The purpose
of the IGA is to set forth the rights, duties and obligations of CCD and RTD to construct intersection
improvements within the CCD Right-of-Way in conjunction with the 16 th Street Mall Reconstruction
Project. The intersection improvements will be funded by CCD, and the construction managed by
RTD.
BACKGROUND
Under a separate IGA, RTD and CCD are jointly reconstructing up to 3 ½ blocks of the 16 th Street
Mall (“Reconstruction Project”). The Reconstruction Project is partially funded by an FTA “Bus & Bus
Facilities Livability Grant.” RTD and CCD are providing local match funds of 20%. Because of late
scope modification request by CCD, the initial scope of the Reconstruction Project did not include
intersections of the Mall and cross streets within the limits of the project. This Intersection
Improvements IGA is intended to fill that gap. The cross-street intersections are generally as old as
the Mall (more than 30 years); the concrete paving is deteriorating, and the existing traffic signal
systems do not meet current CCD design standards.
DISCUSSION
The Reconstruction Project scope includes reconstruction of the transitway pavers, their setting bed,
in-situ resurfacing of the walkway pavers, upgrading the Mall utility infrastructure (e.g. electrical and
irrigation), constructing walkway “bulbouts” at cross-street intersections for pedestrian safety,
replacing the existing pedestrian lights, and upgrading the existing urban furniture (e.g. benches,
planters, water features). However, repairs and upgrades to the full intersections were not included
as part of the FTA grant.
If the intersections are not repaired concurrently with the Reconstruction Project, the work will need
to be done at a later date by CCD, resulting in additional disruptions to Mall shuttle operations,
additional construction delays to vehicular traffic and pedestrians, and further disruption to
businesses adjacent to the Mall.
The IGA addresses funding of the intersection improvements, which will be reimbursed by CCD with
DURA TIF funds. The IGA also addresses the design and construction management for the project
and identifies RTD as the managing entity. RTD will lead the design and construction management
of this project with support from stakeholder agencies. CCD will reimburse RTD for all direct costs
associated with the construction of the intersection.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 16

1.C.1

CCD will reimburse RTD 100% for the construction of the intersection improvements as outlined in
the final IGA.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager, or designee, to
execute an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the City and County of Denver (CCD)
and the Regional Transportation District. The purpose of the IGA is to set forth the rights,
duties and obligations of CCD and RTD to construct intersection improvements within the
CCD Right-of-Way in conjunction with the 16th Street Mall Reconstruction Project. The
intersection improvements will be funded by CCD, and the construction managed by RTD.
2.
Delay implementing the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because delaying
the implementation of the IGA has serious impact to the schedule, budget, and RTD’s ability
to utilize approved grant funds, and would cause an extended delay of the Reconstruction
Project.
3.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because this would cause
major delays in constructing the intersection improvements. The result would be additional
disruption to Mall shuttle operation and further construction delays to vehicular and pedestrian
traffic along the Mall.
