BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Approval of General Manager and CEO's 2022 Appraisal
and 2023 Compensation

Committee Meeting Date:
November 30, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
December 6, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson’s attached
performance appraisal for the period of January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 (performance
period) and in connection therewith, to approve a 0% increase in the GM/CEO’s Adjusted Base Salary,
commencing January 1, 2023.
REPRESENTATIVE
Director Shontel Lewis, Committee Chair, Performance Committee
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Performance Committee (PC) is responsible for oversight and management of the GM/CEO’s
employment contract, compensation package, and annual comprehensive performance appraisal.
Following the PC’s consideration, the GM/CEO’s performance appraisal and any corresponding adjusted
compensation are reviewed and approved by the Board.
On September 20, 2020, RTD and General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson entered into
a five-year employment agreement (“Agreement”). The Agreement sets forth her compensation and
benefits, as well as a program by which the Board, in consultation with Ms. Johnson, establishes
performance goals and metrics, annually evaluates her performance, and utilizes a framework for
determining future incentive awards and increases to base salary subject to her meeting or exceeding
these goals. The Agreement has been amended by the parties four times, with the most recent
amendment adopted by the Board on October 25, 2022. The Third Amendment to the Agreement
provides that RTD will engage a third party by competitive solicitation to conduct a compensation and
benchmarking analysis (“Compensation Analysis”) that will be used by the Board in consultation with
GM/CEO Johnson to determine her compensation for performance periods beginning January 1, 2023.
DISCUSSION
Consistent with the Third and Fourth Amendments, on November 8, 2022, GM/CEO Johnson submitted
a self-evaluation for the Board’s consideration. All Directors were given the opportunity to submit rating
and comments on the GM/CEO’s performance during the performance period. The attached appraisal
reflects the Board’s assessment that GM/CEO Johnson did not meet expectations with respect to the
Strategic Priorities and Success Outcomes and that she exceeded expectations with respect to the
Organizational Values.

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

Following a competitive solicitation, Gallagher Benefit Services, Inc. (“Gallagher”) was selected to
conduct a comprehensive and systematic benchmarking analysis of the total compensation package for
the GM/CEO, including both external market-based factors and internal equity considerations, to ensure
competitiveness in pay practices. On November 16, 2022, Gallagher presented its Compensation
Analysis to the PC, including its finding that the GM/CEO’s current base salary of $374,887 (including a
7.7% cost of living adjustment required by the Agreement) at -3% of the market is highly competitive.

The Third Amendment provides that any Adjusted Base Salary and Incentive Compensation shall be
directly attributable to the GM/CEO meeting or exceeding the goals and metrics established by the Board
in consultation with Ms. Johnson. While the Board may wish to consider in a future performance period
whether to align the GM/CEO’s Adjusted Base Salary with the market by increasing it by 3%, no such
increase may occur at this time.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact for the action.

Re:

GM/CEO Evaluation

Evaluating the performance of an organization’s chief executive is one the most important roles a board of
directors must undertake. Pursuant to Article III (b) of the “Chief Executive Officer and General Manager
Employment Agreement (employment agreement),” as amended:
The Board will annually evaluate Ms. Johnson’s performance as Chief Executive Officer and
General Manager, and any Adjusted Base Salary and Incentive Compensation shall be directly
attributable to her meeting or exceeding the goals and metrics established by the Board in
consultation with Ms. Johnson consistent with Exhibit B to this Agreement. Ms. Johnson shall
have the opportunity to submit a self-evaluation for the Board’s consideration prior to the Board’s
issuance of any final performance appraisal.
Evaluation Documents
To provide context for your consideration, I am pleased to submit to you my self-evaluation and supporting
documentation for the calendar year 2022 performance period.
Attached hereto you will find the summary report of the surveys tied to the Strategic Priorities of Community
Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success. Also included is a spreadsheet detailing how, in the course
of my duty to the agency, I have demonstrated the organizational values we collectively hold to be true.
Please consider and refer to these documents as you conduct your measured evaluation of my performance.
Appraisal Criteria – Weighting
Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement, for this performance period, “the appraisal score shall be
comprised of 50% objective Success Outcomes and 50% subjective Organizational Values as adopted by the
Board pursuant to the Strategic Plan including any amendments thereto. For the performance period of January
1, 2022, through December 31, 2022, the Success Outcomes shall only include Community Value, Customer
Excellence, and Financial Success, with equal weight being to each for a total of 50% of the appraisal score.”
I welcome and look forward to receiving your candid appraisal and constructive feedback, as your structured
responses are critical in order for me to identify necessary changes, to redirect and focus efforts, and to best
carry out the Board’s overall direction.
Thank you in advance for your concerted efforts in this endeavor.

Comments:
2022 Success Outcome: 50% of outcome is that RTD spends less money than it receives
Examples of good financial stewardship:
• Assisted in coordinating with congressional delegation and federal advocates to recover Railroad
Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) loan credit risk premium of $30,267,508
• Partnered with Denver to utilize $6 million of their 50% for Denver Union Station improvements
• Refinanced 2014 Certificates of Participation for interest savings of $274 million over 20 years.
The transaction realized substantial value through the interest savings as well as lower
transaction costs through a direct placement with banks in addition to efficient use of the
remaining FasTracks bond authorization which was scheduled to expire in 2024
• Rapidly drawing down COVID relief and other grants. CARES, CRRSAA and ARPA will all be drawn
by the end of 2022 which has resulted in significantly higher invested balances that are estimated
to earn over $20 million in new revenue in 2023, thereby reducing the reliance on taxpayer
funding
• Aligned budget and MTFP with Strategic Priorities with a focus on the SOP and state of good
repair resulting in value by focusing expenditures where best applied for community value. Result
is a balanced budget and MTFP with full-funding and reserve maintenance forecasted for the
next six-years
• Implemented Account-based Ticketing (ABT), which provides community value by offering
convenient fare media, fare capping and expanded fare options and availability for customers
• Engaged with Directors and staff to provide support for the recommended outsourced internal
audit function as well as the establishment of the Audit Committee to ensure better governance
of RTD to provide public assurance of value received
2022 Success Outcome: 50% of outcome is that the community believes that it sees value in RTD's
spending
Responses to financial stewardship questions indicate 50% of customers agree RTD is a good
financial steward of public funds.

Attachment: 2022 GM-CEO Debra A. Johnson Self-Evaluation (4733 : Approval of General

1.C.1.b

Packet Pg. 23

SURVEY DESIGN
Both customer experience and community value survey instruments were based on survey
instruments developed in 2021

● Questions were directly related to RTD performance scorecard metrics
● Questions were largely similar to 2021 in terms of language and structure to ensure
comparability and allow RTD to track changes
● Select questions were revised to clarify intention (e.g., safety vs. personal security
questions)

● Surveys were administered in English and Spanish

Packet Pg. 25

KEY TAKEAWAYS
● Satisfaction and Net Promoter Scores (NPS) are down across all service modes and for
community members
● Paratransit customers continue to be the most satisfied across service modes
● Overall satisfaction and likelihood to recommend ratings indicate that RTD has a strong
customer base across service modes, and that a relatively small percentage of
customers is dissatisfied
● With improvements in key areas, RTD could drastically improve customer satisfaction
and NPS scores
► Bus and rail customers report lower satisfaction in key areas—including on-time performance,
service communications, security, and cleanliness—than in 2021

1.C.1.b

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
● Understanding changes in customer characteristics in terms of transit dependency and
economic stress is important for understanding customer satisfaction
► Compared to 2021, bus and rail customers are less likely to be transit dependent and more
likely to be looking for ways to save money

● Similarly, acknowledging broader socio-economic factors that continue to impact the
metro area, and identifying their impacts on customer experience is important in
understanding changes in customer satisfaction
► Statistical and qualitative information suggest that factors related to the unhoused,
cleanliness, violent crime, and drug use in public spaces continue to impact the metro area
and customer experience

► As those factors persist over time, without adequate response, customer satisfaction will likely
continue to drop

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
● RTD should consider whether any events potentially impacted participant responses,
including:
► Light rail derailment (September 21), which occurred just before the community survey was
launched (September 22)
► August Zero Fare month, which occurred shortly before the bus/rail survey was launched

Satisfaction vs. Importance
100%
NICE TO HAVES

90%

STRENGTHS TO MAINTAIN

For each service factor, the Key Driver Analysis compares its customer
importance ranking against its respective customer satisfaction level.
Based on that comparison, each factor falls into one of four quadrants:
Lower Priority: This quadrant comprises service factors that have
relatively low importance rankings and relatively low satisfaction levels.
Although these have lower satisfaction levels, they are perceived as less
important to customers and may have a smaller impact on overall
satisfaction.

Nice to Haves: This quadrant comprises service factors that have
relatively low importance rankings and relatively high satisfaction levels.
Although customers are highly satisfied in these areas, these areas are
perceived as less important to customers and may have a smaller impact
on overall satisfaction.

Strengths to Maintain: This quadrant comprises service factors that
have relatively high importance rankings and relatively high satisfaction
levels. Customers perceive these factors as highly important, and they are
satisfied with the service RTD provides in these areas. RTD should
maintain the current level and quality of service in these areas.

As described in the Additional Considerations sections of this
report, in addition to the service factors that customers ranked
as important, there are other service factors that are correlated
with overall customer satisfaction and likelihood to recommend.

ANALYSIS OF COMPARABILITY
The study team conducted extensive analyses to assess and ensure comparability
between 2022 and 2021 survey results and determined that, based on the following
information, results are highly comparable.
● The study team ran regression analyses on 2021 and 2022 survey data to examine the
relationship between overall satisfaction and the service factors that participants were
asked to rate, participant characteristics, and year. The analyses showed that, after
controlling for service factors and participant characteristics, year was not significant,
indicating that factors related to survey year alone, such as survey methodology, did
not significantly impact overall satisfaction. In contrast, key service factors were
significant, indicating that those factors significantly impact overall satisfaction, as
explained in Additional Considerations. The following slide presents those regression
results.

ANALYSIS OF COMPARABILITY
● Participant characteristics were largely similar across their respective surveys (i.e., bus,
rail, paratransit, and community) in terms of demographics, indicating the 2022 and
2021 survey efforts reached similar customers and community members.
● Different methods were used to administer the survey across bus/rail customers,
paratransit customers, and community members, but the same downward trend in
satisfaction ratings was observed across all surveyed groups, indicating that this year’s
lower ratings were not driven by survey method.
● The same telephone method was used in 2021 and 2022 to conduct the paratransit
customer survey, so that group serves as a control. The same downward trend in
satisfaction ratings was observed for that group, again indicating that this year’s lower
ratings were not driven by survey method.

ANALYSIS OF COMPARABILITY
● As illustrated by the examples below, as opposed to a consistent downward movement
in ratings across all rating categories (e.g., 1-5), there is immense variation in how
participants rated questions within the scale, indicating that the results are not driven
by a difference in how participants used or reacted to the rating scales between 2022
and 2021.
On a scale of 1-5 where 1 means 'Very Dissatisfied' and 5 means 'Very Satisfied,” please
rate your overall satisfaction with RTD’s bus/train service?

The bus/train usually runs on time.
