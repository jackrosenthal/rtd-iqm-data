## II. September Board Meeting Agenda Review

Chair Hoy briefly reviewed the September 26th Board Meeting agenda. He stated there were three items on the unanimous consent agenda and that there were no retirees for the month of September. He noted the possibility of a lengthy public participation segment due to discussion of the proposed R Line service changes. He said he had received 70 emails so far on the topic. He suggested that many people may attend the meeting and that each one who wished to speak would have three minutes to do so.

Motion:               Chair Hoy made the motion to approve moving the August 15th Board agenda to the full Board.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Chair Hoy declared that the motion PASSED unanimously.

## III. Other Matters

Director Deadwyler spoke further about the R Line service changes. She said she had received over 130 emails the previous evening regarding the service changes. She stated that the W Line was given a year to establish its ridership levels and that RTD’s process is to give each new service a year before making cuts. She asked why the R Line had not been given a year.

Chair Hoy agreed with Director Deadwyler’s statements and said that others he has spoken to agree as well. He said the timing of the cuts was poor and that the line should have been given a full year. He noted that the target opening date of the VA hospital was in the first quarter of 2018 and that Aurora’s Mayor Steve Hogan said that RTD should give the R Line a year or two to establish ridership. Chair Hoy said that waiting until March would give Mayor Hogan everything he needs. He noted the large volume of emails sent by people saying that RTD should not cut service levels and stated that RTD understands that not a lot of people are riding the R Line currently.

Director Deadwyler stated that the agency gave the W Line more than a year to establish its ridership, whereas the R Line has not been given six months. She said she did not see the reasoning to start cutting service.

General Manager Genova said that he had a lot of conversations with the group that put out the service change notice. Regarding the high volume of emails, he noted that the City of Aurora placed verbiage on a social media site for people to cut and paste into emails and said that Aurora had provided the contact information of certain Directors. He said the language in the emails is similar to that seen in a letter to the Board from Mayor Hogan. General Manager Genova agreed that the service change proposal was too severe at that point in time but noted that, at certain times of day on weekends and non-peak periods, the line only experienced 20 boardings per hour. He said that the next lowest performing line experiences at least double that number of boardings and stated that the agency would present the ridership information for the other lines to the Board. He said that the agency would create a response for Directors to send to constituents if they so chose. He took responsibility for the service changes as they were proposed but noted that the agency almost always makes modifications to service changes based on feedback from public meetings. He reminded the committee that, during the presentation in the Operations & Customer Service Committee on September 12, 2017, he mentioned the agency would look at other options, such as adjustments for non-peak and weekend service while maintaining 15-minute headways between Florida Station and Peoria Station. He said that Public Relations would get the message out but reiterated that the ridership for the R Line is well below anything the agency had ever seen and stated that the Board could decide to leave the current service levels as is. He said that staff wanted to communicate that the service changes are a process and at the end there will be a different proposal for the Board to consider.

Director Walker said that he had not heard about the volume of emails but did receive one email regarding the changes. He said that the Board always receives proposals from staff and that it is the Board’s responsibility to approve the best proposal. He said the Board does not have to accept proposals and can modify them. He said it was good to hear what staff thinks and stated that the community can request staff to change proposals as well. He said he is not concerned with the staff’s proposal and said that, through discussion, the agency can come up with a better solution for everyone. He said that staff was right to address the problem they saw and that the Board can always make changes.

Chair Hoy said that the matter will be resolved because the process allows that resolution to happen.

Director Deadwyler said her concern is for people who already ride the train. She said, with respect to the letter from Mayor Hogan, that she agrees that the R Line was not marketed. She reiterated that she could not see cutting service, especially with winter approaching. She said she would ask the Board to reconsider and give the line at least a year.

Chair Hoy said that everyone is on high alert now and that service and planning staff will look at alternatives because they realize they have stirred up a hornet’s nest. He said the staff will want to see the process go through to its conclusion.

General Manager Genova said he asked staff whether they could do an intermediate step for service reductions but decided to take that option off the table, because doing so cuts across the grain of the service change process.

Director Tisdale agreed with Director Deadwyler’s sentiments. He said that the agency may be too far out in front of the issue. He said that it was appropriate for staff to have brought the issue of the R Line’s ridership to the Board’s attention, because if they had not done so and had not suggested a plan to go forward, the Board would have criticized them somewhere down the road.

Chair Hoy said that the discussion could have been delayed until a subsequent run board in order to be sensitive to Aurora’s needs. He said that everyone was on the same page that service levels may have to be reduced. He said that day may not have been the best day to do so but noted that staff would prepare a response that each Director could use at their own discretion. He said that staff was in the field trying to do the best they could with the public relations issues.

General Manager Genova noted that RTD’s Public Relations team was working with media outlets at that time.

#### A. 2017-006 : Budget Transfer for Router Upgrades

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to approve a budget transfer from the Garage Concentrator Upgrade capital project and the Information Technology, Data Processing Services expense budget to the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project to fund the replacement of the network equipment needed on the rail lines. The targeted rail lines include the Southwest, Southeast and Central Platte Valley rail lines.

BACKGROUND

Network equipment that supports commerce and security activities on the Southwest, Southeast and Central Plate Valley rail lines are no longer in a state of good repair. The network equipment and switches need to be replaced as the technology is at end-of-life and may become unreliable.

The new network equipment includes multiple network switches and routers which connect to RTD’s core network infrastructure. Total estimated costs are not to exceed $900,000.

In 2015, a Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) funding request was made to replace equipment on one of the three rail lines. This project has $320,000 available. An unrelated project, the Garage Concentrator Upgrade project, was completed under budget and has $325,000 remaining that can be used for the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project. The Garage Concentrator Upgrade project originally included contract services to install the equipment. The Information Technology team opted to install the equipment using in-house resources resulting in overall project savings of $325,000. The remaining $255,000 needed for the Network Equipment project is available in the Information Technology expense budget.

DISCUSSION

As the district continues to lean more heavily on technology, our reliance upon the network infrastructure increases in need and criticality. For example, Ticket Vending Machines (TVM) accept credit cards. The network equipment that connects the TVMs to RTD infrastructure must adhere to Payment Card Industry standards. Moreover, this network equipment is used to transport information to the Public Information Displays (PIDs) on the platforms, and is used by security in support of the security cameras and emergency telephones.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The project budget will not exceed $900,000. $325,000 was previously approved in the SBP. This request is asking for permission to transfer $320,000 from the Garage Concentrator Upgrade Project and $255,000 from the Information Technology expense budget to the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project.

ALTERNATIVES

1.       Authorize the General Manager or his designee to approve a budget transfer from the Garage Concentrator Upgrade capital project and the Information Technology, Data Processing Services expense budget to the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project to fund the replacement of the network equipment needed on the rail lines. The targeted rail lines include the Southwest, Southeast and Central Platte Valley rail lines.  This is the preferred alternative.

2.       RTD replaces the equipment and switches on one rail line at a cost $325,000. This leaves two other rail lines at risk of equipment failure potentially leaving RTD unable to collect revenue, use emergency telephones, and collect security camera footage.

3.       RTD does not replace the legacy switch equipment on these lines and continues to use the existing equipment, some of which is not Payment Card Industry compliant. This puts the agency at risk of violating PCI endorsement.

#### B. 2017-007 : ITS Work Order Contract

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to Apex Design, PC (Apex) for an Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Work Order Contract (Contract Number 17DH010) for an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 over 5 years.  Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. Funding for these Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.

BACKGROUND

RTD has need of an on-call contractor to perform work in support of initiatives including Information Technology Governance; Service Provision, Acquisition and Contracting; Intelligent Transportation Systems, Emerging Technologies and Transit Business Operations.  The contractor will provide technical support of the agency’s broad range of technologies and applications. The Work Orders (WOs) will be short to mid-term periods.

DISSCUSSION

RTD conducted an open procurement for an ITS Work Order contractor.  Six firms submitted proposals.  The criteria used to evaluate the proposals was:

The five members of the evaluation team selected three firms for interviews.  Apex was selected as the successful proposer.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The contract authority shall not exceed $10,000,000.  Funding for these Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.  The types of funds are dependent upon the funding source of each individual project.  Individual work orders will be funded as the project requirement is processed.  The amount is not to exceed $2,000,000 in any one year.

ALTERNATIVES

1.       Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to Apex Design, PC (Apex) for an Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Work Order Contract (Contract Number 17DH010) for an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 over 5 years.  This is the preferred alternative.

2.       Provide the needed services with RTD personnel.  RTD personnel does not have the expertise or capacity for the work provided by a work order contractor.  This does not meet the needs of RTD.

3.       Advertise again and proceed with an entirely new procurement.  This would take well over six months and not likely result in a different outcome.

#### C. 2017-008 : Approval of Contract Extension for Special Event Ticket Sellers

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to exercise the final option year and increase the contract amount by $172,000.00 to extend the RTD contract with Central Parking System, Inc. to provide ticket selling services for special event fares through April 15, 2019.

BACKGROUND

RTD is currently contracted with Central Parking Systems, Inc. for a term of three years plus two option years.  The initial three-year period had a contract value of $448,336.09.  The first option year has been exercised increasing the contract amount to $598,336.09.  Exercising the final option year will add $172,000.00 to the contract authority for a revised contract amount not-to-exceed $770,336.09.

DISCUSSION

Ticket sellers are deployed to supplement ticket vending machines (TVMs) and Park-n-Rides during periods of high passenger volume for special events.  Providing these supplemental ticket sales avoids long lines at the TVMs, allows for more streamlined boardings and provides good customer service.  These ticket selling services are used during Rockies and Broncos games as well as other special events such as The Race for the Cure, large concerts, etc.

Central Parking provides the staffing necessary for these supplemental ticket sales.  RTD retains all fares sold by the ticket sellers and pays Central Parking for the staffing they supply.  The following shows the last three years of ticket sales performed by Central Parking.

The ticket sellers on the rail corridors are housed in secure booths at certain rail stations where high passenger volumes occur.  The booths have internet and power connections which allow the sellers to accept credit cards as well as cash.

RTD has contracted with Central Parking to provide the staffing for these supplemental ticket sales because RTD does not have enough staffing resources in-house.  During these events, RTD schedules additional coverage with RTD revenue technicians to service TVMs and also may provide some RTD ticket sellers that use handheld ticket selling devices.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Exercising the final option year will authorize $172,000 in contract funding.  Funding for 2017 is included in the 2017 Amended Budget approved by the Board of Directors in June 2016 and will be included in the 2018 Budget request.

ALTERNATIVES

1)      Authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to exercise the final option year and increase the contract amount by $172,000.00 to extend the RTD contract with Central Parking System, Inc. to provide ticket selling services for special event fares through April 15, 2019.  This is the recommended action.

2)      Do not approve the recommendation by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to exercise the final option year and increase the contract amount by $172,000.00 to extend the RTD contract with Central Parking System, Inc. to provide ticket selling services for special event fares through April 15, 2019.  This is not the recommended action because it would result in long lines to purchase tickets, uneven boardings and customer dissatisfaction.
