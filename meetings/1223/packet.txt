Subject:

North Metro Rail Line Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) with the City and County of
Denver

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the City and
County of Denver (CCD) and the Regional Transportation District. The agreement includes specific
terms defining CCD’s local agency contribution, coordination, and the rights and responsibilities of each
party associated with construction of the North Metro Rail Line within the City’s boundaries.
BACKGROUND
This IGA, like RTD’s previous commuter rail IGAs with CCD, sets forth CCD’s local match obligations
and establishes specific design and construction requirements within the City’s boundaries. This IGA
also incorporates provisions in RTD’s existing CCD/RTD Light Rail Master Agreement dated March
25, 1993 where appropriate for commuter rail.
DISCUSSION
This IGA between CCD and RTD establish the local agency contribution amount for CCD and how that
local agency contribution will be met. The IGA sets forth the commitments from RTD and CCD regarding
financial obligations, responsibilities, coordination, and cooperation between both agencies with respect
to the North Metro Rail Line.
Local Agency Contribution
The IGA stipulates that CCD’s local agency contribution will be $5M or 22% of the total local
agency contribution amount of $22.725M (2.5% of the total project cost of $909M as defined by
the 2010 Annual Program Evaluation).
The Parties acknowledge that credits held by Denver for its local agency contributions to other
FasTracks corridor projects covered by previous intergovernmental agreements between RTD and Denver
exceed the cumulative Denver share of the Local Agency Contribution for all FasTracks corridors,
resulting in an “Overmatch” which exceeds Denver’s Contribution under this Agreement. The Parties
agree that an amount of Denver’s Overmatch from other FasTracks corridors shall be applied in an
amount equal to Denver’s Contribution for the North Metro Project in full satisfaction of Denver’s
obligation to make a Local Agency Contribution for the North Metro Rail Line. If the reconciliation of
other FasTracks corridors should definitely show that this Overmatch does not exist or is insufficient to
cover Denver’s Contribution for the Project, then the Parties will take such action as necessary to amend
this Agreement or enter another IGA to assure that Denver’s Local Agency Contribution is satisfied.
The following items are also included in this IGA:


Certain terms of the CCD-RTD Light Rail Master Agreement are incorporated with no changes,
while other terms are amended as appropriate for commuter rail and this project.

Denver will be afforded opportunities to comment on any supplemental environmental studies
completed for the North Metro Rail Line within Denver’s boundaries.
Right-of-way processes are identified and clarified, including survey and monumentation and
approval of changes to final right-of-way plans.
National Western Stock Show (NWSS) station design, parking and timing are describ ed.
Land transactions required for project construction, including purchases, no-cost transfers,
exchanges and easements between CCD and RTD, are identified.
RTD cooperates with construction of fiber optic to support regional emergency
communications, providing easements and labor while CCD and others pay for materials.
RTD agrees to pay $6/sf for purchase and $2.50/sf for easements of park property, and to
fund traffic and planning studies near the NWSS station.
The parties agree to a process for determining and funding improvements related to project
construction.
RTD to provide funding toward future improvements on Brighton Boulevard as RTD’s
contribution to this work.

Summary
IGAs are required with CCD, as with other jurisdictions along the North Metro corridor, in order to define
the respective rights and responsibilities of each party, and to define the local agency share credit. The
recommendation is to authorize the General Manager to sign this agreement defining those rights and
responsibilities of RTD and CCD with respect to the North Metro Rail Line project. The signed IGA
defines coordination between RTD and CCD for the North Metro project and demonstrates that right-ofway and other coordination responsibilities have been defined.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial elements of the IGA are funded in the project budget for the North Metro Rail Line
project.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) between the City and County of Denver (CCD) and the Regional Transportation
District. The agreement includes specific terms defining CCD’s local agency contribution, coordination,
and the rights and responsibilities of each party associated with construction of the North Metro Rail
Line within the City’s boundaries.
2.
Do not accept the recommendation of the FasTracks Monitoring Committee. This would cause
the North Metro Rail Line project to delay or stop due to lack of right-of-way, and may increase costs
due to schedule delay. In addition an IGA is required to provide for FasTracks-required local match
determination, property acquisitions from CCD needed for the project, and responsibilities and
coordination. This action is not recommended.

16th Street Mall Reconstruction Project
Funding Intergovernmental Agreement with the
City and County of Denver

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager, or designee, to execute an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA)
between the City and County of Denver (CCD) and the Regional Transportation District. The
purpose of the IGA is to set forth the rights, duties and obligations of CCD and RTD to mutually fund
a portion of the project costs to design and reconstruct up to 3.5 blocks of the 16 th Street Mall
(Blocks 1, 2, 12 and 13) within the CCD Right of Way. This IGA commits both RTD and CCD to
provide matching local funds necessary to receive FTA Grant Funding. Funding for this project is
included in the 2013 Amended Budget
BACKGROUND
This IGA formalizes a local matching fund cost sharing requirement needed to secure an FTA “Bus &
Bus Facilities Livability Grant” that will be used to reconstruct a portion of the Mall. The Mall
reconstruction is needed because the current granite pavers and infrastructure have been used since its
October 1982 opening. RTD began maintaining the transit lane portion of the Mall within a few years of
its opening. Maintenance costs have steadily risen from under $100,000 per year to a current value of
approximately $1Million per year. Recent repair trends indicate that this value will increase if
reconstruction does not occur. The granite, other than its friction and color loss, generally is still sturdy
and durable. The paver setting bed and grout need continuous maintenance and repairs.
DISCUSSION
A recent pilot paver reconstruction program had tested alternative grouts and setting bed
applications. Lessons learned from that program have been applied to ongoing maintenance
activities and will be considered for the upcoming reconstruction project referenced herein. The three
and 1/2 block reconstruction project grant request was estimated at $16M. It included granite
transit paver reconstruction, walkway refurbishment and urban design upgrades, as itemized from
the grant application and shown below.
1. Transitway Paver Removal, Rehabilitation and Replacement.
2. Sub-Base Reconstruction for Transit Way Only.
3. Pedestrian Walk Way In-Situ Paver Resurfacing.
4. Intersection Bulb-outs for Pedestrian Safety. (Traffic signalization, camera’s, etc. not
Included)
5. Wet and Dry Utility Upgrade.
6. Urban Design, Trees, Water Features and Irrigation Improvements
7. Mall Livability Furnishing Element Upgrades.

Packet Pg. 39

2.B.1

The FTA grant plus local match was approved for approximately 2/3 of the requested value. The
final project scope and limits will be refined during the current design process. The required local
match is 20%. The approved FTA value is $7,978,998.00 and the local match is $1,994,749.50.
The total grant and local match are $9,973,747.50.
The local match was to be shared by three parties: RTD, CCD and the DDP/BID with an equal cost
sharing of $664,915.50 per party. The City and County of Denver has agreed to provide DDP/BID’s
1/3 part plus their 1/3 share for a total obligation to CCD of $1,329,831.00. RTD’s sh are is the
remaining 1/3 - $664,915.50, which brings the collective agencies’ contributions to $1,994,749.50.
The IGA also addresses the design and construction management for the project and identifies RTD
as the managing entity. RTD will lead the design and construction management of this project with
support from stakeholder agencies. All agency direct costs with the exception of management time
will be reimbursable.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the total project, RTD’s local match of $664,915.50 and the CCD contribution of
$1,329,831 toward the local match, is included in the 2013 Amended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager, or designee, to
execute an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the City and County of Denver (CCD)
and the Regional Transportation District. The purpose of the IGA is to set forth the rights, duties
and obligations of CCD and RTD to mutually fund a portion of the project costs to design and
reconstruct up to 3.5 blocks of the 16 th Street Mall (Blocks 1, 2, 12 and 13) within the CCD
Right of Way. This IGA commits both RTD and CCD to provide matching local funds necessary to
receive FTA Grant Funding. Funding for this project is included in the 2013 Amended Budget.
2. Delay implementing the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because delaying the
implementation of the IGA has serious impact to the schedule and budget and ability t o utilize
approved grant funds that would cause an extended delay or possible cancellation of the project.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because this would cause
major delays in project implementation and budget impacts resulting from the loss of
$7,978,998.00 in grant funding plus local stakeholder shares. The result would be escalating
maintenance costs for the proposed blocks.

Status of Key Tasks
• Northwest Rail phasing assumptions:

– Requires 10,000’ of unobstructed ‘chambering’
track (approx. 2 miles north of end of line station)
– ‘Chambering’ track would be incorporated into
future segments of commuter rail
– Requested additional clarification/information from
BNSF; BNSF indicated a willingness to work with
RTD when funding for the corridor is identified
