BOARD CHAIR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Adoption of Board Operating Guideline Amendments

March 21, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
March 26, 2024

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board to adopt the amendments to the Board’s Operating Guidelines.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
On January 26, 2019, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 1 Series of 2019, which set
forth the RTD Board Operating Guidelines (Guidelines). That resolution calls for the Board to “recommit
annually, during a meeting in the first quarter of each year, to uphold these principles and to amend
them as necessary to reflect current practices.”
In February 2024, the Board Office worked with Chair Davidson to make initial recommendations on
potential amendments to the Guidelines. Chair Davidson then asked for additional
input/recommendations for Secretary Guzman and Treasurer Bouquet. The Executive Committee then
considered these changes during its February 2024 meeting, and the Board Office subsequently solicited
feedback from the remainder of the Board following the meeting.
Based on the feedback received, the Guidelines have been updated and are returning to the Executive
Committee as a Recommended Action.
DISCUSSION
The proposed amendments are now coming forward to the Executive Committee as a Recommended
Action. Upon approval by the Executive Committee, the proposed amendments will be considered as a
Recommended Action during the Board’s March 2024 meeting.
Notable proposed amendments include:
•

Sharing in advance notice of forthcoming media engagements/stories

Packet Pg. 5

1.3.A

•
•

•

•

Sharing in advance planned amendments or changes to action items that will come before the
Board for consideration
Using committee or board meeting time, whenever practicable, to first discuss a major item,
before bringing the item back the subsequent meeting as an action item
Prioritizing attending in-person meetings in person
Utilizing committee work plans
Modifying a reference to incomplete FasTracks projects
Removing references to former General Counsel Rolf Asphaug’s memos to the Board

This discussion aligns with the strategic priority of Employee Ownership as the Board has the ability to
model effective professional interaction for the rest of the agency.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to RTD for the Board to review and/or amend the Guidelines.

RTD BOARD OPERATING GUIDELINES
LAST UPDATED: TBD
BOARD COMMITMENT
Our Board is committed to public transit and the strategic goals of the Regional Transportation
District. In meeting this commitment, we appreciate that the Board adds the greatest value when
it focuses on and helps clarify policy issues and plans, including the policies that underpin capital
and operating budgets. In setting policies and plans, the Board must understand the vision and
mission of RTD and its immediate and future priority objectives for coming years as well as the
long-term strategic plan. The Board appreciates that it must position RTD to be able to respond
flexibly, effectively, and transparently to unique factors as they present, including the current
organizational shift in focus from capital development to operations and maintenance with the
exception of identifying suitable solutions to finish the remaining FasTracks corridors, challenges
in optimizing service levels in order to meet customer demands, and the introduction of evolving
transit technologies, in order better to serve our constituents in new and varying ways. As elected
officials, we each represent different districts with differing needs, and we have a responsibility
to each of our constituents and to the overall well-being of the agency as a whole. We also
recognize that this Board, by statute, has both policy-setting and executive functions it must
perform.
BOARD VALUES
We value the collective Board wisdom that is gained through considered deliberations. Thus we
value openness in our discussions, diversity of perspectives, and civility in our conversations. We
also place a premium on deliberations that are both efficient and effective. Recognizing that
issues will vary in their complexity, we value timely decision-making.
STEPS TO ENHANCE BOARD EFFECTIVENESS
In order to enhance our effectiveness, we, the members of the RTD Board of Directors, support
the following efforts:
REGARDING GOVERNANCE POLICY-SETTING
o
o

o
o

To acknowledge and respect the difference between governance and
management of the agency
To focus its efforts on conducting discussions regarding policy-setting and
strategic planning at official meetings and retreats, while avoiding attempts to
engage in management
To establish common goals, specific next steps for the near term, and a longterm vision for the agency
To strive to effect organizational change through interactions with the General
Manager resulting from consensus action or majority vote of the body, rather
than through the actions of individual Board members

Re:

RTD Board of Directors Customs Relating to Board Meetings

This memorandum (1) discusses Special Rules of Order, Standing Rules, and Customs
relating to RTD Board Meetings; and (2) sets forth RTD staff’s understanding of the
current Customs relating to RTD Board meetings. (There are no current Special Rules of
Order or Standing Rules adopted by the RTD Board.) Normal rules of order in the Bylaws
can be suspended or supplemented by special rules only by a two-thirds vote, and some
rules cannot be suspended.1 By contrast, standing rules and customs can be revised
going forward, or modified for any particular matter, by majority vote of the Board.2
This memo begins by explaining the purpose and authority for Special Rules of Order,
Standing Rules, and Customs. The meme then discusses the differences between Special
Rules of Order as opposed to Standing Rules and Customs. The memo then sets forth
RTD Board Meeting Customs as currently understood by RTD staff. These Customs
include such matters as:











Voting through RTD’s software system
Requesting the right to speak through RTD’s software system
Voting in Committee meetings by Directors attending by phone
Participation of RTD staff in Board and Committee discussions
Participation of Directors by phone in executive sessions
Location and authorization of public videotaping equipment
Time limits and other restrictions on public comments and questions
Recognition of retiring employees
What is “old” and “new” business
Placement of executive sessions when there are multiple Committee meetings

There may be other Customs that apply to RTD Board meetings but that have simply not
yet come to anyone’s attention. This memo will be updated as such Customs are
identified or if and when the Board adopts any Special Rules of Order or Standing Rules.

Attachment: 2019 Resolution - 001 RTD Board Operating Guidelines (4900 : Adoption of Board Operating Guideline Amendments)

A. Introduction: Definitions, purposes, and authority for Special Rules of
Order, Standing Rules, and Customs
Special Rules of Order, Standing Rules, and Customs do not replace the RTD Bylaws
themselves, any provisions set forth in Robert’s Rules of Order, or any statutory
requirements such as laws governing executive sessions. Instead, RTD’s Board Bylaws
state:
“The current edition of Robert’s Rules of Order, newly revised, shall govern
parliamentary procedure for the Board and its Committees except as herein provided
or as otherwise provided by law.”3
Robert’s Rules recognizes that neither it nor an organization’s bylaws can address all
procedures that are used for meetings. Robert’s Rules therefore recognizes the roles of
“special rules of order,” “standing rules” and “customs” in filling gaps not covered by an
organization’s bylaws or Robert’s Rules.4 (Robert’s 11th ed., pp. 18-19).
1. Special Rules of Order
Robert’s Rules explains Special Rules of Order as follows:
“The term rules of order refers to written rules of parliamentary procedure formally
adopted by … an organization. … The usual and preferable method … is … to place
in its bylaws a provision prescribing that the current edition of a specified and
generally accepted manual of parliamentary law shall be the organization’s
parliamentary authority, and then to adopt only such special rules of order as it finds
needed to supplement or modify rules contained in that manual.”5
Robert’s Rules notes that when, as with RTD, a source such as Robert’s Rules is
identified as the parliamentary authority “except as herein provided or as otherwise
provided by law,” a special rule of order cannot supersede anything within Robert’s
Rules except by a two-thirds vote.6 Certain rules of order can never be superseded –
such as fundamental principles of parliamentary law7 – but others can be suspended for
a particular matter by a two-thirds vote.
Unanimous consent is a good way to save time by suspending the rules, effectively
creating a one-time special rule. For example, a member may “ask unanimous consent
to suspend the rules” to adopt some non-controversial resolutions before proceeding to
3

RTD Bylaws, Art. XIII (11/29/2016).
Robert’s Rules, Sec. 2, pp. 15-19.
5
Robert’s Rules, Sec. 2, p. 15.
6
Robert’s Rules, Sec. 2, p. 17; and Sec. 25, pp. 260-267.
7
Examples of such fundamental principles includes the rule that allows only one question to be
considered at a time (note, however, that this rule does allow unanimous consent agendas); and
rules giving the right to vote to a nonmember or an absentee member. Robert’s Rules, Sec. 25,
p. 263. The basic rights of individual members can also not be suspended except through
disciplinary action. Robert’s Rules, Sec. 25, p. 264.

1.3.A.b

another matter, and in doing so “can briefly give sufficient information to enable the
members to vote intelligibly on his undebatable motion.”8 If anyone objects, a formal
motion to suspend the rules is taken up.
2. Standing Rules
Robert’s Rules explains Standing Rules as follows:
“Standing rules … are rules (1) which are related to the details of the administration
of a society rather than to parliamentary procedure, and (2) which can be adopted
or changed upon the same conditions as any ordinary act of the society. An example
of such a rule might be one setting the hour at which meetings are to begin, or one
relating to the maintenance of a guest register. Standing rules generally are …
adopted … individually if and when the need arises. A standing rule can be adopted
by a majority vote … provided that it does not conflict with or amend any existing
rule or act of the society.”9
RTD currently has no Board-adopted Standing Rules: i.e., rules relating to details of
administration of its meetings rather than to parliamentary procedure, adopted by the
Board through motion and majority vote. Instead, RTD’s Bylaws are detailed in
prescribing certain administrative requirements.
3. Customs
Robert’s Rules describes Customs as follows:
“In some organizations, a particular practice may sometimes come to be followed as
a matter of established custom so that it is treated practically as if it were prescribed
by a rule. If there is no contrary provision in the parliamentary authority or written
rules of the organization, the established custom should be adhered to unless the
assembly, by a majority vote, agrees in a particular instance to do otherwise.
However, if a customary practice is or becomes in conflict with the parliamentary
authority or any written rule, and a Point of Order citing the conflict is raised at any
time, the custom falls to the ground, and the conflicting provision in the
parliamentary authority or written rule must thereafter be complied with. If it is then
desired to follow the former practice, a special rule of order (or, in appropriate
circumstances, a standing rule or a bylaw provision) can be added or amended to
incorporate it.”10
The rest of this memo summarizes RTD’s Board meeting Customs as understood by RTD
staff.

B. Customs at RTD Board Meetings
The following are established Customs at RTD Board meetings, as currently identified by
RTD staff. (RTD staff currently knows of no Special Rules of Order or Standing Rules.)
There may be other Customs that apply to RTD Board meetings but that have simply not
yet come to anyone’s attention. This memo will be updated as such Customs are
identified or if and when the Board formally adopts any Special Rules of Order or
Standing Rules.
1. Voting through RTD’s software system
RTD uses a special software system to display the agenda, the current location in the
agenda, Director requests to speak, and Director votes.
a. Unless the Chair of a meeting determines that the software
has malfunctioned, a Director’s vote may not be changed
after votes flash on the screen except by unanimous consent.
RTD employs an electronic voting system intended to ensure that all Board members
vote at the same time, instead of some members basing their votes upon how others
have voted. Once everyone has registered their votes on their computer terminals, the
final tally flashes up on the screen.
RTD’s custom is that the flashing up of the results on the screen constitutes the official
“announcement,” after which a vote may be changed only through unanimous consent.
This Custom is consistent with a primary purpose of the voting software: to prevent
vote-changing and to make the simultaneous “reveal” of all votes on the screen the
official “announcement.” This Custom is also consistent with Robert’s Rules, which
provide that a member may change her or his vote at any time up to when the result is
“announced.” After that, a change may be done only by unanimous consent.
For this reason, it is very important to make sure Board members understand the effect
of a “yes” or “no” vote, especially in votes on amendments or procedural matters.
b. For Committee meetings, Directors attending by phone
should state their vote before the electronic vote is
conducted. Their vote is then added to the result on the
screen, and the Chair states the final vote and result.
c. If the software system is inoperable, for matters involving a
recommended action or another act of a general or
permanent nature, Directors must vote by a roll call vote as
required by the RTD Bylaws.11
RTD Bylaws, Art. V, Sec. 5(a), p. 13. The Bylaws authorize “a roll call or electronically recorded
vote by the Executive Director to the Board …” Shows of hands, voice votes, etc. are only
permitted for other action. RTD Bylaws, Art. V, Sec. 5(e), p. 14.

1.3.A.b

2. Requesting the right to speak through RTD’s software system
a. The Chair should recognize Director requests to speak, or to
ask questions of staff, in the order of speaker requests set
forth in the software system.
b. The Chair may allow reasonable, brief follow-up questions.
c. Once all Directors on the screen have been given the
opportunity to speak at least once, the Chair should ask each
Director attending by phone whether they wish to speak.
d. After all Directors have spoken, the Chair may speak
concerning a matter.
3. Participation of RTD staff in Board and Committee discussions
a. After a staff Recommended Action item is moved and
seconded, RTD staff are customarily asked by the Chair to
provide an introductory explanation of the item without the
need for questions and answers.
b. Subsequent questions by Directors are handled as Director
requests to speak. RTD Board meetings generally allow direct
questions to staff or other Directors, and responses, without
the need to go through the Chair, but the Chair retains
discretion to handle the conduct of comments and questions.
4. Accessibility, including accessible visual aids and recordings
a. Visual aids and recordings at Board meetings should be made
accessible to participants with visual or hearing impairments.
b. Speakers should generally identify themselves by name and
title before beginning to speak.
5. Participation of Directors by phone in executive sessions
a. Directors may not participate by phone in executive
sessions.12
12

At some recent meetings, Directors were allowed to participate by phone in executive sessions.
Upon further review, it appears that Directors have not historically participated by phone in
executive sessions. Participation by phone is problematic in that other attendees cannot verify
that attendance is limited to permitted participants. As with any other custom, the Board could
vote to allow phone participation on a case by case basis. In such case, staff recommends that

6. Location and authorization of public videotaping equipment
a. Public videotaping equipment is only permitted at such
locations as authorized by RTD Transit Police and must not
disrupt the meeting.
7. Time limits and other restrictions on public comments and
questions
a. Public comments are limited to three minutes in length.
b. Questions from the public will not be answered at the
meeting but will be noted for future response.
c. Public officials are allowed to speak first.
8. Recognition of retiring employees
a. Retiring employees are recognized at the start of RTD Board
Meetings.
b. Retirees who are present are generally honored with a
statement by their AGM and/or manager and are invited to
give a brief statement.
9. What is “old” and “new” business
a. “Old business” is limited to the narrow category of nonrecommended action items that have been postponed to a
time certain at a previous Board or Committee meeting.13

Our Board is committed to public transit and the strategic goals of the Regional Transportation
District. In meeting this commitment, we appreciate that the Board adds the greatest value when
it focuses on and helps clarify high-level policy issues and plans, including the policies that
underpin capital and operating budgets. In setting high-level policies and plans, the Board must
understand the vision and mission of RTD and its immediate and future priority objectives for
coming years as well as the long-term strategic plan. The Board appreciates that it must position
RTD to be able to respond flexibly, responsiblyeffectively, and transparently to unique factors as
they present, including the current organizational shift in focus from capital development to
operations and maintenance with the exception of identifying suitable solutions tothe capital
project of finishhing the remaining FasTracks corridors, challenges in optimizing service levels in
order to meet customer demands, and the introduction of disruptive evolving transit technologies,
in order better to serve our constituents in new and varying ways. We appreciate that, asAs
elected officials, we each represent different districts with differing needs, and we have a
responsibility to each of our constituents and to the overall well-being of the agency as a whole.
We also recognize that this Board, by statute, has both high-level policy-setting and executive
functions it must perform.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Appointment of Director Lewis to the Operations and
Safety Committee

March 21, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
March 26, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to ratify Director Lewis’ appointment to the Operations and Safety
Committee.
REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Chair, RTD Board of Directors
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On December 7, 2021, the Board of Directors amended the Board Bylaws. Article VI: Committees of the
Board, Section 1: Standing Committees, states that, “Each year the newly elected Executive Committee
will appoint between five and seven Directors to the other standing committees based upon Director’s
stated interest in serving on standing committees, and the Board will ratify the selections.” The amended
Bylaws also provide that the Chairs and Vice Chairs of the other standing committees will be selected by
the members of the committee. However, the Bylaws do not provide clear direction on how to fill a
vacancy on a committee.
On January 10, 2024, former Director Kate Williams provided notice that she was resigning from the
Board. On February 27, 2024, Director Jaime Lewis was sworn in to succeed former Director Williams.
On March 12, 2024, Director Buzek resigned his seat on the Operations and Safety Committee effective
upon the adjournment of the March 13, 2024, Operations and Safety Committee meeting, thus creating
a vacancy for newly sworn in Director Lewis to fill.
DISCUSSION
The Executive Committee is asked to provide its approval of the Chair’s recommendation to appoint
Director Lewis to the Operations and Safety Committee for the balance of 2024. If appointed by the
Executive Committee to the Operations and Safety Committee, Director Lewis’ appointment will be
subject to ratification by the full Board during the March 2024 monthly meeting. Currently, Director
Lewis does not serve on any committees of the Board.
In adopting this recommended action, the Board seeks to meet the Strategic Plan priorities of Customer
Excellence, Community Value, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success by ensuring each of its
standing committees are set up for successful collaboration as well as effective governance and policy
making decisions.

COMMITTEE WORKPLAN APPROVAL
Committee Meeting Date:
Approval of the 2024 Executive Committee Work Plan

March 21, 2024

COMMITTEE ACTION
For the Executive Committee to approve the 2024 Committee Work Plan.
REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Chair, RTD Board of Directors
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the January 30, 2024, regular Board meeting, the Board of Directors approved a Bylaws
amendment calling for each standing committee of the Board to draft and approve an annual work plan.
The work plan before the committee will cover meetings from April 2024 to February 2025.
Annual committee work plans are a useful tool for ensuring the Board and staff collaborate effectively to
accomplish the necessary work of the agency and Board, while providing dedicated space for the Board
to pursue governance/policy objectives and gain further insights into matters of interest to Directors.
Work plans elevate and respect the role of the committees of the Board as some of the most effective
forums for completing the work of the Board.
Per the Board Bylaws (Article VI, Section 1, c.), the Executive Committee “will review and establish the
agenda for each regular meeting of the Board, and address public affairs, external relations, legislation,
and ministerial matters affecting the Board.”
DISCUSSION
The Committee discussed this item at its January 11, 2024, meeting and Directors offered further input
following the initial discussion. Board Office Executive Manager Kroll also reviewed the plan with the
General Manager and CEO and General Counsel, garnering further input.
Directors are asked to review and make any additional changes to the work plan before voting to
approve the work plan.
Once approved by the Committee, the work plan will be forwarded to the full Board for review. The
approved work plan may be adjusted by the Chair of the Board in consultation with the Board’s First
Vice Chair and responsible RTD staff.

Packet Pg. 31

1.3.C

This discussion and approval align with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer
Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success, as the Executive Committee’s ability to
effectively govern directly impacts the overall performance of the agency. An organized committee work
plan will ensure RTD’s resources are used efficiently, and that the Board’s policy and governance
objectives are more focused, collaborative, and obtainable.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Monthly Government Relations Report – March 2024

March 21, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2024 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board-adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections.
It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and federal elected
officials. To achieve these goals, RTD Board members and staff must be proactive in educating and
informing the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared
goals.
In furtherance of the program, the agency’s Government Relations Officer coordinates and develops
strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve as a point of contact
for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable government relations highlights at the federal, state, and local levels since
the last Executive Committee meeting held on Thursday, February 22, 2024. This report was prepared
on Wednesday, March 13, 2024, and will be updated verbally as needed during the Executive
Committee meeting scheduled for Thursday, March 21, 2024.
Federal
On Saturday, March 9, 2024, President Biden signed a package of federal fiscal year (FFY) 2024
appropriations bills. This package included the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development bill that
funds the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), the approval of which resulted in a
Congressionally Directed Spending allocation of $850,000 for RTD’s Near-term Downtown Rail

Reconstruction Project. Additionally, a full year’s appropriation was approved for the Federal Transit
Administration’s Capital Investment Grant Program needed to award grant funding for RTD and City and
County of Denver’s East Colfax Ave Bus Rapid Transit project – an important step toward finalizing
grant funding.
Regarding discretionary grant opportunities, RTD actively works with municipal partners to support
various projects that have a benefit to transit customers. During the most recent USDOT Rebuilding
American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grant funding period, which closed on
Wednesday, February 28, 2024, RTD supported three projects submitted by municipal partners in
alignment with the Strategic Priority of Community Value. Below is a listing of the application submitted
that RTD supported.
1. City and County of Denver – Proposed project would provide funding to complete a pedestrian
bridge to connect the N Lines National Western Center stop to the CSU Spur Campus
2. City of Lafayette – Proposed project would implement multimodal infrastructure improvements to
the intersection of 195th Street and CO-7 that supports future planning on the CO-7 corridor
3. City of Thornton – Proposed project would make transit customer access improvements to transit
services along 104th Avenue in Thornton
State
Regarding Senate Bill 24-032 (SB32), Methods to Increase the Use of Transit, sponsored by Senators
Kevin Priola and Sonya Jaquez Lewis and Representative Stephanie Vigil, the bill has been advanced to
the Senate Appropriations Committee and has not been calendared as of the writing of this report.
On the topic of potential legislation related to RTD, as previously reported, staff is not aware of any bill
draft that addresses RTD Board governance or other legislative requirements related to RTD.
Additionally, a bill draft has been circulated, and received by staff for review on Tuesday, March 12,
2024, that generates funding and gives direction to RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation,
and the Front Range Passenger Rail District to coordinate and partner on efforts related to rail service on
the Northwest corridor. Staff is still assessing this bill draft as of the drafting of this report and will
update the Board verbally.
Local
At the local level, RTD continues to actively engage with local municipal partners:
• On Tuesday, February 27, 2024, Director Sloan, Director Harwick, Director Catlin, RTD’s
Government Relations Officer, and RTD’s local affairs contractor attended a staff briefing with
the Jefferson County Board of Commissioners
• General Manager and CEO, Director Tisdale, Director Dishell, and Director Catlin participated in a
meeting with the City of Littleton on Thursday, February 29, 2024
• Most recently, on Thursday, March 7, 2024, Director Sloan, RTD’s Government Relations Officer,

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Draft Property and Station Naming Policies

March 21, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the January 25, 2024, Board meeting, the Board provided direction to have staff work with
Directors Sloan and Ruscha to review RTD’s current station naming policy, which is comprised of three
prior Board actions (1994, 2003, and 2011), to coalesce that policy into a unified document, and to
propose a means by which the Board could add to an honorary name to an RTD property or station.
A group comprised of Director Sloan, Director Ruscha, Government Relations Officer Michael Davies,
and Board Office Executive Manager Jack Kroll has met three times, in addition to correspondence by
group members via phone and email, since the January 2024 Board meeting. During these discussions
the group reviewed RTD’s current policies and analyzed policies from other transit agencies (Corpus
Christi Regional Transportation Authority, Houston Metro, Los Angeles Metro, Washington Metropolitan
Area Transit Authority). Additionally, the group drafted and revised the attached policies and procedures
for review. The group received additional input from senior staff as well as Director Rosenthal.
Enclosed with this discussion item, Directors will find a document that coalesces and proposes a few
minor changes to RTD’s Station Naming Policy, as well as a subsidiary document defining the policies
and procedures for the Board to add an honorary name to an RTD property.
DISCUSSION
The group working on the proposed policies and procedures is now seeking the feedback of the
Executive Committee as well as the full RTD Board of Directors on the same. Key elements of the
proposed items are as follows:
•

•

Updating the universe of RTD property covered under the naming policy to include administrative
buildings and maintenance facilities. Thus, the policies and procedures were revised and/or
drafted to cover the naming of RTD properties and stations
Declaring the primary property or station name will remain wayfinding/geographic identifier and
that honorary names will be secondary to the primary name

Packet Pg. 41

1.5.2

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Requiring significant local, public input and support in the form of a completed application packet
submitted to the Board via the Board Office before considering an honorary name
Creating a committee comprised of internal and external parties to review proposed honorary
names and issue a recommendation to the Board on whether to adopt the name
Clarifying that the board may waive the costs to external entities of renaming a station or
property
Requiring staff to brief the Board on the costs of updating or adding an honorary name to a
property or station
Emphasizing honorary names may not violate any existing naming agreement
Stating that events as well as groups and organizations could be the source of an honorary name
Requiring the honoree to have contributed significantly to public transit nationally or within the
RTD
Requiring the honoree, if an individual, to have been deceased for a minimum of 10 years before
becoming eligible
Prohibiting former RTD Board Members from receiving the honor

While feedback is welcome on any elements contained or missing in the proposed documents, the group
would especially appreciate feedback on the following:
•
•
•
•

The composition of the review committee and whether there should be Director involvement at
that stage of the process
Whether to require a two-thirds or simple majority vote in order to bestow an honorary name on a
station or property
Whether to develop a rubric for the committee to use in evaluating proposed honorary names
Whether the proposed requirements to submit an honorary naming proposal are too burdensome
or too easy

Next steps in this process are for the Executive Committee and Board to discuss and provide further
feedback to the group. The group will then take that feedback and incorporate it alongside additional
feedback from staff before returning to the Board in April with two recommended actions. The first
recommended action will be to adopt an umbrella Property and Station Naming Policy that coalesces the
input received in this process along with the requirements set forth in the Board’s prior actions in 1994,
2003, and 2011. The second action will be to adopt a subsidiary Honorary Property and Station Naming
Policy with associated procedures.
It should be noted that, in the course of its work, the group identified areas the Board may wish to
explore further once work is concluded on the above. That work would be to: review existing policies
and procedures related to public art on RTD properties and stations; discuss the possibility of creating a
policy and an associated process for enacting a temporary honorary name for an RTD station or
property; and review and discuss holistically the current policy that allows for RTD stations to be eligible
for corporate sponsorships.

Packet Pg. 42

1.5.2

This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priority of Community Value as RTD approaches naming its
properties and stations in alignment with the goals and desires of the communities in which RTD’s
facilities are located.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
While there is no direct fiscal impact to changing the Board policies discussed above, there would be
significant costs to change the name of any existing RTD property or station.

The primary property name shall remain, in accordance with the broader Property and Station Naming Policy, a
wayfinding/geographic identifier.
SCOPE
The policy applies to rapid transit stations, rail stations, park-n-rides, transfer centers, other major passenger
facilities, maintenance facilities, and administrative buildings.
An honorary name may not violate any existing naming agreement.
Sponsorships will not be considered for a station with an honorary name.
AUTHORITY
The Board shall approve any amendments to this policy and associated procedures.
REQUIREMENTS OF AN HONORARY PROPERTY NAME
The following criteria will be evaluated prior to the Board’s consideration:
1. Documented significant contributions to public transit nationally or,
2. Documented significant contributions to public transit within the RTD, or
3. Documented direct connection with a significant event occurring in the vicinity of the property subject to
a potential renaming, and
4. Demonstrated public support for the proposal contained in a completed honorary property name
application (see accompanying procedures), and
5. A review by the Honorary Property Name Proposal Review Committee, and
6. Two-thirds majority vote of the Board is required to approve of any secondary name

Highlighted text = new text not contained in prior board actions

POLICY
RTD aims to establish property and station names that are recognizable to our customers as destinations. Per
Board policy passed in 1994 and reaffirmed in 2003 and 2011, RTD stations are usually named for the nearest
street intersections, major cross street, or the name of the geographic location of the area. Names should be
kept relatively short so that they will fit efficiently on destination signs, station signs, maps, and other materials.
RTD staff will work with local governments and stakeholders to develop station/facility names for new stations
that differ from the above policy as long as:
•
•

•

The name is recognizable to the general traveling public
The name does not incorporate any trademarked names with value to the private sector or that have
commercially-viable or valuable benefits (absent compensation to RTD as described under sponsorships
below)
The name does not violate any existing naming agreement

SPONSORSHIPS
RTD may, with Board approval, sell naming rights, via a request for proposals-type process, to RTD stations and
facilities under a multi-year contractual agreement provided:
•
•

•

The core station/facility name must remain as a “location identifier” for the traveling public
To be considered as viable, the sale of naming rights would need to generate positive net revenue to
RTD after fully accounting for RTD’s costs of changing the station/facility name (station signs, maps,
collateral material, recorded announcements, etc.) as well as foregone revenue from other sources
The name does not violate any existing naming agreement

NAME CHANGE COST
Entities proposing name changes under this policy would be required to absorb all associated costs, unless the
Board determines otherwise.
HONORIFIC PROPERTY NAMES
The Board may opt to add, as a secondary name to any RTD station or property, an honorific name. The policy,
procedures, and requirements of which are set forth in the separate, subsidiary Honorary Property and Station
Naming Policy.
An honorific name can be applied only if doing so does not violate any existing naming agreement.
SCOPE
The policy applies to rapid transit stations, rail stations, park-n-rides, transfer centers, other major passenger
facilities, maintenance facilities, and administrative buildings.

BACKGROUND
The 37 service changes proposed for May 2024 facilitate opportunities for bus and rail operators to
select new work assignments and for the Service Development Division to adjust the overall operations
plan for the agency’s transit network. Additionally, with the Board’s adoption of the Reimagine RTD
System Optimization Plan (SOP), several of the service change proposals reflect the first phases of SOP
implementation to provide the best possible value to customers.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: benefits and services are provided
without regard to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority
populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Service Equity Analysis Requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a

Packet Pg. 71

disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The May 2024 service change
proposal includes two major service changes out of 37 total changes. Thus, an analysis is required to be
brought before the Board for its consideration. The complete Title VI Service Equity Analysis report is
included in Attachment A.
Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service
changes will be subject to an equity analysis.
Title VI Policies:
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10
percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10 percent more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150
percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
DISCUSSION
Staff proposes changes to 31 bus routes and six rail lines in the forthcoming May 2024 service change.
Of these 37 changes, two services have proposed additions or reductions to service 25 percent greater
than that of baseline service and thus meet established thresholds for a major service change. Those
routes are shown in bold in the following table.

Methodology: Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line
level and system level to identify any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or
income.
Summary of Findings:
• Potential disparate impacts and disproportionate burdens were identified at the individual route
level: of the two routes/lines that had major service changes, one route (the Free MetroRide) had
a potential disparate impact finding and one route (the Free MallRide) had a disproportionate
burden finding.
•

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate, at the system level, to
determine overall impacts to equity (i.e., minority and low-income) populations compared to nonequity (i.e., non-minority and non-low-income) populations.
o

At the system level, service decrease on the Free MallRide stands to impact minority
populations less than non-minority populations (0.39% vs. 0.82%, respectively). The
difference does not surpass the disparate impact threshold of 0.90%. Therefore, no
systemwide level disparate impact finding is found with the proposed major service
decrease. However, low-income populations stand to be impacted more than non-lowincome populations (1.07% vs. 0.59%, respectively). The difference exceeds the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold of 0.65%. Therefore, a system level disproportionate
burden is found with the proposed major service decrease.

o

At the system level, reinstatement of the Free MetroRide stands to benefit minority
populations less than non-minority populations (0.20% vs. 0.24%, respectively). This
difference meets the disparate impact threshold of 0.21%. Therefore, a system level
disparate impact finding is found with the proposed major service increase. Conversely,
low-income populations stand to benefit more than non-low-income populations (0.47%
vs. 0.19%, respectively). The difference is above the 10% disproportionate burden
threshold of 0.17%. Therefore, no system level disproportionate burden is found with the
proposed major service increase.

Conclusion:
Although the two major service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact and a disproportionate
burden at both the route and system level, RTD recommends keeping the May 2024 service plan as
proposed as there are no practical alternatives to avoid, minimize or mitigate the disparate impact (Free
MetroRide) and disproportionate burden (Free MallRide). The substantial legitimate justification for the
Free MallRide service reduction is evident as this change is due to ongoing construction on the 16th
Street Mall and the Near-Term Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project. Moreover, the Free MetroRide
service increase will be utilized as a mitigation measure (i.e., providing customers with alternative
connection between Denver Union Station and the Central Business District) due to the downtown rail
reconstruction project, providing the substantial legitimate justification for the reinstatement.

In adopting this report, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community
Value while maintaining compliance with Title VI federal regulations. RTD will continue to assess the
equity implications for all subsequent service change proposals and will propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Service Equity Analysis: May 2024

2.18.C.a

Executive Summary
This document summarizes the analysis of major service changes proposed for the May 2024 runboards to
ensure that the changes will not inequitably impact minority and low-income populations.

Methodology
RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group levels to identify
any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes
RTD proposes changes to 31 bus route/patterns and six rail lines of RTD’s forthcoming May 2024 runboard. Of
these 37 changes, two services meet established thresholds for a major service change. Although meeting the
threshold of 25% for a major service change, the suspension of the L Line during downtown rail reconstruction
project will be a temporary change in service during the May 2024 runboard and will be reinstated in September
2024; this proposed service change falls below the threshold of major service changes based on timeline of the
change. The routes tabulated below have proposed adjustments to service that were greater than 25% of
baseline service and will remain in effect for 12 or more months.
Service Adjustments (1 service)

Free MallRide: Reduce service to 10-minute headways

Service Reinstatement (1 service)

Free MetroRide: Reinstate in accordance with System
Optimization Plan and to provide alternate services during
downtown rail reconstruction project

Findings

Major service changes included in the proposed May 2024 service changes include a reduction of service on
the Free MallRide and reinstatement of the Free MetroRide previously suspended in April 2020. These routes
both serve high concentrations of low-income populations in central Denver.
When considering the demographics within the service area (within a quarter mile) of a major service increase
and as a proportion to the District overall, low-income populations received a greater increase in service (i.e.,
were more positively impacted) compared to non-low-income populations. Low-income areas received 0.28%
more of a benefit than non-low-income areas. However, minority areas received less of an increase in service
(i.e., were less positively impacted) compared to non-minority populations. Minority areas benefitted 0.01% less
than non-minority areas. For population within the service area impacted by a service decrease, low-income
areas were impacted more than non-low-income areas. Low-income areas were negatively impacted 0.48%
more than non-low-income areas. Conversely, minority areas were less impacted than non-minority areas,
receiving 0.43% less of an impact from service decreases compared to non-minority areas.
Finally, a potential disparate impact and a potential disproportionate burden were identified at the individual
route-level: the Free MallRide had a potential disproportionate burden finding and the Free MetroRide had a
potential disparate impact finding.

Introduction
Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver region.
An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit service without
regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact
on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that are proposed to occur between the
current and proposed runboards. Routes with major service changes include one major increase and one
reinstatement of a formerly suspended route pattern. These changes and all others have been reviewed
individually at the route/line level and in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential impacts to the
communities RTD serves.

Service Change Philosophy
An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD. These
changes include the addition of new routes/lines, the elimination of existing routes/lines and changes to the
alignment and trip frequency within existing routes/lines. RTD has established principles to identify the service
changes needed to meet the diverse travel needs of those within the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system.

RTD Service Changes Guiding Principles
•
•
•
•
•
•

Service performance evaluation based on service standards
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without
regard to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority
populations
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes depending on service type, route alignment and frequency.
Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all routes within each class.
RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in ridership and operational
performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify services that are
underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. In keeping
with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish performance metrics used to
identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses these metrics to identify a series
of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of the proposed major service changes on minority
populations and low-income households at or below 150 percent of the Department of Health and Human
Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact
Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating service change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service
changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.

a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes,
but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects
and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10
percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150%
of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and
RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources and Methodology
Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5Year Estimates for years 2018 to 2022 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level. Other data
related to the analysis includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into
a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with changes in service at a
geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts to district equity communities.
The equity analysis for the May 2024 runboard looked at whether an individual route’s major service changes
impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the proportional difference in changes
made to equity populations within a route’s/line’s quarter-mile service area. These proportional differences were
compared against district population proportions of equity populations and route/line proportions of equity
populations.
Low-income status for population within the District is derived from the Census Bureau and is based on 150%
of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services guidelines), based on local
context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of three. Minority status was based on the non-white
and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area was based on the collection of block groups
within district boundaries.
Route/line service area population was determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area was then used to calculate the percentage overlap of block groupbased population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contained 100% of the underlying block group,
100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block group
was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).

2.18.C.a

RTD calculated the net change in service hours for each route/line modification to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change at or above 25% from baseline was flagged as a major service change
for further review.

Public Outreach Overview
Three public meetings were conducted March 6-7, 2024. The comments collected on service changes during
these meetings are summarized in the table below. In addition to the general outreach, the Transit Equity Office
reached out to 97 key public activity centers surrounding the routes/lines to inform them of the proposed major
service changes, how to provide feedback and encourage community members to attend the open houses.
Table 1 captures the meeting locations, dates, number of attendees and the common themes of attendees’
comments pertaining to the two major service changes described in this analysis.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden
Analysis

Proposed service changes for the May 2024 runboard that resulted in a 25% or greater change in service were
categorized by equity population (minority or non-minority, low-income or non-low-income) for comparison.
Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their identification within the prior (current)
network using 2018-2022 ACS five-year demographic data.
A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to review the routes/lines individually. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the District. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of Disparate Impact (for minority populations) or Disproportionate Burden (for low-income populations) and was
flagged for a finding of potential impact.

Changes by Transit Mode

For the May 2024 runboard, 31 bus routes will undergo various service changes. Of these, 5 routes will see
combined increases in bus service of over 56 total weekday revenue service hours and 62 additional
weekend service hours. While cancelling each other out, the decrease in service on the Free MallRide with
reinvestment of its resources into reinstating the previously suspended Free Metro Ride service both exceed the
major service change threshold. The reduction on the Free MallRide allows for 90 new weekday revenue service
hours for the Free MetroRide, providing another option between Denver Union Station and Civic Center Station.

Major Service Change Review

A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases (service increases of 25% or more related to new or restructured service)

Major Service Change Reductions
The Free MallRide is proposed to have reduced service in light of continuing construction work on the downtown
16th Street Mall and in anticipation of the downtown rail reconstruction project. The service hours reduced on
the Free MallRide are proposed to be reinvested to reinstate the Free MetroRide.
The L Line is proposed to be temporarily suspended due to Near-Term Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project
during the May 2024 runboard but will be reinstated prior to the September 2024 runboard.

Major Service Change Increases
One bus route had a proposed major service increase which includes service increases of 25% or greater. The
reinstatement of the Free MetroRide is proposed for the May 2024 runboard to mitigate impacts of the
downtown rail reconstruction project and provide additional service through downtown.

Route- and Line-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route/line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (DI) and/or
Disproportionate Burdens (DB). Both service reductions and service increases are analyzed. For service
increases, the analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority
and low-income populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse
effects of the reductions are disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.

Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the District’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were reviewed
for potential DI or DB findings. For service increases, the following analysis examines the extent to which the
benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and low-income populations. Because these are proposed
service increases, protected populations falling below these thresholds are flagged for potential concerns. The
narrative analysis of each individual line follows, which includes further considerations of access to jobs,
education, health care, food and social services for minority and low-income populations.
Free MallRide

Proposal: Due to ongoing construction work on the 16th Street Mall and in anticipation of downtown rail
reconstruction project, it is proposed to reduce frequencies on the Free MallRide to 10-minute headways
from every 5 minutes. This change will free up operator resources to reinstate Free MetroRide service,
the reinstatement of which will also help mitigate impacts of the rail reconstruction project.
As shown in Table 3, a higher percentage of the District’s low-income population stands to be impacted
by the proposed major service decrease as compared to non-low-income population (0.75% vs. 0.43%,
respectively). This difference exceeds the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.47%). Therefore, a
potential route-level disproportionate burden is found requiring further examination (i.e., access to key
public service destinations, community engagement and network level analysis). However, a lower
percentage of the District’s minority population is impacted from the proposed major service decrease as
compared to the non-minority population (0.36% vs. 0.56%, respectively). This difference falls below
the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.62%). Thus, there is no disparate impact found at the route level.

169 retail/convenience stores
40 human and social services centers
2 senior housing and facilities
11 colleges, high schools, middle schools and elementary schools

Free MetroRide

Proposal: In accordance with the System Optimization Plan, ongoing 16th Mall construction and in
anticipation of downtown rail reconstruction project, reinstatement of the Free MetroRide service is
recommended to give customers alternative connection between Denver Union Station and the Central
Business District.
As shown in Table 4, a higher percentage of the District’s low-income population stands to benefit from
the proposed major service increase as compared to non-low-income population (0.81% vs. 0.50%,
respectively). This difference does not meet the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.45%).
Therefore, no potential route-level disproportionate burden is found. However, a lower percentage of the
District’s minority population stands to benefit from the proposed major service increase as compared to
the non-minority population (0.44% vs. 0.60%, respectively). This difference exceeds the 10% disparate
impact threshold of 0.54%. Thus, a potential disparate impact is found at the route level requiring further
examination (i.e., access to key public service destinations, community engagement and network level
analysis).

Systemwide Analysis
In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program Update, a systemwide analysis is required in addition to routeand line-level analyses. A system level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for
Title VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring
further review. Once average District thresholds for low-income and minority populations were established,
subsequent equity analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service
changes of 25% or greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major
service changes experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes
with major service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group
levels (block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•
•

Systemwide, bus service increases by over 55 weekday revenue hours
Of the over 31,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes, lowincome populations represented a higher share of population than District averages. Of this total, nearly
8,500 low-income people would receive service improvements
At the systemwide level, equity routes and non-equity routes1 were compared only for those with major
service changes. The two bus routes with major service changes both serve above-average low-income
populations and are classified as low-income routes

In review of the Free MallRide and Free MetroRide at the systemwide level, there are potential
disproportionate burden and disparate impact findings, respectively.
An analysis of all district block groups and their service levels was conducted to establish the baseline equity
thresholds for low-income and minority populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of
the January 2024 to May 2024 service change. Block groups with low-income and minority populations at or
above the district average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas on-low-income and
non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

Based on existence of the route within the January 2024 network and the population within a quarter mile of bus stops
or rail stations. 2018-2022 5-Year ACS estimates were used for population identification.

Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (14.2%) and
minority population (37.5%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in population for equity
versus non-equity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for potential
adverse impacts.

There are 2,197 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District.2 Using the 2018-2022
5-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the total
minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the District-wide lowincome and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average.
While the percent minority figure of 37.5% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.064
million), the low-income population percentage of 14.2% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure
(3.02 million). This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine.3
The thresholds summarized in Table 5 yielded 824 (37.5% of all) block groups above the district average for
low-income population, and 846 (38.5%) block groups above the district average for minority population.

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate by transit mode to determine overall impacts
to underlying population. Table 5 summarizes the change in service for block group population underlying the
bus stops with proposed major service decreases proportionally compared to population in the District, while
Table 6 summarizes impacted block group population for major service increases. These comparisons review
the equity composition of those who may be impacted by proposed service changes compared to the overall
equity composition of the District overall. No major service changes (longer than 12 months) were proposed for
rail services with the May 2024 runboard.

2

Some block groups are not completely contained within district boundaries due to differences in boundaries between the
District and Census-defined geographies.
3
The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total population due to
the inability of the Census to determine income for everyone estimated to reside a particular block group.

For system-level service decreases (service decrease on the Free MallRide), non-minority populations stand
to be impacted more than minority populations (0.39% vs. 0.24%, respectively). The difference does not
surpass the disparate impact threshold of 0.43%. Therefore, no system-level disparate impact finding is found
with the proposed major service decrease. Low-income populations stand to be impacted more than
non-low-income populations (0.65% vs. 0.27%, respectively). The difference exceeds the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold of 0.30%. Therefore, a system-level disproportionate burden is found with

Summary of Findings
The systemwide service modifications proposed between January 2024 and May 2024 include schedule
adjustments, suspension of school trips, changes to summer schedules and trip availability and additional service.
The major service changes were entirely focused on bus services with a major service decrease on the Free
MallRide and a major service increase on the Free MetroRide.
Route-level Findings:
•
•

•

Of the 37 total services with proposed changes, taken individually, 2 had potential findings.
The Free MallRide has a potential disproportionate burden finding due to low-income
populations receiving +0.32% more impact than non-low-income populations. Minority populations
received 0.20% less of an impact than non-minority populations.
The Free MetroRide has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving
0.16% less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations benefited 0.31% more than
non-low-income populations.

Systemwide-level Findings:
•
•

•

The Free MallRide and Free MetroRide comprise the May 2024 runboard’s systemwide major service
decreases and increases, respectively.
For the proposed service increase on the Free MetroRide, of the almost 6,900 people located within the
block groups that include the route’s stops, low-income population represented a higher share of the
population than District averages, indicating targeted services to low-income populations. Low-income
populations received a greater increase in service (were positively impacted more)
compared to non-low-income populations. Low-income areas benefited 0.28% more compared to
non-low-income areas. However, minority populations received a lower increase in service
(were less positively impacted) compared to non-minority populations. Minority areas
benefited 0.03% less compared to non-minority areas. This difference met the disparate impact
threshold; therefore, a system-level disparate impact was found with the proposed change.
When considering the proposed service decrease on the Free MallRide for the demographics within the
block groups that include the route’s stops and as a proportion to the District overall, minority
populations were impacted less compared to non-minority populations. Minority population
areas received 0.15% less of an impact compared to non-minority areas. This was below the disparate

impact threshold; therefore, no systemwide disparate impact was found. However, low-income
populations as a received 0.38% more of an impact than non-low-income populations. This
was above the threshold for a potential disproportionate burden; therefore, a potential disproportionate
burden was found with the proposed service decrease.
Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether there is an alternative
that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or disproportionate burden on
low-income customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals.
Alterations to the initial proposed May 2024 service changes4 include reduction of service on the Free MallRide
and reinstatement of the Free MetroRide, both of which serve low-income populations at rates higher than the
District average.
RTD recommends keeping the May 2024 service plan as proposed as there are no practical alternatives to
avoid, minimize or mitigate the disparate impact (Free MetroRide) and disproportionate burden (Free MallRide).
The substantial legitimate justification for the Free MallRide service reduction is evident as this change is due to
the ongoing construction work on the 16th Street Mall and the Near-Term Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project.
Moreover, the Free MetroRide service increase will be utilized as a mitigation measure (i.e., providing customers
with alternative connection between Denver Union Station and the Central Business District) due to the
downtown rail reconstruction project. Thus, providing the substantial legitimate justification for the
reinstatement.
Additionally, the overall potential benefits of the proposed service plan to customers are significant, with a
greater benefit to minority and low-income customers. Specifically, a total of 13 of the 16 minor changes are
considered minority bus routes and a total of 10 out of 16 are considered low-income bus routes. These minor
changes include improvements to on-time performance for 14 bus routes, stops being added to one bus route
to improve operations and transit access and the introduction of all-day service to one bus route to mitigate
impacts on rail service due to construction.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
May 2024 Service Change Proposals

March 13, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
March 26, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the May 2024 Service Changes as revised and summarized in
Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators impacted by these changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) shared between RTD and the Amalgamated Local Transit Union Local 1001, the May
2024 Service Change Proposal facilitates both an opportunity for RTD bus and rail operators to vote new
work assignments and the opportunity for Service Development staff to adjust the operations plan for
RTD’s transit network.
Along with the continued workforce challenges, light rail projects related to the coping panel
replacement in the Southeast Corridor and the first phase of the downtown rail reconstruction project on
the Central Corridor are primary considerations shaping the service change recommendations for May
2024. Both projects are expected to span from May 2024 until the following service change, having
significant impacts to rail service and the transit network serving the downtown Denver area.
DISCUSSION
The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, reductions, and adjustments aimed at
addressing the reliability of the system network and preserving transit access during major rail
reconstruction efforts. Notable recommendations include proposals to reduce service frequency on
Southeast Corridor, including the E and H lines, in response to construction activity limiting speeds and
track access in the construction area. Additionally, rail services on the D and H lines are proposed to be
redirected from the Central Corridor to instead serve Denver Union Station (DUS). L line service is
recommended to be suspended during the construction period, with alternative service available on the
Route 43 – Martin Luther King Jr/Gateway bus route. Reintroduction of the Free MetroRide is also
recommended, supported by reductions in service on the Free MallRide to provide better circulation
between Civic Center Station and DUS.

Packet Pg. 119

2.18.D

Following the guidelines contained in the Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Customer Excellence
and recognizing the RTD’s workforce challenges, the proposals herein are directed at improving on-time
performance, maintaining CBA compliance and adjusting service levels to match anticipated summer
ridership demand.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
A summary of the list of service proposals are provided below, which are detailed in Attachment A.
Summary of Public Hearings
Three public hearings were conducted:
• Wednesday, March 6, 2024 March 6, 2024, at noon (virtual)
• Wednesday, March 6, 2024 March 6, at 5:30 p.m. (1660 Blake Street, Rooms T & D)
• Thursday, March 7, 2024, at noon (virtual)
These meetings have been recorded and are available for review. Written communications and public
comments collected during this public comment period have been summarized and listed in Attachment
C of this report.
Revisions to Preliminary Modifications
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service modifications are communicated to the Board. Depending on the outcome of the
public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose revision to these initial
modifications. The following modifications have been added or significantly revised:
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue: minor schedule adjustments to improve operator respite time
Route 48 – East 48th/Commerce City: schedule adjustment to address on-time performance
Route 49 – Commerce City: schedule adjustment to address on-time performance

May 2024 Service Change Recommendations - Attachment A

Free MetroRide
In accordance with the System Optimization Plan, with the ongoing 16th Mall construction and in
anticipation of downtown rail replacement work, reinstatement of the Free Metro Ride service is
recommended to give customers alternative connection between Denver Union Station and the Central
Business District. The level/frequency of service will vary based upon detour impacts.
Estimated cost: 10 all day vehicle blocks weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.
GS – Golden/ Boulder
Current On-Time performance: Weekday: 78.3% on-time, 15.7% late

NB – Eldora/ Nederland/Boulder
Seasonal change requiring short-turn trips at Nederland High School, due to Eldora Ski Resort not being
in operation. No cost impacts anticipated.
RX – Brighton/ Denver Express
It is proposed to consolidate the current 5:24pm and 6:48pm northbound trips and to provide 1
northbound trip, from Civic Center Station, at 6:10pm, due to low ridership. It is also proposed to shift
the current 5:04pm northbound trip to 5:10pm, to better balance the overall headways/schedule.
Ridership Max Load: 5:24pm – 3.63pax/hour; 6:48pm – 3.77pax/hour; 5:04pm – 6.54pax/hour
Anticipated cost impact: reduction of 1 tripper (1PTE)
SKIP – Broadway (Boulder)
Reduce weekday service frequency for summer. No cost impacts anticipated.
FLEXRIDE
Platte Valley FlexRide
Current ridership performance: .4 boardings per hour
It is proposed to remove the flex route and to allow Platte Valley FlexRide to operate as a regular FlexRide
service within the newly proposed boundaries of: Federal Blvd to the west, Alameda Ave to the south,
Colfax to the north, and Santa Fe to the east. This service will operate from 5:30am to 6:00pm.

Attachment: May 2024 Draft Attachment A (4898 : May 2024 Service Change Proposals)

Free MallRide
As a means of supporting circulation of customers in the downtown area during the first phase of the rail
replacement project, a reduction of frequency on the Free MallRide to 10-minute service is recommended.
This change will allow operator resources to reinstate Free MetroRide service, thereby reducing the
effects of intersection closures during the project.
Estimated savings: 10 all-day vehicle blocks

Evergreen FlexRide
Current ridership performance: 3.2 boardings per hour weekday, 2.3 Boardings per hour Saturday

May 2024 Service Change Recommendations - Attachment A
It is proposed to combine the Evergreen North and Evergreen South FlexRide service areas into a singular
service area.
RAIL
Two different projects are expected to start in the summer of 2024. One project resumes the coping
panel project in May through September (four months). The rail replacement project is expected to start
in June of 2024 and is a multi-year project to replace rail infrastructure along the downtown loop and
Welton alignment. The first phase of this project involves replacing track at 5 intersections in downtown
Denver. This phase is expected to be concluded in September 2024. Additionally, light rail service spans
are recommended to be reduced; in efforts to increase track maintenance time during late night/early
morning time periods Sunday-Thursday.

D Line – 18th & California to Littleton-Mineral Station
It is recommended that D Line service be replaced with the former C Line pattern of service (Mineral
Station – Denver Union Station) renamed “Special Service Train” for the duration of the downtown Denver
rail replacement project. Service span reduction (2.5 in-service hours) to 5:00am to 11:00pm in-service
Sunday - Thursday. Friday and Saturday service spans would be maintained from 5:00am –2:00am.
Using current data ridership impacts are estimated to be 91 boardings, Sunday-Thursday.
No resource impacts are anticipated.
E Line – Union Station to RidgeGate Parkway Station
Schedule adjustments related to coping panel project will be necessary to accommodate reduced
operating speeds in the Southeast Corridor. Service frequency will be reduced during the peak periods.
Service span reduction (3.5 in-service hours) change to 5:00am to 10:00pm in-service Sunday Thursday. Friday and Saturday service spans would be maintained 5:00am –2:00am. Using current data,
ridership impacts are estimated to be 129 boardings Sunday-Thursday.
No resource impacts are anticipated.
H Line – 18th & California to Florida
Due to coping panel work resuming and rail replacement work taking place in the downtown loop it is
recommended to modify/replace service on the H Line with the J Line pattern, operating Florida Station
to Denver Union Station until the downtown Denver rail replace project is completed. Service span
reduction (3 in-service hours) to 5:00am to 10:00pm in-service Sunday - Thursday. Friday and Saturday
service spans would be maintained 5:00am–2:00am. Sunday-Thursday service span reduction would
impact 93 customer boardings, based upon current ridership data.

N Line – Union Station to Eastlake & 124th Station
Current ridership performance: Saturday 110.7 boardings per hour
It is proposed to extend on Saturday evening, one southbound at 11:13 p.m., and northbound at 11:56
p.m. responding to increased customer requests, supported by increased ridership in the existing trips
preceding the proposed trip times. The last three northbound trips are averaging over 94 boardings.
Cost: 90 additional minutes, 0 full-time employees
R Line – Peoria Station to RidgeGate Parkway Station
Schedule adjustments related to coping panel project will be necessary to accommodate slower operating
service in the Southeast Corridor. Expected impacts are minimal, with no anticipated resource impacts.
Service span reduction (3.5 in-service hours) to 5:00am to 10:00pm in-service Sunday-Thursday. Friday
and Saturday service spans would be maintained 5:00am–12:00am. The service span reduction is
anticipated to impact 215 customer boardings Monday-Thursday.
W Line -_Union Station to Jeffco Government Station
Recommended service span reduction (3.5 in-service hours), adjusting available in-service span from
5:00am to 10:00pm Sundays-Thursday. Friday and Saturday service spans would be maintained at
5:00am –2:00am. The service span reduction would impact 328 customer boardings, based on current
ridership.

Brandon Figliolino conducted the meeting with staff from Service Development and
Communication present. After a brief presentation of RTD’s updated fare policy, Coping
Panel and Downtown Rail Replacement Projects, public comments were heard:
Harcourt, Daniel E
Expressed his disapproval of the impacts caused by the coping project on light rail services.
alerting customers of operations plans during special events and severe weather events. He
also suggested that with other rail system it is possible to handle major projects without the
reduction in service that is being recommended. He stated that the proposed hourly service
is untenable. He also mentioned that the Light Rail system delays were also horrible in the
past year and wanted to be assured that RTD would do a better job in the upcoming
project.
Dr. Scott Ramming PhD PE
Dr. Ramming asked question about same platform transfers between the E and H Lines. He
also stated that he believed the Route 43 would not provide customers with an opportunity
to transfer to rail services south of the downtown area. He suggested the Route 43 be
extended to provide better connections. Dr Ramming had a follow up question concerning
the L Line construction process and LED signage installation.
B Heintzman
Also asked what RTD plans to do in the case of severe weather, noting an event in the
previous year where passengers were affected by a thunderstorm that shut the system
down with no alternative service. He also asked if there is a plan to address rush hour
service when trains are overfull. Similarly, RTD’s plans for special events such as Rockies
games or events at the Ball Arena and whether or not those organizations have been
coordinated or communicated with regarding the detours.

Asked why there isn’t a system map showing the RTD bus and rail service. He also asked if
consideration was given to provide service to the Colorado Rapids games. Additionally, he
wanted to know if RTD had considered creating routes that connect the rail network in a
circular fashion.
UI Caller
Asked whether there were plans to reinstate the Route 128 service.

Wednesday, March 6, 2024
RTD Administrative Offices Rooms T&D 5:30pm

Chris Tenorio
Expressed safety concerns. For example, bus route 51 block 3 had an operator from an RTD
contractor who got out of his driver’s seat and aggressively confronted two passengers over
bus fare. The C and F Lines should be reinstated so customers who need to travel from
Littleton to Union Station or travel from RidgeGate to the downtown central business district
can do so without the inconvenience of transferring. Chris has observed unhoused
populations congregating at the Sheridan Station and observed multiple incidents of open
narcotics usage at the station and on the train. Furthermore, this customer had to
resuscitate a person on the train from an apparent fentanyl overdose. The route 35 should
also run later to accommodate customer needs.
Loren Hansen
Stated that the E and H Line reduction to 60-minute frequency is unacceptable. They stated
one friend they know is moving to a different home due to the reduction in rail service
frequency. They are happy about the 0L and MetroRide proposed service changes. RTD
needs to provide more parallel bus service to supplement the rail service for customers in
that corridor while the coping panel and downtown rail maintenance projects are impacting
service. Loren also stated thanks for TTD holding this meeting and hosting a space for
customers to provide feedback,
Jackson Lee
Wanted to know if RTD looked into the possibility of short-turning the E Line at I-25 /
Broadway to increase service frequency outside the limits of the coping panel project. Will
the 0L be running bi-directionally? Did RTD look into if the 0L or a shuttle would be most
efficient? Does the Platte Valley FlexRide replace the fixed-route trolley? What led to that
decision? Will the MetroRide adhere to the goals outlined in the SOP? Regarding the D and
H Line announcements: how will RTD ensure that customers know that the train is routed to
Union Station during this runboard? Signage on the train in the past have stopped displaying
correctly after several days, can we guarantee that signage will display correctly during the
rail projects? Why is the service span of the W Line being reduced if it is not impacted by
the coping panel and downtown rail projects?

Brandon Figliolino from the Community Engagement Department facilitated the
presentation, and Martin Romero, Transit Equity Manager, was also in attendance. Service
Development staff in attendance included Jessie Carter, Tegan Rice, Maux Sullivan,
Jonathan Wade, Greg Filkin, Clara Bechtel, Matthew Biskey, and Sam Lewis. RTD staff
member. There were 10 members from the public in attendance, 6 wanted to share
comments. Director Jaime Lewis representing the RTD Board of Directors was also present.
Meeting comments are noted below:

Emily Christensen
Commented that classes at the Colorado School of Mines get out at 9pm and therefore has
concerns about the W Line’s proposed service span reduction. The cost of living in Golden is
so high that so many students must live closer to downtown Denver and rely on the W Line
to get to class. With this reduced service span, there are concerns that students will not be
able to travel from class to the W Line station before the last train departs. RTD should
please communicate with the School of Mines to alert students and staff that this change is
coming so customers can plan ahead. Emily noted that about 500 people work at the
Southlands Mall in Aurora and when Emily has asked why more of them don’t utilize RTD,

Ryan
Commented that the R Line to A Line connections are much better, thank you. Operators are
super friendly and dedicated, and that is much appreciated. Ryan also is grateful for RTD
crews who shovel snow early in the morning to make the stations safer. Ryan has observed
RTD working harder and longer to meet customer needs, and that is appreciated. Ryan
commented that the Denver Rescue Mission and state leadership deserve commendation for
their efforts to address open drug use, and he appreciates that it is not solely RTD’s
responsibility to fix.
Drake Harrison
Noted that the shifts at work that this customer can take are limited by the route 139
schedule. An expanded service span would allow for more flexibility in work schedule,
allowing to take shifts that end at 11pm. Regarding RTD’s hiring initiatives, Drake has not
observed a push to hire more, it is not obvious that RTD is doing enough to advertise
employment opportunities at RTD.

March 7, 2024, 12:00PM
Virtual Meeting via MS Teams
Brandon Figliolino conducted the meeting with staff from Service Development and
Communication present. After a brief presentation of RTD’s updated fare policy, Coping
Panel and Downtown Rail Replacement Projects, public comments were heard:
Tyler Walker
Stated that the frequency proposed for the Southeast Corridor was too big of an impact to
many customers, asking whether or not frequency could be increased to 30 minutes. He
also wanted to know if the changes were permanent.

Attachment: Attachment C (4898 : May 2024 Service Change Proposals)

they have expressed that hourly headways are too difficult. They also expressed that 30minute frequency would allow them to take the bus. The route 135 should run every 30
minutes and not hourly, and the route 139 should run later in the day. Exposure to the
elements gets difficult, can connection times at the Smoky Hill & Picadilly Park-n-Ride be
improved? Later Emily asked where is RTD advertising for employment opportunities and
where is RTD hosting hiring events?

Cody Bryan
Expressed concern about the reduction of service span on the W Line mentioning how it
would impact travel to and from DEN. He also stated that he would like to see the service s
Thomas Topero
Stated that operators were not given clear instruction during the Coping Panel project in the
past year. He asked if RTD had checked with the operators on light rail about their
experiences and suggestions. He described a situation where Controllers and Operators
were not in sync. He also felt the hourly frequency would be inadequate. He also expressed
that the current system doesn’t allow operators any decision making which a negative

impact on customers attempting to make connections.
UI Caller
Asked for an update on the construction at the Table Mesa Park and Ride.
UI Caller
Has the district considered providing train replacement bus service along the affected
routes?

Asked if there were any plans to use unused parking spaces at RTD station for Transit
Oriented Development. He also wanted to know if there were any further considerations for
BRT service.
Brett Paglieri
Is very displeased that there is not replacement service during the train shutdowns and then
the light rail train shutdowns, specifically with the Eline and the L lines. He believes that
there could be bus replacement that replicates the service that's being taken offline.
He also stated that “hourly [service] is in my book, basically nonexistent service.”
He also wanted to know why the service wasn’t all being done at night rather than
impacting service during the day. He stated that other agencies like CalTrans have
completed similar work with better service frequencies. He also questioned the reduction in
span of service on the W Line. He also asked for clear definition on when the project will
end.
Sean
Expressed a displeasure with the amount of time given for the review of the proposal and
the brevity of the information given to the public. He is more than concerned about the
reduction in service frequency on the light rail and suggested that RTD do a better job at
connecting bus and rail transfers and distribution of service frequency on bus routes, using
the Routes 65 and 73 as examples. He believes parallel service should offset times of travel
to offer greater options for customers.

Rangaraj, Saigopal
Stated that he is very disheartened by the change in frequency of service on rail and would
like to suggest that the Board provide clear aspirational goals toward creating 15-minute
frequency on all rail lines in the future. He also stated that for future policy changes RTD
consider the ill effects of reducing service will have on getting voters to support transit in
the future.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Project Management Support Consultant Contract Award

March 13, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
March 26, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to award a Work
Order contract to Triunity, Inc. for Project Management Support Consultant services. The contract is for
three base years, with two additional one-year options exercisable at RTD’s discretion. The total Not-toExceed amount for the first three years is $20,500,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Acting Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
BACKGROUND
RTD will supplement professional staff for areas of specialized expertise, part-time and limited duration
assignments, and job positions that are difficult to fill. RTD currently has a Construction Management
Support Consultant services contract expiring in July 2024; if a successor contract is approved, the
consultant will oversee major projects and new programs planned for Summer 2024 and beyond.
On December 15, 2023, RTD solicited a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for Project Management
Support Consultant (PMSC) services. The selected Consultant would function as an extension of RTD’s
staff by providing a range of project support services, including the Near-Term Downtown Rail
Reconstruction projects. Such projects will support the Strategic Priority of providing Community Value,
and more specifically the Strategic Initiative of Back to Basics.
DISCUSSION
The solicitation resulted in three submissions, one of which was determined to be non-responsive to the
RFQ requirements. An internal cross functional evaluation team then reviewed Technical Proposals from:
1. HNTB
2. Triunity, Inc.
This was a qualifications-based selection, with price not being a factor in the selection. The specific
criteria for evaluation were:
1. Project Team Composition
2. Proposer Capability
3. Past Performance on Similar Projects
4. Discussion of Rail and Other Asset Replacement/Repairs

Packet Pg. 138

2.18.E

Following individual team member evaluations, the team met for a consensus evaluation during which
Triunity, Inc.’s (Triunity) submittal was selected as the best qualified. The highly experienced project
team has direct experience with RTD, having successfully supported past RTD projects.
Following a consensus selection of the Best Qualified team, Triunity was contacted to complete the
initial price proposal for Work Order 1, Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project. This work order will
include support for:
1. Design Oversight
2. Construction Oversight
3. Project Controls Support
4. Public Outreach Support
5. Right-of-Way (ROW) Support
6. Disadvantaged Business Enterprise/Small Business Enterprise Compliance
The submitted price proposal for Work Order 1 was compared to the Independent Cost Estimate
prepared by the internal project management team at the start of the solicitation, and a negotiation was
held to review the assumptions and rates. The revised price proposal was found to be fair and
reasonable.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the initial tasks is included in the 2024 Budget. Funding for future tasks will be included in
subsequent year(s) budgets.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Review of 2024 Committee Approved Work Plans

March 26, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
At the January 30, 2024, regular Board meeting, the Board of Directors approved a Bylaw amendment,
which calls for each standing committee of the Board to draft and approve an annual work plan. The
work plans approved by each committee will cover meetings from April 2024 to February 2025.
Annual committee work plans are a useful tool for ensuring the Board and staff collaborate effectively to
accomplish the necessary work of the agency and Board, while providing dedicated space for the Board
to pursue governance/policy objectives and gain further insights into matters of interest to Directors.
Work plans elevate and respect the role of the committees of the Board as some of the most effective
forums for completing the work of the Board.
Subsequently the Finance & Planning, Operations & Safety, and Executive Committee have each
approved a work plan for 2024. The Performance Committee is slated to approve its committee work
plan at their meeting on April 1, 2024.
DISCUSSION
The Board is asked to review the work plans and provide any additional input to the committees as those
committees proceed in their work for the balance of 2024.
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the ability of the Board’s standing committees to effectively
govern directly impacts the overall performance of the agency. Organized committee work plans will
ensure RTD’s resources are used efficiently, and that the Board’s policy and governance objectives are
more focused, collaborative, and obtainable.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to the review of the committee work plans.
