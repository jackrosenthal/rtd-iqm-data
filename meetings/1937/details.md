## III. Other Matters

- Chair Sisk indicated he wanted to talk more about a procedural matter.  He stated that two Directors had requested a meeting with him which he had insisted should be posted.  However, they later indicated they would like separate one-on-ones so no meeting notice was required.  He shared that he is committed to openness and transparency and is aware of the open meetings requirements; therefore he will always follow the procedure for posting and noticing meetings within 24 hours of the meeting time.

He apologized that the Board office had gotten caught in the crossfire and stated it was not acceptable to put the Board staff on the firing line.

Director Bagley stated that he assumes this discussion had to do with TOD.  He indicated he was not in favor of anyone having a discussion about TOD’s especially in someone else’s district when that Director is not present.  Chair Sisk responded that any meeting with two or more Board members will be public and open but that he is concerned about trying to limit the conversation in a one-on one matter.  This puts everyone and the freedom of speech at risk. Director Bagley indicated he would be concerned that allegations could be made that the Director would not have a chance to defend.

- General Manager Washington shared he was in a meeting with one of the developers of the DUS hotel.  The developer was very excited about the activity and development around DUS and expressed his appreciation to RTD.

- Chair Sisk inquired if there was any update on when Secretary of Transportation Foxx would be coming to Denver.  General Manager Washington shared that Secretary Foxx office had expressed his regrets from the cancellation of his visit during the DUS grand opening.  General Manager Washington hopes he will be here in the near future or for the awarding of the TIGER grant.
