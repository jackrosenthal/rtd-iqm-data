Bylaws provide further description of standing committees. The standing committee
can take a vote on an action to move it forward to the full Board at a regular Board
meeting, but the action is not an official action of the District unless approved at a
formal Board meeting or Special Board Meeting.
Membership and Leadership Composition:








Each year the newly elected Chair of the Board will appoint the Chair and Vice-Chair
of the General Manager (GM) Oversight and Performance Management Committee.
The GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee is a standing committee
of six Board members and the Chair of the Board. For 2020, the members of the GM
Oversight and Performance Management Committee will also serve as the members
of the General Manager Executive Search Committee.
The Chair of the Board appoints the six additional members to the committee (for a
total of seven members).
Only the six appointed Board members and the Chair of the Board are voting members
of this committee.
A quorum is reached with four members participating.
This committee makes use of ad hoc or sub working groups to assign tasks. The
committee will implement and utilize a buddy system wherein each committee
member is assigned a Director who is not assigned to the committee with whom to
fully share information and materials presented to and discussed by the committee.
The committee will report back to the full committee for review and recommendation
as needed.

Roles and Responsibilities:


Chair of the Committee:
o Works with the Executive Search Firm and the ad hoc committees to develop and
approve agenda for the monthly meetings.
o Chairs/facilitates committee meetings following established Board protocols and
parliamentary procedures.
o Discusses items on the committee agenda and calls for a vote on recommended
action items to move before the full Board at the formal Board meeting or Special
Board Meeting
o Follows the established order for the agenda as approved in the Board Bylaws but
maintains flexibility to change when appropriate.

balanced participation of Board members through the buddy system.



Sub Committee Chairs:
o Perform a particular scope of work as defined by the Committee Chair and bring
back findings and recommendations to the full committee for review and approval.



All Committee Members:
o Confidentiality: Confidentiality must be maintained at all times. Committee
members are acting as agents of the District when recruiting. Therefore, anything
that goes on within the committee process is not to be discussed with anyone
outside of the committee (that includes applicant’s names, screening results,
interview questions, interview responses, committee discussions, etc.)
Recruitment materials (application materials and screening/interviewing forms)
should only be reviewed in private. If anyone outside of the committee inquires
about anything of a confidential nature, inform them that you are a member of
the screening/interviewing committee and are not at liberty to discuss the
recruitment with them. Directors and staff may refer inquiries to the Board Office
or the Executive Search Firm as appropriate.
o Preparedness: Preview presentations/materials and review committee minutes
provided by staff before the meeting and come prepared to discuss or take
appropriate action on items brought before the committee.
o Participation: Directors are chosen to serve on the committee because of their
connection to/involvement with the recruitment. Your input is essential for the
development of the job announcement, screening criteria, interview criteria and
questions and selection of candidates for interview and recommendation of the
finalists as recommended by the Executive Search Firm. Committee members
must be present at every committee meeting (including orientation, selection of
screening criteria, selection of interview candidates and interview criteria and
deliberation of finalists) to have the opportunity to give this input. Regular
attendance is required and an alternate committee member will be named by the
Chair of the Board to take the place of a committee member after the third
absence.
