projects where RTD owns the asset
– Projected issuance of approximately $480 million
– Separate Board approval will be required for COP
issuance

• Use portion of FISA balance to help cover North
Metro costs
– Allows RTD to finance more of the corridor
– Need to balance with potential uses on US 36 BRT

Design and Construction of the North Metro
Rail Line project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors ("Board")
authorize the General Manager to award the design/build contract and negotiate final terms with
Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors (GBBH) to serve as the Contractor for the North Metro Rail
Line Project ("Project"). The Project consisting of the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to
162nd Avenue with a Notice to Proceed to 124th Avenue, which will be constructed for a lump sum
amount of US $343.3 million. Acceptance of this proposal would complete the North Metro corridor to
124th Avenue with options to extend to 162nd Avenue as funds become available.
In addition, it is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
provide the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts, and
intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Project in the amount not to exceed the remaining
project budget to 124th Avenue of $633.8 million. This authority shall include the ability to negotiate
and execute all contracts; work orders; change orders and contract modifications; and Intergovernmental
Agreements that are necessary or advisable to complete the North Metro Project to 162nd Avenue within
the scope of the North Metro Project budget and to accept grants or other contributions and to increase
the project budget in the amount of third-party contributions for project work. The General Manager will
also be granted authority to exercise the option to extend to 162nd Avenue and issue a notice to proceed
for that phase, should funding become available. This option would be presented to the board through
the annual budget appropriation and with approval of financing provisions.
It is also recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct
RTD staff to proceed with the submittal to the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) of an
amendment to the 2035 Regional Transportation Plan (2035 RTP) consistent with the Project scope as
described herein.
This contract provides major benefits to RTD, the FasTracks program and the entire region.
 It demonstrates RTD’s commitment to the northern suburbs toward completion of the FasTracks
program.
 It provides a firm, fixed price commitment to complete a key part of the FasTracks program. It also
provides a fixed capital cost. The commitment to this cost and scope is not likely to be available at a
later time due to time escalation of prices.
 This proposal is consistent with the stated goals of the FasTracks program to seek innovative
approaches to delivering the program.
 It is consistent with the RTD Board’s stated direction to the General Manager (2013 GM Task Goal
#1: Pursue collaborations and partnerships with local, regional, state, and federal stakeholders; and
Task Goal #2: Actively and aggressively pursue all potential federal, state, local, private sector, and
other funding sources for FasTracks).

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT




Completion of this North Metro Rail Line maximizes mobility for transit dependents both temporary
and long-term, to key job centers and provides clean, safe, reliable, accessible and cost effective
transportation in keeping with RTD's overall mission.
The line provides access for northern residents to major employment centers in downtown Denver
and the Denver Tech Center.
The North Metro Rail Line connects Thornton, Northglenn, Commerce City and parts of Adams
County with all other rail lines via Denver Union Station and provides regional connectivity to a major
portion of the metro area, including Denver International Airport.

BACKGROUND
As part of the RTD FasTracks Plan, the full North Metro Corridor is an approximately 18.5-mile-long
Commuter Rail line extending from Denver Union Station through the City and County of Denver, the
Cities of Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn and parts of Adams County. RTD has been working
closely with stakeholders in these jurisdictions to identify ways to expedite construction of this corridor.
Quarterly meetings are held and RTD and the stakeholders have been working collaboratively towards
this goal.
The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was conducted for the North Metro Rail line between 2006
and 2010. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) issued a Record of Decision (ROD) for the North
Metro Rail Line in April 2011. RTD is constructing the project without federal funds. The RFP for the
Project incorporated the environmental mitigation measures identified in the EIS and these mitigation
measures will therefore be included as contractual obligations. Since that time, RTD has identified and
moved forward with early action items related to the North Metro Rail Line. These included acquisition of
six EMU commuter rail vehicles; design and construction of an expansion to the Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility to house an additional 30 EMU vehicles ultimately required for 2035 ridership;
installation of duct bank at DUS for the North Metro line; contracted with AECOM to design the rail line
from DUS to 72nd Avenue; began the acquisition process for necessary properties between DUS and 72nd
Avenue; began the utility relocation process between DUS and 72nd Avenue; and performed work at the
Bambei-Walker Reservoir. These early action items saved considerable future costs to the project.
Most importantly, RTD concluded an agreement with the Union Pacific Railroad for acquisition of the
Boulder Industrial Lead, which is the right-of-way being used north of 72nd Avenue. The cost of this
acquisition was $117.8 million in 2009, which was a significant commitment of funds to this corridor.
RTD has also negotiated intergovernmental agreements with regard to North Metro with the City and
County of Denver, Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn, Adams County and CDOT.
RTD also has taken actions to provide funding for construction as it becomes available. In June, 2010,
the RTD Board programmed $90 million for the construction of the North Metro Rail Line from DUS to
the National Western Stock Show (NWSS) Station out of the $305 million pool in FasTracks funds
remaining from the Eagle P3 bids that were received below budget. In February, 2013, the Board
approved refinancing three outstanding debt issuances, and committed to use the future savings from
these refinancings to finance construction of the North Metro Rail Line from the NWSS Station to 72nd
Avenue.
The current recommended action to build to 124th Avenue would not have been possible without those
RTD Staff recommendations and those prior approvals by the RTD Board. Approval of this action will
also require RTD to submit an amendment to the DRCOG 2035 RTP reflecting both the extended North
Metro Rail Line construction and operation and the significant schedule acceleration. Specifically, as

1.D.1.b

Over the past couple of years, RTD has publicized the agency's desire to seek out innovations from the
industry to complete the FasTracks program as soon as possible. In 2011, RTD held an industry forum,
Transformation Through Transportation (T3). RTD's goal was to encourage and attract "out-of-the-box"
thinking that would generate innovative industry solutions throughout the District. As part of the T3
process, RTD revised and published its unsolicited proposal policy. The policy and effort as it relates to
the FasTracks program of projects has the objective of seeking innovation from the private sector that
will enable RTD to complete more of the FasTracks program, sooner than what is currently programmed.
In February 2013, RTD received an Unsolicited Proposal from Graham Contracting Limited related to the
North Metro Rail Line. In accordance with RTD's Unsolicited Proposal Policy, each submitted proposal is
reviewed and evaluated to determine whether the proposal has merit and is consistent with the
unsolicited proposal policy criteria.
In March 2013, following RTD staff review and evaluation of the Graham Contracting Limited proposal,
it was determined that it did have technical merit and the competitive process was initiated. The RTD
staff completed development of a design/build and financial solutions Request for Proposals (RFP), which
was advertised on June 28, 2013. The RFP was written in three phases:
 Phase 1: Design/Build from DUS to 72nd Avenue
 Phase 2: Design/Build on four individual segments from 72nd Avenue to end of line at 162nd
Avenue (72nd–88th, 88th-104th, 104th-124th, 124th-162nd), and offer financial solutions
 Phase 3: Design/Build and offer financial solutions for any or all of the three extensions (Central,
Southwest and Southeast Rail lines), or other potential projects
This effort is consistent with our Mantra to “Build as much as we can, as fast as we can, until it’s all
done”. The private sector has taken our Mantra seriously and has responded. The T3 process and this
unsolicited proposal effort for the North Metro corridor are also consistent with the guiding principles for
FasTracks.
 Ensure every step contributes to the full vision
 Focus money available to the greatest good
 Spend public money wisely
 Maximize outside funding before going to taxpayers
 Deliver key investments in all corridors
DISCUSSION
Following an advertisement period of approximately twelve weeks, RTD received four competitive
proposals for the project on September 23, 2013, from the following teams:
1. Bechtel/Herzog Joint Venture which includes AECOM and financial partner Societe General
2. Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors (GBBH) which includes Stantec Design, Parsons
Brinckerhoff and financial partner BMO Capital Markets
3. North Metro Transit Solutions (NMTS), a Kiewit/Stacy and Witbeck joint venture which includes
Atkins Design, Mass Electric, and financial partner RBC Capital Markets

previously authorized by the RTD Board of Directors in February 2013, the 2035 RTP currently reflects
construction of the North Metro Rail Line only to 72nd Avenue by 2018. This action will significantly
accelerate and extend the North Metro Rail Line compared with the financial projections from February
2013. Further, this is being accomplished without impact to any of the other RTD FasTracks or base
system projects committed to in the current DRCOG 2035 RTP as adopted by the RTD Board of
Directors.

1.D.1.b

The RTD staff evaluated the four competing proposals based on the best value criteria established for
this procurement:
Financial
1. Design/Build Cost Proposal – DUS to 72nd Avenue
2. Design/Build Cost Proposal – 72nd Avenue to 162nd Avenue, scored by segment as defined above
3. Financial Innovation/Creativity
Technical
1. Technical Innovation/Creativity
2. Technical Approach
3. Management Organization, Experience and Approach
4. DBE/SBE/WIN Approach
RTD established review teams to evaluate the technical and financial parts of each proposal. In addition
to the technical and financial review teams, key stakeholders (City and County of Denver, Cities of
Commerce City, Northglenn and Thornton, Adams County and the Colorado Department of
Transportation) also participated in the evaluation. The technical, financial and stakeholder teams
presented the results of their evaluation to the Evaluation Committee.
Following the evaluation and scoring, the Evaluation Committee worked collaboratively and unanimously
recommended to the General Manager to select GBBH for negotiation of a contract.
GBBH submitted a proposal for the North Metro Rail line to 162nd Avenue, broken out by the segments
defined above. Based on financial capacity at this point in time, RTD is recommending awarding the
contract from Denver Union Station to 124th Avenue. Given this information, GBBH provided a BAFO
price for a consolidated contract to 124th Avenue, reducing its bid price by $20.5 million from the
original proposal to issue Notice to Proceed (NTP) for individual segments. GBBH also provided an
option, with the price to be held for two years, that could be exercised to complete the North Metro
project to 162nd Avenue when funding becomes available. GBBH also provided option prices for the
Southeast, Southwest and Central extensions, subject to an escalation clause defined in the RFP;
extension of the North Metro line to Longmont; extension of the Northwest Line to 88th Avenue. These
options can be evaluated when funds become available.
The design/build contract initial Notice to Proceed will include the following elements from Denver Union
Station to 124th Avenue:
 Design, construction and testing of all Civil and Systems elements including the following
stations:
o National Western Stock Show station and park-n-Ride
o 72nd Avenue station and park-n-Ride
o 88th Avenue station and park-n-Ride
o 104th Avenue station and park-n-Ride
o 112th Avenue station and park-n-Ride
o 124th Avenue station and park-n-Ride
 Interface, integration and coordination with the Eagle Project in design, fabrication and installation
of traction electrification systems, train control and PTC systems, SCADA and Security and
Communications systems
 Demolition of structures identified for removal

financial partner Piper Jaffray

1.D.1.b

Right of way (ROW) management between 72nd Avenue and 124th Avenue.

The following basic components are included in the contract:
1. Payment Agreement for the Lump Sum Contract.
2. RTD set a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goal of 23% for design and 21% for
construction, which applies to the total value of all work performed under the contract. The
contractor has committed to exceeding these goals by an additional 1% each. The contractor also
has presented a plan to include a minimum of 1% SBE participation.
3. The Project hiring goals for Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) graduates are as follows:
a.
Professional Service – Goal 4%: Participants may perform professional services such as
design, quality control, quality assurance, surveying, contract administration, easement
acquisition, and public information duties.
b.
Skilled Craft – Goal 8%: Participants should perform skilled construction related activities
such as carpentry, masonry, iron worker, equipment operator, mechanic work, or similar
skilled construction work. Laborer activities will only be allowed if incidental to a higher
skilled journey worker status.
4. Davis Bacon and Buy America Requirements - The contractor will be required to use Davis-Bacon
wage rates and comply with Buy America regulations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
After review of the financial proposals, staff determined that it would be in RTD’s best interest to
finance construction of the North Metro Rail Line through RTD issuance of Certificates of Participation
(COP) with the North Metro Rail Line as the collateral. Staff modeled financial alternatives to determine
how much of the North Metro Rail Line could be built and operated within RTD’s current projected
financial capacity. The financial projections considered the contractors bid, RTD’s internal costs for
items such as ROW, vehicles, and construction management, future costs to operate the line, and debt
service on the COPs. In addition, the projections considered the impacts of an increase in COP interest
rates due to a potential ratings downgrade on RTD COPs. This analysis determined that RTD would
have the capacity to build and operate the corridor to 124th Avenue while maintaining the Board 1.2
times net revenue, bond test, and allowing fund balance policy.
Funding for this contract and the associated RTD cost of construction will be provided through the staff
identified and Board approved $90 million from the Eagle project savings, use of existing fund balances,
potential use of the FasTracks Internal Savings Account, and issuance of COPs to provide $430 million
in construction funds. Separate Board actions will be presented for issuance of the COPs, and for a
reimbursement resolution if needed.
Funding of the North Metro Rail Line will not affect the planned financing or construction schedule for
other FasTracks projects. RTD currently has limited remaining TABOR capacity to issue sales tax bonds
or enter into other types of loan agreements. The North Metro Corridor is unique in that it meets the
criteria for RTD to use it as collateral for a COP at this time. As a result, RTD is able to finance this
corridor and conserve TABOR capacity for other opportunities that do not qualify for COP financing.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors ("Board") authorize the General Manager to award the design/build
contract and negotiate final terms with Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors (GBBH) to serve
as the Contractor for the North Metro Rail Line Project ("Project"). The Project consisting of the

In addition, it is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors provide the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts, and
intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Project in the amount not to exceed the remaining
project budget to 124th Avenue of $633.8 million. This authority shall include the ability to negotiate

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead direct staff to negotiate a lesser scope with the
recommended proposer. This is not recommended. There is no guarantee that the reduced scope will
result in a similar reduction in cost as it would require a significant change in the proposer’s entire
approach. This option would not encourage building as much as we can, as fast as we can.

Approval of Tenth Year (2014) Contract
Amendment to Jacobs Engineering for
FasTracks Program Support Consulting

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the tenth year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in the
amount of $23,462,562 for Program Support Services Consulting (PSC) for FasTracks for the year
2014. Funds for the award are contained in the 2014 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks
capital program in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
BACKGROUND
On May 24, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to CarterBurgess (later purchased by Jacobs Engineering) for Program Support Consulting Services at an
initial 2005 Contract amount of $2,360,000, and a Notice to Proceed of July 5, 2005. - Subsequent
contract amendments approved by the RTD Board, along with contract adjustments to reconcile the
contract approvals to actual billings, have brought the current Contract Not-to-Exceed price up to
$127,520,164. The Contract Not-to-Exceed price through the end of 2014 with this contract
amendment would be $150,982,726.
The PSC team provides program management support and specialized technical staff support to
augment RTD FasTracks Team staff. Key PSC staff members are co-located with RTD Staff at the
RTD FasTracks offices. The PSC functions as an extension of RTD staff. This approach adds value,
cost-effectively, by allowing RTD to tap the PSC’s specialized resources in planning, environmental,
design, engineering, construction management support, program control, and related disciplines on
an as-needed, often part-time, basis.
Further, as the focus of the FasTracks program has shifted from planning and design to construction,
the staff resources required for support of the program shift similarly. The PSC role has changed,
and will continue to change, to meet the evolving needs of the FasTracks program. This flexibility
allows RTD to retain the core staff required for implementation of the FasTracks program, without
having to continually (and inefficiently) staff up and then staff down in the planning, design, and
construction management disciplines.
Some of the key deliverables and assistance, in process or received, from the Jacobs/PSC team in
2013 included:




Participation in the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) that resulted in the revised financial plan
that was presented to the Board in February 2013.
Provided key construction management support for the DUS, I-225, US 36 and Eagle Projects.
Provided day-to-day management of the Eagle P3 project, including preparing amendments to the
original contract, project coordination, construction audits, railroad coordination, and coordination
with outside agencies.

mitigations from environmental clearance documents.
Maintained the project controls functions including cost, schedule, estimating, change
management, and document control.
Supported ROW design, survey, mapping and acquisition of all projects.

DISCUSSION
The Program Support Services Contract was specified for a term of six years with a six-year option,
to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work tasks. The option was approved by the RTD
Board in November 2011.The purpose of the annual re-negotiation of the contract is to ensure that
specific tasks and deliverables respond to the evolving needs of the FasTracks Program.
The PSC serves as an extension of RTD staff. RTD staff provides overall management and control of
the FasTracks program and administration of this contract. The PSC provides key personnel to a
number of tasks. These assignments are based on focusing the PSC effort to:






Areas of specialized expertise or experience.
Part-time assignments.
Shorter duration efforts.
Positions that are difficult for RTD to fill.
Limit the number of RTD positions that may need to be re-assigned when current projects are
completed.

Each position in the FasTracks organization is evaluated individually to determine whether that
position falls within the above criteria for using a consultant. In addition, before a consultant is
actually brought into the FasTracks program, an assessment is made as to whether the position is
still needed, and an interview is conducted with the appropriate RTD manager(s).
The major program activities in 2014 include the following:





Construction of the Eagle P3 project.
Integrated testing and startup of the DUS project.
Final design and construction of the North Metro Line.
Final design and construction of I-225.

During 2014, the PSC contract identifies the following specific tasks in support of FasTracks:
Program Management
 Provide the full-time support of a Project Controls Manager for the FasTracks Senior management
Team.
 Provide the support of specific project controls positions in schedule, cost co ntrol, estimating and
document control. Provide tracking and monthly schedule and cost updates to each project
manager.
 Provide support of general planning, operations planning, quiet zones, traffic planning, and
noise/vibration mitigation.
 Manage the public comment database.

RTD has established a 7% DBE goal for this Contract. The latest DBE report indicates that the PSC’s
cumulative DBE percentage through year-end 2013 will be 18.5%. For 2014, the PSC has committed to
23.9% DBE participation, well in excess of the 7% goal, which would bring the projected DBE
percentage through year-end 2014 to 19.4%. Additionally, while not in their contract, the PSC has
committed to continuing their participation in the WIN program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the PSC contract from 2005 through 2014 would be
$150,982,726 with this amendment. Funds for the 2014 contract award in the amount of
$23,462,562 are included in the 2014 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in
the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the eighth year
contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in the amount of $23,462,562 for Program Support
Services Consulting (PSC) for FasTracks for the year 2014. Funds for the award are contained in
the 2014 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where
PSC support would be utilized.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
eighth year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering. Rather, perform all the work in -house
with RTD staff. This is not recommended as RTD does not have the staff to provide a sufficient
level of expertise in a cost-effective approach to manage the FasTracks Program (As described in
the Background section, the PSC team can provide the technical specialties on an as needed
basis).
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Re-solicit this work to another consulting team. This is
not recommended as the PSC is satisfactorily performing its work assignments and providing
valuable technical and project management assistance to the RTD team.
Selection of alternatives two or three would delay the implementation of the FasTrack s Program as
there would be a major loss of continuity on the program.

Approval of Contract Amendment to Front
Range Systems Consultants (FRSC) for
FasTracks Systems Engineering Consultant
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks monitoring committee that the Board of Directors approve a
Contract Amendment with Front Range Systems Consultants (FRSC) in the amount of $10,566,646 for
the year 2014, bringing the total contract authorization to $64,309,557. Funds for the contract award
are included in the 2014 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects
where FRSC support would be utilized.
BACKGROUND
In April 2005, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for professional services for a Systems
Engineering Consultant for the overall FasTracks Systems Engineering Services. On September 20,
2005 the RTD Board approved the selection and award to FRSC for the Systems Engineering work for a
six year term and an option for another six years. The RTD Board approved exercising the six year option
in November 2012
FRSC has successfully performed the stated tasks outlined in the original Scope of Work. Specific
systems design and support scope in their contract includes traction electrification system (TES)
including overhead contact system (OCS) and traction power substations (TPSS), train control,
communication and central control system, corrosion control, systemwide electrical, rail vehicles, and
operation planning support. FRSC has worked with RTD staff in a number of areas:







Provided construction management support for the West Corridor Project
Provided Systems Engineering & Construction Management Support on the Eagle Project
Provided construction management support on the Substation Programmable Logic Controller
Upgrade Project
Completed the design documents for the I225 Project Provided Systems Engineering Support on
the On-Call Systems Engineering Contract
Provided construction management support for the Denver Union Station Project
Provided Systems Engineering Support for the North Metro Project

DISCUSSION
The RTD selected a single Systems Engineering Consultant for the entire FasTracks Program for
consistency and standardization of design. This approach will save the RTD cost and will facilitate the
operation and maintenance of the system. The initial contract award was for the final design services
for the West Corridor and evaluation of commuter rail vehicle type. The work effort is consistent with
the work required to move each corridor forward and maintain the FasTracks schedule. In particular,
FRSC will support RTD’s Systems Engineering staff on managing SE Extension, DUS, I-225, North
Metro, and Eagle Projects. The agreed upon Scope of Work for the Contract Amendment and associated

RTD began negotiations with the Front Range Systems Consultants on September 9, 2013. We have
successfully concluded the negotiations with a contract price of $10,566,646 for the work to be
completed in 2014.
The DBE goal for this contract was set at 10%. To date FRSC has achieved a 15.7% DBE goal. Front
Range Systems Consultants has proposed a 15.4% DBE goal for the 2014 work, exceeding the RTD
proposed goal of 10%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the contract award are included in the 2014 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital
program.

FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where FRSC support would be utilized.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the System Engineering approach. This is not
recommended as RTD does not currently have the specialized staff to meet the System Engineering

the amendment are contained in the 2014 RTD FasTracks Budget.
BACKGROUND
On June 28, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to Delcan for
Quality Management Consulting Services at an initial 2005 contract price of $418,539, and a Notice to
Proceed of August 1, 2005. This contract was set up to run for an initial six-year term, re-negotiated

On November 17, 2009, the RTD Board approved a sixth year contract amendment for 2010. The
actual cost proposal for the 2010 workscope was $1,400,000; but because of cumulative budget
underruns from previous years, the total Contract Not-to-Exceed price only needed to be increased by
$600,000 in order to deliver the 2010 work.
On November 23, 2010, the Board approved a seventh year contract amendment for 2011 in the
amount of $1,550,000, and authorized a six year option included in the original contract.
On November 22, 2011, the Board approved an eighth year contract amendment for 2012 in the

not to exceed $487,308.80 for the year 2014. Funds for the award are contained in the 2014
FasTracks Budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the Public Information Consultant approach.
This is not recommended as RTD doesn’t currently have the staff to provide a sufficient level of
resources to meet the public information, communications and public outreach needs of the
FasTracks program. This alternative would delay and negatively impact the effective
implementation of the FasTracks Public Information Program.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
second one-year option to Virtegic Group. Issue another Request for Proposals for professional
services for Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach for the FasTracks Program
and award a contract to another consulting team. This is not recommended as the Virtegic team
is satisfactorily performing its work, and this alternative will delay and negatively impact the
successful implementation of the various strategies and activities associated with a
comprehensive and multi-layered communications effort.

Board Meeting Date: November 5, 2013

Subject:

North Metro Rail Line Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) with the City of Commerce
City

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the City of Commerce
City (C3) and the Regional Transportation District. The agreement includes specific terms defining C3’s
local agency contribution, coordination, and the rights and responsibilities of each party within the
Commerce City boundaries.
BACKGROUND
As part of the FasTracks Plan, RTD proposes to construct the North Metro Rail Line, consisting of
electric commuter rail transit connecting Denver Union Station with Adams County, the City and County
of Denver, the City of Thornton, the City of Northglenn, and the City of Commerce City, identified in the
FasTracks Plan and more fully described in the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Project
dated January 2011 as approved by the Record of Decision for the Project signed by the Federal Transit
Administration on April 22, 2011 and the final design plans.
The FasTracks Financial Plan assumes and requires a two and one-half percent (2.5%) local agency
contribution from local jurisdictions in the RTD district in consideration for the construction of transit
improvements that will benefit the City and its citizens and the other governmental entities along the
NMRL.
DISCUSSION
This IGA between C3 and RTD establishes the local agency contribution amount for C3 and how that
local agency contribution will be met. The IGA sets forth the commitments from RTD and C3 regarding
financial obligations, responsibilities, coordination, and cooperation between both agencies with respect
to the North Metro Rail Line within the City’s boundaries.
Local Agency contribution
The total local agency contribution shall not exceed two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the cost of the
Project. The cost of the Project for the purposes of establishing the local agency contribution is Nine
Hundred and Nine Million Dollars ($909,000,000) in year of expenditure dollars. Therefore, the total
local agency contribution is Twenty-Two Million Seven Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars
($22,725,000), to be shared by and between by Adams County, the City and County of Denver, and the
Cities of Thornton, Northglenn, and Commerce City and, accordingly, the City’s local agency
contribution is Four Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,700,000).
The IGA stipulates that the $4.7M will be covered by one or more of the following:
1. A lump sum cash payment.
2. Annual cash payments.
3. The value of project permits and fees for plan review.

Packet Pg. 87

1.E.6

4. The value of City staff time required to perform necessary activities associated with planning,
design, construction and inspection of the Project.
5. The value of utility relocation credits due to the City if relocation of public utilities is necessitated
by construction of the Project.
6. The fair market value of real property interests owned or controlled by the C3 that are identified
by RTD and the C3 as required to implement and operate the Project and granted or conveyed to
RTD by the C3. The value of customary fees including storm water utility fees and water tap fees
and sales/use taxes that are legally required to be paid by RTD or the contractors that may be
rebated by the City.
7. The cost of mutually agreed construction projects that are necessary for the NMRL from funding
sources secured by the City (exclusive of Betterments).
Commerce City shall complete the Local Agency Contribution to RTD no later than the first day of NMRL
commuter rail revenue service to the 72nd Avenue Station.
Additional items included in the IGA include:
 Permitting, design plan review, construction review and inspection processes.
 Utility relocation responsibilities and processes.
 Design criteria requirements and design review responsibilities are identified including, but not
limited to, transit system elements, storm sewer, water quality, parking and traffic mitigation,
quiet zones, and station aesthetics.
 RTD will design and construct emergency access on the north side of the 72 nd Avenue station
park-n-Ride so as to not preclude future vehicular public access to the station. Any
improvements to 72 nd Avenue, including bridge replacement for signalization will not be the
responsibility of RTD.
 Process for project betterment determination and funding.
 RTD will petition to annex RTD property into the City of Commerce City.
Summary
IGAs are required with the City of Commerce City, as with other jurisdictions along the North Metro
corridor, in order to define the respective rights and responsibilities of each party, and to define the local
agency share credit. The recommendation is to authorize the General Manager to execute this agreement
defining those rights and responsibilities of RTD and Commerce City with respect to the North Metro Rail
Line project. The signed IGA defines coordination between RTD and the City of Commerce City for the
North Metro project and demonstrates that right-of-way and other coordination responsibilities have been
defined.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial elements of the IGA are funded in the project budget for the North Metro Rail Line project.
The $4.7 million local agency contribution is a part of the project financial plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) between the City of Commerce City (C3) and the Regional Transportation District.
The agreement includes specific terms defining C3’s local agency contribution, coordination, and the
rights and responsibilities of each party within the Commerce City boundaries.

Packet Pg. 88

Subject:

North Metro Rail Line Intergovernmental
Agreement
(IGA)
with
the
Colorado
Department of Transportation (CDOT)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the Colorado
Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the Regional Transportation District (RTD). The agreement
includes specific terms defining the coordination between CDOT and RTD and the rights and
responsibilities of each party associated with the construction of the North Metro Rail Line especially
regarding interface with the state highway system.
BACKGROUND
As part of the FasTracks Plan, RTD proposes to construct the North Metro Rail Line, consisting of
electric commuter rail transit connecting Denver Union Station with Adams County, the City and County
of Denver, the City of Commerce City, the City of Thornton, and the City of Northglenn, identified in the
FasTracks Plan and more fully described in the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Project
dated January 2011 as approved by the Record of Decision for the Project signed by the Federal Transit
Administration on April 22, 2011 and the final design plans.
The Parties have previously executed a Master Intergovernmental Agreement dated April 20, 2004 (the
"Master IGA") which addresses the need for CDOT and RTD to cooperate and coordinate regarding the
design, funding and construction of improvements to major transportation corridors that are a part of
RTD's FasTracks mass transit program so as to enhance all modes of transportation in those major
transportation corridors. Pursuant to the Master IGA, the Parties have committed to execute specific
intergovernmental agreements for each major transportation corridor that is part of RTD's FasTracks
program. The intergovernmental agreements for each major transportation corridor are intended to
address impacts of RTD's FasTracks mass transit improvements on existing or planned CDOT highway
improvements within each corridor. The specific IGAs for each corridor must address:
o physical, operational, safety, regulatory, and design impacts of RTD's transit facilities on
existing or proposed CDOT highway facilities in the major transportation corridor;
o design and construction management staff for each of the Parties that also identifies
responsibilities for overseeing the design and construction of improvements in the major
transportation corridor;
o terms and conditions upon which RTD utilizes existing CDOT-owned rights-of-way for its
mass transit improvements; and
o funding obligations and adjustments among the Parties for improvements being
constructed that affect the parties proposed or future planned transportation
improvements.
This IGA is one of the corridor specific agreements contemplated by the Master IGA and sets forth the
rights, duties and responsibilities of the Parties with respect to the design, construction, operation, and
maintenance of the Project and the crossings of, and impacts to, CDOT facilities and property.

Packet Pg. 96

1.E.9

DISCUSSION
The planned alignment for the North Metro Corridor is adjacent to, and in some cases within, CDOTowned right of way within the state highway system (“CDOT ROW”). The alignment crosses under
Interstate Highway 70, runs alongside Brighton Boulevard (State Highway 265), and crosses Interstate
Highway 270, Interstate Highway 76, 74th Avenue (State Highway 224), and 160th Avenue (State
Highway 7) (collectively, the “Interstate Crossings” or the “Crossings”). If CDOT is satisfied that the
Crossings will not impair the function, operation or safety of CDOT facilities, CDOT may request
authorization from the Federal Highway Administration (“FHWA”) for RTD to use the Interstate
Crossings and will itself authorize use of the other Crossings. RTD acknowledges that 23 C.F.R. Part
810, Subpart C requires CDOT to obtain authorization from the FHWA to allow RTD to use CDOT ROW
at the Crossings, and that such FHWA authorization is premised upon CDOT’s determination that RTD’s
proposed use will not impair the safety of highway users or future proposed or planned highway
improvements identified in the 2035 RTP. If RTD facilities or operations are expanded beyond what is
identified in the EIS, RTD will be responsible for additional analysis, and may be responsible for
additional improvements or mitigations and additional approvals as a result. Once RTD satisfies CDOT’s
concerns, CDOT will seek FHWA authorization for any additional use of CDOT ROW. Upon receipt of
such authorization, CDOT will promptly notify RTD that the Crossings may be utilized for construction,
operation, ownership, and maintenance of the Project.
The Project alignment for the Corridor includes screening on the Interstate Highway 70, Interstate
Highway 76, and State Highway 224 bridges to protect against contact with commuter rail electrified
elements, and crash walls at Interstate Highway 76, which have been constructed as part of a previous
project. Crash walls will also be required at SH 224 if and when the Project in this area includes double
tracking. Based on final design, additional screening or crash walls may be required along the project
limits pursuant to CDOT design standards and may require FHWA authorization.
Other items included in this IGA include but are not limited to:
o The contractors’ responsibility to remain within the identified project envelope and the
contractors’ responsibility to coordinate with CDOT and comply with all regulations if a variance
is requested;
o The responsibility and obligation for CDOT and RTD representatives and contractors to coordinate
and cooperate on all design and construction elements where CDOT properties are affected;
o The responsibility and obligation for all parties to follow federal and state laws and regulations
regarding upgrading of existing CDOT facilities to new standards;
o The rights and responsibilities of the parties regarding CDOT right-of-way, and permanent and
temporary access agreements;
o CDOT’s responsibility for funding discretionary changes requested by them;
o Roles and responsibilities for CDOT design review, construction inspection, auditing, permits,
construction management;
o CDOT staff required to review all plans and specifications related to state highway impacts
through final design and construction and related financial responsibility;
o RTD’s responsibilities regarding a safety and security management plan and public information
plan;
o Roles and responsibilities for following CDOT design criteria regarding CDOT facilities and process
for final inspection and acceptance of CDOT permitted project elements;
o The roles and responsibilities of the parties regarding operations, maintenance, bridge inspections,
insurance and following the statewide contract management system.
