BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Near-term Downtown Rail Reconstruction Legal Services
Contract Amendment

September 11, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
September 24, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute an
amendment to add $600,000 in additional funding to the Near-term Downtown Rail Reconstruction legal
services contract for a total contract amount not to exceed $953,800.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Melanie J. Snyder, General Counsel
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
As part of the Near-term Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project, RTD is currently undertaking full-depth
reconstruction of downtown rail to improve safety and mobility, address deteriorating transit
infrastructure, and extend the design life of the agency’s key transportation assets.
The near-term work will occur in four phases. The first phase commenced in June 2024 and was
completed on August 29, 2024, with track reconstruction at five key intersections in the Downtown
Loop. Work on phases two through four will start in 2025. To accelerate the project schedule and
minimize impacts to customers and the community, the majority of phases two through four will be
completed using a progressive design-build project delivery approach. This project will support the
Strategic Priority of providing Community Value, and more specifically, the Strategic Initiative of Back of
Basics.
The progressive design-build reconstruction contract structure is the first of its kind in RTD’s history,
with the contractor managing design and construction. On December 5, 2023, RTD solicited a Request
for Proposals for external legal services from law firms with expertise advising transportation agencies
on procurement and contracting for progressive design-build projects. On April 15, 2024, RTD executed
a contract with Kaplan Kirsch with a term of one year and a not-to-exceed amount of $353,800.
DISCUSSION
As development of the project contract documents has progressed, RTD has ascertained that additional
funds for the external legal services contract will be necessary to support a project of this size and
complexity. Based on current status and the remaining tasks required to procure and contract for a
progressive design-build project, $600,000 of additional legal services capacity is needed to meet the
agency’s goal of awarding a contract in 2025.

Packet Pg. 3

1.D.1

Kaplan Kirsch has met all contractual requirements, and their performance has met expectations. No
changes to the contract’s scope of work are associated with this recommended action. If approved, RTD
will execute an amendment with Kaplan Kirsch to add $600,000 of additional funding to the Near-term
Downtown Rail Reconstruction legal services contract to increase the contract’s not-to-exceed amount
to $953,800.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this contract amendment will be made available through the Near-term Downtown Rail
Reconstruction Project fund as included in the 2024 budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
East Metro Hoist Replacement Project

September 11, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
September 24, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with Rhinotrax Construction for the replacement of bus hoists at the East Metro Bus Operating
Division (East Metro). The total not-to-exceed amount of the contract is $5,538,331, and the cost to the
agency will be offset by a grant from the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) in the amount
of $3,536,310.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Acting Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Bus hoists are used in operating facilities to lift vehicles above ground level, enabling mechanics to
access the underside of the vehicles for routine maintenance. The 15 in-ground bus hoists utilized at
East Metro were installed during the original building construction in 1977 and have exceeded their
useful life. These hoists currently require significant repairs and maintenance. Additionally, replacement
parts are increasingly difficult to acquire. As such, staff identified the bus hoists for replacement and are
seeking a contractor to complete the work.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership and the 2023-24 Strategic Priority
of Back to Basics.
On Friday, April 12, 2024, RTD issued a solicitation in the form of an Invitation for Bids (IFB) for a
contractor to complete the hoist replacements. Proposals were due on Tuesday, May 28, 2024. Two
firms submitted proposals, one of which was deemed non-responsive to the solicitation. A panel of staff
subject matter experts assessed the remaining proposal and deemed it fair and reasonable.
Should the Board approve this recommendation, the new hoists will be fabricated following the award of
contract. The hoists are comprised of four three-post scissor hoists, 10 two-post scissor hoists, and one
parallelogram hoist, which will be sufficient for East Metro’s vehicle maintenance needs. The new hoists
require significantly less hydraulic oil than the original hoists and will have improved containment

features, which will eliminate the risk of below-grade soil contamination. The replacement project is
expected to be completed within two years following the contract award.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The hoist replacements will be funded from existing capital improvement budget dollars and through a
CDOT grant award in the amount of $3,536,310.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Approval of Budget Transfer for Wheel Truing Machine
Replacement

September 11, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
September 24, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve a budget transfer in the amount of $1,678,500 to the Light Rail
Operations division for the replacement of existing wheel truing equipment and to authorize the General
Manager and CEO to enter into a contract to procure the replacement equipment.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Dave Jensen, Assistant General Manager, Rail Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD conducts regular inspections of the metal wheels of light rail vehicles (LRVs) as part of the agency’s
routine vehicle maintenance activities. Over time LRV wheels incur wear, primarily due to friction with
the rail. Wheel truing is the process of ensuring that the wheels of the LRV fleet are kept within
guidelines established by the specific wheel’s manufacturer. Maintenance personnel utilize an electronic,
computerized wheel truing machine to accomplish this critical task, thereby maintaining assets in a state
of good repair, ensuring customer and employee safety, and avoiding service disruptions and LRV
downtime.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to the 2021-2026
Strategic Plan priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success as well as the
2023-24 Strategic Priority of Back to Basics.
The agency’s LRV wheel truing machine has reached the end of its serviceable life and is in need of
replacement. Funding in the amount of $1,875,000 for the wheel truing equipment replacement is
included in the 2024 budget. In preparing an updated internal cost estimate in advance of the solicitation
for the wheel truing equipment replacement, staff estimated a revised total cost for equipment
replacement in the amount of $3,553,500, leaving a delta of $1,678,500.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for the replacement of wheel truing equipment in the amount of $1,678,500 will come from
unexpended dollars in the 2024 budget originally allocated for contracted operational needs. As such, no
additional appropriation is needed.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP)

September 11, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Sky Mott, Manager, Safety Management Systems Program Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) Rule
requires each operator of a public transportation system that receives federal funds under FTA's
Urbanized Area Formula Grants to develop a PTASP that includes the processes and procedures
necessary to implement a Safety Management System (SMS).
While the FTA retains regulatory authority for compliance with PTASP requirements, pursuant to federal
and state law, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is the established State Safety Oversight
Agency with authority and primary responsibility for enforcing program standards. CPUC regulations
require the agency to update its PTASP annually. Further, the CPUC has the authority to approve the
PTASP and certify to the FTA that it meets current FTA requirements.
DISCUSSION
The updates to the 2025 PTASP as compared to the 2024 Board-approved version are:
• GM/CEO, as the Accountable Executive, and Joint Labor-Management Safety Committee
(JLMSC) approval prior to Board consideration and approval consistent with 49 CFR 673
• Three-year rolling average and numerical targets by mode for safety performance indicators
reported to the National Transit Database consistent with 49 CFR 670
• New Risk Reduction Program and Risk-Based Inspection Program as required by newly
promulgated 49 CFR 673 and 4 CCR-723-7
• Incorporation of Roadway Worker Protection (RWP) as required by newly promulgated 49 CFR
673
Staff will bring forward during the October 2024 meeting cycle the final GM/CEO and JLMSC approved
PTASP for the Board’s consideration of staff’s recommended action.
In approving the PTASP and associated exhibits, the agency complies with federal and state regulatory
requirements.

Policy

The first element of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) is Safety Policy. This, in its most
simple form, is the safety policy developed, approved, and signed by the Regional Transportation District
(RTD), a multimodal agency comprising bus, light rail, commuter rail, and special services in the Denver
metro area. This element also describes the agency’s commitment to safety; its objectives, safety goals,
and the organizational structure established; and plans written to obtain these goals and objectives.
In August 2021, the RTD Board of Directors adopted a new strategic plan that looks toward the next five
years of the agency’s future. The document — against which all initiatives, projects, and priorities are
measured — serves as a blueprint for success and outlines the intentionality the agency will bring with its
redefined mission: We make lives better through connections.
The strategic plan was developed by General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson and RTD’s
executive leadership team in concert with the agency’s 15-member Board of Directors. It establishes four
strategic priorities — community value, customer excellence, employee ownership, and financial
success — that serve as functional pillars to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure overall performance.
Development of the PTASP was completed in accordance with the strategic plan; Title 49 Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) Parts 672, 673, and 674; and Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) State Safety
Oversight (SSO) Program Procedures and Standards.
The agency has adopted a Safety Management System (SMS) approach to administering safety throughout
the organization. SMS is flexible and scalable and consists of four elements:
Description

Safety Policy

Definition of safety policies, procedures, and organizational structure

Safety Risk Management

Formal process for management of hazards to an acceptable level of risk

Safety Assurance

Establishment of process measures, assessments, and controls to assess the
effectiveness of risk control strategies

RTD is a special transportation district and political subdivision of the state of Colorado and is authorized
under Colorado Revised Statutes Title 32, Article 9. As such, the district has its own taxing authority and
operates within the counties of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, Jefferson, and
Weld. The agency is governed by its elected Board of Directors and managed by the GM/CEO, who
develops and implements a comprehensive and integrated PTASP. To that end, the GM/CEO, by signature
authority of the district’s Safety Policy Statement, has authorized the RTD chief safety officer (CSO) to
develop and implement a PTASP as an operating document of the agency for the operations of light rail,
bus and paratransit.

1. POLICY

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) recognizes the CPUC as the state safety oversight agency for RTD.
CPUC is FTA’s certified state safety oversight agency (SSOA), working cooperatively to regulate RTD’s light
rail transit, by ensuring compliance with state and federal requirements, regulations, and guidance,
as applicable.
The FTA functions as both a funding administrator and as a federal regulator as defined by 49 CFR Parts
670, 672, 673, and 674. The FTA conducts regular reviews of the SSOA, to determine the SSO’s and RTD’s
compliance to the FTA’s general requirements. RTD’s light rail service is regulated by the FTA and CPUC.

1.1.3

1.E.1.b

All employees are expected and encouraged to participate in safety activities, including reporting hazards,
unsafe work practices, near misses, and accidents immediately to their supervisor or a safety committee/
department representative.
Disciplinary action will not be taken against an employee who acts to prevent an injury or who reports any
accident, incident, near miss, concern, or hazard to any level of management. All employees are required
to abide by the standards and procedures set forth in the SMS policy and the PTASP. Behaviors such as
illegal activity, negligence, acts of willful misconduct, or undue care and attention shall be considered
outside the scope of this policy.

1.E.1.b

The overall consideration in the development of the agency’s PTASP is to provide safe and reliable
movement of customers throughout the transit system. Customers and the general public must be
confident that the RTD transit system is a safe system. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to design,
construct, operate, and maintain a system that aims to reduce recognized hazards as much as practicable
with the safety of employees, customers, and the general public in mind. The agency’s objectives will be
met by drawing information from system observation, local and state codes, federal guidelines, and specific
agency requirements into an SMS to ensure a safe transportation system.
The agency will track the following Safety Risk Reduction Program performance measures as required by
the National Public Transportation Safety Plan:
●

Fatalities (total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode)

●

Injuries (total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode)

●

Major Safety Events (total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by
mode)

●

System Reliability (mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode)

1.2.2

Agency Safety Policies

Guided by the principles contained in this PTASP, the CSO, under the direction of the GM/CEO, develops,
reviews, and updates safety and risk control policies, processes, and procedures. These policies set the
framework for guiding the SMS. All agency safety policies are available on the intranet.

1.2.3

Integrating Safety into All Aspects of RTD

The objective of the SMS is the continual improvement of processes and operations to maximize safety to
the highest practicable level. This effort is undertaken by providing continual opportunities for employees
to be reminded of safety, incorporate safe practices into their operations, and supply each employee with
multiple means to identify potential hazards.

FT

The agency accomplishes this through safety training, safety moments at meetings, safety committee
meetings, weekly safety messages, safety campaigns, identification and mitigation of hazards, and
proactive reviews and inspections to identify potential hazards.
Within different departments, multiple means of incorporating safety concerns or representation
are presented. As examples:
● Safety and Environmental Compliance representative is a part of Planning Department
meetings to plan for safety in new projects at the earliest opportunity
Safety and Environmental Compliance representative participates in Transit Oriented Development
meetings to identify and raise safety concerns

●

In new construction projects, safety is considered in the Design and Construction Meeting, System
Safety Working Group, Activation Committee and/or other processes where relevant

●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative is in the Technology Advisory Group
regarding the selection and implementation of new technology programs

●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative works with Communications for signage,
vehicle wraps, handouts, billboards, advertisements, and social media to maximize safety
messages to the community

1.3 Overview of Management Structure
RTD Board of Directors and Executive Leadership

RTD was created by the Colorado General Assembly in 1969 for the purpose of providing a public mass
transportation system for residents of the district. The agency began operations in 1972. A 15-member
elected Board of Directors is the legislative body for the agency and determines all questions of overall
governance and policy. The Board of Directors appoints the GM/CEO, who is ultimately responsible for safety.
The GM/CEO has full charge of the acquisition, construction, maintenance, and operations of the system
and facilities of the agency, and of the administration of business affairs. The GM/CEO supervises executive
leadership, including chief officers and AGMs. Included among these officers is the chief operations
officer (COO), who is responsible for bus, rail and paratransit operations. The Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division has the responsibility for agency safety. The Safety and Environmental Compliance
Division reports monthly to the GM/CEO.
The following activities ensure that safety goals and objectives are achieved:
●

Perform timely review of accident and incident investigation summary reports to identify trends and
recommend corrective action to minimize loss

●

Review reports of system standard operating procedures (SOPs) and rules for compliance with
established guidelines

●

Review summary reports regarding periodic equipment and facility inspections, and system
hazard analysis

●

Promote safety awareness by incorporating customer and employee involvement

1.3.2

Management — Key Role in Safety Overview

R
A

FT

The SMS will be incorporated into every aspect of transit services, by rail and bus service managers. Safe
operations of the bus and rail divisions are the responsibility of the AGMs. Each department has an AGM or
chief officer, who, along with senior managers, managers, and supervisors, is responsible for implementing
policies and procedures for safe operations. The AGMs of the rail and bus divisions have charged their
management teams to effectively manage safety; to develop safety programs, plans, procedures, training,
policies and rules to govern safety; and to fully comply with the PTASP. Bus and rail maintenance facilities
are staffed with a Manager of Maintenance responsible for the safe operation of their employees within
the facility and are supported by Shift Supervisors and maintenance workers. The agency models policies,
procedures, and processes for occupational safety and health on Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) regulations.

D

Supervisors’ responsibilities place them at the forefront of safety efforts. A significant portion of their duties
is monitoring, ensuring, and emphasizing safety performance and rules compliance and promoting a strong
safety climate. All employees are charged with adhering to safety, but supervisors are the key to improved
safety-related behavior and positive safety outcomes. Supervisors have the responsibility to monitor safety
compliance of their employees and ensure employees understand their job functions and the associated
safety requirements.
Safety and health are managed at all levels of staff. All employees are trained in safety and job duties, and
are given responsibility for their own safety, as well as the safety of the individuals with whom they work.
All employees have the responsibility to halt an operation or stop work if it is deemed to be unsafe. System
safety processes emphasize open and consistent dialogue between leaders and subordinates to increase

means available: line management; safety committees; safety concern reporting on the agency intranet; the
Hub; safety hotline; safety@rtd-denver.com; and safety suggestion boxes.
In an oversight role, Transit Safety Specialists report to the manager of safety, who reports to the senior
manager of safety and environmental compliance/CSO. TSSs have a role in overseeing the functions
necessary to ensure safety, which include the following:
●

Coordinate safety activities of the agency

●

Compile safety data and perform analysis to identify and assess operational risk

1.3.3

FT

The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division conducts regularly scheduled internal safety reviews
to evaluate compliance and conformance with the PTASP, CPUC Program Standards 49 CFR Part 674, and
49 CFR Part 673. TSSs work closely with management and employees, through various processes and
committees, and have authority to determine compliance. When warranted, TSSs will assist with corrective
action plans (CAPs) and ensure that appropriate divisions implement those plans. TSSs are the designated
contacts to regulatory agencies and serve as alternate contacts to the CPUC oversight agency.

Climate/Geography

FT

The Denver metro region normally has a semi-arid continental climate with four well-defined seasons.
Summers are characterized by hot, dry weather, but the high temperatures are usually not oppressive
since the relative humidity is generally low and the nights usually cool. August is the hottest month, with
temperatures reading 90-100 degrees Fahrenheit. Winters are cold but usually not severe. The average
annual snowfall is less than 65 inches at Denver International Airport, but much higher amounts fall in
foothill locations. Precipitation is generally light during the summer and early fall but may be heavy in the
spring when storms from the Pacific Ocean move through the area more frequently than any other season
of the year.

and Changes

1.E.1.b

Continuous improvement is defined by the FTA as a process by which a transit agency examines safety
performance to identify safety deficiencies or deficiencies in the agency’s performance against Safety Risk
Reduction Program performance targets and carries out a plan to address the identified
safety deficiencies.
The Leadership Safety Committee and the JLMSC meet regularly throughout the year to review the current
performance of the agency against the safety performance targets and the strategic plan objectives and to
take action to address any safety deficiencies that are identified.
The agency will use the management review cycle (annual PTASP update), Joint Labor Management Safety
Committee review cycle, along with performance data for the SMS to identify and prioritize continuous
improvement of each process. Leadership, from the accountable executive to managers, is involved in this
management review cycle. This method is consistent with SMS principles and allows for the resourcing and
prioritization of SMS efforts.

1.7 Emergency Preparedness and Response
Emergency Preparedness and Response

The ability to respond quickly and in an organized manner is vital to the continuation of transit service
during a special event, emergency, or recovery from a catastrophic incident, including, but not limited to,
the following:
●

Earthquake

●

Fire

●

Flooding

●

Hazardous material spill

●

Medical emergency

●

Severe weather

●

Pandemic

●

Transit-related accidents

●

Acts of violence

●

Acts of terrorism

The Emergency Operations Base Plan (EOBP) provides a flexible framework for districtwide emergency
management (See Exhibit for Plan). Each mode (light rail, commuter rail, fixed-route and on-demand
bus) will develop and update its specific emergency response plan. These plans detail activities and
responsibilities for personnel. This plan, along with the safety program documents and SSP, describes
coordination of the following emergency preparedness/management activities:
Incident management – management of an emergency event or incident is based on the principles
of National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the Incident Command System (ICS). NIMS
principles allow emergency response agencies to communicate with field supervisors and/or
Transit Police Communications

●

Coordination with external agencies – the Chief of Police and Emergency Management is
principally responsible for the coordination of incident management resources with various
emergency service agencies to provide for effective interaction between RTD and those agencies.
Liaising with law enforcement agencies is primarily the responsibility of the CSO, with assistance
from the Chief of Police and Emergency Management with assistance from the CSO

●

Emergency response planning and mitigation – the agency establishes a Fire Life Safety
Committee (FLSC) for each new rail extension or significant transit facility project. The
committee comprises safety and security staff; RTD operations, maintenance, and engineering
representatives; and police, fire, emergency medical, and other area emergency response agency
representatives. The committee reviews transit system designs and recommends fire protection,
life safety and security measures, and procedural response and training needs related to the new
extension or facility project

●

Emergency planning – As a critical transportation provider in the Denver metropolitan area, the
agency is a member of the Regional Emergency Management and the Continuity of Operations
Plan (COOP) and Urban Area Security Initiative. It is the agency’s intent to collaborate with regional
emergency management agencies responsible for emergency preparedness, response, recovery,
and mitigation planning and coordination among the counties and cities in the metropolitan
area, emergency response agencies, utility companies, and other critical groups. The agency,

procedures to address a wide range of emergency incidents and events, including criminal activity,
earthquakes, fire at transit stations and along the rights-of-way, hazardous materials releases,
medical emergencies, severe weather, terrorism, transportation mishaps, and other emergency
situations occurring within the transit system
●

Emergency preparedness exercises – A minimum of one emergency tabletop or field exercise
across different RTD modes will be planned and conducted annually to ensure the adequacy of
emergency plans and procedures. These may include readiness of personnel to perform under
emergency conditions; effective coordination between RTD and emergency response agencies;
and coordination of regional emergency exercises that are facilitated through use of Tera software
or other means. All exercises are followed by after-action analyses and reports to document
lessons learned and actions needed to improve the agency’s emergency operations capabilities

●

Emergency response training – Frontline RTD transportation and maintenance personnel
will undergo emergency response training to ensure full understanding of their roles and
responsibilities during an emergency incident. The level of training will be based on their
anticipated role during the incident. At a minimum, training is provided on the emergency plans
and procedures that the employee may be required to implement. Training to familiarize fire,
rescue, and other emergency service personnel with special transit system requirements is
coordinated through the FLSC, Transit Police and Emergency Management Department, and Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division staff, with assistance from the Bus and Light Rail Divisions,
as appropriate.

1.E.1.b

Hazard Log / Risk Register

Local site senior managers, managers, and supervisors, along with TSSs, ensure that local hazard logs are
used to track hazards at the departmental level within RTD. These logs are to be maintained within the
department and are reviewed by the local safety committee on a monthly basis. Hazards placed on the
local log receive their initial and final hazard ratings using the Risk Assessment Matrix. These individuals
may give hazards their initial rating when hazards are received and final ratings when they are closed.
This same group may also present hazards to the local safety committee for hazard ratings or employ the
Safety and Environmental Compliance Division for assistance in rating hazards. Hazard ratings may be
changed with new information or as a result of data analysis.
When a hazard is identified as needing mitigation that requires cost or changes beyond that of the local
safety committee or department abilities, the hazard will be elevated to the corresponding Safety and
Environmental Compliance Division Hazard Logs and be reviewed by the SSWG. The SSWG represents key
department managers that can make decisions, employ multiple disciplines, and can influence higher level
budgeted solutions.
TSSs are responsible for the maintenance of hazard logs / risk register. They ensure that hazards meeting
defined criteria are entered into the appropriate category within the hazard reporting system for accurate
record keeping. Hazard rating should be developed with input from the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division, local site senior managers, managers, and supervisors. The following are specific
hazards that are identified and mitigated at the agency level:
Unacceptable or undesirable hazards (high and serious hazards)

●

Hazards identified from reviews from outside agencies (CPUC, FTA, OSHA)

●

Hazards identified from accident investigations

●

Hazards with significant property damage

●

High-potential events as determined by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division

2.1.4

FT

●

Corrective Action Plan (CAP)

CAPs are used for hazards that meet certain criteria:

Hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B (high risk), or 1C, 2C, 3A, 3B (serious risk)

●

Findings of noncompliance from internal safety reviews or safety reviews or audits by regulatory
agencies (CPUC, FTA, OSHA)

●

Corrective action resulting from accident investigations

●

High-potential events as determined by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division

●

Findings from regulatory agencies resulting in non-conformance (CPUC, FTA)

●

Accident investigations requiring corrective action

Packet Pg. 57

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_v5B (4985 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

2.1.3

For testing or reviews of industrial hygiene that potentially exceed Permissible Exposure Limits for hazards
that do not meet the Unacceptable Risk Assessment Codes of 1A, 2A, 1B, or 2B (high risk), SSOA staff will
review and preliminarily approve the CAP before safety risk mitigation activities are implemented.
If an emergency corrective action must be taken immediately to ensure safety, the SSOA must be notified
of the issue immediately, and the agency must follow up with the SSOA for subsequent review and
approval of the corrective action within five business days.
The SSOA will review and provide final approval of all CAPs on a quarterly basis.
CAPs are assigned a specific tracking number by the Electronic Hazard Reporting System and are linked
with their associated hazard. CAPs must contain at a minimum:
●
●

The action(s) to be taken to minimize, control, correct, or eliminate the risks and hazards identified
A person of responsibility for the corrective action

●

A proposed completion date

●

Plan approval when applicable

CAPs are developed by department managers/designee in conjunction with the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division will facilitate the CAP process is
followed and properly track CAPs until closed.

Hazard Process Overview

FT

The hazard process includes all facilities, light rail, and bus systems. The hazard management flowchart
lays out an overall description of how hazards are identified, evaluated, analyzed, controlled or eliminated,
tracked, and reported to leadership and CPUC.
TSSs are the primary points of contact for the hazard management process

●

Safety committee members for rail and bus will be able to identify, evaluate, and analyze hazards

●

The TSSs will assist in entering identified hazards into the electronic hazard reporting system

●

The TSS facilitate development of mitigations for each unacceptable and undesirable hazard entry,
identify a point of contact or owner of the hazard, and place this information within the hazard
reporting system for tracking purposes

●

CAPs may also be identified as a result of an incident and investigation

●

Safety committee members also participate in the evaluation and control or elimination of the hazard

●

Hazards must be mitigated at the lowest level possible. However, when a hazard is identified as
having a mitigation that involves multiple departments or requires cost or changes beyond the
safety committee or department abilities or budgets, the hazard is elevated to the SSWG. The
SSWG will represent key department managers, have the capability to employ multiple disciplines,
and can influence higher level budgeted solutions.

●

Recommendations/results from contractor or internal review, testing, or industrial or environmental
sampling results requiring corrective actions will be placed in the hazard log for follow up and
possible need for retesting for compliance with Safety or Environmental requirements. If mitigation
or control of a hazard is not achieved through the SSWG, the hazard mitigation process may be
elevated to the Leadership Safety Committee.

Hazard Identiﬁcation

Identifying hazards is the responsibility of all employees and contractors. The continuous identification,
monitoring, and mitigation of hazards is key to an effective safety program.
Hazard identification methods include, but are not limited to:
●

Observation, inspection, and interaction with all employees and contractors

●

Review of reports from safety committee members, customers, and customer service and field personnel

●

Evaluation of accidents, incidents, and near misses, to include data trends and projections

●

Conducting Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) of a design or new construction

●

Conducting safety certification, system integration testing, pre-revenue testing, system
modification, configuration management verification, and inspection processes

●

Conducting Operation Hazard Analysis (OHA) of revenue operations

●

Review of internal and external safety reviews, inspections, observations, defects, findings,
observations, violations, and reviews

●

Review of controller logs, daily operating clearances/bulletins, and training feedback

●

“Lesson learned” inputs

●

Review of applicable regulatory codes and standards

●

Review of NTSB, FTA, OSHA safety recommendations, guidance, initiatives, and alerts

●

Review of Nonconformance Reports, Corrective Action Reports

●

Review of data and information provided by the SSOA

FT

The Hazard Management Flow Chart (in the attached document as Exhibit E.6) will be followed by
employees in identifying and correcting hazards at the employee/supervisor level. Actions will be taken to
move the hazard to the safety committee and beyond if necessary.

2.1.5.2 Hazard Investigation, Assessment, and Analysis

R
A

The agency is currently developing and refining a database where events and observed hazards can
be tracked and analyzed for leading indicators of potential hazards. This will allow management to be
proactive in correcting hazards.

D

Safety concerns are identified and corrected at the lowest level as soon as practicable. Safety concerns
that are not eliminated at this level are reported to a supervisor or a TSS. Reported concerns will be
assessed by a TSS and/or safety committee to determine if a safety hazard exists and assign an initial
hazard rating. Hazards will be evaluated and risks will be ranked to ensure prioritization for elimination or
control as described in the ORM framework.

1.E.1.b

Hazards are investigated following the Event Notification, Reporting and Investigation Policy and Procedure
to determine causal and contributing factors of an event, or hazard, for purpose of preventing recurrence
and mitigating risk. Hazards originating from events are reviewed by TSSs, managers and supervisors, and
respective safety committees. A third-party expert may assist with an investigation if deemed necessary.
The level of investigation and the methodology used will be determined based upon
risk assessments.
HIGH risk hazards (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B) that receive an unacceptable initial hazard analysis made by
management, a safety committee, or a TSS receive immediate attention/control. A high rating requires
corrective action. Hazards that receive a high rating will be elevated from the local hazard log to the
electronic hazard reporting system.
SERIOUS hazards (1C, 2C, 3A, 3B) that are undesirable may require corrective action and decisions by
management. Hazards that receive a serious hazard rating will remain on the local hazard logs no more
than 45 days before being moved to the appropriate Safety and Environmental Compliance Division log.
MEDIUM (1D, 1E, 2D, 3C, 4A, 4B, 5A) hazards may be acceptable with review and documentation by
management.
MODERATE (2E, 3D, 4C, 5B) hazards are acceptable with review.
LOW (3E, 4D, 4E, 5C, 5D, 5E) hazards do not require review and are acceptable.

2.1.5.5 Operational Risk Assessment Matrix

Assessing risk is the process of determining the severity of risk and the probability of the risk being
realized. To ensure risk assessments are consistent, it is important to use a standard definition.

D

Severity is a quantitative or subjective measure of the worst credible mishap resulting from personnel
error, environmental conditions, design inadequacies and/or procedural efficiencies for system,
subsystem or component failure or malfunction. Severity is categorized as Catastrophic, Severe, Serious,
Limited, or Negligible.
Probability is defined as the likelihood of the number of times that a specific event will occur during
the planned life expectancy of a system. A risk probability may be derived from the analysis of a transit
system’s operating experience, evaluation of safety historical data, or the analysis of reliability and failure
data. Probability is categorized as Frequent, Probable, Remote, Improbable or Highly Improbable.

Risks that have been evaluated and ranked will be mitigated at the lowest feasible level. Mitigation actions
that exceed funding levels authorized at each level will be elevated to the next higher level for action.

2.1.5.6 Hazard Control and Tracking

R
A

Safety critical hazards that have been identified must be controlled or mitigated so that the hazard does
not continue to pose a danger. This may be done in a temporary manner if the hazard is controlled. The
process of controlling and tracking hazards is recorded on the hazard log, which is generated from the
electronic hazard reporting system. The portions of the hazard log applicable to the light rail system are
discussed monthly with the CPUC.
Depending upon the risk ranking, hazard log entries may require a mitigation plan or CAP, tracking number,
brief description, projected completion date, and an initial hazard/risk rating (IHR/IRR) using the Risk
Assessment Matrix.

D

CAPs include:
●

Element of activity identified as deficient

●

Planned activities to resolve deficiency

●

Department responsible for implementing corrective action

●

Scheduled completion date for implementation

Packet Pg. 62

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_v5B (4985 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

OPERATIONAL RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX

Hazard log entries with their associated CAP are reviewed regularly by the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division, safety committees, and CPUC. They are periodically reviewed by senior
management. CAPs may be tracked and sorted from the hazard log. When a CAP is closed, the hazard
log will reflect this action and a closed date.
Individual CAP files are stored by tracking number.

2.1.5.7 Hazard Resolution
Hazard resolution refers to the methods and processes to identify mitigation strategies necessary to
reduce the likelihood and severity of the consequences associated with an identified hazard to the lowest
level practicable. Hazard resolution is not synonymous with hazard elimination. In a transit environment,
some hazards are impossible to eliminate and others are highly impractical to eliminate. Reduction of risk
to the lowest practical level can be accomplished in a variety of ways, from protective and warning devices
to special procedures. The hierarchy of controls will be followed to achieve a tolerable risk level:
1.

Elimination – remove the hazard

2. Substitution – replacement of material or a process with another that is considered
less hazardous
3.

Engineering Controls – isolate people from the risk

4.

Administrative Controls – training, signage

2.1.5.8 Hazard Tracking

5. Personal Protective Equipment – clothing protecting the person

R
A

Each CAP developed for hazards or findings from investigations or deficiencies will be submitted to
CPUC for review and approval. The CAP form is automatically assigned a tracking number and placed
on the hazard log with its identified hazard. Upon completion of the corrective action, the Safety and
Environmental Compliance Division will submit to CPUC as required. The completed CAP is formally
adopted by receiving CPUC’s signature. The hazard log will then be updated to show the status of the
identified hazard with its CAP as “CLOSED.”
The agency will monitor all CAPs and provide CPUC with quarterly updates on the hazard log.

D

Internally, the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division will coordinate with the appropriate
department to develop a mitigation plan and fill out the appropriate form for the identified hazard. The form
will be assigned a tracking number by the electronic hazard reporting system and placed on the hazard log
with the corresponding hazards for tracking purposes.

All hazards identified and rated as unacceptable hazardous conditions will be separately tracked and
reported to CPUC with a determination of an unacceptable hazardous condition, along with the CAPs for
each unacceptable hazardous condition found.
The CPUC notifies the agency in writing of its acceptance or rejection of the CAP and in accordance with
procedures specified in the CPUC program standard. The CAP form requires a CPUC electronic or wet

accompaniment of an RTD employee with appropriate communication devices.
RTD will provide data to CPUC at regular intervals as required by 4 CCR 723, including upcoming PMs and
construction projects.

FT

Prior to inspections, CPUC will notify the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division (CSO and assigned
TSS) and associated facility contact. Notification for inspections will be provided at least 24 hours in
advance. For inspections without advance notice, advance notice will be provided to ensure appropriate
RTD staff will be available to accompany CPUC staff. CPUC will notify the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division and associated Transportation, Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance, Maintenance of Way,
or Capital Program department location at least one hour prior to arriving. CPUC staff will notify the proper
supervisor or staff member at the facility and participate in job briefings and job hazard analysis before

2.3 Risk Reduction Program
Risk Reduction Program Management

The Risk Reduction Program is a subset of RTD’s overall risk management processes. Within the
Operational Risk Management process, risks related to vehicular and pedestrian safety events involving
transit vehicles, assaults on transit workers, missed safety performance target, will fall within the scope of
the Risk Reduction Program.
Risks and associated mitigations are identified through the Safety Committees as mentioned above in
Operational Risk Management. Mitigations will consider visibility improvements such as retrofits to vehicles
in revenue service and specifications for future procurements, and deployment of assault mitigation
infrastructure and technology on transit vehicles and in transit facilities.
Once mitigations are agreed upon within the JLMSC, they will follow the agency’s asset management
planning process to plan for appropriate resource allocation. Implementation of mitigations will follow
procurement processes described in Section 3.1.5.4.

2.3.2

Safety Set-Aside

Rail transit agencies must allocate specific resources (funds, personnel, equipment, etc.) dedicated to
ongoing initiatives or future projects that are reasonably likely to assist the agency in meeting the safety
performance target in the future. This allocation of 0.75% of the Federal Transit Administration Section
5307 Urbanized Area Formula Program (5307) funds, independent from the 1% security fund, is required by
49 CFR 673 to ensure effective implementation and continuous improvement of the SMS.

FT

Projects and initiatives will be identified as a part of the Risk Management Program and Risk Reduction
Program, which is implemented in collaboration with the JLMSC. Business case for projects and initiatives
will be reviewed for likelihood to assist the agency in meeting safety performance targets and approved by
the Leadership Safety Committee. Allocation of the funds and project implementation will follow the asset
management planning and procurement processes. The projects and initiatives will be tracked and drawn
from the safety set-aside 5307 funds during the fiscal year. Unused funds will be reviewed periodically and
will be retained for ongoing initiatives or future projects that are reasonably likely to assist the agency in
meeting the safety performance targets.

R
A

The Leadership Safety Committee will receive and consider safety risk mitigations recommended by the
JLMSC. If safety risk mitigations identified within the Risk Reduction Program are not implemented, a
written statement explaining the decision will be provided. Updates on the Risk Reduction Program and
performance targets will be provided in the annual updates to the Board of Directors.
Annually, project initiatives will be evaluated to identify effectiveness in short-term impacts on Risk
Reduction Program performance targets.

D

The safety set-aside funding process is a critical aspect of 49 CFR 673, ensuring that rail transit agencies
allocate sufficient resources to develop, implement, and maintain a robust safety management system. By
doing so, agencies can effectively manage safety risks, comply with regulatory requirements, and promote
a culture of safety within their operations.

The agency operates over an eight-county district along Colorado’s Front Range area. These activities
have the potential to affect local waterways, soil, air, wildlife, vegetation, and human health. RTD’s Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division strives to exceed all state, federal, and local municipality regulatory
requirements to limit the district’s impact to the local environment. The following management procedures
detailed below are in place to ensure this goal is met.

2.4.1

Management of Hazardous Materials

For any hazardous chemical used or stored in the workplace, the agency must submit an annual Tier II
chemical inventory report to their State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning
Committee, and local fire department via the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Tier II Submit
software by March 1 of each year. The information is made available to the public under the Emergency
Planning and Community Right to Know Act. Tier II Submit software is updated yearly by the EPA and
completed by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division.
Over 2,000 listed hazardous materials and 600 extremely hazardous chemicals are subject to reporting
under EPA rulemaking. Reporting requirements have been limited by quantity.
Common hazardous materials used by the agency that are subject to reporting include:
●

Diesel fuel

●

Gasoline

●

New and used oil

●

Antifreeze (ethylene glycol)

●

Lead acid batteries (sulfuric acid)

FT

The agency uses many hazardous chemicals contained in cleaning agents, solvents, adhesives, paints, and
aerosols. These materials are described in the product specific Safety Data Sheet (SDS) forms.
Secondary containment, oil water separators, regular inspections, stormwater best management practices,
and leak detection systems are utilized to help identify and remediate spills.

Chemical Product Approval Program

R
A

2.4.2

D

A product approval process is in place to ensure that all materials arriving on-site have been approved by
the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division for use. The process starts when the division or group
requesting a new product contacts the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division by email with a copy
of the SDS and a completed Product Approval Evaluation Form. If the material is acceptable for use, the
SDS will be placed into the electronic storage database for employees to view via intercompany websites
(e.g., Trapeze or the Hub). If the requested material is not approved, an alternative product that is less
harmful to human health or the environment may be suggested.
All employees and contractors directly responsible for safety as well as each employee who works with
hazardous materials receives training on proper storage/handling of chemical products, appropriate use of
personnel protection equipment, compliant disposal of unused materials, and how to locate SDSs.

Hazardous Material Program

1.E.1.b

Management of Hazardous Waste

District Shops is a small quantity generator of hazardous waste. All other facilities are categorized as very
small quantity generators of hazardous waste. Hazardous wastes can be generated by:
●

Discarding a hazardous material (e.g., oil-based paint, solvents, thinner contaminated rags)

●

Using a product (e.g., batteries, fluorescent lamps, HID lamps, electronic waste, aerosol dregs)

The EPA and Colorado Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division regulate the generation of
hazardous wastes.
Hazardous wastes are to be stored in closed containers and accumulated in satellite accumulation areas
or the Central Accumulation Storage Building at District Shops. Waste containers are labeled and located
near where the waste is generated. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division is responsible
for properly identifying hazardous waste, labeling waste containers, performing internal inspections,
inventorying monthly generation amounts, mitigating spills, training employees, preparing off-site
shipments for disposal, recordkeeping, and collaborating with regulatory agencies during audits.

2.4.4

FT

Personnel that add or remove hazardous waste from containers are required to receive compliance training
that is equivalent to their job duties and measured through routine performance-based internal inspections.
Safety and Compliance personnel that arrange hazardous waste shipments are required to receive training
in EPA’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) site compliance and maintain Department
of Transportation (DOT) ground shipper certifications prior to receiving authorization to sign uniform
hazardous waste shipping manifests. Electronic manifests, individual site information, and notifications
are stored electronically on the EPA information system RCRAInfo. Safety and Environmental Compliance
personnel have access to the RCRAInfo database and use this tool to submit and view required compliance
documentation to the Colorado Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division.

Underground and Aboveground Storage Tank Management

R
A

The agency is the owner of 32 regulated storage tanks throughout the district ranging from 1,000 to
48,000 gallons of diesel, gasoline, and lube oil. Storage tank systems are regulated by the Colorado
Division of Oil and Public Safety (OPS). Common components of tank systems include underground
piping, secondary containment, leak detection systems, overfill protection equipment, and automatic tank
gauging. These components are monitored daily for functionality, regulatory compliance, product inventory,
and release detection. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division collaborates with the Capital
Programs and Bus Operations department to arrange OPS required compliance testing, inspections, and
certifications for tank systems.
Spill Prevention Control and Counter Measure Plans (SPCC) that are certified by a licensed Professional
Engineer (PE) are in place at RTD facilities that store over 42,000 gallons of petroleum products in
underground storage tanks (UST).

D

Each of the six facilities that utilize underground storage tank systems to fuel vehicles has onsite
B-operators (Facilities Maintenance Supervisors) that oversee day-to-day operations and maintenance,
an A-operator (Manager, Facilities Maintenance Operating Facilities) that direct B-operators in their work,
and a listed facility contact (Manager, Environmental Compliance) that collects required compliance
documentation and is the liaison between the agency and OPS for audits, site characterization reporting,
and general inquiries at all six facilities. All three of these positions require OPS approved A- or B-operator
training through an approved training provider.

Safety and Environmental Compliance personnel are required to download and store compliance
documentation from the InSite360 Veeder-Root remote monitoring system at a minimum of every
30 calendar days. Abnormalities in the tank system are reported to the local B-operator and the tank
compliance contractor for resolution. Compliance reports that are run include tank tightness testing, liquid
sensor reports, and alarm history.

2.4.5

Stormwater Management

To comply with the provisions of the Colorado Water Quality Control Division (WQCD), the agency has
historically held a number of stormwater discharge permits for operating maintenance divisions, rail
corridors, stations, construction activities, and the Tunnel 16 Groundwater Treatment Facility. These permits
authorize the discharge of stormwater from these locations to the local waterways provided that the
agency and its contractors follow the requirements listed on each set of Colorado Discharge Permit System
(CDPS) issued documents. Common CDPS requirements include:
●

Illicit discharge detection and elimination procedures are in place

●

Construction site runoff controls are in place before and after project completion

●

Good housekeeping activities are continually practiced, monitored, and improved if needed

●

Internal training is conducted annually to help employees recognize and report illicit discharges

●

Proper storage and containment systems are in place for hazardous materials

●

●

Supplying diesel fuel to the boilers that contain less than 0.5% sulfur by weight

●

Ensuring the units are maintained in a manner to follow the manufacturer’s operating recommendations

2.4.7

Industrial Hygiene

The agency is in a continual cycle of renovation, repair, construction, and demolition of current facilities.
Safety and environmental considerations for these projects include:
●

Identification and abatement of asbestos and lead paint, and other contaminants present in
building materials that are to be disturbed

●

Proper identification, monitoring, and disposal of contaminated groundwater and soils

●

Removal of hazardous wastes that a previous facility owner may have left behind

The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division uses a third-party environmental consulting firm in
most cases to identify, mitigate, and prepare required reports for these activities. These environmental
consulting services can often be very expensive and time consuming. Identifying and addressing the need
for these environmental services at the inception of new projects is helpful in avoiding project delays, cost
increases, and non-compliance issues with regulatory agencies.

FT

Due to the large amount of petroleum contaminated rags, wipes, pads, and absorbents that the agency
historically generates at local maintenance facilities, it has been a long-standing best management
practice to separate most of this material from normally occurring trash throughout the facilities. Operating
facilities are equipped with specialized containers (mini-boxes) that are lined with thick cubic-yard-size
polyurethane tote bags that are manifested, sealed, and picked out of the mini-boxes by boom trucks and
taken separately offsite to avoid comingling with normal outgoing refuse. The contents of the mini-boxes
are profiled through a vendor-supplied customer database that also stores shipment details. The debris is
verified to be non-RCRA hazardous waste through periodic sampling and analytical lab reporting through
which the RTD Safety and Environmental Compliance Division has vetted. Pickup requests are called in by
local Storeroom Supervisors or RTD Safety and Environmental Compliance personnel.

ASSURANCE

The third element of the PTASP is Safety Assurance, which describes how the agency will monitor,
measure, and review its processes to ensure it remains in compliance with established standards.
These processes, safety performance targets, and reports provide assurance to leadership that the
organization and system are functioning at an acceptable level of safety. The reviews, inspections, rules
checks, and compliance verification procedures are described, required schedules set, and acceptable
measures established.

3.1 Internal Safety Review Process
Internal safety reviews (ISR) and inspections are critical components of an integrated system safety
program. As such, internal safety reviews are conducted semiannually to ensure compliance with the
SMS and that the plan is effectively implemented. Facilities are inspected monthly for occupational safety
issues and local fire codes. Written reports of each review are prepared and distributed once the ISR is
completed. Senior leaders will discuss safety reviews, evaluate the effectiveness of the SMS, recommend
corrective action if necessary and ensure timely implementation and follow up. An internal light rail review
report is compiled each year in January and submitted to the CPUC by Feb. 15. The report documents
the review findings for the year, including the results of internal reviews performed during the previous
year; a summary of required corrective actions taken, if any; and provision for follow-up to ensure timely
implementation and to determine effectiveness of the SMS. The annual audit report will be accompanied
by a formal letter of certification signed by the GM/CEO indicating that the agency is in compliance with
its SMS. If areas of deficiency are identified, the GM/CEO will identify the activities the agency will take to
achieve compliance. Documentation of inspection and reviews are maintained.

FT

As part of the ISR program, all departments are subject to review. The CSO is responsible for and has
complete authority to conduct ISRs. Two reviews are conducted annually, one in the summer and one in
the winter. Within a three-year period, all PTASP elements are reviewed for compliance with the plan and
CPUC requirements. The sixth review cycle, which is in the last quarter of the third year, is reserved to
review and revise the audit process to ensure that all elements are completed and that the program meets
CPUC requirements.

R
A

The agency will notify the CPUC of an upcoming review cycle at least 30 days prior to the start of the
safety review.

D

An opening conference may be scheduled with the departments subject to safety review. At the opening
conference, checklists are distributed, discussed, and reviewed for accuracy, and a schedule is set.
The actual ISR consists of interviews with key personnel, documentation review and observation of
activities to assess compliance and understanding of rules, training and procedures. After completion
of the onsite activities, the checklists are completed, and a written draft report is developed. The draft
report may include recommendations or findings. Recommendations are defined as suggestions to
make improvements, while findings are defined as documented deficiencies in the implementation of
established programs, rules or procedures. The draft report is distributed for review and comment to
the affected parties. A final report is completed and distributed to all parties. Recorded findings require
the development of a CAP. The annual ISR report prepared and submitted to the CPUC will include an
evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the SMS.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_v5B (4985 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

3.

Recommendations from previous review cycles will be reviewed and evaluated in subsequent cycles.
Findings will be tracked under the CAP process of placing all findings on a tracking spreadsheet and the
subsequent quarterly corrective action plan progress reports will be filed with the CPUC.
The agency has 30 days to respond to the draft report, including an opportunity to correct any findings.

3.1.1

Field Inspections/Co-op Walks

The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division conducts periodic field inspections/co-op walkthroughs. Maintenance facilities are inspected monthly to ensure compliance with occupational safety
regulations and common fire safety practices. Any deviations from required activities or identified safety
hazards are resolved through a formal reporting process.

3.1.2

Hazard and Accident Investigation, Notiﬁcation, Reporting,
and Corrective Action Plans

Formal investigations shall be conducted for all reportable events. All hazards and accidents are
investigated according to the Event Notification, Reporting and Investigation Policy and Procedure.
All reportable transit events, as defined in 4 CCR 723-7-7348 and 7350, will be tracked and evaluated by
the CSO and the affected chief/AGM. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division will oversee
event investigation activities with the CPUC and will provide as much advance notice as practicable to
notify the CPUC of an accident investigation. When investigating an accident as defined in 4 CCR 7237-7347, the agency will give prior sufficient telephone or email notice to CPUC staff of the times that an
accident investigation team will convene to conduct interviews, inspections, examinations, or tests to
determine the cause of the accident.

FT

Collect, Analyze, and Report Safety Management System Data,
and Maintain Records

SMS data is collected through a variety of sources including near miss information, accident investigation
reports, ISRs, safety committee meetings, occupational injury reports, incident reports, use of an accident
matrix, system monitoring including testing and inspection records and the hazard management program.
This safety data will be analyzed and used for development of key safety performance indicators and
targets. The agency reports the following to National Transit Database (NTD):
●

Fatalities – total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

Injuries – total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

Safety events – total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

System reliability – mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode

These safety performance measures are used to select improvement targets for these four measures
and for light rail, bus and paratransit to encourage improvements and monitor the safety performance of
delivering transit services. In addition, the agency selects additional performance measures and targets,
both leading and lagging, to ensure continual improvement of the SMS. The agency communicates safety
performance information internally using various methods of communication, including electronic message
boards, committee meetings, newsletters, and team/crew meetings to keep employees informed of SMS
initiatives, risks and performance.
The agency will make its safety performance measures improvement and targets available to applicable
state agencies (e.g., the Colorado Department of Transportation) and metropolitan planning organizations
(currently Denver Regional Council of Governments). To the maximum extent practicable, the agency will
coordinate with the external entities in the selection of external entity safety performance targets.

FT

The safety data collected will be analyzed for potential safety impacts. Identified areas of concern are
reported to appropriate personnel in the form of specific project reports and memos. Records of system
safety data are maintained in the office of the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division for a minimum
of three years. Certain information, such as safety certification backup documentation, is maintained by the
document control process managed by the Capital Programs Department. In addition to safety, the Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division maintains data and documentation of activities required by
the SMS.

System Modiﬁcations or Major Repairs

New facility equipment modifications and retrofits are reviewed and approved by the RTD engineering
group and the technical support staff. Review may also take place by the RTD Infrastructure Change
Review Committee. Non-infrastructure changes will follow the non-infrastructure change process.

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modiﬁcation Review

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are reviewed and approved by the Capital
Programs Department and Bus Operations, Rail Operations, and Safety and Environmental Compliance
divisions. This review is conducted to ensure that new equipment, expansions, and modifications safely
and operationally integrate into the existing system.

3.1.5.2 New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modiﬁcation Acceptance
Operational readiness of new equipment and system expansions is verified through the equipment
acceptance and safety and security certification process. The Bus Operations and Rail Operations divisions
perform rigorous equipment and integration testing as part of the vehicle and equipment acceptance
process. Once complete, new vehicles and equipment are formally accepted by the Bus Operations
and Rail Operations divisions. This information is presented and approved by the Safety and Security
Certification Program and described in section 3. The Safety and Security Certification Program provides
an identification, design, review, and verification process for system expansions and modifications.
Certification process completion is verified by sign-off from the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division.

3.1.5.3 Exceptions to Established Design Criteria

3.1.5.4 Procurement Procedures

FT

The agency has a process to request variances to design criteria. All variances go through three levels
of review. Level 4 and above exceptions to design criteria are approved only by the acceptance of the
CSO and the GM/CEO. If appropriate, the design criteria may be amended or modified to accommodate
acceptable modifications. The AGM of Capital Programs is responsible for the maintenance and distribution
of the design criteria. The design criteria will be reviewed prior to new corridor construction.

R
A

Procurement of equipment and materials is controlled by the Procurement Standards Manual. Each
procurement requires the development of detailed specifications assembled by the requesting manager.
Levels of review are built into the procurement process depending upon the scope of the procurement.
As the scope of the procurement increases, so does the level of review. Minor procurements require
authorization from the Contracting and Procurement Division and the division manager of the requesting
division. Major procurements, such as light rail- or bus construction-related projects or procurement of
buses or light rail vehicles (LRVs) vehicles, are subject to the following review process.

D

The Operations Department and technical support staff develop detailed specifications through the
design process. These specifications are subject to several internal reviews at varying levels of design and
personnel from other transit agencies, where relevant. In addition to procurement specifications, the safety
and security certification review process described in Section 3 governs construction.

Management of Change (MOC) comprises multiple streams of change that will consist of change
identification, risk assessment and impact analysis, review and approval, implementation, and training and
communication.
The overall MOC process is managed by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division in
collaboration with associated responsible parties for various streams of change. Changes will be reviewed
and approved by a committee of relevant stakeholders who will evaluate potential impacts and provide
approval to proceed if risks level is acceptable.
MOC per federal requirements is currently beginning to be integrated into procedures. Infrastructure
changes will be managed through the Infrastructure Change Review (ICR) process, which is managed
by the Capital Programs Department. The ICR process coordinates physical changes, before they are
implemented in the existing operating environment. Formal Project Management Plans are prepared for
large projects.
Representatives from each involved department and personnel from the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division are represented in the ICR and MOC processes. When changes are made to existing
structures or facilities, it is critical that affected personnel, the public or other groups be notified of changes
that might have potential safety or security impacts. Affected personnel are invited to participate in project
meetings and coordinate any changes. Additional training may be required. Operations and maintenance
procedures, bulletins or SOPs may need to be developed. Engagement and Communications Department
personnel assist with communications to outside agencies or affected groups. An essential element of
communications must take place after the project is completed. Any observed negative or hazardous
impacts of physical changes must be reported to the chief engineer or CSO, as soon as possible, so that
hazards may be assessed and included in the hazard resolution process.

3.2.1

FT

MOC process also applies to existing bus and light rail services systems, vehicles, facilities, and equipment
that may not require formal safety certification, but may have safety impacts.

Safety and Security Certiﬁcation

R
A

Safety and security certification programs will follow Safety and Security Certification Policy and associated
Framework to ensure that safety and security concerns and hazards are addressed prior to the initiation
of light rail and bus operations for new corridors, system extensions, rehabilitation, or modification or
replacement of equipment where new risks are introduced. The agency uses the FTA Handbook for Transit
Safety and Security Certification to develop the requirements for each safety and security certification
program. An individual safety and security certification plan is developed for each new corridor. Certain
projects might have a scaled certification proportional to potential risks introduced. For modifications or
rehabilitations, safety and security certification is addressed through the preparation of safety and security
certification forms applicable to the scope of work. If equipment is procured as part of a new maintenance
facility. LRVs undergo a formalized commissioning acceptance process owned by the manufacturer under
the supervision of Light Rail Operations.

D

The safety and security certification program has the following goals:
●

Verify that acceptable safety and security levels are met or exceeded through various phases of
the project’s lifecycle

●

Document the verification of safety and security standards

Quality Assurance

Capital projects have a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) function built into the design and
construction of the project. Specific personnel are responsible for QA/QC activities. In general, QA/QC
activities in large projects follow standard industry practice and are subject to review by the FTA and
others. Quality control during construction projects is a requirement of the contractor and submitted in the
quality plan prior to initiation of construction. The agency retains qualified inspectors and testing firms to
provide quality assurance by document submittal reviews and periodic testing of materials throughout
the project.

A TSS may incorporate violation trends or deficiencies for any rule or procedure into the risk management
program for resolution. Risks unresolved by the Rail Safety Committee (RSC) or the Bus Safety Committee
(BSC) are escalated based on the ORM Framework for further tracking, review, resolution, and/or
correction. Noncompliant review findings determined to be hazardous are documented in the hazard log. A
date of observation, description of the hazardous condition, corrective action required, and implementation
date are tracked until the hazardous condition is corrected. (See section 2 for further information.) The
Safety and Environmental Compliance Division conducts ongoing and regular observations and reviews to
determine the effectiveness of the rule compliance program.

Right-of-way rail maintenance uses a maintenance plan, RTD Maintenance of Way Track Safety Standards,
to maintain the track modeled to be in accordance with FRA regulations 49 CFR Part 213. The standard
outlines all aspects of proper maintenance and inspections regarding track.

3.4.3

Tracking and Resolving Hazards Identiﬁed During Inspections

Most safety hazards and concerns are resolved immediately by employees and/or supervisors, and
require no formal tracking process. Safety-critical hazards that cannot receive immediate attention are
forwarded to the appropriate supervisor and will be reported to the manager of safety or safety committee.
An observed safety critical hazard that cannot be corrected in a timely manner will be entered into the
hazard log for tracking purposes and mitigations will be managed in accordance with the risk management
process in section 2. A CAP, responsible person, and completion date will be assigned where warranted.
Follow-up inspections will verify that the hazard has been resolved.

3.5 Inspections and Reviews
Maintenance

Maintenance and service of all vehicles, equipment, and facilities is established using manufacturer
manuals, codes, standards, and established procedures as guidelines. Maintenance is performed at a level
of readiness that ensures safe, efficient, and reliable service. The agency maintains data to track scheduled
maintenance of vehicles and equipment.
Safety critical equipment that does not meet established requirements is withdrawn from service.
Vehicles or equipment involved in an accident are removed from service if there is reason to suspect that
equipment failure contributed to the cause of the accident. Vehicles or equipment are returned to service
only after they are determined that no defects could have contributed to the accident and if the equipment
is deemed safe for service. The agency has established procedures to ensure rapid deployment, recovery,
and return to service in the event of an emergency.
Effective maintenance is an indispensable prerequisite to safe and efficient operations. The Bus and Light
Rail divisions have standards that make safety and reliability the primary objectives of the system. These
goals are met through the incorporation of preventive and repair maintenance programs for all aspects of
the system. The Light Rail Vehicle (LRV) Maintenance Plan addresses incorporates the following principles:
●

Preventive maintenance programs will be cost-effective in minimizing service failures

●

Changes in preventive maintenance programs may be expected periodically as experience is
gained on the equipment maintained

●

Preventive maintenance goals and policies will not be altered due to time constraints or as a costreduction measure in times of financial stress

●

Effective maintenance procedures require much record-keeping and information storage/retrieval

●

The technical sophistication of the LRV, and the tracking of a large, expensive inventory, place a
heavy responsibility on the information capabilities of the light rail vehicle maintenance group

FT

The Bus Fleet Maintenance Plan addresses the following areas:
Maintenance division goals and objectives

3.6 Drug and Alcohol Program
Drug and Alcohol Program

The agency maintains an employee drug and alcohol program in compliance with DOT and FTA
regulations. The program includes criteria for random testing of safety sensitive personnel and testing for
cause, either accident related or from observed behavior. The Human Resources Department manages this
program, which is subject to frequent review by the FTA.
Drug and alcohol testing and information about drug and alcohol abuse is included in the Drug and Alcohol
Policy. Training on this policy is required for each new hire and provided during orientation and through
self-guided educational video. The program is administered by the Manager of HR DOT Compliance who
verifies compliance with the program and oversees training. Revisions to the program are distributed to all
employees.
GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT
The agency is dedicated being a trusted leader in mobility, delivering excellence and value to its
community and customers and to providing a healthy, safe, and satisfying work environment for employees.
The agency and the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001 agree that employees must be able to
work in a drug- and alcohol-free work environment. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect
the rights and privacy of all employees. The employer has the right and duty to protect its employees,
customers, and the public from the adverse effects of drug abuse and alcohol misuse. It is not the intent of
the employer to restrict employees’ on-the-job conduct.
A successful drug and alcohol program must address the safety implications of drug abuse and alcohol
misuse and must also institute proper procedures and controls guaranteeing accurate alcohol and drug
testing results, while preserving confidentiality and focusing on rehabilitation through an effective
employee assistance program.

FT

It is the responsibility of all employees to report to work not under the influence of alcohol or controlled
substances. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect and respect employees’ rights and privacy.
To meet these goals and comply with legal requirements, the agency has implemented this policy to:
Detect drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through testing

●

Encourage employees to obtain treatment and rehabilitation for drug and alcohol problems

●

Deter drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through random testing, education, training, and
discipline

●

Enforce the goal of a drug- and alcohol-free work environment through appropriate discipline

R
A

●

Drug and alcohol abuse can have profound effects on the health, work, and personal life not only of
the abuser, but also the abuser’s family, friends and the public at large. Employees should be aware of
the signs and symptoms of drug or alcohol problems, and of available methods of intervening when a
substance abuse problem is suspected.

D

Many elements of this policy are required by federal regulations covering persons in safety-sensitive
job classifications.
Employees wishing to review federal regulations on drug and alcohol use may contact the Manager of DOT
Compliance.

Packet Pg. 92

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_v5B (4985 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

3.6.1

To the extent that any elements of this policy may conflict with federal or state regulations as they may
be amended or revised in the future, the regulations shall take precedence. Employees are expected
to review, be familiar with, and obey this policy and all laws concerning drug and alcohol use and
testing. All existing and new employees must receive at least 60 minutes of training on the effects and
consequences of prohibited drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment and the signs
and symptoms that may indicate prohibited drug use.
Compliance with this policy, including participation in the drug and alcohol testing program, is a required
condition of employment.

3.6.2

Applicability

3.6.2.1 Categories of Employees
This policy applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive employees, volunteers and contractors
and are referred to in this policy as “employees” unless otherwise noted. This policy applies to all
employees while on agency property to perform their duties or while performing any work-related
business. Visitors and vendors are expected to adhere to this policy while on agency property.

The following are safety-sensitive functions:

FT

In addition to being subject to all other elements of this policy, employees who perform “safety sensitive
functions” for RTD, as that term is defined in federal regulations 49 CFR Part 40 as amended and Part
655, are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other specific requirements set forth in this
policy. Generally, a safety-sensitive function occurs when an employee is performing, ready to perform, or
immediately available to perform any duty related to the safe operation of public transportation.

4.2 Training and Certiﬁcation Program
Employee Safety Training, Certiﬁcation, Veriﬁcation, and Performance Testing

Employees receive formal training and certification for the work they perform according to their job
classification. The categories of safety-related work requiring training and certification are Rail and
Bus Operators and Maintainers. The specific programs are discussed below. However, each training
and certification program contains classroom and hands-on training and written exams. Certification
documentation, including tests and test scores, is maintained in employee files and is subject to review
during the internal safety review program.
Except for the on-track safety training program required of contractors working on or near RTD rail
property, the agency does not train or certify contractors or employees of contractors. The on-track safety
training program is required of contractors prior to issuance of an access permit to work near or on RTD
rail property. The program is usually instructed in a train-the-trainer format allowing contractors to train
their own personnel. Compliance with this program is verified through in-field observation and examination
of contractor training cards. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division maintains a log of all
contractors trained under the program.
Regarding performance testing (to include operational tests and efficiency checks), any operating or
maintenance rule is subject to verification and compliance. Compliance with rules, training, and certification
requirements is verified in several ways. Rail and bus operators are frequently observed in the field
by supervisors and Safety and Environmental Compliance Division personnel; however, a supervisor
must discuss an observed rule violation with the operator as soon as practicable. In addition to ongoing
monitoring and observation, rail and bus operators are subject to formal ride checks in which supervisors,
usually anonymously or covertly, observe operators according to predetermined criteria or a checklist.
These ride checks are documented, reviewed with the operator, and maintained in the operator’s
employee file. These records are subject to verification during the ISR process. Any trend or issue
discovered during system monitoring, observation, and ride checks is reported to divisional leadership and
the CSO for inclusion in the operational risk management risk register.

4.2.2

R
A

FT

Bus, rail, and facility maintainers also receive direct supervision, including observation and verification of
their maintenance activities. Each piece of work that is assigned to a maintainer is reviewed and approved
for correctness by their immediate supervisor through the work order process. When a Maintainer
completes a work assignment, the direct supervisor verifies and approves the work through observation
and signature approval on the work order. The maintainer will enter in the enterprise asset management
system that the work is complete, and the direct supervisor will verify and approve the work, then accept
that the work was properly completed in the enterprise system. Maintenance activities are also observed
during the ISR process. Supervision is assessed during the ISR program by the review of documentation
and compliance with schedules. If issues are discovered, they are reported as recommendations or
findings in the review report. Review findings are referred for inclusion in the hazard
management program.

All contractor work on or near agency light rail property is controlled by access permits. Prior to issuing an
access permit, the contractor is required to meet with staff from Capital Engineering and Rail Operations
to describe and coordinate their work. After this initial coordination, the contractor applies for a permit,
which is reviewed and approved by Light Rail Maintenance of Way, Rail Transportation and Safety and
Environmental Compliance prior issuance by Light Rail Maintenance of Way. The contractor is bound
to the requirements of the permit. All contractors working with the agency are also bound by contract
specifications for the work they are to perform.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps

September 11, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Stuart Summers, Chief Communications and Engagement Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
On Tuesday, February 27, 2024, General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson commissioned
a peer review of RTD’s paratransit service delivery, to be conducted by transit industry subject-matter
experts. The American Public Transportation Association (APTA) convened a peer review panel that
included a geographical representation of panelists from across the country. During the course of the
months-long thorough review, the panelists leveraged their expertise and professional experience to
assess both RTD’s Access-a-Ride (AaR) service, the agency’s complementary Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) paratransit service, and RTD’s Access-on-Demand (AoD) premium supplemental paratransit
service. A copy of the APTA Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next steps were distributed to the
Board of Directors on August 21, 2024, by GM/CEO Johnson.
The overarching goal of the peer review was to help the agency better understand strengths and
opportunities, with respect to both ADA complementary paratransit and premium supplemental ondemand service, and to note potential improvements that support long-term sustainability. The panel
conducted a review of RTD’s paratransit operations to identify (1) best practices employed by similar
transit agencies, including for demand-response programs; (2) model program parameters, including
responsible cost controls and sound customer-facing processes; and (3) software, hardware, or other
tools to ensure optimal service performance and program cost-effectiveness.
DISCUSSION
Staff will provide a high-level briefing regarding the APTA Peer review final report and outline the
agency’s next steps. A more in-depth presentation will be provided to the full Board of Directors during
the Board Meeting scheduled for September 24, 2024.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this discussion item.
