of interest.

new Chair has been elected and the new Chair will make this appointment.

Incorporated for the FasTracks Information Communications and Public Outreach
consultant contract, General Manager Washington indicated that his team has

will go out to the Board members today. Additionally, they have made a change
to remove the CAC function from Virtegic back to CRL under a change order and
will modify both contracts accordingly.
Director Malpiede expressed a concern over the appropriateness of asking for
metrics and measurements from Virtegic when we do not require this from other
vendors. General Manager Washington indicated that he too was concerned
about this request from a DBE vendor. However, they will be addressing
expected deliverables from Virtegic.
