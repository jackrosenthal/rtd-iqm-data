#### 1. Approval of the Purchase of Six Electric Multiple Units (EMU) Vehicles for the North Metro Rail Line

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the purchase of six Electric Multiple Units (EMU) vehicles for the North Metro Rail Line through the Denver Transit Partners (DTP) Rolling Stock Option in accordance with the EAGLE Concession Agreement (CA) Section 31.1, for an amount not to exceed $24 million.  Funding to purchase two of the vehicles is included in the 2013 Adopted Budget for the North Metro Corridor project.

It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to transfer $16 million from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve to the North Metro Corridor project budget to fund the purchase of the additional four EMU vehicles.

#### 2. Resolution Regarding Easement Agreements and Indemnification of Claims with Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc.

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopt the attached resolution.  The resolution authorizes the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute two easement agreements with Suncor; one agreement that grants an easement to RTD for the North Metro Rail Line (“NMRL”) project through Suncor property in Adams County (the “Bridge Easement”) and another agreement that grants an easement to Suncor to construct a pipeline in the RTD owned Boulder Industrial Lead (“BIL”) right of way (the “Pipeline Easement”).  The Bridge Easement requires RTD to waive sovereign immunity to the extent it may be applicable, and to indemnify Suncor for claims arising out of RTD’s use of the Bridge Easement in an amount up to $200 million and to purchase general liability insurance in that amount from the date of commencement of construction of the bridge and to maintain it through termination of the Bridge Easement.  RTD would receive $10,000,000 from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement, and would pay Suncor $836,420 for the Bridge Easement.  This would result in net revenue of $9,163,580 to RTD, which would be applied to the cost of expansion of the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF) to accommodate the North Metro vehicles.

It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $836,420 from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve for the acquisition of the Bridge Easement.  These funds would be replenished out of the $10,000,000 to be received from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement.

#### 3. Moving Forward: Filling the FasTracks Internal Savings Account

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct staff to move forward with implementation of the eight, highest value, recommended opportunities identified as part of the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Any funding realized through these activities will be tracked separately and added to a new budget account, the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA). The status of the FISA will be reported to the RTD Board of Directors on a monthly basis, and the FISA will be incorporated into the FasTracks Strategic Budget Plan and Annual Budget. Expenditures from the FISA will be subject to Board approval, with the staff recommended project goals identified below in the Background section of this report confirmed as the current RTD Board project goals for the FISA.

Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:

Beginning in 2014, increase FasTracks funding to support base system operations at the rate of inflation as defined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI):
- Estimated to contribute $24 million to the FISA by 2017;

Reduce FasTracks Minimum Unrestricted Fund Balance once construction milestones have been reached, the majority of the Eagle Project grant funding has been received and RTD has better information on the growth of sales and use tax:
- Estimated to contribute up to $72 million to the FISA by 2017;

Reduce FasTracks Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Fund Balance from three to two months:
- Estimated to contribute $10 million to the FISA by 2017;

Defer Southwest Corridor Extension Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) relocation – complete once funding is identified for the entire project:
- Estimated to contribute $9 million to the FISA by 2017;

Work to achieve project underruns on FasTracks projects currently under contract:
- Estimated to contribute $15 million to the FISA by 2017;

Sell or lease RTD properties, where possible:
- Estimated to contribute $20 million to the FISA by 2017;

Request stakeholders to increase financial participation above the current level of 2.5%:
- Estimated contribution – To Be Determined;

Work with legislature to allow RTD to audit sales and use tax receipts and provide RTD with parity with the State on sales tax exemptions (i.e., ensure exemptions are the same for both RTD and the State in all cases). Establish this as RTD’s number one legislative priority. Begin working immediately with government relations staff, lobbyists, legal counsel and other stakeholders to initiate and support the introduction of a bill(s) on these topics during the 2013 legislative session:
- Estimated to contribute up to $127 million to the FISA by 2017.

Approval of the opportunities listed above will have a positive impact to the FasTracks capital program through the establishment of the FISA with a goal of achieving $300 million by 2017. It is anticipated that these eight highest priority opportunities alone could fund the FISA up to or exceeding $277 million by 2017. The Board directs staff to continue working to identify other funding opportunities through the RAM analysis process in 2013 for potential Board consideration at a later date.
