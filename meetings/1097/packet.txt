1.1.2.a

Packet Pg. 16

1.1.2.a

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

Overview
• On July 6, 2012, President Obama signed into
law the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st
Century Act (MAP-21)
– Two year reauthorization at current levels plus
inflation
– Expires September 30, 2014
– Transfers $22 billion into the Highway Trust Fund
(HTF) to cover the funding gap, and completely
exhausts the HTF
– One of the most significant pieces of legislation
enacted this past Congress, demonstrating the
importance of transportation infrastructure

Packet Pg. 17

1.1.2.a

MAP-21 Provision
• Reforms and
streamlines the
New Starts
process

Significance for RTD
• Expedites the New Starts process by
eliminating / consolidating phases
• Removes the ratings requirement for
approval to enter the process
• Creates a new category for projects that
add capacity to existing lines
• Preserves Small Starts eligibility for BRT
projects that do not operate in a dedicated
right of way
• Creates a pilot program with greater
flexibility for projects that use innovative
approaches
• Ultimately, MAP-21 provides for a faster
process but expands eligibility, likely
increasing competition

Highlights of MAP-21: New Starts

1.1.2.a

MAP-21 Provision
• Eliminates most
discretionary
programs and
expands formula
programs

Significance for RTD
•

Eliminates Bus and Bus Facilities grant programs
and replaces them with smaller formula program
Ø We worked with RTD to secure significant
grants under this program over the past few
years, expecting it to be formularized

•

Combines remaining bus funds with Rail
Modernization funds to create a new State of Good
Repair formula program
Ø New program ends legacy earmarks, providing
more funding for newer systems

•

Ultimately, Colorado and RTD receive essentially
the same amount of funding, but receive
guaranteed funding instead of the “ups and downs”
of discretionary grants

Core RTD Priorities

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

Summary: Core RTD Priorities
MAP-21

• Avoid program cuts and preserve
dedicated transit funding
• Make sure that RTD and Colorado get
their fair share of transit funding
• Streamline the New Starts process
• Maintain Small Starts eligibility for BRT
projects that do not use a bus-only lane

Packet Pg. 23

1.1.2.a

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

The Next Reauthorization
• MAP-21 is a two-year bill. The next Congress
will have to reauthorize or extend MAP-21
• The fundamental issue remains the financing
question, i.e., how to pay for it
– The federal surface transportation program is funded
primarily through the gas tax, which is set at a fixed 18.4
cents per gallon
– The gas tax has not been increased since 1993
– Gas tax revenue has steadily declined as cars have
become more fuel efficient, resulting in what is now a
~$15 billion funding gap per year

Packet Pg. 24

1.1.2.a

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

The Short-Term Solution
• Since 2008, Congress has transferred $56 billion into the
Highway Trust Fund to maintain its solvency
– General Fund transfers break the link between the dedicated
user fee (the gas tax) and federal transportation spending
– This, in turn, threatens the special budgetary status of the
surface transportation program, such as having:
• Multi-year bills with guaranteed funding that do not have to
compete with other priorities in the appropriations process
• A “firewall” that keeps gas tax revenues solely for
transportation purposes
• An exemption from automatic spending cuts

• Continued General Fund transfers at this pace are ultimately
politically unsustainable

Implications of the Election, the
“Fiscal Cliff” and the Agenda
Ahead

Packet Pg. 27

1.1.2.a

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

The Fiscal Cliff
• Congress must act to avoid a “fiscal cliff” that
includes $503 billion in tax increases and
automatic spending cuts (“sequestration”) set to
take effect January 1st
• Sequestration would not impact Highway Trust
Fund programs but would impact the New Starts
program because it is funded from the General
Fund

Packet Pg. 28

The Fiscal Cliff
• Most observers believe there will be a deal to
avert the fiscal cliff
– Potential outcome is short-term deal combined with
framework for comprehensive fiscal reform in 113th
Congress
– Deal may include some spending cuts this year

• RTD’s priority is both to avoid “sequestration”
and avoid / minimize any New Starts cuts
resulting from fiscal cliff deal

Transportation Funding
• Congress will confront the HTF shortfall and
transportation funding in the context of a
comprehensive focus on fiscal issues
• Alternatives for the future of the surface
transportation program:
– Raise new revenue
– Cut the program
– “Kick the can down the road”

1.1.2.a

Attachment: Patton Boggs PPT Dec 2012 (1415 : Patton Boggs Federal Update)

Transportation Funding
• Key questions:
– Will transportation funding be addressed as part of
comprehensive fiscal package?
• Many stakeholders believe that a comprehensive deal
offers the “political space” to reach a solution

– Within a larger package or on its own, what are the
options for raising revenue?
• Raise the gas tax?
• Tie transportation funding to new energy revenue?
• Use the “peace dividend”?
• Use revenue from tax reform, or other
non-transportation revenue?

The Impact of the Election

issues; focus is on the
revenue question

The Impact of the Election
• The election puts the elements in place for a
deal that increases revenue, rather than an
approach that cuts the program
– President Obama campaigned on infrastructure
investment
– Bi-partisan support for transportation investment in
the Senate
– Chairman Shuster has expressed his desire to
stabilize the HTF with long-term dedicated revenue
– Hurricane Sandy further reinforced importance of
transit infrastructure

The Impact of the Election
• Puts the focus squarely on solving the revenue gap
• But an extremely challenging question
– Gas tax has not been raised for 20 years
– Gas prices at near-record highs
– Complications with other revenue sources
• Ultimately, the current path is not sustainable and
“something has to give”
– Calls for continued engagement and vigilance by
stakeholder community

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: November 28, 2012

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 28, 2012

Board Meeting Date: December 4, 2012

Subject:

Disposition Plan for Excess Land in Ft. Lupton,
Weld County

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
proposed Disposition Plan for excess land for the 80,173 square feet (1.84 acres) net of county road
right of way located at 13215 Weld County Road 8, Fort Lupton, Colorado and further authorize the
General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute a contract for the sale of the property.
BACKGROUND
The Agreement Regarding Engineering Design and Railroad Property Acquisition by and between Union
Pacific Railroad Company and the Regional Transportation District dated January 25, 2007 contemplated
an acquisition of UPRR sites in Denver, Fort Lupton and Brighton and a relocation of UPRR to Weld
County. The Agreement provided that in order for the FasTracks Project to proceed on schedule and to
avoid delays, it would be necessary and desirable for the UPRR to purchase, or purchase options for,
certain Relocation Sites prior to the completion of negotiations on the Final Agreement between the
parties. Pursuant to the Agreement, RTD paid UPRR 100% of costs, fees and expenses incurred by
UPRR related to the identification of, due diligence on, and purchase and ownership of six properties in
Weld County and one property in Denver County. RTD determined that is was not feasible to proceed
with acquisition and relocation of UPRR facilities and therefore according to the terms of the Agreement,
UPRR assigned or transferred to RTD the properties at no additional cost to RTD.
Resolution No. 8, Series of 2008 Concerning the Sale of Property Acquired by the Regional
Transportation District from the Union Pacific Railroad was adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on
May 20, 2008 and provided that property acquired by the District from the UPRR pursuant to the
January 25, 2007 Agreement and not needed by the District for mass transit purposes would first be
offered to its original owners at the price paid by the UPRR plus direct expenses related to the transfer
of the property, and if not reacquired by the original owners on those terms would be marketed to obtain
the best price for the District. The owner of the property subject to this Board Action was notified of
the option to acquire the property back. The owner chose not to acquire the property at that time.
The subject property consist of a one story 3,688 square foot, single family residence which has been
substantially vandalized with two other vacant auxiliary houses and a small shed on 1.84 acres of
former residential property. Zoning of the property is I-2 (Heavy Industrial District) by the Town of Fort
Lupton.
DISCUSSION
An unsolicited offer to acquire was received on the property. An appraisal report was completed by an
independent appraiser, Sue Ann Foster, MAI, Foster Valuation Company LLC. Ms. Foster concluded an
opinion of the fair market value of the fee-simple interest in the subject property of $135,000 or 80,173
square feet at $2.25 per square foot ($180,389) less demolition costs of $45,000.

Packet Pg. 41

2.1.1

PROPOSED DISPOSITION PLAN: In accordance with Resolution No. 10, Series of 1984, Joint
Development and Disposition of Property Rights, the General Manager find that the RTD owned property
known as 13215 Weld County Road 8, Fort Lupton, Colorado Is not needed for transit use.
The appraisal report established a fair market value for the property. Mr. Robert Villano, Authorized
Manager of Villano Brothers Properties, Inc. represented by Mr. Peter G. Gunderson, Larry A. Cornell and
Mr. Bob Bruce, Esquire has agreed to enter into a Purchase and Sale Agreement for the appraised value.
The property will be sold “as is-where is”.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD will receive the purchase price at closing. The proceeds will be assigned to the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors approve the proposed Disposition Plan for excess land for the 80,173
square feet (1.84 acres) net of county road right of way located at 13215 Weld County Road 8, Fort
Lupton, Colorado and further authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and
execute a contract for the sale of the property.
2. Do not approve the proposed Disposition Plan for excess land for the 80,173 square feet (1.84
acres) net of county road right of way located at 13215 Weld County Road 8, Fort Lupton, Colorado
and further authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute a contract
for the sale of the property.

Board Meeting Date: December 4, 2012

Subject:

Approval of the Purchase of Six Electric
Multiple Units (EMU) Vehicles for the North
Metro Rail Line

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the purchase of six Electric Multiple Units (EMU) vehicles for the
North Metro Rail Line through the Denver Transit Partners (DTP) Rolling Stock Option in accordance
with the EAGLE Concession Agreement (CA) Section 31.1, for an amount not to exceed $24 million.
Funding to purchase two of the vehicles is included in the 2013 Adopted Budget for the North Metro
Corridor project.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to transfer $16 million from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve to
the North Metro Corridor project budget to fund the purchase of the additional four EMU vehicles.
BACKGROUND
Final design for Phase 1 (DUS to 72 nd Avenue Station) of the North Metro Rail Line (NMRL) is
underway and construction for the first 2.5 miles from DUS to the National Western Stock Show
(NWSS) is funded. RTD is actively pursuing avenues to secure the funds for the next 3.5 miles from
NWSS to 72 nd Avenue with the intent of building Phase 1 as a continuous construction package.
Construction of the 2.5 mile segment from DUS to NWSS is scheduled to be completed and ready
for revenue service in 2017. A single two car train is required to operate from DUS to NWSS with
30 minute headways. An additional four vehicles are needed to provide 30 minute headways to 72 nd
Avenue.
The EAGLE CA anticipated the purchase of the North Metro fleet and included an option that allows
the purchase of no less than 8 and no more than 24 additional Cars (the Rolling Stock Option Cars).
The CA allows us to exercise the option up to 24 months prior to the scheduled delivery of the last
base car. Based on the current revised baseline schedule, that date is approximately February 2013.
DISCUSSION
The Eagle CA only allows for a minimum purchase of eight vehicles. DTP is willing to allow RTD to
exercise the option in the EAGLE CA for the reduced number of cars provided that the request is
authorized before December 20, 2012. The vehicles will be identical to the Eagle vehicles and will
share the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF). Identical vehicles will all ow for interchange
of vehicles and parts.
The cost estimate included in the 2012 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) for two EMU vehicles was
$8,020,000. This price assumed a purchase of between 15 and 30 vehicles. The cost for a
manufacturer to mobilize to produce such a small order would greatly exceed that price if a
manufacturer could even be convinced to bid on such a limited order.

Packet Pg. 67

3.2.1

If RTD were to purchase only two vehicles now and look to buy the additional four vehicles after
funding is secured for the segment to 72 nd Avenue the cost is estimated to be, at a minimum, in
excess of $6 million per vehicle.
We recommend exercising the option of purchasing six cars through the EAGLE CA because the
price is reasonable, allows for interchangeable parts with the EAGLE fleet, and continues to show
forward movement in taking concrete steps toward to goal of completing the full build out of the
NMRL.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the purchase of two vehicles is included in the 2013 Adopted Budget for the North
Metro Corridor project. Funding for the purchase of the remaining four vehicles would be provided
through the recommended transfer from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve. Staff will investigate
additional funding sources to replenish the FasTracks Contingency Reserve at a future date.
Payment for each Rolling Stock Option Car shall be made by RTD to the Concessionaire in
accordance with the payment schedule noted in CA Section 31.1(i).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the purchase of six
Electric Multiple Units (EMU) vehicles for the North Metro Rail Line through the Denver Transit
Partners (DTP) Rolling Stock Option in accordance with the EAGLE Concession Agreement (CA)
Section 31.1, for an amount not to exceed $24 million. Funding to purchase two of the vehicles is
included in the 2013 Adopted Budget for the North Metro Corridor project.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to transfer $16 million from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve to
the North Metro Corridor project budget to fund the purchase of the additional four EMU vehicles.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the North Metro Rail Line approach. This is
not recommended as RTD does not have another avenue to purchase EMU vehicles identical to
EAGLE Fleet. This alternative would delay operations from DUS to NWSS and negatively impact the
effective implementation of the FasTracks North Metro Rail Line.

Resolution Regarding Easement Agreements
and Indemnification of Claims with Suncor
Energy (U.S.A.) Inc.

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopt
the attached resolution. The resolution authorizes the General Manager or his designee to negotiate
and execute two easement agreements with Suncor; one agreement that grants an easement to RTD
for the North Metro Rail Line (“NMRL”) project through Suncor property in Adams County (the
“Bridge Easement”) and another agreement that grants an easement to Suncor to construct a
pipeline in the RTD owned Boulder Industrial Lead (“BIL”) right of way (the “Pipeline Easement”).
The Bridge Easement requires RTD to waive sovereign immunity to the extent it may be applicable,
and to indemnify Suncor for claims arising out of RTD’s use of the Bridge Easement in an amount up
to $200 million and to purchase general liability insurance in that amount from the date of
commencement of construction of the bridge and to maintain it through termination of the Bridge
Easement. RTD would receive $10,000,000 from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement,
and would pay Suncor $836,420 for the Bridge Easement. This would result in net revenue of
$9,163,580 to RTD, which would be applied to the cost of expansion of the Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility (CRMF) to accommodate the North Metro vehicles.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Boar d of Directors
authorize the transfer of $836,420 from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve for the acquisition of
the Bridge Easement. These funds would be replenished out of the $10,000,000 to be received
from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement.
BACKGROUND
In December of 2011, Suncor approached RTD with a request to purchase an easement from RTD to
be used for the installation of a new pipeline (the “Pipeline Project”). The Pipeline Project consists of
construction a 16-inch crude oil pipeline system, running from Wyoming to Commerce City, Colorado
and a 10-inch pipeline running for approximately 1,000-feet from Brighton Boulevard to East 66 th
Avenue in Commerce City.
In 2009, RTD purchased the Boulder Industrial Lead (BIL) from the Union Paci fic Railroad for the
purpose of using the corridor to construct and operate the NMRL. Suncor would like to use a portion
of this right of way for the 10-inch and 16-inch pipeline. The requested Pipeline Easement would be
parallel to but lateral from the future NMRL tracks.
The Pipeline Easement is approximately 15 miles long and 20 to 30 feet wide, starting on the north
side within Section 36, Township 1 North, Range 68 West in Weld County and proceeds south to

Packet Pg. 70

3.2.2

Section 7, Township 3 South, Range 67 West in Adams County. The Pipeline Easement parallels the
NMRL from beyond the end of line station at 162 nd Avenue to south of the 72 nd Avenue Station, at a
minimum lateral distance of 25-feet away from the centerline of the nearest track which will not
interfere with the use and maintenance of the NMRL. The 10-inch pipeline is located in the south
end of our BIL right of way in an area not used by the NMRL.
RTD agreed to negotiate granting of the Pipeline Easement contingent on Suncor granting RTD the
bridge easement for the future NMRL that will run through the Suncor property on an elevated
structure requiring an aerial easement approximately 5300 feet long by 24 feet wide. RTD also
requested that Suncor include provisions for a gravel access road.
DISCUSSION
The price to be paid by Suncor for the Pipeline Easement is $10,000,000. The easement was
appraised by David B. Clayton, Certified General Appraiser for Suncor Energy Services, Inc. The
property was appraised under two valuation techniques, commonly known as Across the Fence and
Across the Fence Plus Corridor Enhancement Factor and is based on several “extraordinary
assumptions. The appraisal was reviewed for RTD by Integra Realty Resources, Houston, Texas and
signed by Michael W. Welch, Principal and Certified General Real Estate Appraiser, Brad Weiman,
MAI, Managing Director and John P. Baker, MAI. The review concludes that Mr. Clayton’s use of
the methodologies used is an acceptable means of valuation that is recognized by industry peers,
published treatise and acceptable standards and in general agrees that the value of the easement,
$4,031,930 is reasonable. Through negotiation, Suncor has agreed to pay $10,000,000 for the
pipeline easement and to make a onetime payment in the amount of $500,000 to be used toward
installation of the gravel access road.
Engineering plans for the Pipeline Project have been reviewed by RTD’s engineering staff to ensure
compatibility with the NMRL. Submittal of final plans is expected in December 2012. Final signi ng
of the Pipeline Easement is contingent upon final approval and acceptance of the Suncor’s
construction plans by the RTD engineering staff and final approval of the form and substance of the
Pipeline Easement Agreement.
The current estimated value of the bridge easement is $836,420 based on an appraisal prepared by
David B. Clayton for Suncor. The appraisal will be reviewed for RTD when received from Suncor.
Final signing of the bridge easement is contingent upon RTD review and acceptance of the appraised
value and final approval of the form and substance of the bridge easement Agreement.
Total Cost for Easement Agreement:
Pipeline Easement
Bridge Easement

$10,000,000
$
836,420

As noted in the Resolution, the bridge easement requires RTD to waive sovereign immunity to the
extent it may be applicable, and to indemnify Suncor for claims arising out of RTD’s use of the
bridge easement. Suncor is also required to indemnify RTD for claims arising out of Suncor’s use of
the Pipeline Easement in an amount to be determined based on RTD risk management review. RTD is
required to maintain $200 million of passenger rail liability on its entire corridor due to federal and
freight railroad requirements and so will not be increasing its level of insurance cove rage to benefit
Suncor. Suncor has requested it be required to insure RTD at a level commensurate with its pipeline
coverage in other corridors.

Packet Pg. 71

3.2.2

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the acquisition of the bridge easement is not presently included in the North Metro
budget since the bridge easement is part of the construction project from National Western Stock
Show to 72nd Avenue Station. The recommended budget transfer would provide funding for the
acquisition of the Bridge Easement, and would be replenished from the proceeds of the Pipeline
Easement when this easement is executed. In addition, the approval of this resolution would result in
a net gain of approximately $9,163,580 to the District. These funds will be applied to the cost of
expansion of the CRMF to accommodate the North Metro vehicles, as approved by the Board on
September 18, 2012.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors adopt the attached resolution. The resolution authorizes the
General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute two easement agreements with
Suncor; one agreement that grants an easement to RTD for the North Metro Rail Line (“NMRL”)
project through Suncor property in Adams County (the “bridge easement”) and another
agreement that grants an easement to Suncor to construct a pipeline in the RTD owned Boulder
Industrial Lead (“BIL”) right of way (the “Pipeline Easement”). The bridge Easement requires RTD
to waive sovereign immunity to the extent it may be applicable, and to indemnify Suncor for
claims arising out of RTD’s use of the bridge easement in an amount up to $200 million and to
purchase general liability insurance in that amount from the date of commencement of
construction of the bridge and to maintain it through termination of the bridge easement. RTD
would receive $10,000,000 from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement, and would pay
Suncor $836,420 for the Bridge Easement. This would result in net revenue of $9,163,5 80 to
RTD, which would be applied to the cost of expansion of the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility
(CRMF) to accommodate the North Metro vehicles.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the transfer of $836,420 from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve for the
acquisition of the Bridge Easement. These funds would be replenished out of the $10,000,000
to be received from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not agree to adopt this resolution, do not grant
Suncor the Pipeline Easement and forgo the receipt of $10,000,000; do not acquire the
easement for the future NMRL until a future date when all funding for the construction of that
project is in place. This alternative would negatively impact the effective implementation of the
NMRL as well as the cost recovery for the CRMF.

as part of the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Any funding realized through these activities will be tracked
separately and added to a new budget account, the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA). The
status of the FISA will be reported to the RTD Board of Directors on a monthly basis, and the FISA will
be incorporated into the FasTracks Strategic Budget Plan and Annual Budget. Expenditures from the
FISA will be subject to Board approval, with the staff recommended project goals identified below in the
Background section of this report confirmed as the current RTD Board project goals for the FISA.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:
1. Beginning in 2014, increase FasTracks funding to support base system operations at the rate of
inflation as defined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI):
 Estimated to contribute $24 million to the FISA by 2017;
2. Reduce FasTracks Minimum Unrestricted Fund Balance once construction milestones have been
reached, the majority of the Eagle Project grant funding has been received and RTD has better
information on the growth of sales and use tax:
 Estimated to contribute up to $72 million to the FISA by 2017;
3. Reduce FasTracks Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Fund Balance from three to two months:
 Estimated to contribute $10 million to the FISA by 2017;
4. Defer Southwest Corridor Extension Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) relocation – complete once
funding is identified for the entire project:
 Estimated to contribute $9 million to the FISA by 2017;
5. Work to achieve project underruns on FasTracks projects currently under contract:
 Estimated to contribute $15 million to the FISA by 2017;
6. Sell or lease RTD properties, where possible:
 Estimated to contribute $20 million to the FISA by 2017;
7. Request stakeholders to increase financial participation above the current level of 2.5%:
 Estimated contribution – To Be Determined;
8. Work with legislature to allow RTD to audit sales and use tax receipts and provide RTD with
parity with the State on sales tax exemptions (i.e., ensure exemptions are the same for both RTD
and the State in all cases). Establish this as RTD’s number one legislative priority. Begin working
immediately with government relations staff, lobbyists, legal counsel and other stakeholders to
initiate and support the introduction of a bill(s) on these topics during the 2013 legislative
session:
 Estimated to contribute up to $127 million to the FISA by 2017.

Approval of the opportunities listed above will have a positive impact to the FasTracks capital program
through the establishment of the FISA with a goal of achieving $300 million by 2017. It is anticipated
that these eight highest priority opportunities alone could fund the FISA up to or exceeding $277 million
by 2017. The Board directs staff to continue working to identify other funding opportunities through the
RAM analysis process in 2013 for potential Board consideration at a later date.
BACKGROUND
Over the last several months, RTD staff has developed a Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) that identifies
specific cost saving/revenue enhancing opportunities that, if enacted, would result in additional nearterm funding for the FasTracks program (i.e., by 2017). For each of these opportunities, staff has
identified the associated level of risk to the District and presented this risk assessment to the RTD Board
on November 13, 2012 for their consideration. All funding identified through the process will be added
to the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) until enough funding is accumulated to complete and
operate additional projects. Staff has identified the following project goals for 2017, and this confirms
the RTD Board’s concurrence with these goals at this juncture:




Completion of US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project;
Construction of North Metro to at least 72nd;
Any remaining funds above the $300 million goal could leverage potential grants or private sector
contributions for FasTracks partially-funded projects (at the RTD Board’s discretion).

Ultimately, future RTD Board policy actions will be required to determine what projects will be funded,
and when, through the FISA.

DISCUSSION
On November 13, 2012, staff presented the eight, highest value, recommended opportunities identified
as part of the RAM. For each of these opportunities, staff identified an estimated contribution to the
FISA by 2017 and a level of risk. The following table summarizes the information presented to the RTD
Board in November:

Highest Value Recommended RAM
Opportunities
1

Beginning in 2014, increase FasTracks
funding to support base system operations at
the rate of inflation as defined by CPI

Level of Risk
MEDIUM
• Base system operations would be more
sensitive to the impact of significant
downturns in the economy. If such a
downturn occurs, RTD would need to:
– Access Management Reserves OR
– Reduce Base System service
levels commensurate with the
severity of the economic
downturn

In addition to the opportunities identified above, RTD staff has identified the following additional RAM
items that will be discussed with the RTD Board of Directors in the future:
 Aggressively pursue additional federal loans/grants and potential loans from public/private sector;
 Request stakeholders apply DRCOG financial commitment to base projects rather than
enhancements;
 Adjust frequencies/span of service on rail lines;
 Conduct life-cycle reviews to balance short-term capital and long-term O&M needs;
 Minimize scope changes once projects enter final design/construction.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Approval of the eight, highest value, recommended opportunities identified as part of the RAM will have
a positive impact to the FasTracks capital program through the establishment of the FISA. It is
anticipated that these opportunities could fund the FISA up to or exceeding $277 million by 2017.

ALTERNATIVES
RTD staff identified the following alternatives for RTD Board consideration.
1.

2.
Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not direct staff to move forward with
implementation of the eight, highest value, recommended opportunities identified as part of the RAM.
This alternative is not recommended because would not allow RTD to take advantage of these low to
medium risk opportunities that could result in additional funding for the FasTracks program of up to or
exceeding $277 million by 2017.

General Overview Questions
• FAQ: What is the impact to the base system if there is a
significant economic downturn before 2017?
– The cost saving/revenue enhancing measures would have little to
no impact to RTD’s base system. The majority of the measures
apply only to FasTracks.
– Should a significant economic downturn occur that impacts the
base system, a future RTD Board could mitigate impacts to base
system operations through the following:
o Accessing management reserves to backfill the need, and
keeping the FISA whole.
o Transferring funds from the FISA to maintain base system
service levels (within the constraints of the FasTracks adopted
plan) and reducing the FISA accordingly.

General Overview Questions

Attachment: Board_Pres_12_4_12_RAM FAQS_FINAL (1406 : Filling the Internal Savings

3.2.3.b

• FAQ: Can RTD expend funds from the FISA prior to 2017?
– Future RTD Board policy actions will determine the timing and
purpose for withdrawing funds from the FISA.
o Funds for many of the measures are not assumed to be fully
available until 2017 (e.g., reducing the FasTracks Minimum
Unrestricted Fund Balance from $150 M).

– Staff recommends not withdrawing funds from FISA until accumulated
balance enables provision of a significant component of the short-term
project goals.

• FAQ: Will the FISA be included in the next SB 208
submittal to DRCOG?
– The financial plan provided with the SB 208 report will list FISA as a
fund balance account. The FISA will not be assumed to fund
additional projects until the RTD Board takes a formal policy action.

Packet Pg. 118

General Overview Questions
• FAQ: What impact will these measures have on the
DBE/SBE community?
– Enactment of these measures would benefit the DBE/SBE
community. Approval could fund additional FasTracks
projects up to or exceeding $277 M by 2017. Adding funds
to the FISA increases opportunities to receive additional
contracts with RTD to construct FasTracks projects.

Packet Pg. 119

1. Evaluate FasTracks Funding for
Base System Operations

• FAQ: What did the original FasTracks plan assume for
FasTracks funding of base system operations?
– The original 2004 FasTracks plan assumed an increase in base bus
service levels of 1% per year between 2006 and 2020 and 1.5% per
year between 2021 and 2025.

Attachment: Board_Pres_12_4_12_RAM FAQS_FINAL (1406 : Filling the Internal Savings

3.2.3.b

– FasTracks funding for base system operations is drawn from the 0.4%
FasTracks sales and use tax approved in 2004.

• FAQ: What would happen if the Consumer Price Index
(CPI) is negative in any given year?
– RTD would assume 0% growth in the FasTracks allocation to base
system operations for any year with a negative CPI.

• FAQ: Could you please provide an updated graphic of the
total impact to the base system out to 2020?

1. Evaluate FasTracks Funding for
Base System Operations
• FAQ: How much is the savings related to the total
funding for base systems operations?

– Over the five-year period, the cumulative reduction would be $24 M,
less than 1.5% of base systems operations. The transfer to the FISA
would be limited to that amount.
– The RTD Board always retains the option to suspend the allocation,
or to transfer previously allocated funds back to the base system.

• FAQ: Does this measure have a sunset? Will it remain in
effect through 2025 or some other date?
– The decision to adjust FasTracks allocation to base system
operations only defers the commitment in the short-term to
accelerate construction of additional FasTracks projects. The full
allocation will be restored to base system operations when
financially feasible.

• FAQ: Could RTD please provide examples of what could
be included in the “participation above the current 2.5%”?
– Any contribution that provides a tangible “hard value” to the FasTracks
project (as currently defined) above the 2.5%, for example:
o Cash
o Rights-of-way
o Local jurisdiction funding and/or construction of a project
component (e.g., utility relocations)
o DRCOG’s Congestion Mitigation/Air Quality (CMAQ) second $60M
funding.

3.2.3.b

Sales and use tax forecast is from the CU Leeds School of Business.
17% collection improvement is a conservative estimate of the increase in tax collections
from auditing and improved reporting. Third party vendor estimates range from 15-30%
for this item.
Exemption parity with the state results in a net increase in collections.
Assuming RTD’s proposed legislation for exemption parity would be in effect in 2014 and
audit collections in effect in 2015.
Packet Pg. 127

• FAQ: What does “parity with the State” mean?
– RTD would request legislation to ensure that any items taxed by the
State of Colorado are also taxed by RTD. For example, Colorado
currently collects sales and use tax for sodas and candy, while RTD
is precluded from collecting these taxes.
– Treating RTD and the State of Colorado consistently would simplify
tax collection process for vendors and the Department of Revenue.

• FAQ: If RTD is successful in implementing this
measure, would it be applied retroactively?
– If approved, RTD would work closely with government relations
staff, lobbyists, legal counsel and other stakeholders to further refine
this measure, including specific timeframes of applicability, etc.

Conclusion
• Approval of the recommendations presented
in the Risk Allocation Matrix could fund the
FasTracks Internal Savings Account up to or
exceeding $277 M by 2017.
• The Internal Savings Account would enable
RTD to begin implementing the following
projects by 2017:
– Completion of US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project
– Construction of North Metro to at least 72nd
– Any remaining funds above the $300 M goal could
leverage potential grants or private sector contributions
for FasTracks partially-funded projects (at the RTD
Board’s discretion).
