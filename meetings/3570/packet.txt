BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2022 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report
to Governance

July 7, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Regional Transportation District’s Annual Comprehensive
Financial Report, that includes audited financial reports relating to the year ended December 31, 2022.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Byron Aten, Senior Manager, Accounting
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Colorado state statutes require an annual financial audit be performed on the financial statements of
governmental agencies by independent certified public accountants. RTD is required to provide these
annual audited financial statements to the State of Colorado, external entities and other government
organizations to be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements and other contractual
agreements. The audit firm Plante Moran, PLLC, performed the financial audit of RTD’s financial
statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022.
In addition to the financial statement audit requirements set forth in state statutes, the audit also was
designed to fulfill the requirements of the federal Single Audit Act of 1984. A Single Audit is required by
the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to review the expenditures of federal grant awards.
DISCUSSION
As stated in Plante Moran’s unmodified opinion, the financial statements in the enclosed Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
RTD as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the
2022 and 2021 fiscal years in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this recommended action.

June 27, 2023
Chair Guissinger and Board Members
Regional Transportation District
State law requires that all general-purpose local governments publish within seven months of the
close of each fiscal year a complete set of financial statements presented in conformance with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and audited in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards by a firm of licensed certified public accountants. Pursuant to that
requirement, the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report of the Regional Transportation District
(RTD) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, is hereby issued.
This report consists of management’s representations concerning RTD’s finances. Consequently,
management assumes full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of all information
presented in this report. To provide a reasonable basis for making these representations,
management has established a comprehensive internal control framework that is designed both
to protect the government’s assets from loss, theft, or misuse and to compile sufficient, reliable
information for the preparation of RTD’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The cost
of internal controls should not outweigh the benefits, RTD’s comprehensive framework of internal
controls has been designed to provide reasonable rather than absolute assurance that the financial
statements will be free from material misstatement. As the General Manager and CEO, I assert
that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this financial report is complete and reliable in all
material respects.
RTD’s financial statements have been audited by Plante Moran, PLLC, a firm of licensed certified
public accountants. The goal of the independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that
the financial statements of RTD for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, are free of material
misstatement. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management; and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. The independent auditor concluded, based upon the audit, that there was a
reasonable basis for rendering an unmodified opinion that RTD’s financial statements for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2022, are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP. The independent
auditor’s report is presented as the first component of the Financial Section of this report.
The independent audit of the financial statements of RTD was part of a broader, federally
mandated “Single Audit” designed to meet the special needs of federal grantor agencies. The
standards governing Single Audit engagements require the independent auditor to report not only
on the fair presentation of the financial statements, but also on the audited government’s internal
controls and compliance with legal requirements, with special emphasis on internal controls and
legal requirements involving the administration of federal awards. These reports are in RTD’s
separately issued Single Audit Report.

GAAP requires that management provide a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to
accompany the basic financial statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis
(MD&A). This letter of transmittal is designed to complement the MD&A and should be read in
conjunction with it. RTD’s MD&A can be found immediately following the report of the
independent auditors.
RTD provides public mass transportation service to the Denver metropolitan area. In 1969, the
Colorado General Assembly (Assembly) found that public transit was a necessary part of the
growing Denver metropolitan region. The Assembly found that public sector involvement was the
best method to ensure the continuation of this vital service. Thus, RTD was created as a political
subdivision of the State effective July 1969 “to develop, maintain, and operate a public mass
transportation system for the benefit of the District.”
RTD boundaries include Jefferson, Boulder, and Denver counties, most of the City and County of
Broomfield, and portions of Adams, Douglas, Weld, and Arapahoe counties. Over 3.09 million
people reside within RTD’s 2,342 square mile service area.
Since 1983, RTD has had a 15-member Board of Directors that are elected by their constituents
to serve four-year staggered terms to govern RTD. There are approximately 207,000 residents
per director district. The RTD Board of Directors is responsible for setting policy, overseeing the
agency’s annual budget, and establishing short and long-range transit goals and plans in concert
with local, state, and federal agencies.
In 2022, RTD employed 2,609 people, making it one of the largest employers in the eight-county
area. In addition, RTD contracts with private carriers to provide paratransit service branded
“Access-a-Ride”, fixed route bus and commuter rail services employing 1,910 individuals. Besides
its administrative headquarters in Denver, RTD has seven operating facilities (excluding
purchased transportation services), including four in Denver, one in Aurora, one in Englewood,
and one in Boulder.
The financial reporting entity includes all the financial activities of RTD, as well as those activities
of its component unit, the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority), a nonprofit corporation
established to facilitate RTD’s use of lease/purchase financing. In addition, the financial reporting
entity also includes activities of the RTD Salaried Pension Plan and RTD Salaried Employee 401(a)
Plan for which there is a fiduciary relationship.
RTD also maintains budgetary controls. These controls ensure compliance with legal provisions
embodied in the annual appropriated budget approved by RTD’s Board of Directors. The budget
sets forth proposed outlays for operations, planning, administration, development, debt service,
and capital assets. The level of budgetary control (that is, the level at which expenditures cannot
legally exceed the appropriated amount) is established at the project level.
The annual budget serves as the foundation for RTD’s financial planning and control. All
departments of RTD are required to submit requests for appropriation to the General Manager
and CEO on or before August of each year. The General Manager and CEO uses these requests
as the starting point for developing a proposed budget. The General Manager and CEO then
presents this proposed budget to the Board of Directors for review prior to October 15. The Board

of Directors is required to hold a public hearing on the proposed budget and to adopt a final
budget no later than December 31.
Unused appropriations lapse at year-end, except that the Board of Directors has the authority, as
stated in the adopted appropriation resolution, to carry-over the unused portion of the funds for
capital projects not completed, for a period not to exceed three years.
RTD’s policy also authorizes the General Manager and CEO to approve certain line-item transfers
within the budget. Budget-to-actual comparisons are provided in the Supplemental Information
Section of this report.
Factors Affecting Financial Condition
The information presented in the financial statements is perhaps best understood when it is
considered in the broader perspective of the specific environment within which RTD operates.
RTD serves the eight-county region considered the Denver metropolitan area. It is the most
populated area of the state and the economic barometer of Colorado. Employment in the Denver
Metro area is dominated by small businesses. These companies represent a diverse mix of
industries and are located throughout the Denver metropolitan area, providing a geographic
balance in employment centers.
The Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) in its March 2023 report forecasts that the outlook for the
economy is clouded by emerging challenges. Although economic activity has rebounded and
exceeded pre-pandemic levels, employment has not recovered in several hard-hit industries.
Increasing inflation, supply chain challenges, a tight labor market and concerns about the
escalating conflict in the Ukraine all point to the potential for an economic downturn.
Economists for CLC reported the following key economic indicators for the Denver Metro Area
(Inflation is based on National numbers):

On November 3, 1992, the voters of Colorado approved a constitutional amendment known as
the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR), that limits taxes, revenue, and spending for state and local
governments effective December 31, 1992. On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District
exempted RTD from TABOR’s revenue and spending limitations through December 31, 2005. On
November 2, 1999, the voters of the District further exempted RTD from TABOR’s revenue and
spending limitations for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to finance the construction of

the Southeast and Southwest light rail lines or to operate such for as long as any debt remains
outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in the District’s sales and
use tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit
improvement program. This authorization also exempted the District from any revenue and
spending limitations under TABOR on the additional tax and on investment income generated by
the increased tax revenue and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements
included in the FasTracks program. At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, the District’s
sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the transit system financed
through FasTracks and the TABOR restriction exemption will expire.
Long-term Financial Planning
Each year the Board of Directors adopts a financially balanced Mid-Term Financial Plan (MTFP),
which is the six-year operating and capital improvement forecasting plan for RTD including both
the Base System and FasTracks. The MTFP is a component of the long-term transportation
planning program for the Denver metropolitan area evaluated by the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG). While the MTFP is developed separately for the Base System and
FasTracks, RTD integrates both plans into a single medium and long-range Financial Plan which
includes the entirety of RTD in a single report. This financial information forms the basis for the
development of RTD’s annual budget. In September 2022, the Board of Directors approved the
2023-2028 MTFP.
Long-term financial planning seeks to allocate resources among related and, at times, competing
activities and to optimize those resources in a manner consistent with defined organizational goals
and objectives.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
RTD management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure
designed to ensure that assets are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and that adequate
accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP. RTD has designed its internal control structure to provide reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance
recognizes that: (1) the costs of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and
(2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgment by management.
Single Audit: As a recipient of federal assistance, RTD is responsible for ensuring that an
adequate internal control structure is instituted to ensure compliance with applicable laws and
regulations related to those programs. This internal control structure is subject to periodic
evaluation by management.
As part of RTD’s single audit, tests are made to determine the adequacy of the internal control
structure, including that portion related to federal financial assistance programs, as well as to
evaluate RTD’s compliance. RTD’s single audit for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 found

1.B.1.b

no instances of material weakness in the internal control structures or significant violations of
applicable laws and regulations. A separate report was prepared for this purpose.
Fiscal Policy: RTD follows a fiscal policy approved by the Board of Directors annually or as
necessary due to modification. The fiscal policy contains policies for revenue, investments,
expenditures, capital improvements, fund balance, debt, budgeting, accounting and grants.
Debt Administration: RTD formulates its debt policy to protect its credit ratings and soundly
manage its assets and liabilities. Included in this policy is a requirement that debt will not be
used to finance current operations. Another requirement precludes financing capital projects
beyond the useful life of the project. Additional policies go beyond these essential guidelines and
result in further protection. RTD has separate ratings for its 1.0% sales and use taxes. Base
System bonds secured by the 0.6% sales tax are rated by Moody’s Investors Service as “Aa1”, by
Standard and Poor’s Corporation as “AAA” and by Fitch Ratings as “AA”. FasTracks Bonds that
are secured by a first lien on the districts 0.4% sales tax and a subordinate lien on the 0.6% sales
tax are rated by Moody’s Investors Service as “Aa2”, by Standard and Poor’s Corporation as “AA+”
and by Fitch Ratings as “AA”.
Cash Management: The main objective of RTD’s cash management program is the protection
of investment principal while providing optimal levels of cash throughout the year. The RTD
investment policy is modified periodically to adapt to changes in eligible investments, benchmarks,
and specific objectives.
During the year, RTD invested its cash in various investment vehicles including money market funds,
U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, discount notes, commercial paper, repurchase
agreements, and variable and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities. The total average return on
investments for the year was 1.4%.
Risk Management: RTD employs a combination of self-insurance and purchased insurance in
its efforts to protect assets and control and prevent losses.
The areas of self-insurance are worker’s compensation, automobile, general liability and felonious
assault. RTD is self-insured for liability, the limits of which are $424,000 per person and
$1,195,000 per occurrence as specified under the Colorado Governmental Immunity statute for
claims arising on or after January 1, 2022. The self-insured retention for worker’s compensation
claims is $2,000,000 per claim, with any amounts above this covered by purchased insurance up
to the legal limits of liability under the Colorado worker’s compensation statute.
Commercial insurance policies provide coverage including: property coverage up to $500,000,000
for buildings, their contents, and rolling stock (other than collision); a commuter rail railroad
liability policy of $323,000,000 to cover the cap on damages set by federal law; a Commercial
Crime Policy with a limit of $10,000,000; a $5,000 bond for Commercial Driver’s License (CDL)
Testing Performance Bond; $4,000,000 Workers’ Compensation Bond; fiduciary coverage on the
Trustees of the Union Pension Trust, Salaried Pension Trust, Represented Health and Welfare
Union Trust, and the employees administering the health benefits program for salaried employees
with a limit of $8,000,000 and Cyber Liability policy with a limit of $10,000,000.

Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to RTD for its Annual Comprehensive Financial
Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. RTD will submit its 2022 Report for award
of this Certificate.
In order to receive the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting, RTD must
publish an easily readable and efficiently organized Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the
contents of which must conform to program standards. This report must also satisfy both GAAP
and applicable legal requirements.
The Certificate of Achievement is valid for one year only. It is my belief the current Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report meets the program’s requirements and RTD will be submitting it
to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate.
Acknowledgements: Timely preparation of the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report was
made possible by the dedicated services of the Finance Department led by Doug MacLeod, Chief
Financial Officer. I extend my sincere appreciation to each member of the department for their
contributions. Moreover, I thank the Board of Directors for its governance.

Independent Auditor's Report
To the Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District, Colorado
Report on the Audits of the Financial Statements
Opinions
We have audited the financial statements of the business-type activities and fiduciary activities of the Regional
Transportation District (the "District") as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the related
notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District's basic financial statements, as listed in
the table of contents.
In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the accompanying financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the business-type
activities and fiduciary activities of the District as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the respective changes in
its financial position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the years then ended in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We did not audit the financial statements of the Regional Transportation District Salaried Employees Pension Plan
(the "Salaried Pension Plan"), a fiduciary fund of the District, which represents 78.1 percent, 78.1 percent, and
58.1 percent of the assets, net position, and revenue, respectively, of the fiduciary activities for the year ended
December 31, 2021. Those financial statements were audited by other auditors, whose report has been furnished
to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for the Salaried Pension Plan, is based solely
on the report of the other auditors. The financial statements of the Salaried Pension Plan were not audited under
Government Auditing Standards.
Basis for Opinions
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America (GAAS) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards,
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further
described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audits of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are
required to be independent of the District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the
relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The financial statements of the Salaried
Pension Plan were not audited under Government Auditing Standards.
Emphasis of Matter
As discussed in Note A to the financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the District
adopted the provisions of GASB Statement No. 87, Leases. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.
Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for the design, implementation, and
maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events,
considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the District's ability to continue as a going concern
for 12 months beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise
substantial doubt shortly thereafter.

To the Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District, Colorado
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audits of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our
opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and, therefore, is not a
guarantee that audits conducted in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards will always detect
a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a
substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a
reasonable user based on the financial statements.
In performing audits in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards, we:

• Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audits.
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining,
on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audits in order to design audit procedures that are

appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
District's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.

• Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise
substantial doubt about the District's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audits, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that
we identified during the audits.
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management's
discussion and analysis and required supplementary information, as identified in the table of contents, be
presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management
and, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards
Board, which considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in
an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the
required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and
comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial
statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not
express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us
with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.

Regional Transportation District, Colorado
Supplemental Information
Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively
comprise the District's basic financial statements. The supplemental information, as identified in the table of
contents, is presented for the purpose of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial
statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The information has been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional
procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other
records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other
additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In
our opinion, the supplemental information is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial
statements as a whole.
Other Information
Management is responsible for the other information included in the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report. The
other information comprises the introductory and statistical sections but does not include the basic financial
statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinions on the basic financial statements do not cover the other
information, and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audits of the basic financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
and consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and the basic financial
statements or whether the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work
performed, we conclude that an uncorrected material misstatement of the other information exists, we are required
to describe it in our report.
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated June 27, 2023 on our
consideration of the District's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain
provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements, and other matters. The purpose of that report is
solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the
results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control over
financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with
Government Auditing Standards in considering the District's internal control over financial reporting and
compliance.

The management of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) offers users of its financial statements this
narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
This discussion and analysis is designed to assist the reader to focus on significant financial activities and
identify any significant changes in RTD’s financial position. It should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements that follow this section. All amounts, unless otherwise indicated, are expressed in thousands of
dollars.
Financial Highlights
In December 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19, emerged. The virus
subsequently spread globally resulting in a worldwide pandemic and caused significant disruptions to the
economy and public transit. As a result of COVID-19, RTD experienced a significant reduction in ridership,
fare revenues and its largest source of revenues, sales and use taxes beginning in March 2020. While
ridership and fare revenue recovered to a certain extent in 2021 and tax collections increased, RTD
experienced a stabilization of late 2021 ridership and fare revenue levels throughout 2022. Tax collections
have been robust and continued to grow in 2022 while expenditures moderated in connection with lower
service levels effectuated by RTD’s implementation of the System Optimization Plan (SOP). RTD continued
to be challenged with inflationary pressures, supply chain issues and a very competitive labor market during
2022.
Beginning in 2020, RTD was apportioned federal COVID-19 relief grant funding through the Coronavirus,
Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, followed by 2021 COVID-19 relief grant apportionments
through the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA) and,
subsequently, another federal COVID-19 relief grant apportionment through the American Rescue Plan Act
(ARPA). These apportionments totaled $792,873 and were awarded to RTD to be used to sustain transit
operations during the Pandemic. Through 2022, $739,849 (93.3%) of these grant apportionments were
drawn to pay for employee compensation, contracted services and fuel.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded total
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $3,558,484 and $3,462,416, respectively. The amount of
unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2022, was $480,405 compared to $252,166 in 2021. RTD’s
2022 unrestricted net position was positively impacted by expenditure reduction efforts in response to the
impact of COVID-19, improved sales and use tax collections as well as additional federal COVID-19 relief
funding.
The net position of RTD increased by $96,068 (2.8%) during the current year compared to an increase of
$100,423 (3.0%) in the previous year. The increase in both years was primarily due to the aforementioned
cost reductions, tax collections and federal funding in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. In addition,
RTD completed a refinancing of its 2014 Certificates of Participation, for interest savings, and realized
additional investment income due to rising interest rates.
RTD experienced an approximate 70% decrease in ridership due to COVID-19 beginning in March 2020
followed by a recovery to a level of approximately 40% less than the period preceding the Pandemic.
Ridership levels are a key determinant of fare revenue collections; however, fare revenue has become a
less-significant source of funding for RTD.

RTD’s sales and use tax revenues are its largest single source of revenues. These tax revenues were
negatively impacted by the economic effects of COVID-19 in 2020 with a 4.1% decrease followed by a
19.6% increase in 2021 and a 13.0% increase in 2022.
For 2022, total operating expenses exceeded total revenues resulting in a loss before non-operating revenue
and expenses of $971,674 compared to a loss of $826,288 for 2021. The increase in operating loss for 2022
was primarily due to increased operating expenses from restored services, contractual wage increases and
recognition of additional expenses associated with retirement plans. RTD anticipates operating losses each
year, as these losses are subsidized by non-operating sales and use tax, grant revenues and other
miscellaneous income.
RTD’s total debt decreased $223,814 (6.9%) and decreased $66,505 (2.0%) in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Outstanding debt decreased in 2022 and 2021 due to payment of outstanding principal balances and
refinancing of outstanding obligations for interest savings and reduction of outstanding principal.
Capital grants and local contributions decreased $1,523 (8.9%) in 2022 and decreased $79,008 (82.1%) in
the previous year. The decrease in both years was a result of lower capital grant eligible expenditures as
the FasTracks capital expansion project winds down.
Grant operating assistance increased $7,990 (2.7%) in 2022 due to modestly higher grant draws from
COVID-19 relief apportionments. Grant operating assistance decreased $17,796 (5.6%) in 2021 due to a
lower federal grant apportionment than in 2020. This federal COVID-19 relief funding was 93.3% drawn
at the end of 2022 and no additional similar COVID-19 operating assistance grants are anticipated.
RTD’s capital assets, net of depreciation, decreased $337,952 (5.4%) in 2022 and decreased $296,065
(4.5%) in 2021 primarily due to depreciation.
Basic Financial Statements
Management’s Discussion and Analysis serves as an introduction to RTD’s basic financial statements. RTD’s
financial statements are prepared using proprietary fund (enterprise fund) accounting that uses a similar
basis of accounting as private-sector business enterprises. Under this method of accounting, an economic
resources measurement focus and an accrual basis of accounting are used. Revenue is recorded when
earned and expenses are recorded when incurred.
The basic financial statements are comprised of four components: statements of net position; statements
of revenues, expenses and changes in net position; statements of cash flows; and notes to the financial
statements.
The statements of net position present information on assets and deferred outflows of resources and
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference between the two reported as the net
position. Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the
financial position of RTD is improving or deteriorating. The statements of revenues, expenses, and changes
in net position present information on operating revenues and expenses and non-operating revenues and
expenses of RTD for the fiscal year with the difference, the net income or loss, combined with any capital
grants and local contributions to determine the change in net position for the year. That change combined
with the previous year-end total net position reconciles to the net position total at the end of the current

24

Packet Pg. 40

1.B.1.b

fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the
changes occurs, regardless of the timing of the related cash flows.
The statements of cash flows report cash and cash equivalent activities for the fiscal year resulting from
operating activities, capital, and related financing activities, noncapital and related financing activities and
investing activities. The result of these activities added to the beginning of the year cash balance reconciles
to the cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the current fiscal year. The statements of cash
flows, along with the related notes and information in other financial statements, can be used to assess the
following: RTD’s ability to generate positive cash flows and pay its debt as the debt matures; the reasons
for differences between RTD’s operating cash flows and operating income (loss); and the effect of investing,
capital, and financing activities on RTD’s financial position.
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to fully understand the
data provided in the statements of net position, statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net
position, and statements of cash flows.
RTD provides bus, paratransit, light rail and commuter rail service in a 2,342 square mile area (District) in
and around metropolitan Denver, Colorado. The activities of RTD are supported by a 0.6% and a 0.4%
sales and use tax collected within the District. The 0.6% sales and use tax is used to fund the Base System
operations of RTD. The Base System operations provide the bus and the majority of current light rail services
in the Denver area. The 0.4% sales and use tax funds the FasTracks build-out program and operation and
maintenance of those program elements as well as providing for enhanced transit services in the District.
Additional revenue sources include fare collections, federal, state, and local financial assistance, investment
income, and other income such as advertising and rental income.

*GASB 87 was implemented in the current year which resulted in an adjustment to beginning net position
as described in footnote A.

In 2022, current assets decreased by $121,049 (11.8%) primarily due to additional funding of a portion of
unfunded pension liabilities as well as additional principal payments on outstanding debt.
In 2022, capital assets net of accumulated depreciation decreased $337,952 (5.4%) primarily due to the
depreciation of assets.
Total liabilities and deferred inflows decreased $127,063 (3.0%) in 2022 primarily due to debt service
payments reducing outstanding obligations.
The net position of RTD increased by $96,068 (2.8%) during 2022 compared to an increase of $100,423
(3.0%) in the previous year. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to increased tax collections and federal
funding in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The increase in 2021 was due to cost reductions and
federal COVID-19 relief funding.

Passenger fares – Passenger fares provided 5.8% and 6.7% of total revenues in 2022 and 2021,
respectively. Farebox receipts, monthly and annual pass revenue, and special event fares for bus and rail
services are included in passenger fares. Passenger fares decreased by $3,631 (4.6%) in 2022 compared
to an increase of $2,658 (3.5%) in 2021. The decrease in 2022 was due to Zero Fares for Better Air in
August 2022 for which state grant funding was received and fares were not collected during the month.
The increase in 2021 was due to a modest return of ridership following the most severe impacts from
COVID-19.
Advertising and other – Advertising and other revenue provided 0.2% and 0.4% of total revenues in
2022 and 2021. This revenue category primarily includes revenues from advertisements on RTD’s buses
and external wraps on light rail vehicles as well as revenue from naming rights. Advertising and other
income decreased $1,490 (35.5%) in 2022 compared to a decrease of $1,986 (32.1%) in 2021. The
decreases in both years were primarily due to lower advertising revenues from lower advertisement sales
resulting from COVID-19 impacts to the economy as well as the expiration of a naming rights contract.
Sales and Use Tax – Sales and use tax provided 66.3% and 64.7% of RTD’s total revenues in 2022 and
2021, respectively. Sales and use tax is a dedicated 1.0% tax imposed on certain sales within the District.
Sales and use tax increased $98,172 (13.0%) in 2022 compared to an increase of $124,309 (19.6%) in
2021. The increase in both years resulted from a recovery in spending within the District after the initial
economic shocks of COVID-19. Additional contributing factors included continued population growth, low
unemployment as well as growth in personal income.
Grant operating assistance – Grant operating assistance provided 23.8% and 25.5% of total revenues
in 2022 and 2021. Grant operating assistance increased $7,990 (2.7%) in 2022 compared to a decrease
of $17,796 (5.6%) in 2021. The operating assistance is a federal grant revenue program used to perform
capital maintenance and maintain RTD’s revenue fleet of bus, paratransit, and rail vehicles. The revenue
changes in both years resulted from changes in amounts drawn from federal COVID-19 relief grants which
were largely drawn in 2020-2022 to maintain certain operating levels in order to serve ongoing public transit
needs.

Investment Income – Investment income provided -0.1% and 0.2% of total revenues in 2022 and 2021.
Investment income decreased $3,405 (141.8%) in 2022 compared to a decrease of $6,564 (73.2%) in
2021. The decrease in 2022 resulted from mark-to-market adjustments with rising interest rates and the
decrease in 2021 was due to the lower interest rate environment.
Other Income/Gain on sale of Assets – Other income provided 2.7% and 1.0% of total revenues in
2022 and 2021. Other income includes interest subsidy income, rental income from retail space, parking,
and miscellaneous other items. Other income increased $22,372 (186.5%) in 2022 compared to an increase
of $1,601 (15.4%) in 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to the receipt of a returned credit risk
premium associated with a prior year loan and the increase in 2021 was primarily due to less activity with
asset disposals.
Capital grants and local contributions – Capital grants and local contributions provided 1.2% and 1.5%
of total revenues in 2022 and 2021. Capital grants and local contributions decreased $1,523 (8.9%) in
2022 and decreased $79,008 (82.1%) in 2021. The decreases in both years resulted from lower
infrastructure expenditures due to completion of FasTracks expansionary projects.

Salaries and wages – Salary and wage expense is one of the largest expense categories accounting for
19.1% and 17.3% of the total RTD expenses in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Salary and wage expenses
increased by $42,248 (22.8%) in 2021 compared to a decrease of $8,856 (4.6%) in 2021. The increase in
2022 was due to contractual increases and additional hiring with the restoration of service while the
decrease in 2021 was due to reductions in service and staffing shortfalls due to COVID-19.
Benefits – Fringe benefits accounted for 8.8% and 5.7% of total expenses in 2022 and 2021. Fringe
benefits increased by $44,166 (72.9%) in 2022 compared to an increase of $6,386 (11.8%) in 2021. The
increase in both years was due to higher pension liabilities as well as higher payroll taxes on higher wage
levels.
Materials and supplies – The materials and supplies expense category accounted for 3.7% of the total
expenses in both 2022 and 2021. Materials and supplies expenses increased $4,251 (10.7%) in 2022
compared to a decrease of $2,539 (6.0%) in 2021. The increase in 2022 was due to restoration of some
service in addition to inflation while the decrease in 2021 was due to reduced service levels due to COVID19.
Services – Services expense accounted for 6.9% of total expenses in both 2022 and 2021. Services
expense includes contracted services such as security services, vehicle, equipment and right of way
maintenance services, advertising and marketing services, and legal services. Services expense increased
$8,305 (11.2%) in 2022 compared to a decrease of $10,345 (12.2%) in 2021. The increase in 2022 resulted
from restoration of some service in addition to inflation while the decrease in 2021 resulted from service
expense and project reductions to adjust to lower revenues caused by the COVID-19 economic effects.

31

Packet Pg. 47

Utilities – Utilities accounted for 1.5% and 1.6% of total expenses in 2022 and 2021. Utilities expense
includes electric, telecommunications, water and sewer, and natural gas for facilities as well as traction
power for rail lines. Utilities expense increased $922 (5.3%) in 2022 compared to an increase of $1,306
(8.1%) in 2021. The increase in 2022 resulted from higher traction power costs due to some restored
service while increase in 2021 resulted from the opening of the N Line in 2020.
Insurance – Insurance accounted for 1.1% and 0.9% of total expenses in 2022 and 2021. Insurance
expense includes RTD’s self-insured cost for general liability and worker’s compensation claims as well as
the premium cost for excess insurance lines, cybersecurity and railroad liability insurance. Insurance
expense increased $3,117 (30.8%) in 2022 and decreased $82 (0.8%) in 2021. The increase in 2022 was
due to state increases in the caps for liability, higher worker’s compensation reserves and restoration of
some service while the decrease in 2021 was due to lower frequency and severity of claims as RTD has
focused additional cost containment efforts in this area.
Purchased transportation – The purchased transportation expense category accounted for 16.4% and
16.3% of the total expenses in 2022 and 2021. Purchased transportation represents the costs of contracted
transportation services for bus, commuter rail, Access-a-Ride, and FlexRide services. Purchased
transportation costs increased $21,269 (12.2%) in 2022 and decreased $29,217 (14.3%) in 2021. The
increase in 2022 was due to some restoration of service and contractual increases and the decrease in 2021
was due to service reductions from COVID-19 impacts.
Leases and rentals – Leases and rentals include lease expense for office space, office equipment, Parkn-Ride facilities, and use of communication towers and accounted for 0.1% and 0.2% of total expenses in
2022 and 2021, respectively. Leases and rentals expense decreased $103 (6.3%) in 2022 compared to a
decrease of $1,754 (51.6%) in 2021. The decrease in both years resulted from cost reduction efforts to
mitigate impacts from 1COVID-19 as well as the adoption of GASB 87.
Miscellaneous – Miscellaneous expense includes other incidental operating expenses not included in other
defined categories and accounted for 0.3% and 0.2% of total expenses in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Miscellaneous expenses increased $1,050 (47.4%) in 2022 compared to a decrease of $333 (13.1%) in
2021. This category includes additional one-time project expenses creating fluctuations between years.
Depreciation – The depreciation expense category accounted for 30.0% and 32.1% of the total expenses
in 2022 and 2021, respectively. RTD’s depreciation expense is a straight-line non-cash systematic allocation
of the cost of capital assets over the estimated useful life of the assets. Depreciation expense increased
$15,040 (4.4%) in 2022 compared to an increase of $3,334 (1.0%) in 2021. The increase in both years
was due to recognition of amortization expenses related to GASB 87.
Interest expense – The interest expense category accounted for 11.6% and 14.4% of the total expenses
in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Interest expense decreased $15,759 (10.2%) in 2022 and decreased
$12,959 (7.8%) in 2021. The decrease in both years was attributable to lower outstanding balances
resulting from paying down principal as well as refinancing of debt for interest savings.
Other expense – Other expense includes miscellaneous non-operating expenses not classified in other
expense categories and accounted for 0.4% and 0.6% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Other expense

assets in 2022 was $337,952 (5.4%) compared to a decrease of $296,965 (4.5%) in 2021. The decrease
in both years was due to additional accumulated depreciation.

Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 87. The 2022 outstanding debt was $3,009,568 compared to
$3,233,382 in 2021. Outstanding debt decreased by $223,814 (6.9%) in 2022 and decreased by $66,505
(2.0%) in 2021. The decrease in both years was due to payment of principal on outstanding debt with the
2022 outstanding debt also decreasing due to the completion of a refinancing for interest savings.
Sales tax revenue bonds – RTD issues sales tax revenue bonds to fund the acquisition and construction
of assets. These bonds are secured by future sales and use tax revenues. The sales tax revenue bonds,
the 2022 amount which includes the 2022AB Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, were $2,360,680 and
$2,056,875 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The sales tax revenue bonds increased
$303,805 (14.8%) in 2022 compared to a decrease of $6,043 (0.3%) in 2021. The increase in 2022 was
a result of the issuance of taxable (convertible to tax-exempt) Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series 2022AB.
The proceeds from which were used to pay of which were used to pay off all outstanding Series 2014A
Certificates of Participation. The decrease in 2021 was due to payment of principal on outstanding debt.
Certificates of participation - Certificates of participation (Certificates) relate to financial obligations
issued by the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority), a nonprofit corporation and component unit of
RTD. Certificates are lease-purchase financial obligations secured by the underlying assets. Outstanding
Certificates were issued with the proceeds being used to acquire certain equipment, facilities and
infrastructure to be used by RTD. For financial reporting purposes, RTD accounts for the Certificates as
its own debt. Certificates outstanding were $453,994 and $955,782 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The Certificates outstanding decreased $501,788 (52.5%) in 2022 compared to a decrease
of $55,537 (5.5%) in 2021. The decrease in both years is due to payment of outstanding principal.
RTD maintains credit ratings from Standard & Poor Corporation, Moody’s Investor Services, and Fitch
Ratings. Credit ratings vary based on the type of debt and the source of funds used for repayment.

Economic Factors and Subsequent Events after adoption of the 2022 Budget
RTD is dependent on sales and use taxes, which are the largest single source of revenue for RTD,
representing 66.3% and 64.7% of the total revenues in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales and use tax
revenues are affected by the local economy in which changes will affect the level of funding available to
RTD during its fiscal year. RTD’s 2022 sales and use taxes increased 13.0% from the prior year due to
continued recovery from the economic effects of COVID-19.
RTD is dependent on passenger fares collected for transit services that it provides. Passenger fares
accounted for 5.8% and 6.7% of total revenues in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Passenger fare collections
were significantly impacted by COVID-19 and lower ridership in both years. In August 2022, fares were
suspended for customers in recognition of the Zero Fare for Better Air initiative, however, these foregone
fare revenues were replaced with a Colorado state grant.
RTD is dependent on federal and local grant funding as well as local capital contributions for both operations
and capital expenditures. Grant operating assistance provided 23.8% and 25.5% of total revenues in 2022
and 2021, respectively which represented a more substantial portion of revenues in both years being
attributable to federal COVID-19 relief funding to replace lost revenues while maintaining public transit
service.
Each year, RTD may propose an Amended Budget at any point to the Board of Directors for appropriation
to adjust revenue and expenditures for the remainder of the fiscal year according to existing economic
conditions and fiscal results. RTD may also present budget amendments to the Board of Directors for
approval at any time during the fiscal year to accommodate economic factors.
In 2020, RTD reached final completion on the remaining FasTracks Project elements for which funding had
been identified. Additional FasTracks elements approved by the voters of the District have been deferred
due to a lack of current identifiable funding.
Requests for Information

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

N OTE A – SUM M AR Y OF SIGNI FI CANT ACCOUNTI NG P OLI CI ES
1. Organization
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created as a transportation planning agency,
a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, by an Act of the Colorado General Assembly
(the Act), effective July 1969 (Title 32, Article 9, C.R.S., 1973, as amended). In 1974, the
Act was amended and RTD became an operating entity charged with the responsibility for
development, operation and maintenance of a public mass transportation system for the
benefit of the citizens of the District. The District is comprised of 15 separate districts
located in Denver, Boulder, Broomfield and Jefferson counties, and certain portions of
Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas, and Weld counties.
RTD is governed by a publicly elected board of directors consisting of 15 members. Each
board member is elected to serve a term of four years by the constituents of the District in
which the board member resides. As required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP), these financial statements present RTD and its component units. The component
unit discussed in note A. 2. is included in RTD’s reporting entity because of the significance
its financial relationship with the RTD.
In 1988, a Senate Bill was enacted (privatization legislation) requiring RTD to implement by
March 31, 1989, a plan to competitively bid contracts for the provision of at least 20% of
RTD’s bus service by private contractors. In 1999, the Bill was amended requiring RTD to
increase this provision to at least 35% of fixed route bus service. In 2003, the Bill was
amended to require that at least 50% of RTD’s vehicular service be operated by private
transit companies. In May of 2007, the legislation was amended to provide for “a system
under which up to 58% of the District’s service” is provided by private contractors.
2. Financial Reporting Entities
Blended Component Unit
The Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority) was formed in 1987 as a nonprofit
corporation on behalf of RTD for the purpose of issuing certificates of participation in a
public offering collateralized by an installment purchase agreement with RTD. RTD’s
General Manager and CEO appoints the Board of Directors of the Authority. The Authority
serves as a financing mechanism for various financing arrangements for RTD. RTD follows
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) pronouncement 14 (GASB 14) and 61
(GASB 61) which provide guidance regarding the inclusion of component units in the primary
government’s financial statement presentation. The activity related to the underlying
financial obligations of the Authority has been included as a blended component unit in
RTD’s financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. No separately
audited financial statements are prepared for the Authority.
Fiduciary Funds
GASB 84 requires that funds held in a trustee or custodial capacity that meet certain criteria
be included in RTD’s financial statement presentation. Those criteria include the
governmental agency having control of the assets of the fiduciary activity and the existence
of a fiduciary relationship with the beneficiaries. RTD has determined that the RTD Salaried
Pension Plan and RTD Salaried 401(a) Retirement Plan meet these fiduciary criteria and has

December 31, 2022 and 2021 (Dollars in Thousands)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------included the financial activity of each in 2022 and 2021 in the financial statement section of
this report.
3. Basis of Accounting
The accounts of RTD are reported as a Proprietary Fund. Proprietary funds are accounted
for on the flow of economic resources measurement focus and use the accrual basis of
accounting which reports all assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, deferred
inflows of resources, revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Revenue is recognized when
earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. Proprietary funds
distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non-operating items. Operating
revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and producing and
delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The
principal operating revenues of RTD are charges (fares) to customers for services. Operating
expenses include the cost of services, administrative expenses and asset depreciation. All
revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as non-operating revenues
and expenses.
It is RTD’s policy to apply Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in its
presentation of financial statements. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are
available for use, it is RTD’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted
resources as they are needed.
4. Cash and Cash Equivalents
RTD considers all highly liquid investments, both restricted and unrestricted, with an original
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
5. Interest Bearing Investments
Investments with a maturity date, when purchased, of less than one year are carried at cost
or amortized cost which approximates fair value. Investments with a maturity date of more
than one year from the date of purchase are carried at fair value.
6. Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of
operations. Materials and supplies are stated at cost using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method.

7. Other Current Assets
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are
recorded as prepaid items. Escrows are deposits held in the custody of a third party until a
certain condition has been met such as retainage for construction projects. At the time
projects are completed, escrows are generally applied toward the cost of the project or may
be forfeited upon breach of contract.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2022 and 2021 (Dollars in Thousands)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------8. Receivables
Accounts receivables are stated at the amount management expects to collect from
outstanding balances. Management provides for probable uncollected amounts through a
charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the
current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management
has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation
allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. Changes in the valuation allowance have not
been material to the consolidated financial statements.
9. Restricted Assets
Restricted assets are assets restricted by the covenants of long-term financial or other
contractual arrangements.
10. Capital Assets
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost. Capital assets are defined by RTD as
assets with an initial, individual cost of more than $5 and an estimated useful life in excess
of one year. Maintenance and repairs are charged to current period operating expenses
and improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or other disposition of property and
equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective
accounts and any gains or losses are included in non-operating revenue and expense. A
pro-rata shares of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, which were acquired
with federal funds, is required to be reinvested in a similar asset.
Prior to 2020, interest was capitalized on assets financed with debt or certificates of
participation from the date of the borrowing until completion of the project. The amount
of tax-exempt and taxable debt and certificates of participation (externally restricted)
interest to be capitalized is the difference between the interest expense and interest
earnings on issuance proceeds. The amount of other interest to be capitalized is calculated
by weighted average construction expenditures multiplied by the weighted average interest
rate of the outstanding obligations.
Total interest cost of RTD as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively was $138,337
and $154,096.
11. Depreciation
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:

Land improvements
Buildings
Revenue earning equipment
Shop, maintenance and other equipment

10-20 years
30 years
8-25 years
3-10 years

Fully depreciated assets, which are still in use, are included in the asset balances in the
accompanying financial statements. The cost of fully depreciated assets was approximately
$635,609 and $573,783 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

December 31, 2022 and 2021 (Dollars in Thousands)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------12. Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources
In addition to assets, the statement of financial position will report a separate section for
deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement element represents a
consumption of net assets that applies to a future period(s) and thus, will not be recognized
as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until then.
In addition to liabilities, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate
section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element
represents an acquisition of net assets that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be
recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that time.
13. Compensated Absences
RTD employees receive compensation for vacations, holidays, illness, and certain other
qualifying absences. The number of days compensated in the various categories of absence
is based generally on length of service. Compensated absences, which have been earned
but not paid, have been included as liabilities in the accompanying financial statements.
14. Self-Insurance
Liabilities for property damage, personal injury and qualifying unemployment benefits are
recognized as incurred on the basis of the estimated cost to RTD. In addition, RTD offers
a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee benefits program in which costs
are recognized as they are incurred.
15. Revenue Recognition
Passenger Fares
Passenger fares are recorded as revenue at the time services are performed and revenue is
collected. Sale of mobile ticketing products, monthly passes, ticket books and day pass
tickets are recorded as income at the time of sale. Stored value sales are evaluated for
revenue recognition at the time services are performed. Sales of college-based passes,
which are valid for a specific academic semester, are recorded initially as unearned revenue
then recognized as income at the end of each month, with the amount recognized
determined by prorating the total contract amount over the semesters/quarters covered.
Sales of EcoPass and Neighborhood Pass, which are valid through December 31 of a given
year, are recorded initially as unearned revenue then recognized as income at the end of
each month, with the total contract amount prorated evenly over the number of months of
the contract.
Sales and Use Taxes
Under the provisions of the Act, as amended, RTD levies a sales tax of 1.0% on net taxable
sales made within the District and a use tax of 1.0% on items purchased for use inside the
District. As described in Note E, under the terms of the Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series
2007A, Series 2010B, Series 2013A, 2016A, 2017A, 2017B, 2019A, 2021A, 2021B, 2022A
and 2022B bond resolutions, sales and use tax revenue is pledged for payment of debt

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------service. Sales and use taxes are collected by the State of Colorado Department of Revenue
and are remitted to a trustee who satisfies debt service requirements for these obligations
through remittances to a trustee and then remits the remaining balance to RTD.
Sales and use taxes are recorded as revenue by RTD in the month collected by the
merchant. Sales tax bond service will be paid from the collateralized sales and use tax
revenues in the amount of approximately $3,735,849 through 2050. Principal and interest
paid for the current year and pledged revenues received were $99,115.
Grants and Local Contributions
RTD receives grants from the federal government through the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA). Grants are also awarded to RTD by State of Colorado through the
Colorado Department of Transportation. The federal and state governments issue grants
to RTD for operations and acquisition of property and equipment.
The amount recorded as capital grant revenue was $12,490 and $15,739 in 2022 and 2021,
respectively. Operating assistance grant revenue was $307,042 and $299,052 in 2022 and
2021, respectively. Other contributed revenue was $3,156 and $1,430 in 2022 and 2021,
respectively.
RTD was awarded additional COVID-19 relief funding of $304,227 through the American
Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) in August 2021. A portion of these funds were also drawn in 2022
and are included in the operating assistance grant revenue.
Grants and local contributions are recorded as revenue by RTD once all applicable eligibility
requirements are met.
16. Use of Estimates
The financial statements contained herein have been prepared in accordance with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). GAAP are uniform minimum standards of and
guidelines to financial accounting and reporting. GAAP establishes appropriate
measurement and classification criteria for financial reporting. Adherence to GAAP provides
a reasonable degree of comparability among the financial reports of state and local
governmental units. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
involves the use of management’s estimates. These estimates are based upon
management’s best judgments after considering past and current events and assumptions
about future events. Actual results may differ from estimates.
17. Pensions
For purposes of measuring RTD’s net pension liabilities, deferred outflows of resources and
deferred inflows of resources related to pensions and pension expense, information about
the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and additions to/deductions from the plan’s
fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by the
plan. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are
recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are
reported at fair value.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------18. TABOR (Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights) – Reserve Composition
Restricted net position represents amounts constrained by external parties or legislation. In
1992, Colorado voters approved an amendment to the state constitution referred to as the
TABOR Amendment in which certain annual limitations were placed on the growth of
government revenues. The Amendment also requires that an emergency reserve, referred
to as Restricted TABOR, of 3.0% of fiscal year spending excluding debt service be
maintained for all years subsequent to 1994 for declared emergencies.
19. Leases-GASB 87
RTD is a lessee for noncancellable leases of land, office space and equipment. RTD
recognizes a lease liability and an intangible right-to-use lease asset (lease asset) in the
statement of net position.
At the commencement of a lease, RTD initially measures the lease liability at the present
value of payments expected to be made during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease
liability is reduced by the principal portion of lease payments made. The lease asset is
initially measured as the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for lease payments
made at or before the lease commencement date, plus certain initial direct costs.
Subsequently, the lease asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful life.
Key estimates and judgments related to leases include how RTD determines (1) the
discount rate it uses to discount the expected lease payments to present value, (2) lease
term, and (3) lease payments.
x RTD uses the interest rate charged by the lessor as the discount rate. When
the interest rate charged by the lessor is not provided, RTD generally uses its
estimated incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for leases.
x The lease term includes the noncancellable period of the lease. Lease payments
included in the measurement of the lease liability are composed of fixed
payments and purchase option price that RTD is reasonably certain to exercise.
RTD monitors changes in circumstances that would require a remeasurement of its lease
and will remeasure the lease asset and liability if certain changes occur that are expected
to significantly affect the amount of the lease liability.
Lease assets are reported with other capital assets and lease liabilities are reported with
the short-term portion combined with long-term debt and the long-term portion is stated
separately on the statement of net position.
RTD is a lessor for noncancellable leases of buildings, land, office space, parking space and
use of RTD physical resources for advertising space. RTD recognizes a lease receivable and
a deferred inflow of resources in the statement of net position.
At the commencement of a lease, RTD initially measures the lease receivable at the present
value of payments expected to be received during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease
receivable is reduced by the principal portion of lease payments received. The deferred
inflow of resources is initially measured as the initial amount of the lease receivable,
adjusted for lease payments received at or before the lease commencement date.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Subsequently, the deferred inflow of resources is recognized as revenue over the life of the
lease term.
Key estimates and judgments include how RTD determines the discount rate it uses to
discount the expected lease receipts to present value, lease term, and lease receipts.
x RTD uses the actual rate charged to lessees as the discount rate for leases.
x The lease term includes the noncancellable period of the lease. Lease receipts
included in the measurement of the lease receivable is composed of fixed
payments from the lessee.
RTD monitors changes in circumstances that would require a remeasurement of its lease
and will remeasure the lease receivable and deferred inflows of resources if certain
changes occur that are expected to significantly affect the amount of the lease receivable.
20. Upcoming Accounting Pronouncements

GASB 94
In March 2020, the GASB issued Statement No. 94, Public-Private and Public-Public
Partnerships and Availability Payment Arrangements, to bring a uniform guidance on how
to report public-private and public-public partnership arrangements. As a result, transferors
in public-private or public-public arrangements will recognize receivables for installment
payments, deferred inflows of resources, and, when applicable, capital assets. Operators
will recognize liabilities for installment payments and intangible right-to-use assets, and
when applicable, deferred outflows of resources and liabilities for assets being transferred.
This statement also provides guidance for accounting and financial reporting for availability
payment arrangements, in which a government compensates an operator for services such
as designing, constructing, financing, maintaining, or operating an underlying asset for a
period of time in an exchange of exchange-like transaction. The provisions of this statement
are effective for RTD’s financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2023.

GASB 96
In May 2020, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued GASB Statement No.
96, Subscription-Based Information Technology Arrangements (SBITAs), which defines
SBITAs and provides accounting and financial reporting for SBITAs by governments. This
statement requires a government to recognize a subscription liability and an intangible
right-to-use subscription asset for SBITAs. RTD is currently evaluating the impact this
standard will have on the financial statements when adopted. The provisions of this
statement are effective for RTD’s financial statements for the year ending December 31,
2023.

GASB 99
In April 2022, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued GASB Statement No.
99, Omnibus 2022, which establishes or amends accounting and financial reporting
requirements for specific issues related to financial guarantees, derivative instruments,
leases, public-public and public-private partnerships (PPPs), subscription-based information
technology arrangements (SBITAs), the transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate

transactions, pledges of future revenues, the focus of government-wide financial
statements, and terminology. The standard has various effective dates. RTD does not
believe this pronouncement will have a significant impact on its financial statements but is
still making a full evaluation.

GASB 100
In June 2022, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued GASB Statement No.
100, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which enhances the accounting and
financial reporting requirements for accounting changes and error corrections. The
provisions of this statement are effective for RTD's financial statements for the year ending
December 31, 2024.

GASB 101
In June 2022, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued GASB Statement No.
101, Compensated Absences, which updates the recognition and measurement guidance
for compensated absences under a unified model. This statement requires that liabilities
for compensated absences be recognized for leave that has not been used and leave that
has been used but not yet paid in cash or settled through noncash means and establishes
guidance for measuring a liability for leave that has not been used. It also updates
disclosure requirements for compensated absences. The provisions of this statement are
effective for RTD's financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2024.
21. Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements
During the current year, RTD adopted GASB Statement No. 87, Leases. As a result, the
business-type activities now include a liability for the present value of payments expected
to be made and right-to-use assets. The business type activities now include receivables
for the present value of payments expected to be received and deferred inflows of resources
that will be recognized as revenues over the term of the lease.
The effective date for GASB Statement No. 87 was as of January 1, 2021, resulting in a
liability, a right to use asset, a receivable, and a deferred inflow of resources recognized in
the statement of net position as of that date. There was no impact on net position as of
January 1, 2021. There was an impact on net position at the end of 2021 due to the impact
of the standard on components of revenue and expenses in fiscal year 2021. The effect of
the new standard on net position as of December 31, 2021, and therefore January 1, 2022,
was as follows:

N OTE B – DEPOSI TS AND I NVESTM ENTS
Deposits
RTD’s deposits are subject to the State of Colorado’s Public Deposit Protection Act (PDPA).
Under this act, all uninsured public deposits at qualified institutions are fully collateralized with
pledged collateral which is held in custody by any Federal Reserve Bank or branch thereof, or
held in escrow by another bank in a manner as the banking Commissioner shall prescribe by
rule and regulation, or may be segregated from the other assets of the eligible public depository
and held in its own trust department. Colorado’s PDPA requires that pledged collateral to be
held is clearly identified as being securely maintained or pledged for the aggregate amount of
public deposits accepted and held on deposit by the eligible public depository. The public
depository has the right at any time to make substitutions of eligible collateral that is maintained
or pledged and is always entitled to collect and retain all income derived from those investments
without restrictions.
As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, RTD had bank deposits of $13,436 and
$13,407 collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial institutions’ trust department

Fair Value M easurem ents
In March 2015, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) released Statement No.
72, Fair Value Measurement and Application, which would generally require state and local
governments to measure investments at fair value. GASB's goal is to enhance comparability of
governmental financial statements by requiring fair value measurement for certain assets and
liabilities using a consistent definition and accepted valuation techniques. This standard
expands fair value disclosures to provide comprehensive information for financial statement
users about the impact of fair value measurements on a government's financial position.
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that RTD
can access at the measurement date. Examples are derived values from the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE), National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ),
Chicago Board of Trade and “Pink Sheets”.
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices under Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly on the measurement date. Examples include matrix pricing,
market corroborated pricing and inputs such as yield curves and indices.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value that rely on
the reporting entity's reasonably available information concerning the assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing an asset or liability including assumptions about risk.

(1) Real estate investment trusts invest primarily in commercial and residential real estate. The fund focuses on
properties with high quality physical improvements, stabilized occupancies and competitive positions within their
markets that produce a relatively high level of current income combined with moderate appreciation potential.
(2) The common collective trusts measured at the NAV invest primarily in asset-backed securities, corporate bonds,
U.S. government agency securities and foreign common stocks. The investment objectives include matching the
return of the Barclay’s Aggregate Bond Index through investment in substantially all of the bonds contained in that
index and matching the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Index (Net) benchmark.
(3) The mutual funds primarily invest in U.S. corporate bonds and U.S. equity securities. The investment objectives
of the U.S. equity securities mutual funds include matching the performance of the Russell Mid-cap Growth Index.
The investment objectives of the U.S. corporate bond funds include matching the return of the Intercontinental
Exchange Bank of America U.S. high Yield Constrained Index through investment in a diversified portfolio of highyield debt securities.

N OTE E – LONG-TER M DEBT
In April 2018, GASB issued Statement 88, Certain Disclosures Related to Debt, Including Direct
The primary objective of GASB 88 related to providing
additional information regarding debt, including direct borrowings and direct placements. It also
clarifies which liabilities governments should include when disclosing information statements as a
liability that arises from a contractual obligation to pay cash (or other assets that may be used in
lieu of cash) in one or more payments to settle an amount that is fixed at the date the contractual
obligation is established. GASB 88 requires that additional essential information related to debt
be disclosed in notes to financial statements, including unused lines of credit, assets pledged as
collateral for the debt and terms specified in debt agreements related to significant events of
default with finance-related consequences, significant termination events with finance-related
consequences and significant subjective acceleration clauses.

Borrowings and Direct Placement.

RTD sales tax revenue bonds Series 2007A, 2010B, 2013A, 2016A, 2017A, 2017B, 2019A, 2021AB
and 2022AB are secured by a pledge of future sales and use tax revenues. These tax-secured
future liabilities of $3,735,849 remain outstanding through 2050. The pledged revenue includes
a 0.6% and 0.4% tax on the net taxable sales made within the District and use taxes of 0.6%
and 0.4% on items purchased for use inside the District. For the year 2022, these tax-generated
revenues were $855,145.
RTD’s Base System sales tax obligations are secured by a 0.6% sales and use tax. The Fastracks
bonds are secured by a 0.4% sales and use tax and a subordinate pledge from the 0.6% Base
System sales tax. Per TABOR, at the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, RTD’s 0.4% sales and
use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate and maintain the assets financed
through FasTracks. For the year 2022 and 2021, respectively, RTD paid interest and principal for
sales tax revenue bonds of $99,115 and $88,756.

The sales tax bonds are secured by RTD’s 1.0% sales and use tax for which debt service payments
are withheld by a trustee from the monthly remittance prior to the Colorado Department of
Revenue remitting such taxes to RTD. Withholdings are equivalent to a proportionate monthly
amount of the annual principal and semi-annual interest payments and are held by the trustee
until such debt service payments are satisfied.
Certificates are issued by the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority), a nonprofit corporation
and component unit of RTD. The Authority issued Certificates with the proceeds used to acquire
certain equipment, facilities and infrastructure to be used by RTD as well as for construction of
the North Metro (N Line) commuter rail line. RTD leases the equipment acquired and elements
constructed with the proceeds from the Certificates under separate master lease purchase
agreements. For financial reporting purposes, RTD accounts for the Certificates and the capital
lease agreements as its own obligations.

A TU 1001 Pension P lan – Defined Benefit (2022)
Plan Description
The Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 (ATU) Pension Plan was established pursuant to a
collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between RTD and the ATU. This plan covers substantially
all full-time union-represented employees in accordance with the CBA. The plan is a single
employer defined benefit pension plan administered by Compusys, Inc.

Benefits Provided
All benefits are paid in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity unless this form is rejected
by the participant and the spouse.
Normal retirement benefits under the ATU Plan are paid to participants who have attained age
65 and have been in the ATU Plan for 10 years. The benefit amount is based on final average
earnings, years of employment and age at the date of retirement.
Effective January 1, 1992, any participant who has accumulated 20 or more years of credited
service and terminated employment prior to attaining age 50 will be entitled to an early retirement
benefit starting on the first day of any month after attaining age 50. The ATU Plan was
subsequently amended effective January 1, 2011, for new employees in which the years of
credited service needed to qualify for a normal retirement benefit was increased from five to 10
years and the benefit multiplier for both the normal and early retirement was revised.
Death benefits state if an employee who is not eligible for a vested benefit or not eligible to retire,
should die, their beneficiary will be paid the accumulated employee contributions plus interest.
Upon the death of a pensioner, a funeral benefit of $2 (two thousand dollars) will be paid in a
lump sum to the pensioner’s designated beneficiary.
An individual who becomes totally disabled prior to age 65 and retires from active employment
with RTD as a direct result of being totally disabled is entitled to a disability retirement benefit
provided, he or she has worked for at least 10 years for RTD in covered employment. An
individual will be considered totally disabled upon receipt of a disability award from the Social
Security Administration. Effective January 1, 2011, the years of credited service needed to qualify
for a disability benefit was increased from five to 10 years and the benefit multiplier was revised.
An individual who terminated employment on or after January 1, 1993, for any reason other than
retirement, will be entitled to a deferred vested benefit at age 65 provided they had worked for
at least 10 years in covered employment for RTD. A participant is entitled to deferred, vested
benefits as early as age 50 if they have worked for at least 20 years in covered employment and
terminates active employment on or after attaining age 50. If an individual with 20 or more years
of service terminated employment prior to age 50, benefits will be payable at any time after age
50. Effective January 1, 2011, the years of credited service needed to qualify for a deferred
vested retirement benefit was increased from five to 10 years and the benefit multiplier was
revised.

Following signing of new Collective Bargaining Agreement, employer
contributions were increased to 15% of pay effective January 1,2022.
A one-time $160 million contribution was made in 2022 to support an
increased benefit multiplier from 1% to 2% for participants hired
between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2022 retroactive to their
hire date and to increase the funding level of the plan to 85%. The
plan closed to new hires effective January 1, 2023.

Single Discount Rate
Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted to their actuarial present values using
a single discount rate that reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan
investments (to the extent that the plan’s fiduciary net position is projected to be sufficient to
pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general
obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that
the plan’s projected fiduciary net position is not sufficient to pay benefits).
For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of return on pension plan investments is
6.50%, the municipal bond rate is 1.84% (based on fixed income municipal bonds with 20 years
to maturity that include only federally tax-exempt municipal bonds as reported in Fidelity Index’s
“20-Year Municipal GO AA Index” as of December 31, 2021 and the resulting single discount rate
is 6.50%.

included an increase of employer contributions to 15% and a change in the benefit multiplier
from 1% to 2%, retroactive to the date of hire . There was also an increase in the pension
liability under Change in Assumptions due to a decrease in the assumed discount rate.

Contributions
Contributions are made in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement (CBA). RTD
signed a new CBA in April 2022, retroactive to January 1, 2022. As part of the new agreement,
RTD made a one-time lump sum contribution of $160,000 in May 2022, reported as a deferred
outflow on the statement of net position to the plan. The plan also had contributions during the

Contributions
Employee contributions are a source of revenue for the Trust and prior to 2013 were based on
a percentage of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) salaried employees’ base
compensation. Due to the decreasing active population and resulting reduction in future
expected payroll, the RTD Board approved a funding policy effective January 1, 2013, where the
recommended dollar contribution up to a cap of $3.1 million is made to the Trust each year.
This funding policy was established with the goal of achieving 100% funding by the end of 2032;
however, due to net actuarial losses, the RTD Board adopted a new funding policy effective in
2016 to remove the $3.1 million maximum and allowed for an amount to be contributed to keep
the Trust “actuarially sound” based on recommendations from the Trust’s actuary and RTD’s
Chief Financial Officer. Note that the recommended contribution can fluctuate annually due to
such factors as projected total base compensation, investment results, and retirement patterns
of participants. RTD contributed $8.4 million in 2022 and $6.1 million in 2021.

Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation with date of January 1, 2021
using the following actuarial assumptions applied to all periods included in the measurement with
a liability roll forward to the measurement date of December 31, 2021:
Inflation
Salary increases
Investment rate of return

2.75%
3.70% - 6.45%, based on age
7.00%

The long-term expected rates of return on pension plan investments were determined using
a building-block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return
are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term
expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset
allocation percentage including expected inflation.
The best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the
target asset allocation as of December 31, 2022 are summarized in the following data and
reflect assumed long-term expected real rates of return over a 30-year horizon upon which the
disclosure is based:

Mortality Rates for Annuities (75% Election Assumption)
Healthy: RP-2014 Mortality Tables for healthy employees and annuitants (adjusted to 2006),
and projected to 2022 using the MP-2017 mortality improvement scale.
Disabled: RP-2014 Disabled Retiree Tables

Mortality Rates for Lump Sums (25% Election Assumption)
RP-2014 Mortality tables for healthy employees and annuitants (adjusted to 2006) and projected
to 2022 using the MP-2017 mortality improvement scale, blended 70% male/30% female for
participants and 30% male/70% female for beneficiaries.
The actuarial assumptions used in the January 1, 2021, evaluation were based on the results of an
actuarial experience study covering the period January 1, 2014 – December 31, 2017.

Single Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.00%. The projection of
cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions would be equal
to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the applicable fiscal years. Based on those
assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all
projected future benefit payments of current plan members.
Therefore, the long-term
expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected
benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. The discount rate does not
incorporate nor require a 20-year tax-exempt general obligation municipal bond rate (with an
average rating of AA/Aa or higher).

Sensitivity of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate
The following presents the net pension liability as of 12/31/22 calculated using the discount

R TD P lan – Defined Contribution
Plan Description
The RTD defined contribution plan is available for full-time salaried employees hired after January
1, 2008. The RTD Board adopted Amendment 8, effective January 1, 2008 for which RTD
contributes 7-9% of the employee’s qualifying wages. Contributions totaled $7,191 and $4,314
in 2022 and 2021, respectively. RTD employees cannot contribute to this plan. Membership was
710 and 681 active employees in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust
The Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust (Trust) was formed
pursuant to a Trust Agreement effective July 1, 1971 between Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU)
Division 1001 and an agent of a transit enterprise owned by the City and County of Denver,
through July 3, 1974 and RTD thereafter. In addition to the original Denver Metro Division,
employees of other RTD divisions have been approved for participation in the Trust benefits. The
Trust agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all its terms and provisions so long as
there continues to be a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the ATU and RTD.
The Trust provides health benefits (hospital, medical, dental, vision, life and short-term disability)
for represented employees of RTD and certain officers of the ATU and health care benefits for
retired employees who actively worked 600 hours or more per quarter. The Trust is funded
through contributions by the employer and employee in which the share of benefit plan
contributions is set by the CBA. RTD’s contribution was $21,061 and $22,780 for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Trust also provides insurance coverage for
felonious assault for each employee. The Trust self-insures part of its health, life insurance and
short-term disability benefits. The Trust issues audited financial statements which include
financial information for the plan. Those audited financial statements may be obtained from the
Trust: RTD ATU 1001 Health and Welfare Trust, 2821 S. Parker Road, Suite 215 Aurora, Colorado
80014-2602.
Unearned Compensation Plan
RTD offers its employees an unearned compensation plan (Plan), created in accordance with
Internal Revenue Code Section 457, which is available to substantially all employees and permits
them to defer a portion of their compensation to future years. Under the terms of the Plan, the
unearned compensation is available to participants upon termination, retirement, death or in the

RTD considers all accrued compensated absences as due within one year. Employees accrue paid
time off (PTO), vacation and sick leave based on years of service. Employees are not allowed to
accumulate more than twice their annual PTO or vacation accrual and sick leave based on years
of service. Employees are paid any outstanding compensated absence balances upon leaving
RTD. RTD records these accrued compensated absences as current liabilities under the principle
of conservatism by assuming these amounts are the most RTD would be obligated to pay.

The monies held by such trustees will be utilized to make the lease payments owed by RTD under
the transactions and are therefore considered fully funded and economically defeased.

Capital Projects
As of December 31, 2022, RTD has contracts for the construction of various capital projects and
the purchase of buses and light rail vehicles. The costs to complete these projects and the
purchase of buses and light rail vehicles total $150,266 and $151,213 in 2022 and 2021,
respectively.

Grant Match Requirements
Under the provisions of current grants, RTD is obligated to satisfy certain matching requirements.
At December 31, 2022, RTD had a commitment to provide $72,585 in matching funds in order to
receive $172,344 in future federal and state grant funds.

Privatization Contracts
In response to the privatization legislation (Note A), RTD has awarded contracts for specific
groups of routes not to exceed 58% as required by law for vehicular services. As of January
2022, 55.78% of RTD’s non-rail transit services are delivered by private contractors operating
under the auspices and direction of RTD.

ADA Paratransit Service
With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, RTD was mandated to
provide paratransit service to persons with disabilities unable to use RTD’s fixed route system.
This service, branded Access-a-Ride, is a curb-to-curb transportation system offered to persons
with disabilities who cannot functionally use RTD’s regular fixed route system. Customers eligible
for Access-a-Ride services must originate their trip within 3/4 of a mile of an RTD fixed route.
Since September 1996, RTD has been in full compliance with the ADA requirement to provide
paratransit service to persons with disabilities unable to use the fixed route system.
Future Commitments under Construction Contracts
In 2010, RTD entered a public-private partnership (P3) to design, build, finance and operate
several of the transit improvements contemplated under the FasTracks program, including the
Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, the East Rail Corridor (A Line), the Gold Line Rail Corridor

P3 Project.” The Eagle P3 Project is being delivered and operated under a concession agreement
that RTD has entered with a concessionaire that was selected through a competitive proposal
process. The selected concessionaire, Denver Transit Partners (DTP), is a special purpose
company owned by Fluor Enterprises, Uberior Investments and Laing Investments.
The Eagle P3 Project construction was completed in two phases with Phase I completed in 2016
and Phase II completed in 2019. Under the terms of the Eagle P3 Project agreement, RTD made
scheduled construction payments to DTP from 2011 through 2017 for completed project
elements. RTD began commuter rail services on the University of Colorado A Line and the B
Line in 2016 and began services on the G Line in 2019. Under the terms of the concessionaire
agreement, RTD will make scheduled secured principal and interest payments to DTP from 2017
through 2044 in addition to service payments for the provision of operations and maintenance
services performed by DTP. The principal and interest payments are fixed amounts for the term
of the agreement while the service payments are indexed each year according to certain inflation
measurements. In addition, the service payments may also be adjusted for schedule changes,
special services and certain availability factors.
In 2013, RTD entered a contract with Regional Rail Partners to construct the North Metro Rail
Line (N Line). The N Line is an 18.5-mile electric commuter rail line that runs from Denver Union
Station through Commerce City, Thornton and Northglenn to Highway 7 at 162nd Avenue in North
Adams County. The N Line opened in September of 2020 with service extending to 124th Avenue.
In 2014, RTD entered a contract with Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Inc. to design and construct
the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) Project. SERE includes 2.3 miles extending the existing
Southeast Light rail Line from Lincoln Station through the City of Lone Tree to RidgeGate Parkway
Station featuring a Park-n-Ride with a structure of 1,300 parking spaces. SERE opened in 2019.

Diesel Fuel Contract
RTD contracts with Mansfield Oil Company, Inc. (Mansfield) for diesel fuel for buses. The contract
is structured as a single year contract. RTD estimates 2023 usage of approximately 7 million
gallons: 4.20 million gallons of RTD’s usage and 2.8 million gallons of RTD’s private contractors’
usage.
The estimated locked-in price commitment under the Mansfield contract in 2023 is for 7 million
gallons of diesel fuel for both RTD and private contractors at $2.9377 per gallon or $20,564.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Contingencies

Federal Grants
RTD receives federal grants for capital projects and operating assistance, which are subject to
reviews by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Although the outcome of any such review
cannot be predicted, it is management’s opinion these reviews will not result in liabilities to such
an extent that they would materially affect RTD’s financial position.

Self-Insurance
RTD is self-insured for general liability and Workers’ Compensation claims. Liabilities are reported
when it is probable that a loss has occurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee
benefits program in which costs are recognized as they are incurred.
RTD does not carry excess liability insurance for personal injury and property damage. Under
the provisions of the Colorado Government Immunity Act, the maximum liability, with certain
exceptions as defined in the Act, to RTD for claims involving personal injury and property damage
is $387 per individual and $1,093 per incident for claims arising on or after January 1, 2018, and
before January 1, 2022. For claims that arise on or after January 1, 2022, RTD’s liability is limited
to $424 per person and $1,195 per occurrence.
For worker’s compensation, an excess coverage insurance policy covers individual claims more
than $4,000. The number of settlements has not exceeded insurance coverage in any of the past
three years.
RTD’s liability for unpaid claims includes an amount for claims that have been incurred but not
reported (IBNR). RTD’s Risk Management Division determines incurred claims by investigating
the accident and establishing a reserve. Reserves are established on the day of assignment,
reviewed at 30 days and again at 90 days. Reserves are reviewed every 90 days thereafter and
based on ultimate exposure. This amount is included in other accrued expenses in the statement
of net assets. Changes in the balances of claims liabilities for both general liability and worker’s
compensation during the past year are as follows:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------RTD is party to several pending or threatened tort lawsuits, workers’ compensation claims, or
labor/employment claims under which it may be required to pay certain amounts upon final
disposition of these matters. RTD also has certain contract disputes being considered in
contractual dispute resolution proceedings. RTD’s legal counsel estimates that the ultimate
outcome of these matters is sufficiently covered by RTD’s general liability or worker’s
compensation reserves, project contingencies, or insurance, or would not otherwise materially
affect the financial statements of RTD.
The concessionaire for the Eagle Project, Denver Transit Partners, filed litigation in Denver District
Court asserting claims against RTD based on an alleged change in law. DTP alleged damages for
those claims more than $111,000 and RTD had filed a counterclaim of approximately $30,000.
On February 10, 2023, the Court hearing this case issued judgement, determining that the federal
and state authorities applied existing regulations and enforcement policies when they undertook
the regulatory review of the warning system, of which DTP had argued otherwise. The Court
found that there was no change in law or force majeure event that entitled DTP to relief under
the Concessionaire’s Agreement. This action denied DTP’s $111,000 claim against RTD. At the
same time the Court denied RTD’s $30,000 counterclaim against DTP.
On March 30, 2023, DTP submitted a notice of appeal to the Court in response to the decision.
RTD will continue to vigorously defend its position through the appeal process with the belief RTD
will prevail throughout.

NOTE J – BUDGETARY DATA
RTD’s annual budget is prepared on the same basis as that used for accounting except that the
budget also includes proceeds of long-term debt and capital grants as revenue and expenditures
include capital outlays and obligation principal payments and excludes TABOR rebates under
Amendment 1 of the Colorado Constitution, extraordinary loss, and depreciation on, as well as
gains and losses on disposition of property and equipment. The budget sets forth all proposed
outlays for operations, planning, administration, development, debt service, and capital outlays
for the fiscal year. Prior to October 15, the RTD General Manager and CEO submits to the Board
of Directors a proposed operating and capital budget for the fiscal year commencing the following
January 1, which is made available for public inspection and comment. On or before
December 31, the budget is adopted in conjunction with an appropriation resolution by the Board
of Directors, who must also approve subsequent amendments thereto. In the absence of such
adoption, RTD has authority to begin making expenditures limited to 90% of the prior year’s
approved appropriation. RTD’s policy on budget transfers authorizes the RTD General Manager
and CEO to approve certain transfers within the budget.

Unused appropriations lapse at year-end, except the RTD Board of Directors has the authority,
as stated in the adopted appropriation resolution, to carry over the unused portion of funds for
capital projects not completed for a period not to exceed three years. As of December 31, 2022,
there was approximately $567,961 of unused 2022 appropriations for capital outlays available for
carryover to 2023.
In 2022, the RTD Board of Directors approved refinancing certain lease-purchase financing
instruments for interest savings by separate resolution independent of the 2022 approved budget
appropriations. The cost of extinguishment of this debt resulted in expenditures exceeding the
initial approved appropriations in 2022.

NOTE K – TAX, SPENDI NG AND DEBT LI M I TATI ONS
In November 1992, Colorado voters passed an amendment (Amendment 1) to the State
Constitution (Article X, Section 20) that limits the revenue raising and spending abilities of state
and local governments known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR). The limits on property
taxes, revenue, and “fiscal year spending” include allowable annual increases tied to inflation and
local growth in construction valuation. Fiscal year spending as defined by the amendment
excludes spending from certain revenue and financing sources such as federal funds, gifts,
property sales, fund transfers, damage awards, and fund reserves. Amendment 1 requires voter
approval for any increase in mill levy tax rates, new taxes, or creation of multi-year debt. Revenue
earned in excess of the “spending limit” must be refunded to the taxpayers unless voters approve
retention of these revenues. In addition, Amendment 1 mandates that reserves equal to 3% of
fiscal spending be established for declared emergencies.
On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District exempted RTD from the revenue and spending
limitations concerning Amendment 1 through December 31, 2005. On November 2, 1999, the
voters of the District further exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined

Southwest Corridor light rail projects or to operate such projects for as long as any debt remains
outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in RTD’s sales and use
tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit
improvement program. This authorization also exempted RTD from any revenue and spending
limitations on the additional tax and on any investment, income generated by the increased tax
revenue and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the
FasTracks program. At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, RTD’s sales and use tax rate
will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the transit system financed through FasTracks. RTD
has $3.477 billion in authorized debt, subject to Amendment 1’s limitations. This debt was
authorized by the voters of the District in 2004 to pay for the FasTracks transit improvement
program. Based on estimated fiscal year spending for 2021, $25,623 of year-end net position
has been reserved for emergencies. Amendment 1 is complex and subject to judicial
interpretation. RTD believes it follows the requirements of Amendment 1 based on the
interpretations of the amendment’s language available at year-end.

NOTE L – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On March 30, 2023, RTD’s concessionaire, Denver Transit Partners (DTP), which operates and
maintains certain elements of RTD’s commuter rail services, filed an appeal with the Court
regarding the February 10, 2023, judgement issued regarding litigation between RTD and DTP.
See Contract Disputes and Legal Proceedings.
On January 9, 2023, RTD was awarded a federal grant under section 5307 Preventive
Maintenance, totaling $99,650, of which $79,720 is the federal portion. The start date for eligible
costs was 10/1/2021 ending 9/30/2023. The grant will assist RTD in covering costs for preventive
maintenance and capital cost of contracting which helps RTD ensure its transit services are safe
and reliable.
