RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Resolution No. ______ reappointing Bill Van Meter and Derrick Black to a term
expiring 12/31/2021 as trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and
Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Plan.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #2 – Address Service & Human Capital
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 1 Series of 2008 providing that
a screening committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee Pension Trust
Fund and the Finance Chair (i.e., Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit Committee) will screen
applications from the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management salaried
employee class and will bring recommendations back to the Board.
In 2010, Resolution No. 27 made modification to state that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have
served satisfactorily and in whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not
necessary to seek applications for renewal, and instead the application process established by the RTD
Board of Directors in 2008 will be used on those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or
appropriate to appoint new salaried trustees to the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008 Series of 2016, the RTD Board of Directors amended the
Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Trust, to end the “senior” and “middle” management
distinction, and instead authorized the Board of Directors to appoint two employee Trustees who
participate in the Pension Plan and two who participate in the Defined Contribution Plan, in addition to
the two Board members who are appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a
permanent member of the Trusts, to serve as the same set of trustees on both of the Trusts.
Bill Van Meter and Derrick Black current terms expire on 12/31/2019. Both Bill and Derrick meet the
criteria from Resolution No. 2017, Series 2010 for reappointment.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approves the attached Resolution No. ______ reappointing Bill Van Meter and Derrick

1.B.1

Black to a term expiring 12/31/2021 as trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e.,
Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Plan.
2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, and require the screening
committee to return with a revised recommendation. This is not recommended since the
committee has reviewed applicants and performed its function in accordance with the Plan
requirements, consistent with the goals of existing Board resolutions.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Subject:

Adoption of the 2020 Performance Measures

CFO/AGM,

Date: November 6, 2019

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors adopts
the attached 2020 Proposed Performance Report and the accompanying performance measures for
mission statement goals 1-7. In 2020, there are 42 proposed performance measures to be tracked for
the GM, which is one higher than for 2019.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Service
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These performance measures provide a framework in which RTD can
determine how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within the
context of its mission statement, and they should integrate with the Board’s priorities for the coming
year.
A report detailing year-to-date performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of
Directors following the end of each quarter. The proposed performance measures for 2020 are brought
to the Board of Directors for review at this time because the measures are used in development of the
2020 Budget. These final 2020 performance measures are being presented to the Board at the
November 12th Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting with a request to forward to the
Board for adoption on November 19th.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the performance measures from 2019 to 2020 are listed below:


Goal 1.4 Reduce the number of light rail accidents
o It is recommended that the measure be changed from reporting preventable light rail
accidents per 100,000 train miles to reporting the actual number of preventable accidents
regardless of miles and that the measure be changed from ≤ 2.0 to ≤ 3.0 in 2020.



Goal 1.5 Reduce the number of commuter rail accidents
o It is recommended that the measure be changed from reporting preventable commuter rail
accidents per 100,000 train miles to reporting the actual number of preventable accidents
regardless of miles and that the measure be changed from ≤ 2.0 to ≤ 3.0 in 2020.



Goal 6.2 Increase in ridership
o It is recommended that the ridership increase for 2020 be established at 2.1% based on
estimates for ridership for 2019 and 2020. Overall system ridership is projected to be flat

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.2

for the Base System with any ridership increases attributed to FasTracks. Full-year G Line
and SERE numbers are factored in as well as mid-year opening of the N line. The measure
includes all passenger boardings not limited to revenue ridership; ridership estimates for
the Mall Shuttle and Free MetroRide are included.


Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total operating revenue
o It is recommended that the fare revenue increase for 2020 be established at 2.6%. This is
the percentage increase in estimated fare revenue over the 2019 projection. It is based on
ridership estimates and assumes full-year ridership for the G Line and SERE and half-year
ridership for the N Line.
o It is recommended that the total operating revenue increase for 2020 be established at
2.4%. This is the percentage increase in total operating revenue in the 2020 Budget over
the 2019 projection.



Goal 6.5 Maintain bus/light rail operator headcount and bus mechanic headcount within
authorization.
o A change is proposed to add the measurement of Light Rail operator vacancies at ≤ 5.0%
and light rail operators over headcount at ≤ 4.0%. This mirrors the same measure for bus
operators. It is deemed relevant due to system growth and the need to monitor operator
hiring in current labor markets.

With the addition of the measurement for light rail operator vacancies/headcount, there will be 42
proposed performance measures to be tracked for the GM which is one higher than for 2019.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2020 performance measures are being utilized in the development of the final 2020 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors adopts the attached 2020 Proposed Performance Report and the performance measures
included for mission statement goals 1-7. In 2020, there are 42 proposed performance measures
to be tracked for the GM.
2. Do not adopt the 2020 Proposed Performance Report and the accompanying performance
measures. This is not the recommended action because it results in no measures for ridership,
fare revenue, and total operating revenue and does not aid in the development of the 2020
budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

November 6, 2019

Subject:

Adoption of the Investment Policy

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 6, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the attached Investment Policy which contains recommended changes to reflect changes in state
law relating to bank securities and some wording changes for clarification purposes.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management, Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in November 2018. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION
Staff solicited the expertise, knowledge and recommendations of its investment advisor, Public Trust
Advisors, in reviewing the current Policy. Recommended changes are in response to a change in state
law in 2019 and clarification to some previously existing text in the policy.
The purpose of the Investment Policy (the “Policy”) of the Regional Transportation District ("RTD") is to
specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and systematic program for investments in
RTD’s operating and reserve funds. The Policy also provides for the investment of bond proceeds that
are authorized through bond resolutions or indentures of trust.
By following best practices with respect to the management of public funds, the primary objectives of
RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2) sufficient liquidity to meet
known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield (achieving a market rate of return). Although RTD must
legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1) it
has previously made a policy decision to implement its investment program in a more conservative
manner than is dictated by state statute through imposing stricter diversification requirements.
A redlined copy of the recommended policy is attached which highlights the recommended changes from
the currently adopted investment policy.
ALTERNATIVES

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement

The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:



Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:


Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

Packet Pg. 24

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 10-31-19 (3995 : Adoption of the Investment Policy)

1. PURPOSE

1.B.3.a

3.2 Liquidity

3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to

2
Packet Pg. 25

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 10-31-19 (3995 : Adoption of the Investment Policy)

The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.

1.B.3.a

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.

the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).

Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the
security is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating
organizations (“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second
highest rating category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's
and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or
security is downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in
the Portfolio, the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is
advisable to sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates
of indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America.
100% of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum
maturity for investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities: Obligations, participations or other
instruments of any Federal agency, instrumentality or United States governmentsponsored enterprise as described in CRS 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an “Agency” or
“Agencies”). Such securities shall be rated in one of the two highest rating categories (as
described above in the Credit Criteria section) by at least two NRSROs. No more than
75% of the Portfolio may be invested in Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities,
with no more than 25% being invested in a single issuer. Subordinate debt of any issuer
is not authorized. The maximum maturity for investments in Federal Agency and
Instrumentality Securities shall be limited to five years.
Authorized Securities include, but may not be limited to:


department, agency, instrumentality, or authority of the state) shall be rated in one of the
three highest rating categories (as described in the Credit Criteria section) by at least two
NRSROs. Such obligations of any other governmental entity shall be rated in one of the

two highest rating categories (as described in the Credit Criteria section) by at least two
NRSROs.

Pre-Refunded Municipal Bonds which are secured by an escrow of U.S. Treasury
securities or State and Local Government Series securities, shall be rated in one of the
two highest rating categories (as described in the Credit Criteria section) by a NRSRO.
No more than 40% of the Portfolio may be invested in Pre-Refunded Municipal Bonds

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,
diversification requirements, extraordinary events and other factors may be considered when
awarding investments. RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or
sales of investment instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be
executed through a bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial
institutions. If RTD is offered a security for which there is no readily available competitive
offering on the same specific issue, the investment officer may document quotations for
comparable or alternative securities. When purchasing original/new issue securities, no
competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in the selling group offer those securities at
the same original issue price.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions
authorized to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities
only from those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i)
primary dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that
qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

Adoption of Pension Plan Contribution

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopt a 2020 contribution of $6.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust
(the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2020 contribution of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount
to the plan for each year of employment.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #2 – Address Service & Human Capital
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9% of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION

DB Plan
In 2012, the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan
would be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a
result of the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the
DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a
“fully funded” status for the plan in the future. In 2016, the policy was changed to fund an amount that
would keep the Plan “actuarially sound” based on the recommendations of the Actuary and RTD’s Chief
Financial Officer.
The Actuary has updated the DB Plan projections to reflect the final 1/1/2019 valuation assumptions for
the DB Plan. The 2020 Actuary recommended contribution is $8.1 million.
If the Actuarial
recommendation of $8.1 million is made beginning in 2020, the plan is expected to achieve 100%
funding in 2031 and the recommended amount is projected to drop below $5.1 million in 2032.
RTD’s Chief Financial Officer is recommending a contribution of $6.1 million. If RTD contributed $6.1
million in 2020 and beyond, the Plan is expected to achieve 100% funding in 2040. This also assumes
an annual rate of return of 7% per year.

Packet Pg. 38

1.B.4

DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2019.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Below is a summary of the current and recommended DB Plan and DC Plan funding scenarios:

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopt a 2020 contribution of $6.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit
Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also
recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2020 contribution of 9% of each
participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC
Plan”), which contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment.
2. The RTD Board of Directors could certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust or the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution
Plan at amounts other than $6.1 million and 9%, respectively.
3. Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plans. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

Subject:

Board Expense Reduction Resolution

Executive

Manager,

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Executive Committee of the RTD Board of Directors that the Board approve a
motion to adopt the attached Resolution No. ______, Series of 2019, concerning a Temporary Reduction
of Certain Board Office Budget Lines Related to Director Travel and the Allocation of Certain Meeting
Expenses to Directors’ Local Expense Budgets.
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2019 Core Goal #3 - Strong Financial
Management.
BACKGROUND
Directors are eligible for reimbursement from the District for reasonable local and travel expenses
incurred that are necessary to the transaction of official District business. Out-of-District registration
fees for the first two sanctioned events for each Director are not charged against the Director’s
expenses and are instead paid for using Board Office funds.
In 2009 and again in 2011, the Board unanimously adopted resolutions reducing the Board members’
spending limits on their local and travel expenses as economic downturns required a reduction in overall
agency spending.
DISCUSSION
The attached resolution, for Fiscal Year 2020 only:




Reduces by $2,000 the amount allocated to each Directors’ travel expense budget;
Reduces by half, or $12,750, the amount budgeted by the Board Office to defray the cost of
Directors’ registration fees incurred in order to attend out-of-District transit-related conferences;
and
Authorizes the Board Office to allocate a debit in a certain amount toward each Director’s local
expense account for expenses incurred by the Board Office on behalf of the Director in the course
of preparing for official meetings of the Board and its committees.

ALTERNATIVES
1. To adopt the attached resolution.
2. To reject the resolution. Rejection of this resolution would necessitate further cuts to certain line
items in the Board Office budget in order to balance the Board Office’s component of the 2020
requested agency budget.

1.B.5

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adoption of this resolution would result in an estimated General Fund savings of at least $51,000 during
Fiscal Year 2020.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

Temporary Reduction of Certain Board Office Budget Lines Related to Director Travel and
Allocation of Certain Meeting Expenses to Directors’ Local Expense Budgets
WHEREAS, The Regional Transportation District (RTD) has 15 elected Board members who
serve their constituents on a daily basis throughout the community, at committee meetings,
study sessions, and Board meetings, and at the legislature, and
WHEREAS, there is an increasing need and desire of the community to hear of RTD’s
evolving plans and projects; and
WHEREAS, Board members’ direct contact with constituents puts a public face on RTD and
gives community members the opportunity to share ideas and concerns with their elected
officials; and
WHEREAS, in order to learn current information and keep updated on a myriad of
transportation issues and new innovations across the nation, it is important for Directors to
experience first-hand other transit agencies and issues they face; and
WHEREAS, in order to grasp new ever-changing transit technology, it is important for the
Directors to attend conferences and formal presentations and meet with peers from other
transit agencies to discuss issues similar to those experienced by RTD; and
WHEREAS, in recognition of the effect of the economic downturn in the Denver metropolitan
region, however, and the concomitant reduction in sales and use tax revenues, the Board
believes it appropriate to reduce the local expense limits allocated to the RTD Board
members;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that for Fiscal Year 2020 only:
1) The amount allocated to each Director’s travel expense budget shall be reduced by
$2,000;
2) The amount budgeted by the Board Office to defray the cost of Directors’ registration
fees incurred in order to attend out-of-District transit-related conferences shall be
reduced by half; and

Draft 2020 Budget

BACKGROUND
RTD’s initial 2020 Requested Budget was presented at the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee (FAAC) on September 17, 2019. The State of Colorado requires that a requested budget be
presented to the Board and be made available for public inspection after giving public notice in
newspapers of major distribution by October 15th of each year. Public notice was given in the October
12-13, 2019 weekend editions of The Denver Post and The Boulder Daily Camera. Copies of the
preliminary 2020 budget were made available at that time in the Board office for public inspection and
the preliminary budget was posted on the website. A budget update was presented to FAAC on
October 22, 2019.
The purpose of this Board report is to update the Board with proposed changes and new information that
has become available since the presentation of the first draft 2020 Requested Budget and subsequent
update at the FAAC. The 2020 Recommended Budget (final budget) is now scheduled to be presented
at the December 10th FAAC meeting with a request to forward the budget to the Board for adoption on
December 17th.
DISCUSSION
The following summarizes revised assumptions incorporated into the 2020 budget from those previously
presented at the FAAC. Major revisions and areas of focus include:


Sales/use taxes are revised from the first draft Requested Budget previously presented to
the Board on September 17th. The first draft budget incorporated the CU-Leeds School
March sales/use tax forecast, while subsequent budget updates incorporate the September
forecast as will the final Recommended Budget. In the CU-Leeds School September
forecast, 2020 sales/use tax is revised downward to increase 2.0% over the 2019
projection, which is also revised downward to increase 2.7% over 2018. The most
current sales/use tax forecast is lower by $25.2 million in 2020 compared to the Mid-term
Financial Plan (MTFP).



Revised estimates for fare revenue have been made based on year-to-date actual data
through September and a forecast for North Metro based on a May 2020 opening. Fare
revenue is now estimated to be lower by $14.8 million in 2020 compared to the MTFP.
This number improved from the previous estimated shortfall of $17.1 million.

Packet Pg. 59

1.C.2



The total of 2020 fare revenue and sales/use tax revenue shortfalls from the MTFP is
$40.0 million. This number improved from the previous estimated shortfall of $42.3
million.



Staff has made a series of reductions in planned expenditures from the first draft
Requested Budget and subsequent update previously presented at FAAC. Reductions
were made by all departments to meet the operating expense target established in the
MTFP and to make up for the estimated shortfalls from the MTFP in sales/use tax revenue
and fare revenue. The goal is a balanced 2020 Recommended Budget to be presented to
the Board on December 10th.



Base System measures planned to balance the final budget are as follows:
Additional requests over MTFP



The items highlighted in yellow are changed from the previous update on October 22 and
consist of the following:

Packet Pg. 60

1.C.2

o

Additional requests over the MTFP have been reduced from $4.1 million to $1.7
million. These are necessary expenses related to insurance and mobile ticketing
support identified after the MTFP was finalized.

o

Staff was informed about the State Audit in 2020 after the MTFP was finalized.

o

Grant revenue was revised after the MTFP was finalized to include grant-funded
projects and revisions to earlier forecasts based on updated information.

o

Purchase of the UP Burnham Yard property adjacent to the RTD ROW to be utilized
for additional trackage along the Central Corridor is postponed until 2022 at the
direction of the City & County of Denver.



An executed diesel fuel lock for 2020 will have positive benefit. Diesel fuel is budgeted at
a locked price of $2.00/gallon for 2020, down from the budgeted price of $2.30/gallon.
The favorable impact from the 2020 price lock is $3.0 million. Gasoline remains budgeted
at $2.90/gallon, same as the 2019 budgeted price.



Based on the above calculation, the 2020 Budget for the Base System would be balanced.
Should any of the items identified to close the gap not materialize before the 2020 budget
is finalized, additional measures will be taken to eliminate a Base System gap which may
include further operating expense reductions, capital expenditure reductions, or fund
draws.



The total capital carryforward (previously approved capital) is not estimated at this time
but will be included in the final Recommended Budget.



The FasTracks budget is able to withstand its share of the revenue shortfall to MTFP and
maintain a balanced budget in 2020.



In FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital
Replacement Fund, and Unrestricted Fund are established at 3 months of operating
expenses.



The Base System Unrestricted Fund balance is targeted at $2.0 million, which is the
projected fund balance in the MTFP. This target remains a viable goal after adjusting for
the above-noted revenue items and expense reductions. The Base System will not meet
the goal of 3 months of operating expenses in fund balances in 2020 but is estimated to
have approximately 1 month of operating expenses in fund balances in 2020.
The $3.0 million contribution to the Board-Appropriated Fund is retained for 2020.

POLICY REFERENCE
Investment Policy
DISCUSSION
Please find the District’s investment report for the third quarter of 2019 attached. RTD funds are
invested in high quality, short term investments which are often effected by changing economic
conditions and expectations and also by actions of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.
The U.S. economy and household spending continued to expand at a moderate pace during the third
quarter of 2019 while business fixed investment and exports have weakened. The U.S. unemployment
rate decreased to 3.5% and general inflationary pressures have been muted.
In view of implications of global developments for the economic outlook, the Federal Reserve Open
Market Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1.50 to 1.75 percent.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

3rd Quarter

Y-T-D

RTD cash and cash equivalents:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 3-month U.S. T-Bill Index

RTD enhanced cash:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index:

0.561%
0.639%

2.309%
2.364%

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio for the month of September was 2.13%. Year to date
invest earnings if annualized would produce earnings of approximately $8.1 million.
Historical performance of RTD Liquidity Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy benchmark is
reflected in the following graph:

Historical performance of RTD Enhanced Cash Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy
benchmark is reflected in the following graph:

In addition to the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s portfolio, all other reserves are

LiVE Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 6, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 12, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program will transition to
new rules after December 31, 2019.
DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

1.C.5

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of November 3, 2019, 2,652 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 1,567 have been
approved, 743 have been denied and the remaining 342 are pending. Of the 743 denied, 489 of them
were denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65 and older which entitles them to a
better discount. 176 were denied because their address was out of District, 8 were denied because it
was a duplicate application, 4 were denied because the applicants were already enrolled, 5 were denied
because they did not respond to requests for additional information, and 61 were denied because they
did not meet the income threshold.
In addition to going live on July 29th, the following actions have been completed:
