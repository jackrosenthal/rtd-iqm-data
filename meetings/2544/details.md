The 2017 Budget Appropriation below includes the following projected operating expenses, debt and reserves, capital expenditures, and fund balances as follows (in thousands):

BACKGROUND

In accordance with State law, the District submitted its proposed budget to the governing body by October 15, 2016.  By legal notice, the governing body presented the proposed 2017 Requested Budget for public review on October 8, 2016.  A public hearing to solicit formal public comment is scheduled for the November 29, 2016 regular meeting of the Board of Directors.

DISCUSSION

The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2017 Recommended Budget (combined Base and FasTracks) is $2,169.2 million.  This includes an operating expense budget of $626.1 million, interest expense of $160.9 million, capitalized interest of $33.0 million, new capital expenditures of $301.0 million, debt payments of $58.9 million, FasTracks management reserve of $15.9 million, FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $40.6 million, Board appropriated fund of $29.7 million, capital replacement fund of $15.0 million, unrestricted operating reserve of $9.7 million, and estimated unrestricted fund balance of $14.3 million.  The previously approved capital (capital carry forward) is $864.1 million.  The sum of the budget appropriation and capital carry forward is $2,169.2 million.

Overview of the 2017 RTD Recommended Budget

Revenues of $1,258.2 million on a combined basis are expected to increase $174.0 million (16.1%) in 2017 from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget.  The increase is due to 1) an increase in farebox revenue of $20.2 million, 2) an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $38.5 million, and 3) an increase in grant revenue of $122.1 million, and 4) an increase in investment income of $0.4 million, offset by a decrease in other income of $7.2 million.

- Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenues of $150.4 million are budgeted to increase 15.5% over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget.  On the Base System, fare revenue is budgeted to remain flat in 2017 and ridership as well is expected to be flat to minimal.  For FasTracks, farebox revenue is budgeted to increase $20.2 million over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $32.9 million due to the full-year operation of the FasTracks service corridors brought on-line in 2016.  The FasTracks estimate is per the Annual Program Evaluation.  Any ridership increases are attributed to FasTracks.

- Sales and use tax revenue of $608.3 million in 2017 is expected to increase 6.7% over the 2016 projected level according to the most recent September quarterly forecast by the CU-Leeds School of Business. Compared to the growth rate used in the SBP of 5.2% based on the CU-Leeds March forecast, the gain is $3.9 million.  This differential between the forecasts used in the SBP and the 2017 Budget is contributed to the unrestricted operating reserve in the 2017 Budget.

- Total Base System grants are projected to increase $30.5 million over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget, including new and carry forward amounts.  Base System grants are estimated to total $148.0 million in 2017; of that amount, $94.1 million is new grants while projected carryforward grant funding is $53.9 million.  FasTracks grants are budgeted at $328.9 million, an increase of $91.7 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget largely due to significant projected carryforward grant funding of $119.7 million.

- Investment income is budgeted to increase slightly by $0.4 million due to the impact of continued low short term interest rates coupled with deployment of invested funds.  An expected small increase in interest rates will stabilize investment income.

- Other operating income and other income together will decline by $7.2 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due to the non-recurrence of $9.0 million released from TABOR reserves in 2016, offset by full-year payment by the University of Colorado for naming rights on the A Line and an increase in DUS rental income.

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $626.1 million on a combined basis in 2017 (excluding depreciation), which is $12.2 million lower compared to the 2016 Re-Amended Budget.  Base System operating expenses are budgeted to increase $8.8 million, FasTracks Project operating expenses are budgeted to decrease $24.8 million, and FasTracks Operations operating expenses are budgeted to increase $3.8 million.  On the Base System, departmental operating expenses are targeted amounts derived from the SBP and amounts allocated for health insurance increases for salaried personnel, costs for material salvage, an increase in LRV spare parts, wages and salary adjustments, and other miscellaneous increases unknown at the time of the SBP.  For FasTracks Operations, the increase is generally due to full allocation from Base to FasTracks of costs of operating the new service corridors offset by reclassification of TABOR interest expense to FasTracks Project.  The expense project carryforward to 2017 is $15.0 million for Base System, $19.9 million for FasTracks Project, and $1.5 million for FasTracks Operations.  It should be noted that substantial reductions were made to departmental operating budgets to align them with the SBP target, which offset unanticipated expense increases over 2016.

Diesel fuel is budgeted at the lock price of $1.69 per gallon, compared to a price of $2.23 per gallon in the 2016 Re-Amended Budget, for year-over-year savings of approximately $5.3 million.  Compared to the budgeted price of $1.80 used in the SBP, the savings is $1.2 million.  This differential between the SBP and actual lock price is contributed to the unrestricted operating reserve in the 2017 Budget.  Gasoline is budgeted at $2.65/gallon, down from the 2016 per gallon budget price of $3.00, for year-over-year savings of $0.6 million.

The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to the posted Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A.  The majority of the changes from the Requested Budget consist of the expense projects carry-forward.

Interest expense in 2017 is budgeted at $160.9 million on a combined basis, an increase of $43.6 million over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget.  The increase is due to the inclusion of the TABOR interest expense of $41.0 million as part of the DTO service payment for the first time in 2017 and new interest expense for the full year from the 2016 FasTracks bond issuance.   This increase is offset by a reduction to total interest expense from the favorable benefit of bond refinancing.  Of total interest expense, $25.5 million is budgeted for Base System and $135.4 million is budgeted for FasTracks.  Capitalized interest (combined) is budgeted at $33.0 million, the majority of which will occur in FasTracks Project.  Capitalized interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for interest payments in 2017.

Principal payments on debt are estimated at $58.9 million on a combined basis, which is $2.8 million lower than the 2016 Re-Amended Budget.  Base System principal payments of $48.6 million are $3.3 million lower due to scheduled amortization of COPs issued for fleet purchases (bus and rail).  FasTracks principal payments of $10.3 million are $0.5 million higher due to refundings and scheduled principal amortization on current debt.  No new debt issuances are planned in 2017 for either the Base System or FasTracks.  Both will draw from previously issued debt to fund major capital purchases and construction in 2017.

Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2016 (previously approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2017.  The capital carry-forward will be $864.1 million made up of $166.1 million on the Base System and $698.0 million on FasTracks.

New capital spending of $301.0 million on a combined basis will decrease $219.0 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due mainly to project completion in FasTracks.  New capital spending for FasTracks will decrease $175.8 million to $234.4 million in 2017 due to on-going project completion on the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, Eagle project, US36 BRT, Northwest Rail and I-225, offset by increases to North Metro.  For the Base System, new capital spending will decrease $43.2 million to $66.6 million.  Of this amount, the Base system will spend $6.0 million more on facilities construction and maintenance (primarily Customer Care Center relocation), $1.4 million on Park-n-Rides, and $4.1 million on systems planning (mostly Colfax Avenue Transit Priority Project).  These increases will be offset by $1.0 million less on bus infrastructure, $49.4 million less on fleet modernization/expansion (bus and rail), $5.3 million less in capital support projects (primarily IT support for the District).  The Base System new capital was approved as part of the Strategic Budget Plan in September 2016 and is the amount identified for minimum “must have” projects.

New capital expenditures for 2017 and the change in new capital in the 2017 Recommended Budget over the previous 2017 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget Plan are shown in Attachment B.  The capital carry-forward expenditures for 2017 and the change in the capital carry-forward in the 2017 Recommended Budget over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.

Notable designated fund balance changes include a minimal decrease in the Base System year-end unrestricted fund balance from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $2.0 million.  This projected fund balance is in agreement with the SBP target of $2.0 million after incorporating all revenue and expense adjustments.  The actual amount realized, however, may be lower (or higher) than that projected due to lower (or higher) fare revenue and sales tax revenue in 2016 (this will become evident in the 2017 amended budget).  Also on the Base System, the Board-appropriated fund is projected to increase by $7.0 million to $17.4 million, the capital replacement fund is projected to increase by $2.7 million to $2.7 million, and an unrestricted operating reserve is established for the first time in 2017 at $9.7 million.

The FasTracks management reserve (formerly contingency reserve) is budgeted at $15.9 million.  The FasTracks construction reserve is budgeted at $56.3 million.  In FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the Board-appropriated fund, capital replacement fund, and unrestricted fund are established at 3 months of operating expenses up from 2 months previously.

On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to increase $2.9 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $14.3 million.  The Board-appropriated fund, the capital replacement fund, and the unrestricted operating reserve are projected to increase by $25.3 million in total.  These increases are in minimum accordance with fiscal policies for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.

Cost Recovery Ratio

The 2017 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA farebox revenues divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.

Fund Balance Policy

The Fund Balance Policy for 2017 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated fund, a capital replacement fund, the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance for both the Base System and FasTracks, and an additional unrestricted operating reserve currently for the Base System.  The objective is for the total of these funds excluding the capital acquisition fund to equal approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for both Base System and FasTracks.  The 2017 budget reflects maintenance of a FasTracks management reserve and construction reserve at levels deemed sufficient to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule.

The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2017 on a District-wide basis is projected at $68.7 million, comprised of 1) the Board-appropriated fund of $29.7 million, 2) the capital replacement fund of $15.0 million, 3) the unrestricted operating reserve of $9.7 million, and 4) the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance of $14.3 million.  The Base System portion of these fund balances listed for 2017 is projected to total $31.8 million.

Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting

The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two exceptions:

- Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.

- Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.

- The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.

- Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.
