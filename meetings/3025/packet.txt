BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Paul J. Ballard, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: August 4, 2020

From:

Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations

GM

Date:

August 4, 2020

Board Meeting Date: August 18, 2020

Subject:

Award of Wagon Road, Broomfield
Evergreen Contracted FlexRide Services

and

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Via Mobility Services (Via)
for the provision of contracted Wagon Road, Broomfield and Evergreen FlexRide transit services. This
contract is for two years, with no option years. The first-year contract amount for service is $981,288
and the second-year is $894,366 for a total not-to-exceed amount of $1,875,654. In addition, RTD will
reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be $113,305 for contract year
one and $106,010 for contract year two, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $219,316 for the twoyear contract term. The total two-year not-to-exceed amount for the FlexRide service and fuel is
$2,094,970.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND:
Originally mandated in 1988 by Senate Bill 88-164 and revised by other legislative activities over the
years, RTD is obligated to “implement a system under which up to fifty-eight percent of the district’s
vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses pursuant to competitively negotiated
contracts.” RTD currently outsources approximately 45% of its fixed-route service, 100% of its ADA
paratransit service (Access-a-Ride), and 100% of its general public demand response service (FlexRide).
The total amount of vehicular service currently contracted out is close to 56%.
On June 18, 2020, a Request for Proposals (RFP) 120-FH-015 named Wagon Road, Broomfield and
Evergreen Services (“WGBFEV”) was issued soliciting proposals for the provision of demand response
transit services. The “WGBFEV” service package replaces the current Wagon Road and Broomfield
contracts, which will expire on September 30, 2020, and the current Evergreen contract, which will
expire on December 31, 2020. The service package consists of 8 FlexRide vehicles operating in three
service areas providing approximately 18,777 revenue hours per year. A summary of the service areas
included in “WGBFEV” is included as Attachment A. Responses to the Request for Proposals were due
on July 15, 2020. Proposers were required to provide detailed operating plans for providing demand
response service, including hiring and training employees, maintaining RTD-provided transit vehicles, and
conforming to RTD operating requirements. The contract award was anticipated to be awarded on a
fixed-price basis and based on “best value” competitive proposal procedures.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

DISCUSSION:
This recommendation represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to
Request for Proposals (RFP) 120-FH-015 to provide “WGBFEV” Public Transportation Services. The
contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective on October 1, 2020 (Wagon Road and
Broomfield) and January 1, 2021 (Evergreen).
PROCUREMENT:
Two (2) proposals were received from Via Mobility Services (Via) and Denver Limousine in response to
RFP 120-FH-015 for the Provision of “WGBFEV” Public Transportation Services. All proposals were
evaluated on the following evaluative criteria:
a) understanding/approach and organization for
implementation (35%); b) experience/qualifications and safety record (30%); c) price (30%); and d) SBE
plan and goal attainment (5%).
The technical evaluation team reviewed and scored each proposal based on a) understanding/approach
and organization for implementation and b) experience/qualifications and safety record. The technical
evaluation team consisted of Brian Matthews, Manager, Special Services; Erin Vallejos, Manager,
Competitive Services; Eric Castillo, Senior Quality Control Inspector, Maintenance; and Pat Heye, Senior
Alternative Service Planner/Scheduler.
The SBE plan and goal attainment was reviewed and scored by Jose Chirinos, Compliance Officer, SBO.
The proposal pricing was reviewed and scored by the Procurement Department staff.
“WGBFEV” PROPOSALS:
Via - The following is a summary of the strong points of the Via “WGBFEV” proposal which support the
recommendation of contract award to Via:
Facility. Located at 2855 North 63rd Street in Boulder and 6500 Franklin Street in Denver, these
facilities are centrally located in close proximity the Wagon Road and Broomfield service areas. For the
Evergreen service area, while Via is still seeking to lease space in a secured parking lot, they have an
agreement in place to use the facility of the current service provider, Seniors’ Resource Center, until a
new space is secured. All three facilities are already fully functional so there will be no disruption of
service or added start-up costs when transitioning from the previous contracts to the new “WGBFEV”
contract.
Maintenance Program. Via has a well-established maintenance program and prior experience maintaining
the vehicles provided under this contract. The Boulder and Denver facilities already have all necessary
equipment for properly maintaining the vehicles so there will be no disruption of service or added startup costs while transitioning from the previous contracts.
Recruitment and Training. As the current provider of these FlexRide services, Via already has drivers on
staff and trained to provide this service. They have a thorough and proven training program that will
allow them to provide continuity for on-going operations.
Proposed Management Team. Under this team’s leadership, Via successfully delivers paratransit and
FlexRide service for RTD throughout the District. The team has developed and nurtured positive and
productive relationships with RTD, surrounding governments and communities. The following is a brief
description of the experience for the Key Personnel assigned to the new “WGBFEV” contract:
•

Proposed General Manager: Has 3.5 years’ experience as a General/Project Manager for RTD

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

FlexRide services and a total of 12 years’ transportation experience.
•

Proposed Operations Manager: Has 5 years’ experience as an Operations Manager and a total of
17 years’ experience within the transportation industry.

•

Proposed Maintenance Manager: Has 30 years’ experience as a Maintenance Manager. In total,
has over of 42 years’ experience in fleet management.

•

Proposed Human Resources Manager: Has 16 years’ experience as a Human Resources Manager
with 13 years’ FlexRide experience.

•

Proposed Safety/Training Manager: Has 12 years’ experience as a Safety and Training Manager
with 2 years’ transportation experience.

Experience of Firm. Via has been providing services for RTD for almost 25 years in addition to providing
other private demand response services within the community since 1979.
SBE goal set at 5%. Via’s proposed SBE plan meets the 5% goal.
The technical evaluation team requested further clarification on a few items which were adequately
addressed by VIA.
Denver Limousine - The following is a summary of the Denver Limousine “WGBFEV” proposal that does
not support the recommendation of contract award to Denver Limousine:
Milestones. Denver Limousine did not provide a schedule as to how the milestones would be met.
Start-up and Transition Plan. Denver Limousine did not provide a start-up or transition plan.
Maintenance. Denver Limousine did not provide a detailed maintenance plan.
Hiring and Retention Strategy. Denver Limousine did not provide a detailed hiring or retention plan.
Training. Denver Limousine did not provide a detailed training calendar or components that would make
up the training.
Management Team. The proposed Denver Limousine local management team did not meet the minimum
qualification requirements set forth in the “WGBFEV” RFP.
Cost. Denver Limousine’s proposed price is $1,167,730 more than the price proposed by Via.
For the reasons noted above the technical evaluation team determined that it was not in the best
interest of RTD to pursue any further action with Denver Limousine.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
RTD Special Services Internal Cost Estimate:
This estimate was prepared by the Special Services Department to anticipate the amount RTD could

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1

expect to pay to outsource the “WGBFEV” service package to a contract operator. RTD anticipated
proposers would implement a competitive wage structure that was in line with the local labor market
as well as an increase for inflation. RTD Special Services total two-year estimate for the “WGBFEV”
service package was $2,055,233.
Via’s proposed total price was $1,875,654. Via’s price proposal for Wagon Road and Broomfield
matches the variable hourly rate for the rest of the northern metro FlexRides they currently operate
and does not include any additional overhead. The Evergreen variable hourly rate proposed by Via is
15% lower than the rate of the current service provider.
Denver Limousine’s proposed total price was $3,043,383. Denver Limousine’s price proposal was
not considered further since their proposed price was significantly higher than RTD would expect to
pay for the “WGBFEV” service package.
Below is a breakdown of the RTD Special Services estimate and price proposals received.

($179,579)
$998,150

The Via total two-year proposed price represents a $179,579 (9%) savings over the RTD estimated
cost of the service. The Wagon Road and Broomfield FlexRide services are grant funded and were
almost equal to RTD’s internal cost estimate. The Evergreen FlexRide service represents a 17%
savings over RTD’s internal cost estimate. Funds for the provision of the 2020 portion of the first
year of service under this contract were included in the 2020 RTD budget. Funds will be requested
in future budgets for the provision of service in future years.
RECOMMENDATION:
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Via Mobility Services
(Via) for the provision of contracted Wagon Road, Broomfield and Evergreen FlexRide transit
services. This contract is for two years, with no option years. The first-year contract amount for
service is $981,288 and the second-year is $894,366 for a total not-to-exceed amount of
$1,875,654. In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount
estimated to be $113,305 for contract year one and $106,010 for contract year two, for a total notto-exceed amount of $219,316 for the two-year contract term. The total two-year not-to-exceed
amount for the FlexRide service and fuel is $2,094,970.

Safety

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by Directors Lewis, Walker, and Williams that the Board of Directors approve the
Resolution No. _____, Series of 2020.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #2 – Strong and Ethical Leadership
BACKGROUND
The Board of Directors have had discussion regarding the challenges regarding the safety and security
for our patrons. There are ongoing concerns regarding our unhoused neighbors utilizing our rolling stock
for shelters and our staff being ill-equipped to address the social, behavioral, or mental health needs of
our patrons.
This is an opportunity to create a harmonious approach to those that are in need of resources.
DISCUSSION
Currently RTD Safety and Security is staffed via a multi-million dollar contract with Allied Universal
Security and supplemented by RTD Transit Security Officers and secondary employment police officers
from local jurisdictions, whose collaboration with RTD is secured via inter-governmental agreements with
the Denver Police Department, the City of Arvada, and the Aurora Police Department.
The agency has used Allied Universal Security personnel to fulfill the role of a second qualified crew
members on each commuter rail train, per the Federal Railroad Administration for the Emergency
Preparedness Plan. While the agency has utilized armed security in this way, armed security on each
train is not required per 49 CFR § 239.101, Subpart B- Specific Requirements Emergency Preparedness
Plan.
As of May 11, 2020, as a result of a partnership with the Mental Health Center of Denver (MHCD), the
agency now has one full-time certified rehabilitation practitioner, whose responsibility to contact
passengers in Denver who may need mental health support or medical intervention, as well as follow-up
with individuals to ensure continued support. This joint effort provides support to riders who may not
have access to, or knowledge of, available mental health services.

Packet Pg. 11

1.B.2

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Current budget allocation for safety and security is broken out as follows, 17 million allocated for the
Allied Security Contract for 2019, with an increase to 22 million for 2020 and beyond.
Intergovernmental agreements allocate 5.3 million for off-duty police officers/second employee and 3.8
million for our internal police resources.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the resolution.
2. Reject the resolution. Given current national discussion, the above-mentioned Directors would not
recommend this option.

TO:

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.84% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in July 2020. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflects an
improvement as compared to the same month (July) last year. Lost service for personnel
related reasons follows:
•
•
•
•

July 2020 – 14.68 hours
June 2019 – 149.17 hours
Year to date hours for 2020 – 1566.28 hours
Year to date hours 2019 – 2404.21 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in July were bus bridges and the COVID-19
pandemic and the pandemic service reduction.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.84% of all scheduled hours of service in the month,
it was necessary to cover 0 shifts with RTD operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 0 hours of service being provided by a
“6th day” RTD operator. Additionally, our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev,
covered 0 shifts, or approximately 0 hours of service, with operators working a “6th day”.

Subject:

Approval of Masabi Contract

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: August 5, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: August 18, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves an increase to the contract with RTD’s mobile ticketing vendor, Masabi (contract #16DH050),
to a Not-to-Exceed (NTE) value from $1,450,000 to $9,733,400. Funding for project expenses have
already been approved and are budgeted. Commissions and fees are paid directly from associated sales
in mobile tickets.
This action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Mission-Oriented Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
2020 Strategic Priority #3 – Enhance Current and Future Transportation Methods
2021 Strategic Priority #4 – Increase Ridership and Improve Rider Experience (Implement Account-Based
Ticketing System)
BACKGROUND
Mobile Ticketing Program Success Story
RTD has three mobile app sales channels which allow customers to purchase fare products for bus and
rail; the RTD branded app (launched Nov 2017), Uber app (launched May 2019), and Transit app
(launched Sept 2019). Full fare, senior, individual with disabilities discount, and youth discount 3-hour
pass, day pass, and monthly passes, as well as, LiVE discount 3-hour and day passes are sold in all
three mobile app sales channels. All mobile tickets sold in the Uber app and Transit app cost the same as
they do in the RTD branded mobile app. 13.8% of the fare revenue generated January through March
2020 is from the mobile ticketing sales channel (all 3 apps combined). Since inception, RTD has sold
4,959,081 tickets in the RTD branded app, 60,713 tickets in the Uber app, and 25,359 tickets in the
Transit app for a total of 5,045,153 mobile tickets valued at $31,070,635.75.
The mobile ticketing sales channel has been wildly successful. Sales have exceeded several other sales
channels and fare media offerings. In January 2018, mobile ticketing sales exceeded MyRide stored
value sales, in December 2018,they exceeded paper 10-ride ticket book sales, in December 2019, they
exceeded farebox sales, and in January 2020, they exceeded ticket vending machine sales.

DISCUSSION
Account-Based Fare Collection System
Electronic Fare Operations resources and efforts are focused on launching the new Account-Based Fare
Collection System to replace the current, antiquated card-based fare collection system from Conduent.
The $3.8M grant received from DRCOG, in 2019, will be used to purchase validators in a competitive
procurement. The new Account-Based Fare Collection System will consist of turning on the AccountBased Ticketing (ABT) feature on the existing Masabi mobile ticketing platform and connecting the new
validators to the Masabi mobile ticketing platform. The Account-Based Ticketing feature allows smart
cards and other media (such as a student id or a contactless bank card) to be used as fare media.
Implementation will be conducted in a phased approach.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Account-Based Ticketing (ABT) Contract Amendment / Increase Contract Not-to-Exceed (NTE) Value
Due to the success of the mobile ticketing sales channel resulting in higher than expected sales and
associated commissions/fees, upcoming work on the Account-Based Fare Collection System, and
potential Federal Grant award costs, the team requests an increase in the Masabi contract NTE value
from $1,450,000 to $9,733,400 (an additional $8,283,200).Note – Past fees were covered in the
board-approved budgets and budget amendments for each year.
This new additional NTE amount consists of the following breakdown areas and costs:

Contract Item Description

Estimated Additional Cost

Details

$926,000

Due to higher than expected
demand for mobile ticketing,
sales were higher than projected
and resulted in higher
commissions/fees.

Past Costs
Additional Mobile Ticketing
Commissions/Fees Spent Up to June
2019.

Note - This amount includes
credit/debit card processing
fees.
Future Costs
Estimated Future Mobile Ticketing
Commissions/Fees for the Remainder
of the Contract Term.

$4,624,000

Higher than projected
commission and fees due to the
high demand for mobile ticketing
and an adjustment to the
contract term.
It is in RTD’s best interest to
pay the commissions and fees
for the on-going mobile ticketing
contract, short of discontinuing
the sales channel, which is not
advisable.
Note - This amount includes
credit/debit card processing
fees.

related to the addition of the

Mobile Ticketing Enhancement –
Vendor Portal

$102,000

There will be updates through
2023 to the Masabi platform
including Vendor Portal, which
enables RTD sales outlets to sell
mobile tickets and stored value.
Built into this costs are
implementation costs, licensing
fees, and commission.

AIM Grant Award Costs

$860,400

RTD undertook an application
for the AIM federal grant, which
if awarded will incur a cash
match paid to the FTA from our
mobile ticketing project, and will
also require us to disburse
payments to Masabi and other
vendors for their participation.
This is a one-time cost.

Note: the G Line opened on April 26, 2019 and the Southeast Rail Extension opened on May 17, 2019. Fares were suspended on April 5, 2020 and resumed on July 1, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic
The second quarter 2020 SB154 ratio is 12.1% which is lower than the statutorially required 30% ratio. The low ratio is caused by the absence of fare revenue and reduction of taxes due to COVID.

(1) Variance is due to lower parts, suppliers and purchased transportation.
(2) Variance is due to lower labor, repair parts and purchased transportation.
(3) Variance is due to projects budgeted evenly across year but not yet started.
(4) Variance is due to timing of project expenses not yet incurred, many of which are grant-funded.
(5) Variance is due to lower outside security services costs.
(6) Variance is due primarily to timing of outside counsel costs related to litigation.
(7) Variance is due to timing of outstide IT services costs for projects.
(8) Variance is due to timing of outside printing costs for schedules, other outside services and special events.
(9) Variance due to purchasing card costs that initially get coded to this cost center until they can be coded to each cost center where they were incurred
(10) Variance due timing of hosting services charges for MinuteTraq.
(11) Variance due to timing of grant fund draws, particularly the Eagle P3 FFGA and preventive maintenance grants typcially drawn late in the year.

POLICY REFERENCE
Investment Policy
DISCUSSION
Please find the District’s investment report for the second quarter of 2020 attached.
The U.S. economy and consumer spending slowed during the second quarter of 2020 as the coronavirus
outbreak caused tremendous human and economic hardships. The U.S. unemployment rate peaked
above 14% during the quarter and then declined to 11.1% by the end of June. The continuation of
social distancing in response to the coronavirus outbreak continued to depress economic activity and
long term interest rates although credit spreads have begun to narrow.
The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee maintained the target range for the federal funds rate to
0.00 to 0.25 percent. The Committee stated that it expects to “maintain this target range until it is
confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum
employment and price stability goals.” This drastic reduction in short term interest rates is now directly

The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance. The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return (yield plus change in market value) on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the
District’s unrestricted portfolio and investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

2nd Quarter

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio for the month of June was 0.52%. Investment income
year to date was $2.9 million.

LiVE Program Update

CFO/AGM,

Board Meeting Date: August 11, 2020
Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program transitioned to
new rules after December 31, 2019.
DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded a
photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two weeks
of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide the
required photo or information are notified by mail.

2.D.3

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of June 30, 2020, 9,831 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 6,084 have been
approved, 3,013 have been denied, 729 are pending and the remaining 5 have been closed for other
reasons. Of the 3,013 denied, 1,665 were denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65
and older which entitles them to a better discount, 461 were denied because their address was out of
District, 65 were denied because it was a duplicate application, 52 were denied because the applicants
were already enrolled, 608 were denied because they did not respond to requests for a photo or
additional information, and 162 were denied because they did not meet the income threshold. Of the
729 pending applications, 680 lack an uploaded photo and 49 are pending for eligibility determination by
a benefits program that would income-qualify the applicant for LiVE.
Approximately 500 applications were approved in July 2020.
The decrease in ridership caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the suspension of fare collection from
April to June 2020 have had a significant impact on the program. The number of approved applications
went from an average of 230 per week in the first two weeks of March to an average of 100 in April,
50 in May and June, and 110 in July.
The 6,084 LiVE participants enrolled as of June 30, 2020, provided a mailing address 1 in the following
counties: Denver 2,979, Arapahoe 1,375, Jefferson 708, Adams 560, Boulder 265, Douglas 69, Weld
24, and Broomfield 23. Note that some counties are only partially in the RTD District. 81 participants
reside in the RTD District but provided a mailing address in a county outside of the District, which is
acceptable under the program rules.
From the implementation of the LiVE program through June 2020, we issued 490 LiVE MyRide cards
that were used for 11,400 trips. 2,240 mobile app users bought 26,500 mobile 3-hour passes and day
passes. Nonprofit organizations bought 121,300 LiVE paper tickets. We do not know how many
individual riders received LiVE tickets from nonprofit organizations since the number of tickets issued to
each client depends on the organization and the client’s situation.
In addition to going live on July 29, 2019, the following actions have been completed:
•
•

LiVE fares are available through RTD’s mobile ticketing application.
LiVE fares are available on LiVE MyRide smart cards. The cards can be ordered through the
MyRide portal and have been made available for purchase at RTD sales outlets as well as
King Soopers and Safeway stores.

The team has identified requirements for PEAK enhancements related to the LiVE
application and application processing.
Negotiated the scope for enhancements to the LiVE application and application processing
in PEAK with the State’s software vendor. These enhancements will include revised
verbiage in the LiVE application based on feedback. Due to the pandemic’s impacts on the
RTD budget, this project was put on hold.
RTD kicked off a broader marketing campaign about all fare discounts, including LiVE,
starting with in-vehicle advertising and social media posts. In June, RTD issued social
media posts for each fare discount. We also included information about the fare discounts
in the communications and outreach related to resuming front door boarding and fare
collection on July 1.
We worked with Denver Human Services to adjust procedures due to the COVID-19

situation. The LiVE eligibility technicians are processing applications and provide customer
service remotely while the Denver Human Services offices are closed to the public. In
addition to the online application on PEAK, interested individuals have the option of
applying by phone, at least until the offices re-open.
Executed an amendment to the intergovernmental agreement with the City and County of
Denver to add the services of an Outreach Coordinator at Denver Human Services. The
person in this new position will assist eligible riders who face barriers to completing a LiVE
application. We plan to offer this service at rotating locations throughout the District, for
example in homeless shelters.

RTD is working with the State’s software vendor and Denver Human Services to work out
remaining “bugs” from the initial implementation in PEAK.
RTD is evaluating next activities for the marketing campaign about the discounts offered
by RTD, in accordance with the LiVE/All Discounts Communications Plan.
Creation of new LiVE informational materials based on feedback by customers, Denver
Human Services, and community-based organizations. This includes a comprehensive
questions & answers document and short videos with basic information, how to apply,
and how to use the program. The videos are almost completed and will be launched later
this month.

discounted tickets for these individuals.
Work with the City and County of Denver to add the services of an application outreach
worker who will help individuals apply for the LiVE Program at partner locations
throughout the District.
