BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Paul J. Ballard, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: June 2, 2020

From:

Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations

GM

Date:

June 1, 2020

Board Meeting Date: June 9, 2020

Subject:

Award of “Group 30” Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with First Transit for the
provision of contracted “Group 30” fixed-route transit services. This contract is for three years,
with two one-year options for a total of 5-years. The initial 3-year contract amount for service is
$50,694,345; the option year 1 amount is $18,203,287; and the option year 2 amount is
$18,886,381. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for service is $87,784,013. In addition, RTD
will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be $4,882,393 for the
initial 3-year contract term; $1,710,599 for option year 1; and $1,745,170 for option year 2. The
total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for fuel is $8,338,162. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for
the contracted fixed route transit service and fuel is $96,122,176.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND:
Originally mandated in 1988 by Senate Bill 88-164 and revised by other legislative activities over the
years, RTD is obligated to “implement a system under which up to fifty-eight percent of the district’s
vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses pursuant to competitively negotiated
contracts.” RTD currently outsources approximately 45% of its fixed-route service, 100% of its
ADA paratransit service (Access-a-Ride), and 100% of its general public on-demand service (Flex
Ride, formerly known as Call-n-Ride). The total amount of vehicular service currently contracted out
is close to 56%.
On January 27, 2020, a Request for Proposals (RFP) 120-FH-001 named “Group 30” was issued
soliciting proposals for the provision of fixed-route transit services. The “Group 30” service package
replaces “Group 26”, which will expire in 2021. The service package consists of 74 buses operating 18
routes providing approximately 191,311 revenue hours per year. A summary of the routes included in
“Group 30” is included as Attachment A. Responses to the Request for Proposals were due on April 3,
2020. Proposers were required to provide detailed operating plans for providing fixed-route service,
including hiring and training employees, maintaining RTD-provided transit vehicles, and conforming to

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

RTD operating requirements. The contract award was anticipated to be awarded on a fixed-price basis
and based on “best value” competitive proposal procedures.
DISCUSSION:
This recommendation represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to
Request for Proposals (RFP) 120-FH-001 to provide “Group 30” Public Transportation Services. The
contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective on January 10, 2021.
PROCUREMENT:
Three (3) proposals were received from First Transit, Transdev and National Express Transit in response
to RFP 120-FH-001 for the Provision of “Group 30” Public Transportation Services. All proposals were
evaluated on the following evaluative criteria:
a) understanding/approach and organization for
implementation (35%); b) experience/qualifications and safety record (30%); c) price (30%); and d) SBE
plan and goal attainment (5%).
The technical evaluation team reviewed and scored each proposal based on a) understanding/approach
and organization for implementation and b) experience/qualifications and safety record. The technical
evaluation team consisted of Greg Smith, Deputy Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations; Erin
Vallejos, Manager, Competitive Services; Dave Ober, Assistant General Superintendent, Maintenance;
Corey Inman, Assistant Manager, Bus Operator Training; Niconor Garcia, Technician, Contracted
Services.
The SBE plan and goal attainment was reviewed and scored by Alexis Serrano Castro, Manager, Small
Business Office and Jose Chirinos, Compliance Officer, SBO.
The proposal pricing was reviewed and scored by the Procurement Department staff.
“GROUP 30” PROPOSALS:
First Transit - The following is a summary of the strong points of the First Transit “Group 30” proposal
which support the recommendation of contract award to First Transit:
Facility. Located at 811 South Sherman St, Unit D, Longmont, CO 80501, this facility is centrally
located within the “Group 30” service area. The facility is fully functional and its location does not
require any increases in diesel fuel use or increased travel times to get to bus route terminals. In
addition to this facility being fully functional, many improvements will be implemented to expand inhouse training and maintenance capability, enhance security and lot functionality, and to meet ADA
accessibility requirements for the building. There will be no disruption of service or added start-up
costs when transitioning from the previous “Group 26” service to the new “Group 30” contract.
Bus Operator Wages. First Transit’s proposal provides an increase in bus operator wages. The bus
operator starting wage will increase from $19.19/hour to $19.91/hour (RTD starting wage for
operators will be $20.58/hour). Adjustments were also proposed for other operator wage levels.
RTD, as well as our contractors, have faced long-term challenges with recruiting and retaining
qualified operators. The proposed wage increases will provide First Transit the opportunity to offer a
more attractive wage package which will improve recruitment and retention of operators and result in
improved service for our passengers.

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

Mechanic Wages. First Transit’s proposal provides an increase in mechanic wages. The First Transit C
level mechanic wage will increase from $22.26/hour to $23.15/hour (RTD starting wage for an entry
level mechanic will be $26.08/hour). Adjustments were also proposed for other mechanic wage levels.
The proposed wage increases will provide First Transit the opportunity to offer a more attractive wage
package which will improve recruitment and retention of mechanics.
Dedicated First Transit Recruiter. This full-time position will be solely focused on the recruitment of bus
operators and maintenance personnel for the First Transit locations.
Enhanced Quality Control. First Transit will track all performance metrics captured through FirstBase,
GeoTab, and DriveCam, along with on-the-road coaching through street supervision staff, to monitor,
maintain and, if necessary, improve performance under all RTD Board of Director adopted performance
measures.
Maintenance Program. First Transit will implement Geotab technology on all buses, enabling effective
predictive analysis of the fleet to identify and eliminate repetitive repairs. Customized training programs
are developed for each technician by Cengage Learning through comprehensive online skills
assessments. During the term of the “Group 30” contract First Transit has committed to obtaining an
Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) shop certification and the shop is currently Silver LEAN certified.
First Transit has also committed to completing many outstanding Component Change Outs by the end of
June 2020.
Proposed Management Team. Under this team’s leadership, the First Transit division consistently
meets/exceeds most of the RTD quarterly performance goals. The team has developed and nurtured
positive and productive relationships with surrounding governments and communities. The team has
long-term experience providing service for RTD and there will be no disruption of service when
transitioning from the previous “Group 26” contract to the new “Group 30” contract.

Experience of Firm. First Transit has been providing RTD service for over 30 years and in other locations
for over 65 years. The company currently has over 335 contracts throughout the United States, Canada
and Puerto Rico. The local operation is supported by a number of experienced professionals at the
Regional level.
SBE goal set at 5%. First Transit’s proposed SBE plan meets the 5% goal.
The technical evaluation team requested further clarification on a few items which were adequately
addressed by First Transit.
Transdev - The following is a summary of the Transdev “Group 30” proposal that does not support the
recommendation of contract award to Transdev:
Facility. Located at 811 South Sherman St, Unit D, Longmont, CO 80501, this facility is centrally
located within the “Group 30” service area. The facility is fully functional and its location does not
require any increases in diesel fuel use or increased travel times to get to bus route terminals; however,
a detailed plan on how Transdev would be fully operational within the facility on the service start date
was not provided.
Start-up. Transdev proposed a start-up facility located at 21 South Sunset Street, Longmont, CO
80501 but did not provide a comprehensive explanation of when the facility is available, any
modifications or changes that need to be made, capacity for training operators and other staff, capacity
for sorting buses and other required vehicles or location for maintenance of training buses.
Management Team. The proposed Transdev local management team did not meet the minimum
qualification requirements set forth in the “Group 30” RFP.
Cost. Transdev’s proposed price has an additional $5,127,735 in costs, this included $3,200,407 in
additional management fees.
The technical evaluation team requested further clarification on a few items which were not all
adequately addressed by Transdev. For this reason and the others noted above, the technical evaluation
team determined that it was not in the best interest of RTD to pursue any further action with the
Transdev “Group 30” proposal.
National Express - The following is a summary of the National Express “Group 30” proposal that does
not support the recommendation of contract award to National Express:
Facility. Located at 811 South Sherman St, Unit D, Longmont, CO 80501, this facility is centrally
located within the “Group 30” service area. The facility is fully functional and its location does not
require any increases in diesel fuel use or increased travel times to get to bus route terminals; however,
a detailed plan on how National Express would be fully operational within the facility on the service start
date was not provided.

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.1

Start-up. No facility was proposed for the necessary start-up and transition activities nor was a detailed
timeline provided.
Management Team. The proposed National Express local management team did not meet the minimum
qualification requirements set forth in the “Group 30” RFP.
Cost. National Express’ proposed price has an additional $14,667,251 in costs, this included
$3,348,477 in additional management fees.
For the reasons noted above, the technical evaluation team determined that it was not in the best
interest of RTD to pursue any further action with the National Express “Group 30” proposal.

Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 Miles: First Transit utilizes bus operator monitoring
technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators. They emphasize safety with all
employees at monthly safety meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their
facilities.

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.1

Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 Miles: First Transit raises awareness of passenger safety through
campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles. Both
of the passenger accidents that occurred in 2019 were classified as non-preventable.
On-Time Preventive Maintenance Inspections: First Transit places a high emphasis on completing
preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local operation is diligent about
completing these inspections on time.
On-Time Performance: First Transit understands the impact new operators, construction detours, and
traffic can have on OTP. Over the course of operating this service package, First Transit worked in
conjunction with RTD Service Planning and Scheduling to improve OTP. They identified low performing
routes and assigned street supervisors to campaign the routes and to meet with operators to discuss
factors that impact their ability to run on time. Schedule issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning
and Scheduling for review.
Miles Between Lost Service Road Calls: First Transit did not meet the goal in 2019 or the 1st quarter of
2020. First Transit Longmont did however meet the goal for Miles Between Lost Service Maintenance
Road Calls with approximately 37,000 miles in both April and May 2020. In addition to continuing to
address deficiencies identified in First Transit Longmont’s Preventive Maintenance Inspection (PMI) and
Quality Control (QC) practices, an expanded maintenance action plan was implemented during the 1st
quarter to further address all issues. First Transit has since improved Preventive Maintenance Inspection
adherence to 100%, reduced repeat maintenance occurrences by 29% and reduced overdue Component
Change Outs by 72%.
Competitive Services staff will continue to monitor the contractor operations and work closely with local
and corporate management teams to ensure this goal is being addressed by completing preventive
maintenance inspections on-time, working off defects in a timely manner, monitoring repeat issues,
providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a pro-active approach to maintaining the buses in
their fleet.
Operator Complaints per Boarding: First Transit continues to investigate and address customer
complaints with operators and take other remedial actions to reduce the number of customer complaints.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
RTD Competitive Services Internal Cost Estimate:
This estimate was prepared by the Competitive Services Department to anticipate the amount RTD
could expect to pay to outsource the “Group 30” service package to a contract operator. Due to
continued labor challenges, RTD anticipated proposers would implement a competitive wage
structure that was in line with the local labor market as well as an increase for inflation.
Additionally, RTD factored in increases in maintenance costs associated with the aging fleet and
additional parts and support equipment for the diesel exhaust fluid after treatment systems required
on replacement buses during the term of the contract. RTD Competitive Services total five-year
estimate for the “Group 30” service package was $89,318,914.
First Transit’s proposed total five-year price was $87,784,013. First Transit’s price proposal
included increases in inflation, CBA agreed upon Operator and Mechanic wage increases to address
differences between RTD and First Transit wages, and maintenance costs associated with the aging

Transdev’s proposed five-year price was $92,911,748.
Transdev’s price proposal included
significantly higher costs associated with maintenance and management fees. RTD requested that
Transdev provide a Best and Final Offer and they declined to reconsider their proposal. Transdev’s
price proposal was not considered further since their proposed price was significantly higher than
RTD would expect to pay for the “Group 30” service package.
National Express’s proposed five-year price was $102,451,264. National Express’s price proposal
included significantly higher costs associated with supervisory, staff and operator wages, general
overhead and management fees. National Express’s price proposal was not considered further since
their proposed price was significantly higher than RTD would expect to pay for the “Group 30”
service package.

RTD Cost Model:
The Cost Model estimate was prepared by the RTD Finance Department to estimate the cost for RTD
to operate the “Group 30” service package in house rather than outsource to a qualified contract
provider.
The RTD internal financial analysis (Attachment B) indicates that the five-year estimated cost for RTD
to provide these services would be $94,665,856, which is $6,881,843 higher than the five-year
cost proposed by First Transit. The RTD Cost Model Estimate is based on current and projected
wage rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience providing other fixedroute services. In addition to estimating the cost for RTD to provide the services included in the
“Group 30” service package, the cost of providing a facility to serve as the operating and
maintenance base for the provision of the services is also included in the estimated cost of RTD
operation. RTD currently does not have the capacity to provide these additional services without
building or leasing additional facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance base for the

provision of the services.
The First Transit total five-year proposed price represents a $6,881,843 (7%) savings over the
estimated cost for RTD to provide the service. Please see the “Group 30” - Proposer Service Cost

Q1 2020 Performance Measures

INFORMATION
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
The Performance Report is presented for Board review each quarter according to Fiscal Policy Statement,
Budget Policy 10. These year-to-date measures provide a framework in which RTD determines how well
it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within its mission statement
objectives.
DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the First Quarter of 2020. Of the 42 performance measures
tracked for the GM, RTD met 33 of the goals (78.6%) in the first quarter. The following is a review of
the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – Maintain system-wide on time performance
Light Rail on-time service of 89.8% was slightly below goal of 90.0% and has improved from year-end
2019. A number of factors accounted for this such as traffic signal sequencing, large events, incidents,
etc., as well as the inability to maintain adequate operator levels.
Goal 3.2 – Maintain system-wide service availability
Light Rail service availability of 91.6% was below goal of 99.0% and has declined from year-end 2019.
Service availability is directly related to the train operator shortage.
Goal 5.1 – Improve ADA On-Time Performance
ADA OTP of 85.9% was slightly below goal of 86.0% and has improved from year-end 2019. The
deficiency was caused by a combination of operator shortage, a high rate of operators on FMLA, and the
increasing number of trips requested during peak travel hours along with software limitations of current
software to smooth the demand.
Goal 6.2 – Increase in Ridership
First quarter ridership for 2020 was down 5.3% from same time in 2019. The decline is centered in bus
service and mirrors the national trend. This goal is an annual measure and we will continue to monitor.

Packet Pg. 14

1.C.1

Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
First quarter fare revenue and total operating revenue were down 2.6% and 1.3%, respectively, from
same time in 2019. These goals for 2020 are annual measures based on the 2020 budget.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
Bus operator vacancies, bus mechanic vacancies, and light rail operator vacancies exceeded their goals
in the first quarter due to attrition, retirements, system growth, and full employment in the strong local
economy. Compared to year-end 2019, light rail operator and bus mechanics vacancies are lower, while
bus operator vacancies are higher.

Access-a-Ride Pilot with Uber of On-Demand Solutions
Collaborative Program Goals: Improve rider experience through faster response times by
providing on-demand same-day trips to paratransit customers that are booked by riders through
the Uber app. Decreased cost per trip for both the customer and RTD during peak service hours
while also providing transportation options to paratransit customers.
Specifically, the pilot will test whether improved response times for same-day travel and low fares,
(same as Access-a-Cab), which are provided during peak travel hours will draw more customers
to this lower-cost alternative for both the customer and RTD.

Pilot Service Area: Area will initially be confined to the following zip codes of 80013, 80014,
80015, and 80016. This would allow for trips into, out of, or wholly within this boundary. After
initial set up of the program, and provided several months of ridership demand, Access-a-Ride
will reassess to determine if the pilot test boundary should be increased.
Pilot Sign-up: Any Access-a-Ride customer is eligible to participate in the Uber pilot, but must
first contact the Access-a-Ride eligibility department to verify their status as a current Access-aRide customer prior to pilot participation.
Duration: The Pilot will last for up to 12 months.
Marketing: RTD will broadcast through multiple media pushed to and seen by Access-a-Ride
customers including onboard advertising; mailers; email; phone hold messaging; and to advisory
and advocacy groups. Once RTD has conducted initial outreach, we will add content to the AaR
portion of the RTD website. RTD will work with Uber marketing staff and our in-house
communications staff to assure content is vetted prior to deploying directly to customers or
indirectly through media or the web.
Cost: Customers would pay the same fare of $2.00 as the Access-a-Cab program. The subsidy
provided would be increased to a maximum of $20.00/trip instead of $12.00 and only be provided
during peak travel hours. Unlike the current AaC program, this pilot will focus on shifting trips
from the most expensive peak travel period which requires increased vehicle and driver capacity
while providing a service delivery alternative which costs less than half the amount if provided by
our larger AaR vehicles.
KPI tracking: We will track multiple Key Performance Indicators including trip distance and
duration, subsidy per trip, average wait time and unique riders. This information is available
through a “dashboard” which is in the included Uber Transit Profiles Product Overview. The
aggregated data will be available to assess pilot outcomes for any period, (day, week longer), as
part of the post-program review in determining whether Transportation Network Company (TNC)
companies such as Uber offer an affordable solution that our customers will embrace.

The initial launch will provide service like Access-a-Cab for ambulatory trips and wheelchairs used
by transfer customers. The second phase will add RTD vehicles to provide trips to customer
using fixed, (non-folding), wheelchairs to raise the bar by providing response times that are similar
for all customers regardless of their mobility device.

FlexRide & Metro Taxi Pilot Project Status
Report

Senior

Manager,

Service

Board Meeting Date: June 9, 2020

Introduction
FlexRide is RTD’s micro-transit service, established in March 2000, which is shared-ride, demand
responsive public transportation provided in defined geographic territories where customers typically
arrange for pick-up and pay local bus fare. Service areas are typically located in a low density suburban
area where bus service is not feasible and uses 14-seat, wheelchair accessible vehicles. Customers can
book trips 10 minutes to 30 days in advance and also subscriptions, and trips are grouped for sharedriding to be productive and cost-effective. Over the years FlexRide has been customized to suit each
community it serves, such as with scheduled connections to rail stations, flex routes, and gathering
stops that customers walk to. In 2010 RTD introduced MobilityDR software to completely automate
booking, scheduling and dispatching; and which also provides customer web/mobile self-booking.
FlexRide has 22 service areas and utilizes 40 vehicles during the peak hours, accommodating
approximately 1,900 average weekday boardings (pre-pandemic).
Goal & objectives
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a new service delivery model that intelligently integrates
FlexRide’s dedicated vehicle fleet with Metro Taxi vehicles and others in the future. In this way,
transportation companies such as taxis and ridehailing companies, can supplement RTD FlexRide
vehicles to accomplish these objectives:
1. Better meet RTD’s customer demand. Some customers’ trips may be denied due to the capacity
constraints of the FlexRide fleet. Instead of denying the trip or adding another fleet vehicle, RTD
could accommodate the trip with a taxi trip.
2. Be more cost-effective for RTD.
During periods of low demand, the few trips can be
accommodated with taxis resulting in a net cost savings from reducing FlexRide fleet service
hours.
Implementation of the Pilot
Each FlexRide service area is configured to meet the community’s particular customer travel patterns
and there are two primary markets—first/last mile and community circulation. RTD has identified
first/last mile service areas with connections to train stations which have few trip requests during offpeak periods, resulting in very low productivity for the FlexRide dedicated vehicles. There is opportunity
for significant cost savings if fleet vehicles that are idle most of the time are discontinued in favor of
placing these FlexRide trips on taxi vehicles charging only the cost per trip.
This pilot will be
implemented for first/last mile FlexRides during the midday hours in the Denver Tech Center (DTC) as

Packet Pg. 36

1.C.3

illustrated in Figure 1. Table 1 provides characteristics of these FlexRides and the pre-pandemic midday
ridership
Service Delivery Approach
With an integrated service delivery approach, passengers would continue to book FlexRide trips on their
smartphone, computer or via phone using the FlexRide MobilityDR scheduling platform. MobilityDR will
be programmed with business rules to decide whether a FlexRide or taxi is most appropriate for a
requested trip and either retain it for FlexRide or send the trip to the Metro Taxi dispatching system’s
interface (API). This offers a simple, seamless approach to the customer. MobilityDR would be
enhanced so that its current passenger notification would also communicate that passenger would be
picked up by a taxi.
Status
RTD and Metro Taxi will do a full end-to-end field test of the technology, including from trip reservation
to taxi assignment in June 2020. Pending necessary bug fixes and refinements, the pilot will get
underway shortly thereafter for 4 months with fleet vehicles still in operation. An evaluation will
determine how many fleet vehicles should be retained to be used thereafter, at least for wheelchairrequired trips. Then other options, such as supplementing peak demand needs can be tested.

that allows us to meet the mobility needs of the region
in an effective, efficient and sustainable manner
Given COVID-19
• The recommended SOP will have a new, lower
fiscal constraint
• The SOP effort is more important than ever to help
prioritize phasing in service
An “unconstrained” SOP is also being developed to
guide us if/when revenues increase

Update: Covid 19 Response - Drivers and Prevention (Larry Buter, RTD)

Driver Retention
Before Covid19 Stay-at-Home Access-a-Ride had approximately 3000 trips, now there are just under 500
trips. 80% of drivers were furloughed. Last week RTD’s carriers/providers brought back 40% of the
furloughed drivers and will increase to a total of 60% of them over the next few weeks. This ensures better
driver retention and allows RTD to:
• Be better positioned to meet demand – With more drivers online RTD can readily meet demand as
businesses slowly reopen. Also, long furloughs increase risks of losing drivers permanently (they go
find other work and do not return), causing a driver-shortages once demand is back to pre-Covid19
ridership.
• Provide better social distancing – More drivers allow for 1 passenger-1 vehicle service, although
sometimes this is not possible; we have more resources/drivers to call on when needed.
The extra drivers are categorized into two groups:
1. Extra Board - They wait at depot and are called out when needed; or
2. Loop Extra - They wait across the district at grocery stores, light rail stations or Park-n-Rides so they
can more quickly be where an extra driver is needed.
Also to ensure driver retention and to provide a needed service in times of lock-down, RTD is providing
food service delivery for eligible Access-a-Ride passengers. RTD is working with King Soopers and Safeway
and food banks.
• Client/“passenger” calls the grocery store or food bank and sets up the order and pick up time,
then calls RTD to schedule when/where to pick-up, and where to deliver food.
• This is a free service, and allows for more than 3 bags.
• Passengers are asked to be home at time of delivery, food will not be left unattended at the door
or on the porch. In unique situations where no one is there to receive the delivery, a second
attempt to deliver the groceries will be made later in the day once dispatch contacts the passenger.

•

Drivers ring/knock on the door and leave bags once a person is acknowledged; for those living on
the second floor or higher, they are asked wait for the driver on the ground floor. If no one answers
the door the driver contacts dispatch to contact the passenger.
So far RTD has had over 136 food delivery trips.
Other agencies across the county are interested in starting similar programs.

Prevention
RTD has been working to out-pace the virus and keep people safe. They are:
• Not transporting those with Covid19;
• Asking passengers and drivers to wear masks;
• Sanitizing all vehicles daily; and
• Where possible social distancing – this is more difficult for Access-a-Ride than for fixed route;
when securing a wheelchair, passengers are asked to face away from the operator securing the
chair.
Questions & Answers
• Question: What personal protection equipment are drivers wearing?
Answer: All drivers are wearing masks, provided gloves, and have spray disinfectant and towels to
disinfect buses after each passenger.
• Question: Have there been procedural changes for pre or post trip?
Answer: Vehicles are disinfected every day and the procedure for securing wheelchairs requests
passengers face the window instead of the operator when the chair is being secured.
• Question: How long will food delivery continue?
Answer: RTD is considering extending the food delivery program beyond Covid19; making the
program permanent requires Board approval.
• Question/Confirmation: All Access-a-Ride trips are currently free, correct? And, when will fares be
reimplemented?
Answer: Yes, they are free right now. Reinstituting fares has been discussed, but no date has been
set. RTD will notify passengers prior to reinstating a fare.
• Question: Is RTD adding new Access-a-Ride passengers at this time?
Answer: RTD never stopped accepting new passengers. The policy in quarantine has been to
provide temporary presumptive unrestricted eligibility until the Easter Seals eligibility review
process is reengaged. Easter Seals review process restarted this week and will slowly start reviews,
one at a time for now.
• Comments: Several members mentioned that the food delivery was an excellent service to provide.

Contractor Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 1st
Quarter 2020

RTD currently provides 45% of its fixed route bus service via four contracted bus divisions currently
operated by First Transit and Transdev. With bus divisions located in Longmont, Denver, Commerce
City and Englewood, our contract partners provide fixed route bus service throughout the RTD District.
The performance for First Transit and Transdev is measured based on the following performance
indicators: Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 miles, Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000
miles, On-Time Preventive Maintenance Inspections, On-Time Performance, Miles Between Lost Service
Road Calls and Operator Complaints per Boarding.
Because of their commitment to excellence, dedicated corporate support and detailed problem solving,
First Transit and Transdev as a group, met all of the Board of Director adopted 2020 key performance
measures through the 1st quarter 2020. In the areas where our contract partners fell slightly short of
their individual goals, they implemented both procedural and staff changes which should result in
continuous improvement into 2020. The following is a more detailed discussion of fixed route
contractor performance through the 1st quarter of 2020.
•

PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles through the 1st quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to
utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of
operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety
meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities and on the
street.

•

PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles
through the 1st quarter. Only one of the seven passenger accidents that occurred during the 1st
quarter was classified non-preventable. First Transit Denver did not meet the goal (0.25)
however, all three of their passenger accidents were classified as non-preventable. All of the bus
operators involved in passenger accidents were provided retraining on the proper procedures for
addressing passenger safety. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness of
passenger safety through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger
accidents per 100,000 miles.

•

ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled through the 1st quarter. Competitive Services staff will
continue to monitor the contractor operations to ensure PMIs are completed on-time.

Packet Pg. 100

1.D.2

•

ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
The contractors, as a group, met the target of 86% Local On-Time Service through the 1st
quarter. First Transit Commerce City (84.8%) did not meet the goal due in part to unexpected
detours and traffic. RTD and the private contractors continue to campaign routes and operators
with low on-time performance with a strong focus on first time point departures. On a monthlybasis, contractors review the OTP report and meet with operators of low performing routes to
discuss factors that are impacting their ability to reach 86% on-time performance. Running time
issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.

•

MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, as a group, exceeded the target of 30,000 Miles Between Lost Service
Maintenance Road Calls through the 1st quarter. First Transit Longmont did not meet the goal
during the 1st quarter. First Transit Longmont did however meet the goal for Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls with approximately 37,000 miles in both April and May 2020. In
addition to continuing to address deficiencies identified in First Transit Longmont’s Preventive
Maintenance Inspection (PMI) and Quality Control (QC) practices, an expanded maintenance
action plan was implemented during the 1st quarter to further address all issues. Competitive
Services staff will continue to monitor the contractor operations and work closely with local and
corporate management teams to ensure this goal is being addressed by completing preventive
maintenance inspections on-time, working off defects in a timely manner, monitoring repeat
issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a pro-active approach to
maintaining the buses in their fleet.

•

OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
Currently, boarding information needed to calculate this statistic is not available. However, the
contractors continue to investigate and address customer complaints with operators. The
contractors utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist operators in improving
customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted above regarding on-time performance should
help address some customer complaints. The contractors also continue to address complaint
trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.
The contractors continue to take a variety of actions over and above contract requirements to
address their operator hiring/retention challenges which include hiring bonuses, wage increases,
incentives to take on additional work, employing a full-time recruiter, and mentoring programs.

Customer Comment Analysis – 1st Quarter
2020

Customer comments through the 1st Quarter of 2020 for both RTD and the private contractors showed
improvement over the same period in 2019. The total number of operator-related comments for the
District as a whole for the 1st Quarter of 2020 was 3,214. The total number for the same period in
2019 was 3,965. Specific customer comment categories showing improvement in 2020 include “Bus
Did Not Show,” “Bus Late,” “Careless Driving/Operator,” “Discourtesy/Operator,” “Discrimination,”
“Fare Dispute,” “Improper Procedure/Operator,” and “Passed Up Passenger At Stop.” The customer
comment categories of “Bus Early,” and “Incorrect Info/Operator” showed increases over 2019. RTD
and the private contractors review customer comments on a daily basis and implement corrective action
as needed to address deficiencies and improve performance.
Recapped below is an analysis of the customer comment trends through the 1st Quarter of 2020. Also
included is a comparison of customer comment data for the same period in 2019.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer comments on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer comments using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the comment is not supported by factual data. Some of the
reasons for the “Not Valid” classification include the following:
• Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
• Operator followed proper procedure
• Passenger presented insufficient fare
• Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
• Passenger presented an expired transfer
• Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
• Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
• There was no video evidence to support the comment
RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer comments.
•

•

Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator, running time of the route, or
other circumstances such as construction and detours.
Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.

Packet Pg. 105

1.D.3

•

RTD conducts refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado Cross Disability Coalition,
Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis, DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force, RTD Advisory
Committee for People with Disabilities-ACPD) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service
for passengers with disabilities.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Operating Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
Trends in customer service challenges are also addressed through bulletins, campaigns, and other
communications to ensure that RTD and Contractor employees are aware of our customers’
concerns.

Historically, and in 2020, the following comment categories generated the highest number of customer
comments:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop

All of these comment categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
comment numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high comment categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and external,
that are impacting the number of comments. The input received from both RTD and private contractor
operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 1st Quarter 2020: Comments in this category significantly decreased by 42.3%
compared to the same period in 2019. “Flashbacks” for “bus did not show” comments often show
buses running late. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 2.30 comments per day. The
comparable number for 2019 was 4.02 comments per day.
Bus Early – 1st Quarter 2020: Comments in this category increased 1.8% compared to the same period
in 2019. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” comments often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The

Packet Pg. 106

1.D.3

YTD average in this category for 2020 is 4.30 comments per day. The comparable number for 2019
was 4.27 comments per day.
Bus Late – 1st Quarter 2020: Comments in this category significantly decreased 41.0% compared to
the same period in 2019. Improving on-time performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of
reasons including construction, traffic and heavy ridership delays. Running time issues are continually
reviewed by RTD Service Planning and Scheduling. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 3.90
comments per day. The comparable number for 2019 was 6.69 comments per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 1st Quarter 2020: Comments in this category decreased 16.8% compared
to the same period in 2019. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride
checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In
addition, RTD and the private contractors have “G-Force Activated” event-recording systems (Drive
Cam, Smart Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators
continue to be counseled and retrained, as needed, to improve driving performance. Also, periodic
safety campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for
2020 is 2.84 comments per day. The comparable number for 2019 was 3.44 comments per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 1st Quarter 2020: Comments in this category decreased 13.0% compared to
the same period in 2019. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined appropriately if video evidence confirms that
they treated passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions
for handling similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 7.80
comments per day. The comparable number for 2019 was 9.07 comments per day.
Discrimination – 1st Quarter 2020: Comments in this category decreased 9.5% compared to the same
period in 2019. Investigation into discrimination-related comments usually shows the operator not at
fault. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 0.21 comments per day. The comparable number
for 2019 was 0.23 comments per day.
Fare Dispute – 1st Quarter 2020: Comments in this category decreased 3.5% compared to the same
period in 2019. Investigations into “fare dispute” comments often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The
YTD average in this category for 2020 is 0.91 comments per day. The comparable number for 2019
was 0.96 comments per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 1st Quarter 2020: Comments in this category significantly decreased
28.5% compared to the same period in 2019. RTD and private contractor training and operations
personnel meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date
information. In addition, the on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly
safety meetings held at the private contractor divisions provide operators with information about
accommodating the needs of RTD passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video
evidence shows operators are not following proper procedures, appropriate coaching activities are taken.
The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 3.98 comments per day. The comparable number for
2019 was 5.62 comments per day.

Packet Pg. 107

1.D.3

Incorrect Info/Operator – 1st Quarter 2020: Comments in this category increased by 9.1% compared to
the same period in 2019. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation,
Operations Managers, the Bus Operator Training teams, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to
provide operators with up-to-date information to answer customer questions and address customer
concerns. Although RTD and the private contractors have seen an influx of new operators, their impact
on this category is minimal, thanks to annual refresher training, assistance from Street Supervisors and
trainers, and improved communication. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 0.40 comments
per day. The comparable number for 2019 was 0.37 comments per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 1st Quarter 2020: Comments in this category decreased 6.4%
compared to the same period in 2019. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these comments will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop as the bus
passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting
directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” comments from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
comments (43 of the total 791 = 5.43%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjusted, as needed, as resources will
allow. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 8.69 comments per day. The comparable number
for 2019 was 9.39 comments per day.

FlexRide Quarterly Report – 1st Quarter 2020

RTD’s FlexRide services are currently operated by Via Mobility, MV Transit and the Seniors’ Resource
Center. With FlexRide bus divisions located in Boulder, Denver and Evergreen, our contract partners
provide FlexRide services to 23 distinct service areas throughout the RTD District. The performance for
Via Mobility, MV Transit and Senior’s Resource Center is measured based upon Ridership, Customer
Contacts, Preventable Vehicle Accidents and Productivity (boardings per service hour).
Customer contacts received were about the same when compared with the same period in 2019, and
overall for 2020. Preventable Vehicle Accidents decreased during the quarter. Our contract partners
continued to experience a decrease in ridership during this period and the year. FlexRide staff continues
to monitor low performing FlexRide services to help increase ridership and productivity. The following is
a more detailed discussion of the FlexRide contractor performance through the 1st quarter of 2020.

Ridership
FlexRide ridership for the first quarter for 2020 was down in comparison to the same quarter in 2019.
Boardings in 2019 were 114,295 and 2020 were 103,231. Contributing to the decrease in ridership
included the impact of low fuel prices, which gives customers a low-cost alternative to using the
FlexRide service and the early stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic in March.

Customer Contacts
FlexRide experienced a small decrease in overall customer contacts in the first quarter for 2020 when
compared to 2019.
Customer contacts are reviewed on a daily basis. Those contacts that are considered operator related
(within the operator’s control) are monitored for trends and improvement.

At Fault contacts decreased by one when comparing quarters. The number of all other customer
contacts received regarding FlexRide service (requests for new service or a change in service which can
include boundary changes, service day and hours, web site issues, no return calls, etc.) are as follows:
2020: 101
2019: 102

Preventable Accidents
The preventable accident rate for the first quarter dropped compared to 2019.
Contractors have
continued to retrain operators identified as being involved in accidents and have increased the number of
“ride-alongs” performed by operations specialists and training staff.
Turnover has been high due to a
great job market resulting in new operators in the field. RTD Safety and Training Compliance Officer has
been working with contractors and researching additional defensive driving refresher courses.
2020: 6
Preventable Vehicle Accidents: 1.72 per 100,000 miles
2019: 9
Preventable Vehicle Accidents: 4.02 per 100,000 miles

Productivity
A number of FlexRide areas continued to remain productive during the first two months of the quarter.
Many of the FlexRides that serve business parks and mixed residential areas that connect with the light
rail (Arapahoe, Dry Creek, Meridian, North Inverness, South Inverness and South Jeffco) or communities
where residents utilize the service (Golden and Longmont) were doing meeting productivity. COVID
started having an effect on ridership in March. The attached 2020 Special Services 1st Quarter Report
provides the productivity numbers for each of the FlexRides and some other special services for which
RTD provides cost-share funding. The acceptable level of productivity for FlexRide service continues to
be 3.0 boardings per hour.

Contractor Drug and Alcohol Compliance

In compliance with the Recommendation included in the Performance Audit of the RTD conducted in
2015 on behalf of the State of Colorado, the following is a summary of the monitoring activities
completed by RTD Drug & Alcohol compliance personnel through the 1st Quarter of 2020:
Number of files reviewed:

85

Percentage of records in compliance with requirements:

95.3%

These statistics represent the verification of records reviewed for the private contractor operations for a
portion of the quarter. Generally, these numbers are much greater, but due to Covid-19, RTD has
suspended all in-person meetings-which are required for physical review of the files. Scheduled visits for
the contractors are going to resume once RTD allows in-person meetings and when deemed safe to do
so.

Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection on-board
buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then to
issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the actual
number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers from
month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security-related incidents.

TO:

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.88% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in May 2020. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflects an
improvement as compared to the same month (May) last year. Lost service for personnel
related reasons follows:
•
•
•
•

May 2020 – 12.24 hours
May 2019 – 160.17 hours
Year to date hours for 2020 – 1543.99 hours
Year to date hours 2019 – 2064.92 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in May were bus bridges and the COVID-19
pandemic and the pandemic service reduction.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.88% of all scheduled hours of service in the month,
it was necessary to cover 0 shifts with RTD operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 0 hours of service being provided by a
“6th day” RTD operator. Additionally, our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev,
covered 0 shifts, or approximately 0 hours of service, with operators working a “6th day”.
