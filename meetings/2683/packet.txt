Local Government Relations Update

Below is our update for December 5:

1. Transportation Funding Initiative Update - A coalition of business interests, elected
officials, transportation and multi-modal advocates and industry representatives continue
to meet to discuss future transportation/transit needs and assess the viability of a
statewide funding initiative. The Metro Mayors Caucus has taken a “go big or go home”
position and support a 1% sale tax increase, while other entities have indicated a
preference for a smaller sales tax increase and different funding mechanisms. There is
general agreement new funding would be distributed 45% to CDOT, 15% to a new
multimodal transportation options fund and 45% to cities and counties (split evenly).
Although state funds would not directly flow to RTD, several working assumptions are
favorable to the District: (1) RTD would be eligible to apply for mobility funds, and (2)
local funds would be fully flexible allowing local jurisdictions to partner with RTD to
advance projects. The Coalition is undertaking additional research over the next few
weeks and continues to discuss options with stakeholders around the state.
2. Citizens Advisory Committee – The Citizens Advisory Committee met before
Thanksgiving and expressed their appreciation for the opportunity to discuss current
focus areas and issues with many of you at the roundtable dinner in October. As a follow
up, I will be working with each of you to schedule individual meetings, after the first of
the year, with two CAC members to talk about specific ways they can support you in
your director districts. The Committee is also working closely with the senior leadership
and public engagement team to identify additional areas to engage.

Re:

December Board Update

RTD General Manager Genova, Board Chair Hoy, and RTD Executive Staff presented to the Transportation
Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) in early November with an update on the District’s activities. The
presentation was very well received by members.
BBMK and RTD Senior staff continue to meet with legislators on a variety of subjects to date we have met
•

Rep. Lebsock
Rep. Weissman
Rep. Bridges
Speaker Duran
Rep. Gray
Rep. Winter
Rep Beckman
Senator Moreno

We have future meetings scheduled with Reps. Kraft Tharp, Winter, Covarrubias, Neville, Wist and Senator
Martinez Humenik.
BBMK, RTD Executive Staff and Michael Washington continue to have conversations with the proponents
of legislation to implement a low-income transit fare reduction pilot program to update these
organizations (CFI and 9-5) about the efforts of the working pass group. BBMK and Senator Moreno met
with RTD Executive Staff and Michael Washington to provide an update on the pass working group.
Senator Moreno appreciated the update and our continued outreach.
BBMK continues to meet on behalf of RTD with the lobbyists and lawyers for SCFD and the Special Districts
Association on potential legislative options to address the drafting error in 267.
BBMK is monitoring legislation to re-work the 811 one call system for any potential impacts on the District.
The Department of Health Care Policy and Financing is exploring working with RTD on a possible
discounted fare for members with a disability and seniors that are current participants in the Medicaid
Non-Emergency Medical Transportation Program. BBMK forwarded the information to RTD for review
and feedback.

What is the state of play
on transportation issues in Washington?
• FY 2018 Appropriations:

• Funding through December 8: FY 2018 began October 1. Federal

government agencies and programs are operating under a short-term
spending bill that expires on December 8.

• Fiscal Year 2018 Transportation/HUD Appropriations Bill:

• Controls funding for New Starts projects, TIGER program.

• Under the CR: short-term extension of FY 2017 levels for transit

formula programs under FAST Act; no discretionary grants.

• A big infrastructure bill in early 2018 after tax reform?

• Maybe. Competing priorities: Welfare reform, healthcare revisited.

• US DOT:

• Focused on regulatory streamlining, autonomous vehicles.

• White House, not US DOT, leading on infrastructure initiative.

FY 2018 Appropriations Outlook

• Deadline: Congress must pass another spending bill before December 8
deadline; likely another short-term extension until late December/early
January.

• Another CR: One or more short-term bills will provide additional time for
Congress to pass tax reform before turning to a full-year omnibus bill.
• Transportation spending levels:

• House and Senate 2018 THUD bills both fully fund transit and highway

formula programs at their FY 2018 FAST Act levels.

• TIGER funding: House $0; Senate $550 million. (Administration

requested $0.)

• New Starts funding: House $1.75 billion; Senate $2.13 billion.

(Administration requested $1.23 billion.)

• All below FY 2017 level ($2.41 B) and FY 2018 FAST Act-

authorized level ($2.3 B).

What does this mean for New Starts funding
for the Eagle P3 project?

• House and Senate bills would fully fund our Eagle P3 funding request:
• RTD’s FY 2018 request:
• $63.3 million

• President’s FY 2018 budget request:
• $63.3 million

• Pending House and Senate FY 2018 THUD appropriations bills: Both

fund the Eagle P3 project at $63.3 million.

• Must await a full-year spending bill: US DOT will not award grants under

discretionary programs (programs in the control of the Appropriators) in
the absence of a full-year spending bill.

• Bottom Line: Likely that no FY 2018 New Starts funding will be awarded

until after a full-year omnibus spending bill is enacted.

Opportunities in an Infrastructure Bill
• Long-sought Highway Trust Fund revenue solution?

• Closing the gap between spending levels and dedicated HTF revenues

seen as “unfinished business” after FAST Act.

• Still broad bipartisan Congressional support: June letter from 253

House Members seeking long-term revenue solution in tax reform.

• But surface transportation funding is not a must-pass bill:

• FAST Act funds surface transportation programs through 2020.

• Other Trump/Congressional priorities: healthcare, tax reform, trade.

• Competing transportation priorities in FY 2018: FAA reauthorization,

autonomous vehicles.

• Same politically difficult revenue options: taxes on gasoline, oil and gas

production, vehicle-miles traveled.

Infrastructure and Tax Reform
• Congress’ current focus is tax reform:

• House passed its tax reform bill on November 16; Senate passed its bill on

December 2.

• House and Senate will vote on a final tax bill before the end of the calendar year.

• Early hope was tax reform could serve as a vehicle for a Highway Trust Fund

revenue solution or at least a one-time funding boost, neither of which are
included in the House or Senate tax bills.
• Republicans using tax reform to lower rates, not for new spending.

• Yet the gas tax debate continues:

• White House advisor Gary Cohn recently floated the idea of a gas tax increase

to the bipartisan congressional Problems Solvers Caucus.

• Senator Schumer recently voiced opposition to a gas tax increase as a

regressive tax; favors use of one-time repatriated revenues.

• Now playing defense: fighting to keep favorable infrastructure-related tax

provisions: private activity bonds, advance refundings, commuter benefits.

Trump’s Infrastructure Proposal

• Still much speculation and few specifics.

• Timing: Early 2018 after tax reform? Congress likely must vote on a bill by

May; thereafter the window for moving a bill starts to close, due to elections.

• Funding and Finance: Trump’s original proposal still stands: leverage $200

billion in Federal funding to attract a total of $1 trillion in infrastructure
investment.
• Financed through “both public and private capital.”

• Recent Trump statement that P3s are “more trouble than they’re worth.”

• Regulatory Reform: reducing or eliminating burdensome regulations to cut

red tape and advance project approvals more quickly.

• Secretary Chao asserts regulatory red tape is a bigger hurdle to project

advancement than lack of funding.

• Transportation stakeholders are not giving up on a HTF revenue solution; if

not in tax reform, then here.

Changes in transit programs?

• Authorizers reluctant to revisit carefully-crafted compromises in the
FAST Act.

• Authorizers want any additional Federal funding to be distributed

via FAST Act formula programs, in place through FY 2020.

• Republican-led Congress rejected Trump Administration proposals
to zero-out TIGER and new CIG funding in FY 2018 THUD bills.

• Where change is likely is in regulatory reform:

• WH Council on Environmental Quality focused on streamlining and

reducing permitting requirements on infrastructure projects.

• US DOT pulled back two-man crew rulemaking and sleep apnea

rulemaking for FRA-regulated operators.

• US DOT eliminated local hire pilot program for highway and transit

projects.

squirepattonboggs.com

• Strong support for Buy America requirements government-wide.
