Approval of the
Evaluation (APE)

2015

Annual

Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the
2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The APE provides a comprehensive financial blueprint for all
FasTracks capital projects completed, underway or planned through the year 2019.
BACKGROUND
RTD has been conducting an Annual Program Evaluation since 2007. Given the challenges of managing
a multi-billion dollar capital program, it is desirable to perform a complete analysis of the cost of the
program. The APE captures all project expenditures to date and all planned expenditures through the
year 2019 on a project-by-project basis. It essentially provides a baseline capital budget for boardapproved projects currently underway or planned in the near future.
Since so many of the FasTracks projects are now in construction, the major effort has shifted from
developing accurate estimates of costs to one of managing the projects within the Board-approved
budgets for those projects. The staff provides the Board with regular updates on the FasTracks projects
throughout the year.
On July 14, staff provided an update on the 2015 APE to the FasTracks Monitoring Committee with the
intention of bringing it to the Board at a later date for approval. There have been no changes to the
project information since that presentation. However, at that meeting, the Board requested additional
detail on the miscellaneous projects included in the FasTracks program. The July 14 presentation and
the additional requested detail are attached.
DISCUSSION
The project-by-project cost along with the amount spent through 2014 is shown in the attached
presentation. The total FasTracks budget through 2019 is approximately $5.6 billion, and approximately
$3.6 billion of this total was spent through the end of 2014.
Since most of the funded FasTracks projects are complete or under construction and are being managed
within the Board approved budgets, the changes to this APE are relatively small. The changes primarily
reflect updates to the project scope and accounting as shown on the attached presentation.
The project cost increases for the 2015 APE capital budget are summarized below:



Construction of additional passing sidings to improve service reliability along the corridor and
facilitate the future completion of the full corridor to 162nd Avenue, approved by the Board in
October 2014.
Additional improvements to the North Metro Corridor:

Packet Pg. 4

1.C.1

Additional hazardous materials costs resulting from additional engineering and soil
testing along the corridor, as well as from negotiations with adjacent property owners
o Property-related impacts resulting from detailed engineering, relocation of the single
remaining freight shipper along the corridor to mitigate impacts on its operations, and
mitigation required at the National Western Stock Show
o Operating and maintenance interface with the Eagle Project, including equipment for
additional North Metro vehicles in the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, developing
and integrating the North Metro communications and control system, and improving
service reliability along the corridor.
 Updated planning and cost estimates for the Central Rail Extension
 Additional funds required for interface between I-225 and East Rail lines at Peoria Station
 Additional closeout work for the West Rail Line
 Additional funds for staffing, marketing, education and promotion of the five corridors
scheduled to open in 2016
 Funding to conduct a federal funding feasibility analysis to identify the best candidate project
for future New Starts or Small Starts funding out of the remaining partially funded projects.
This analysis will not proceed unless a preliminary in-house analysis determines that at least
one of the remaining projects meets the current FTA criteria for entry into the New Starts or
Small Starts process.
The 2015 APE also identifies several projects that will not require the full amount of funds budgeted in
the 2014 APE, and contingency funds that are available to meet project needs:
o



Projects completed under the APE budget
o Denver Union Station
o Free MetroRide
o Wadsworth and Sheridan parking garages
 Other projects with updated cost projections
o Additional light rail vehicles
o Programwide capital costs
 Contingency funds available to meet project needs
o FasTracks Railroad Compliance Contingency
o FasTracks Environmental Mitigation
Future implementation of projects not included in the current APE would require identification of funding
sources for construction and operations, and would require approval of the Board. Therefore, the APE is
a dynamic tool, which is updated as projects move towards completion and any changes approved by
the Board are incorporated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total cost of the changes to the project scopes, net of the transfer approved by the Board in
October 2014 for the North Metro Rail Line project, is $48.8 million. These changes will be funded
through the reallocation of $34.7 million from contingency funds and projects completed under budget,
and a reduction of $14.1 million in the FasTracks Management Reserve.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors approve the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The APE provides a
comprehensive financial blueprint for all FasTracks capital projects completed, underway or planned
through the year 2019.

Packet Pg. 5

1.C.1

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the 2015 APE. This is not recommended
because FasTracks would not have an updated capital budget in place to manage the program
through 2019.

Subject:

Updated Authorization of Fiscal Authority to
the General Manager for the North Metro Rail
Line Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors (“Board”)
increase the authority granted to the General Manager or designee to enter into all contracts, real
property transactions and intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Rail Line Project by $56
million to a total authorization of $689.8 million. This authority shall include the ability to negotiate and
execute all contracts; work orders; change orders and contract modifications; agreements for the
acquisition and conveyance of property interests; and intergovernmental agreements that are necessary
or advisable to complete the North Metro Rail Line within the scope of the North Metro Rail Line Project
budget. This action is consistent with previous board actions and the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation
(APE).
BACKGROUND
As part of the RTD FasTracks Plan, the full North Metro Corridor is an approximately 18.5-mile-long
Commuter Rail line extending from Denver Union Station through the City and County of Denver, the
Cities of Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn and parts of Adams County.
In November, 2013, the Board authorized actions related to the North Metro Rail Line project:
 Award of a design/build contract to Regional Rail Partners (RRP) for construction of the North
Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to 124th Avenue, with options to extend to 162nd
Avenue as funds become available.
 Provided the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts and
intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Rail Line Project in the amount not to exceed
the remaining project budget to 124th Avenue of $633.8 million.
 Provided the General Manager or designee with authority to accept grants or other contributions
and to increase the project budget in the amount of third-party contributions for project work
without further Board approval.
 Approved intergovernmental agreements (IGA) with the City of Commerce City, the City of
Thornton, and the City of Northglenn regarding the North Metro Rail Line project. Each IGA
includes specific terms defining the local agency contribution, coordination, and the rights and
responsibilities of each party within the boundaries of each municipality.
 Approved an IGA with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) regarding the North
Metro Rail Line project, including specific terms defining the coordination between CDOT and
RTD and the rights and responsibilities of each party associated with the construction of the
North Metro Rail Line, especially regarding interface with the state highway system.
In May, 2014, the Board approved the issuance of Certificates of Participation (COPs) to fund a portion
of the North Metro Rail Line project, using the section of the corridor from Denver Union Station to 104th

Packet Pg. 25

1.C.2

Avenue as collateral for the COPs. RTD issued the COPs in the par amount of $441 million in July
2014.
In October, 2014, the Board authorized the transfer of $16 million from FasTracks Railroad Right of Way
budget to a project to construct additional track sidings on the North Metro Rail Line to improve
operational reliability. The Board did not increase the General Manager’s contract authority for the
project at that time.
DISCUSSION
The intense nature of construction projects requires quick decision making capability at the project level.
Failure to provide direction to contractors in a timely manner can result in delays or expensive rework.
Delays in approving change orders can also delay payments to contractors and subcontractors.
Similarly, the ability to acquire, dedicate exchange or dedicate property and property interests, enter into
third party agreements for goods, services, funds or mutually desirable change orders may be required in
time frames that are more abbreviated than board cycles.
Providing this delegation is consistent with previous Board actions for major corridor projects. Based on
this experience, the Board delegated fiscal authority to the amount of the remaining project budget at
the same time that it approved the contract for construction of the project.
Since that time, changes to the project scope and external conditions have necessitated changes in the
project budget, as described below:


Construction of additional passing sidings to improve service reliability along the corridor and
facilitate the future completion of the full corridor to 162nd Avenue.
 Additional hazardous materials costs resulting from additional engineering and soil testing along
the corridor, as well as from negotiations with adjacent property owners
 Property-related impacts resulting from detailed engineering, relocation of the single remaining
freight shipper along the corridor to mitigate impacts on its operations, and mitigation required at
the National Western Stock Show
 Operating and maintenance interface with the Eagle Project, including equipment for additional
North Metro vehicles in the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, developing and integrating the
North Metro communications and control system, and improving service reliability along the
corridor.
The breakdown of the requested fiscal authority for the North Metro Rail Line is detailed below:
Original Project Budget
Recommended Contract Authority Increases
North Metro Sidings - Approved October 2014
Hazardous Materials, Property Impacts, O&M
Interface with Eagle - August 2015 Approval
Subtotal – Recommended Contract Authority
Increases
Updated Contract Authority

$633.8
$16.0
40.0
$56.0
$689.8

FINANCIAL IMPACT
In November, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a total budget of $633.8 million for the remaining
construction of the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to 124th Avenue. Funding for this
contract and the associated RTD cost of construction was provided through the staff identified and

Packet Pg. 26

1.C.2

Board approved $90 million from the Eagle project savings, use of existing fund balances, and issuance
of COPs to provide $430 million in construction funds. These funds were augmented in October 2014
through a transfer of $16 million from the FasTracks Railroad Right of Way contingency fund, and will
be augmented by $40 million in August 2015 through reallocations of budget funds from other existing
contingency funds, reallocations from other projects completed under budget, and a reduction in the
FasTracks Management Reserve.
Funding for the years 2013-2018 is included in the FasTracks financial plan to be approved by the Board
of Directors in August 2015, with the aggregate amount of remaining funding not to exceed $689.8
million. Any further increases to the project budget will be permitted only where the increase is fully
funded by a third party.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors (“Board”) increase the authority granted to the General Manager or
designee to enter into all contracts, real property transactions and intergovernmental agreements for
the North Metro Rail Line Project by $56 million to a total authorization of $689.8 million. This
authority shall include the ability to negotiate and execute all contracts; work orders; change orders
and contract modifications; agreements for the acquisition and conveyance of property interests; and
intergovernmental agreements that are necessary or advisable to complete the North Metro Rail Line
within the scope of the North Metro Rail Line Project. This action is consistent with previous board
actions and the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE).
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not increase the fiscal authority granted to the General
Manager or designee for the North Metro Rail Line Project, and leave the current limit of $633.8
million in place. This is not recommended as it could delay critical project actions resulting in delays
to the project efforts, expensive rework and delays in payments to contractors and subcontractors.
