### B. CAC

Cyndi Stovall, Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Co-Chair, shared that the CAC hosted a General Manager Executive Search public hearing where they discussed broadly the traits that they would like to see in a new General Manager as well as areas of focus.  She noted that a summary of the meeting was provided to the General Manager Executive Search Committee.  She shared that the CAC also met with Brian Welch, Senior Manager of Planning Technical Services, to provide feedback on the RTD Strategic Plan.

Cyndi Stovall informed the Board that many of the CAC members volunteered at the recent Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility event.  Their next work session is scheduled for August 19 where they will begin their ambassador training for the 2016 Grand Openings as well as discuss service integration.  She said the CAC hopes to find new ways to help the Board.  They will continue to discuss what is next in a broader agency-wide focus.

Committee Chair Hoy noted that much of the feedback from the CAC and Board two-on-ones was related to what would be next for the CAC.

Director Folska suggested that the CAC consider reaching out to and mentoring the youth in the District when considering how to expand their scope of service to RTD.  She thinks RTD’s future is in the hands of our children.  She hopes RTD can be more inclusive in getting their input in how RTD can meet their needs in the future.

Committee Chair Hoy thanked Cyndi Stovall for her update.

#### 1. Citizens Advisory Committee

#### 1. Approval of the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE)

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The APE provides a comprehensive financial blueprint for all FasTracks capital projects completed, underway or planned through the year 2019.

Motion:              Director Deadwyler made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the August 18, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, reminded the Board that staff gave an update on the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) during the July FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meetings.  He stated there have been no changes to the APE since then.  Staff added a supplemental chart to address the questions from the Board about what constituted miscellaneous project costs.

Committee Chair Hoy asked if staff would be providing the whole APE documentation at some point in the future.  Rick Clarke stated that there is a chart that shows the revenues versus costs.  Staff plans to provide the cash flow information supporting the chart to the Board by early next week.

Director Folska inquired about the marketing and communications budget included in the APE for the 2016 Grand Openings.  Rick Clarke explained that based on previous Openings staff has budgeted approximately $5 million.

Chair Sisk thanked staff for the information.  He noted that in the list of projects to be completed by 2019 the Longmont Station was listed.  He explained that while there is funding for the station the City of Longmont has asked RTD to delay funding as there are some outstanding questions about where the station will ultimately be located.  He wanted to clarify the reason behind the delay as there has been some consternation that RTD does not have the money.

Director Bagley inquired if the money that was programmed for the Longmont Station would go back into the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).  Rick Clarke said no; the money will remain available for the project.  He explained that staff would actually like to begin the Longmont Station because $17 million can get eroded away very quickly when looking at inflation.

Director Bagley noted that the North Metro Rail Line budget increased $48.8 million or 8.8%.  He understands that much of this funding will be coming from the FasTracks Railroad Relocation Right-of-Way Contingency fund but asked if staff could explain why the extra funding is needed.  Rick Clarke stated that there are three major reasons for the increase in funding needed for the North Metro Rail Line: (1) additional hazardous material costs, (2) negotiations with adjacent property owners who were impacted and (3) additional operations and maintenance costs that were identified as RTD began working more with Denver Transit Partners.

Director Bagley asked if these transfers would jeopardize any other FasTracks projects currently under construction.  He also wanted to confirm that none of the funding would come from the FISA.  Rick Clarke explained that the funds being used were largely contingency funds set aside early in the program.  He said that as RTD moves forward with the completion of many of the corridors staff feels we are beyond a lot of the risk that the funding was set aside to address.  He stated that no funding for the increase in the North Metro Rail Line costs would be coming from the FISA.

Director Bagley asked how much the North Metro communities were contributing both for the total North Metro Rail Line cost as well as the increases.  He also asked if the contribution was in-kind or cash.  Rick Clarke stated that they were contributed the 2.5% required local match in in-kind contributions.

Director Bagley wondered if the approval of the APE required an affirmative vote of 10 since it is a fixed guideway corridor.  Marla Lien stated that this action did not require a vote of 10.  She said he was referring to the next item related to the General Manager’s Fiscal Authority for the North Metro Rail Line.

Director Lubow asked if staff had a summary of the FISA.  She wonders if it is being accumulated in the amount we hoped.   Committee Chair Hoy pointed out that the FISA’s balance is reported every month as part of the Monthly Financial Status Report.  Rick Clarke said that they would send Director Lubow information about the FISA’s balance.

Director Anderson shared that there has been a discussion in her community related to value engineering on the Eagle P3 Project.  She said that some members of her community believe that the real-time train information at the platforms was removed as part of the value engineering.  Rick Clarke stated that he too had heard that rumor but it is incorrect.  Staff is actually working with DTP so their information can be integrated into our system.  He acknowledged that there were really very few cuts made on the Eagle project.  He believes the public will really like what they see when it opens next year.

Director Folska wonders if the real time information is accessible for people with no or low vision.  Rick Clarke said that it was his understanding that there are auditory announcements in addition to a video messaging sign.  He said that he would confirm that information.  Director Folska also asked for information on the party responsible for ensuring that it meets ADA standards.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

##### a. 2015 APE Update

##### b. 2015 APE Adoption Supplemental Information

#### 2. Updated Authorization of Fiscal Authority to the General Manager for the North Metro Rail Line Project

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors (“Board”) increase the authority granted to the General Manager or designee to enter into all contracts, real property transactions and intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Rail Line Project by $56 million to a total authorization of $689.8 million. This authority shall include the ability to negotiate and execute all contracts; work orders; change orders and contract modifications; agreements for the acquisition and conveyance of property interests; and intergovernmental agreements that are necessary or advisable to complete the North Metro Rail Line within the scope of the North Metro Rail Line Project budget. This action is consistent with previous board actions and the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE).

Motion:              Director Solano made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the August 18, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, explained that this Board action is in conjunction with the approval of the Annual Program Evaluation (APE).  In the previous action the Board authorized the additional funding for the North Metro Rail Line.  This action provides the contractual authority to the General Manager that goes along with the budget authority that was already approved.

Director Bagley asked if this action would require an affirmative vote of at least 10 members of the Board for approval.  Marla Lien explained that she wanted to check the language of the statute.  She said that for a vote to move the item from committee the Board would only need 8 affirmative votes.  She stated that she would confirm the number required for approval of the Board before the August 18, 2015 Board Meeting.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. RTD FasTracks U.S. 36 Bus Rapid Transit RTD Board Update August 4, 2015

Nadine Lee, Engineering Project Manager for US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), introduced Svetlana Grechka, Senior Engineer, who reviewed a Power Point Presentation with the Board that is available in the August 4, 2015 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.   Svetlana Grechka noted that there had been many exciting milestones with Phase I 100% completed and Phase II nearly 85% complete.

Svetlana Grechka shared that some of the current activities are:

- Phase I

o        BRT platforms alteration is in progress

o        BRT canopies installation ongoing

o        On-call contract to do final station improvements

o        In-house design of station name and direction signs underway

o        Punch list walkthrough has started

- Phase II

o        Traffic was switched to newly installed Westbound pavement

o        Construction of McCaslin bridge is ongoing

o        Eastbound mainline paving underway

- Programmatic BRT

o        Coordinate civil work at BRT stations and security upgrades

o        RTD Board approved proposed US 36 BRT service plan – July 28, 2015

She said that the next steps are:

- Strategic public outreach – throughout 2015

- Installation of station canopies and Public Information Displays – summer/fall 2015

- Boulder Junction at Depot Square Open House – August 13, 2015

- BRT vehicles delivered – mid-October, 2015

- BRT stations ribbon cutting – TBD

- BRT revenue service – January 17, 2016

Director Folska expressed her appreciation of the attention to detail in the accessibility at all of the stations as well as moving the October openings to January.  She asked if the stations would include real-time information that was accessible to those with low or no vision.  Nadine Lee said that was something staff was working on currently.  She explained that her team was having discussions with IT about how to get that information to people who are visually impaired but have not yet come up with a solution.

Director Folska noted the bike lane seemed very large at 10 feet.  She wondered what the standard minimum width for a traditional bike lane might be.  Nadine Lee explained that it was a bikeway, which is an off street/road path.  She stated that 10 feet is typically standard for a bikeway; however, most bikeways do not have shoulders and the US 36 bikeway has 2 foot shoulders on each side.

Director Menten noted the South West Transit Association award that RTD won in recognition of our ADA design elements.  She asked if staff could provide some examples of what had been done to improve accessibility.  Svetlana Grechka stated that the location of the braille signs is an example.  Staff worked with the Transit and Accessibility Task Force to establish a common location for these signs at all stations.

Director Menten asked for the members of the Transit and Accessibility Task Force.  She wondered if Jadwiga Brown, who is an Orientation and Mobility Specialist for the State of Colorado, was on the Task force.  Director Menten thought it would be beneficial for Ms. Brown to be informed of the Task Force as she helps people with disabilities learn to use public transit.   Nadine Lee said that she was not sure of all the members but she would get back to Director Menten with the information.

Chair Sisk thanked staff for their presentation and enthusiasm.  He is very excited about the progress.  He shared that he attended a groundbreaking for the new Google facility in Boulder.  He stated that one of the key components of picking the location at Boulder Junction was transportation.  He reminded the Board that the Westminster Groundbreaking event would be tomorrow.  Chair Sisk thanked staff for working with the stakeholders to move the ribbon cutting ceremonies to January.

Director Tobiassen shared that the Transit and Accessibility Task Force was a group stated about 6 years ago that meets at the RTD Administrative Offices every month.  He said this Task Force is strongly supported by staff and people from all over the District have been participating.  He encouraged the Directors to attend an upcoming meeting.

Director Bagley commented that similar to Google, the reason Charles Schwab located to Lone Tree and DeVita to Downtown was because of access to public transportation.  He thinks the increase in businesses relocating to the Metro area is great.

Committee Chair Hoy pointed out that there is also a Google facility in Thornton.  Google has generously donated one of its managers to sit on the Board of the Smart Commute Metro North.  He recognized that they are very interested in transportation.  Committee Chair Hoy asked when the diverging diamond would be open to the public.  He has looked at the diagrams on the internet but thinks it will be interesting to see how it works once opened.  Nadine Lee stated it would be done by the end of the year.

##### a. US 36 BRT Aug 4 Board Update

### E. Other Matters

Director Anderson said she wanted to explain her no vote on the Board action to increase the Fiscal Authority granted to the General Manager for the North Metro Rail Line.  She is still concerned about the cost per rider for that project as well as the commitment from the local governments.  She asked staff to provide her with a breakdown of the local contribution to the project.

Committee Chair Hoy recognized that Adams County planned to contribute $3 million into further study on the completion of the Line.  He asked staff to provide additional information on the other contributions.

### G. Adjourn

Committee Chair Hoy adjourned the meeting at 6:23 p.m. to the Government Relations Committee.
