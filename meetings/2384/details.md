### B. 2015 State of the District Address (David Genova)

Dave Genova, Interim General Manager and CEO, introduced the Senior Leadership Team:

- Marla Lien, General Counsel

- Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager (AGM) for Communications

- Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and AGM for Finance & Administration

- Bob Grado, Acting Transit Police Chief, sitting in for John Tarbert, Acting AGM for Safety, Security, and Facilities

- Bill Van Meter, AGM for Planning

- Bruce Abel, AGM for Bus Operations

- Terry Emmons, AGM for Rail Operations

- Henry Stopplecamp, Acting AGM for Capital Programs

He also introduced Zamy Silva, Senior Manager for the Civil Rights Department and Brian Iacono, Senior Manager for the Materials Management Department.

Dave Genova reviewed the State of the District presentation as included in the Operations and Customers Service Committee agenda packet for December 8, 2015.  The presentation included the structure, 3 Major Accomplishments, 3 Goals for 2016, and 3 Challenges for 2016 for each department.  He highlighted the following challenges and priorities for the District as a whole:

- Safety as the District’s number one priority

- The 2016 openings as a challenge for every RTD department

- Human capital retention

- Fiscal Sustainability in light of new operating costs, new fare structure, service planning changes, competing priorities, and project deferrals

- Identifying funding to complete FasTracks

Dave Genova noted that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has new safety rules as well as asset management and State of Good Repair rules that RTD is already meeting, which he will cover in more detail during updates.  There might be new American with Disabilities Act (ADA) and new Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) requirements.  RTD will continue to work with the private sector regarding technology and FasTracks.

He summarized that the General State of the District is financially stable, positioned well to meet all of the 2016 challenges, and ready to maintain service without reductions while maintain the State of Good Repair.  Dave Genova credited the leadership of the Board of Directors and the staff as key elements on RTD’s current position moving forward.  He added that he is not aware of any other transit agency that has had 5 line openings in a single year.

Director Folska thanked Dave Genova for the wonderful, comprehensive look at the District.  She agreed that RTD is in a very unique position in opening 5 new lines in one year.  She noted there had been discussion of safety but she asked that staff think very deeply about safety and security as we move forward with the new openings.

Director Lubow thanked Dave Genova for the comprehensive report.  She congratulated the Senior Leadership Team for their great work this year.  She expressed her pride in being a part of the Board of Directors.

Director Bagley asked Dave Genova about working with the private sector to fund the four uncompleted corridors.  He wondered when the Directors would receive more information on this matter.  Dave Genova replied that staff is having several meetings before the end of the year.  Staff will come to the Board either in January or February of 2016 with more information.  If there seems to be some interest from the private sector, staff may recommend a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a financial advisor to work with staff.  Director Bagley noted the similarity between this process and the Eagle P3 process in 2010.  He assumed that all this information will be available to the Board.  Dave Genova confirmed that the information will be available to the Board.

Committee Chair Anderson thanked staff for their work and leadership.    She said that RTD has an excellent team running a successful and busy agency.

#### 1. 2015 State of the District Address

##### a. 2015 State of the District

#### 2. 2015 Year End Budget Transfer for Access-a-Ride

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service and fuel line items of the Via Mobility budgets to the service line item of the Transdev On Demand budget to cover the variation in costs incurred as a result of the assignment of additional Access-a-Ride service to Transdev On Demand in 2015.  The total dollar amount of the budget transfer is $686,000.

Motion:                Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 15, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              There was no discussion on this matter.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

#### 3. Award of Evergreen Call-n-Ride Contract

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorizes the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with the Seniors’ Resource Center for the provision of the “Evergreen Call-n-Ride” contracted demand response transit services. This contract is for three years with two (2) one-year options. The contract amount includes $1,597,481 for service for the first three years and $99,217 for fuel for the first three years for a total amount not to exceed $1,696,698 for the first three years. The contract amount also includes two (2) one-year options in the amounts of $564,187 for service and $35,075 for fuel for a total of $599,262 for option year 1; and  $580,848 for service and $36,127 for fuel for a total of $616,975 for option year 2. The total contract amount for the five year period is not to exceed $2,742,516 in service and $170,419 in fuel for a total of $2,912,935.  These costs are based on an hourly rate and include estimated fuel costs, which will be treated as a “pass-through” (RTD will reimburse the Contractor’s actual direct fuel costs). This proposal represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 15DH099, to provide “Evergreen Call-n-Ride” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide this service is scheduled to begin January 1, 2016.

Motion:               Director Francone made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 15, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:                Director Francone thanked Brian Matthews, Manager for Special Services, for all the work negotiating the contract with the Seniors’ Resource Center in Evergreen.  She asked him to give the Board an idea of the quality of service the Seniors’ Resource Center provides.  Brian Matthews noted that the Seniors’ Resource Center has been contracted for the Evergreen Call-n-Ride for 10 years.  He added that this contractor is the one with the least complaints received.  The complaints are really not complaints but requests for service outside the service area.  Brian Matthews said that they provide a high quality service.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

#### 4. Approval of General Manager Authority Regarding Eagle Project Operations and Maintenance Annual Costs

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached resolution authorizing the Interim General Manager to execute all necessary work orders, change orders and amendments with Denver Transit Partners (DTP) or its subsidiaries for the operation and maintenance and any additional capital requirements for the Eagle Project pursuant to the previously executed Concession Agreement in accord with the Board approved annual budget and service changes.

Motion:               Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 15, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:                Director Lubow noted that the recommended action seems to be a change from the original agreement so that the Board does not need to approve changes that, in the past, were approved by the Directors.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, explained that the recommended action does not change the original agreement.  She noted that the Board gave authority to the General Manager in 2009 during the construction phase to execute contracts or contract amendments.  The current recommended action requests giving authority to the General Manager during the operations and maintenance phase.  Moving forward, the Board would still be approving changes in two ways: through service changes and through the budget.   As it stands today the Board would have to approve everything twice.  This would remove the extra approval.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. Exhibit A Board Resolution 2010 P3 Concessionaire (Replaces Resolution No. 8)

#### 5. Authorization to enter into fixed-price contract with Cambridge Systematics for a new RTD Trip Planner (15DJ005)

It is recommended by the RTD Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to enter into a $763,757.00 fixed-price contract with Cambridge Systematics, Inc. (CS) for design, development, testing, and release of RTD’s new Trip Planner.

Motion:               Director Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 15, 2015 Board meeting.

Chair Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:                Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, introduced Will Adams, Senior Manager for Customer Care, Ashley Rice, Program Manager for IT, and Dan Jackson, Lead GIS Architect.  Scott Reed noted that the Trip Planner is a joint project between Customer Care and IT.

Director Francone asked staff to comment on the new features, including the ability to add more than one stop to the trip.  Will Adams noted that this Trip Planner would have more functionality than the current one.  Customer Care and the public will have access to the same information, as opposed to the current system where customer care and the public are working on two separate platforms.  Other functionalities include improved walking distances, removing stops or routes, avoiding rail, and multiple trips.  Director Francone asked when the Trip Planner would be live.  Ashley Rice replied that the project will kick off the week of January 10th, 2016 and will be fully completed by the end of December, 2016.

Director Tobiassen asked staff to confirm that staff would be testing  the Trip Planner for ADA compliance.  Will Adams confirmed that would absolutely be the case.  Director Tobiassen wondered where the Trip Planner would be hosted and if Sheri Le, Cyber Security Manager, is involved in the process.  Ashley Rice replied that it will be hosted on RTD’s server and that Sheri Le is part of the Technology Review Panel working on the project.

Chair Sisk shared his excitement in providing a Trip Planner that works for the constituents.  He asked for more information on Cambridge Systematics, Inc. (CS).  Ashley Rice explained that RTD has done business previously with CS in other areas.  She noted that they have always delivered.  She added that CS has over 3 years of trip planner experience and have completed 6 deployments for Florida, New York, Seattle, Atlanta, Pennsylvania and Virginia.  She added that CS has real time experience and is one of the leading participants in real time collaboration and research.

Director Hoy mentioned that these kinds of projects, at times, drag on and that staff has an opportunity to shine with the December, 2016 deadline.  He wondered how the Trip Planner will work from a phone/mobile device regardless of its operating system as most people accessing the Trip Planner will be on a curb waiting for a bus.   Dan Jackson noted that CS developed the mobile interfaces for New York and Trimet in Portland.  Will Adams added that the contract includes responsiveness regardless of device.  Ashley Rice further explained that the contract calls for the Trip Planner to follow RTD’s current web design, which automatically recognizes and adjusts to the device used to access the website.  Scott Reed noted that RTD has been tracking how people access the agency’s website and currently the majority use mobile devices.  Staff only expects that trend to continue.  The Trip Planner will be a seamless integration of this process.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

#### 1. FTA Safety Update (no back-up)

Dave Genova, Interim General Manager and CEO, explained that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has established a variety of new rules for safety and State of Good Repair.  The FTA is linking these two items closely in the new rules.  RTD does not see any new rules that could pose significant challenges locally.  RTD is in compliance with all the new rules, and in some instances, exceeding the safety and State of Good Repair rules as RTD just considers these good industry practices.

Dave Genova noted that under the MAP-21’s new safety management plan approach, the Board will have to approve the safety program every year.  This will translate to more safety and technical briefings during committee meetings in order for the Directors to feel comfortable making these types of decisions.

He added that currently the FTA oversees safety through the State Oversight Safety Program.  The FTA is making this program more robust.  This will include a new Safety Certification Training Program, which means that staff doing safety related work will have to undertake certain training courses.  Dave Genova noted that most staff is up to date with these courses except for one, which is new.

He pointed out that the FTA’s rule making process was started under the current administration, so the expectation is that the process will be finalized by the end of 2016.  Overall, Dave Genova noted that there is nothing of significant concern for RTD under these new rules.

Marla Lien, General Counsel, said that she has not seen the mandates as far as how the agencies are to use these new rules.  However, she noted that the FTA is moving towards a Performance Based Goal Evaluation, which she thinks in the long term will create a mechanism on how to direct federal funds under these rules.  These may include bills, changes in Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) structures, grant structures, etc.

Committee Chair Anderson expressed her concerns about MPOs possibly being in charge of how the funding may be distributed.  She wondered if RTD should try to have more representation at the Denver Regional Council of Government (DRCOG) Board if they would be making rules for the agency.

#### 2. 16th Street Mall Update

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, and Jessie Carter, Manager for Service Planning and Scheduling, reviewed an abbreviated version of the City and County of Denver’s (Denver) presentation titled “The Mall Experience”.  The complete version was included in the Operations and Customer Service Committee agenda packet for December 8, 2015.  Staff distributed a copy of the abbreviated version to the Directors.  A copy of the abbreviated version is available at the Board Office.  The abbreviated presentation included the current state and traffic/visitations on the 16th Street Mall, observations and analysis, the 8 principles to guide the process, next steps, findings of the Meet In the Streets events, and lessons learned.  He noted that this item was originally scheduled for discussion during the November Study Session which, due to scheduling, was cancelled.

Bruce Abel recognized the following people in attendance:

- Brad Buchanan, Director for Community Planning and Development, Denver

- David Gasper, Senior City Planner, Denver

- Jason Whitlock, Principal City Planner for Urban Design, Denver

- John Desmond, Executive Vice President of Downtown Environment for the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP)

Bruce Abel expressed his appreciation for the partnership with Denver and DDP.  He highlighted that RTD is the provider of mobility for the 16th Street Mall.  He mentioned that RTD continues to have dialogue with all the partners on the roles played and the challenges ahead.

Committee Chair Anderson reminded the Directors that this in an information item with no action from the Board.  This proposal will go out to the public with the 2016 April changes for public comments.  Committee Chair Anderson emphasized that RTD’s main job is transit.  She added that an important piece is to listen to riders that use the 16th Street Mall Ride and come back to the Board with the April Service changes.  She wondered if there really were more people because there was no bus.  She also wondered how Denver could attract people when there is bus service.  Bruce Abel added that there is further conversation on specifics under the next agenda item.

Director Folska asked staff to remind the Directors of the 16th Street Mall ridership.  Bruce Abel noted that it is 45,000 on weekdays, 25,000 on Saturdays and 18,000 on Sundays.  Director Folska shared that her concern is the ongoing cost to market the Meet In the Streets weekends.  She said that at a recent event she had the opportunity to talk to over 70 of her constituents, as well as The Honorable Paul Rosenthal, Representative for Denver District 9, and The Honorable Pat Steadman, Senator for District 31.  She noted that no one was against the idea of detouring the 16th Street Mall Ride during the weekends in the summer; however, there was opposition to detouring the 16th Street Mall Ride during weekdays.  She pointed out that the Mall Ride is the equivalent of a horizontal elevator.  She wondered if the length of the 16th Street Mall has an impact on people lingering on the 16th Street Mall.  Bruce Abel replied that the 16th Street Mall is over a mile long.  He noted that Denver’s experimentation process is designed to figure out these logistics.  He added that about 8 blocks of the 16th Street Mall have a median and these are the areas that Denver is experimenting with to measure different types of activities.

Director James thanked John Desmond and Brad Buchanan for their attendance at the meeting and allowing RTD to collaborate with Denver.  Director James reminded the Directors that the 16th Street Mall Ride was created in part because the buses were filling up the streets of downtown.  He agrees that RTD’s job is to move people.  He believes it is appropriate to meet with our partners in Denver in order to create the best environment.  He recalled that when he started as a Director 7 years ago he found himself as Co-Chair of the 16th Street Steering Committee.  The goal then was to attempt to do what is happening now, but it did not go very far.  He mentioned that he is glad to see the experimentation going on with DDP and Denver’s involvement.  He said that he would strongly support anything that RTD could do to support our partners in a cost-effective manner.  He believes it is interesting how the 16th Street Mall Ride serves as the heart of the system that extends to the suburbs.

Director Lasater shared his personal observations during one of his visits downtown on a Meet In the Streets Sunday.  He said that there was a lot of confusion as the vehicles used on 15th Street and 17th Street to transport people were the Free Metro Ride shuttles.  People did not have the landmarks they are used to on the 16th Street Mall to know where to get off the shuttle.  He noted that one of the conclusions of the presentation was that women and children felt safer coming downtown during Meet In The Streets.  He said that while he was downtown with his friends, there was a lot of panhandling and vagabonds, and that the women in his group only felt safe because their husbands were with them.  He said that in order to attract more people to Downtown Denver, more needs to be done about the vagabonds and the herds of teenagers.  He also noted that not having the 16th Street Mall Ride shuttle would be a detriment because that is what people are used to.

Director Bagley clarified that the Free Metro Ride runs during the week, not the weekend.  This would be a differentiation on knowing which buses are providing what service.  He said that he would like to see the numbers on how many people outside of Denver visited the Meet In The Streets events.  He guesses that the number would be very low as this events are very different from going to a Rockies game or visiting Denver Union Station.

Director Francone wondered what the focus of the 16th Street Mall revitalization is: reenergize the area, leisure, business, etc.  She echoed the sentiment that RTD’s focus is moving people and that any participation in this partnership should be done in a cost effective manner.  She also visited the 16th Street Mall during a Meet In the Street event and witnessed the confusion of not having the 16th Street Mall Ride running on 16th Street.  She asked staff to provide, off line, the cost differential between running the Mall Ride on 16th Street versus on 15th and 17th Streets.

Director Hoy said that he was a little suspicious of the statistics in the presentation.  He is not sure if there would be this many people on the 16th Street Mall were it not for the intentional activities during these events.  He agreed that RTD’s focus is moving people.  He wondered how adjusting the 16th Street Mall Ride route benefits RTD.

##### a. 16th St Mall-meet in street summary-Dec. 8 2015 Ops committee-

#### 3. April 2016 Service Change

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, reminded the Directors that normally service changes happen in January, May, and August.  The May, 2016 changes have been moved to April, 2016 to coincide with the opening of the University of Colorado A Line (CU A Line).  He noted that the packet is very light since the CU A Line changes, as well as the restructuring of bus services around the line, were already approved.

Bruce Abel called the Directors’ attention to a letter from the City and County of Denver (Denver) asking to divert the 16th Street Mall Ride to 15th Street and 17th Street for 13 weekends during the summer starting on June 4th and ending on August 28th.  He added that this is a large enough request that it is no longer considered a detour but a service change, thus requiring Board approval.  Staff received today a letter of support from the Downtown Denver Partnership that will be uploaded to the Operations and Customers Service Committee agenda packet.  He noted that at this time this is not a recommendation but part of the information to be taken out for public comment.  After considering the public comments, a recommendation will be brought to the Director’s in January.

Director Folska asked for two items to be presented down the road: the financial impact on the District for making the Saturday and Sunday modifications and any unintended security consequences.  Bruce Abel noted that these will be included in the assessment as part of the final recommendation.

Director Walker wondered if the weekend changes would be during the day, evening, or both.  Bruce Abel replied that it would be for the entire service day.  Director Walker said that he was fine with the changes as these types of changes are part of living in a dense area.  He agrees that RTD’s business is moving people; however, he sees it as moving people where they want to go when they need to be moved.  He noted that part of the lessons learned process is to step up signage to help people find their way through a city that is constantly changing.

Director Menten mentioned that one of the proposed eliminations is the Belmar Call-n-Ride, which is in her District.  She noted that she is okay with this as the ridership is 1.8 per hour when the minimum per RTD service standards is 3 per hour.  She pointed out that currently the subsidy is almost $58 per rider.  She said that she is willing to do the necessary outreach in her area.

Director Menten noted that Attachment C mentions the cost $126,100 for the 26 days requested by Denver to divert the 16th Street Mall Ride.  Bruce Abel explained that Attachment C has facts on the 16th Street Mall Ride in an attempt to communicate the role of the shuttle in our transportation network.  During the 2015 Meet In the Streets events, RTD chose to remain cost neutral by running the Free Metro Ride less frequently given the larger capacity of the buses.  Street Supervisors were stationed at Denver Union Station and Civic Center to ensure the buses would meet trains and other bus routes.  Attachment C explains what would happen with an increased frequency to match the current weekend 16th Street Mall Ride service.  Director Menten noted that the 16th Street merchants reported a slight sales increase.  She wondered as to the potential of RTD seeing some increased sales tax revenue from this to offset the increase in service.  She told staff that this information could be provided offline.

Director Tobiassen asked staff to do an extra effort to reach out to the disability community regarding these potential changes to the 16th Street Mall Ride service.  Bruce Abel noted that would be part of the process.

Director Hoy suggested that Denver looked into how Boulder finances most of their services as they contribute more to their requests.  Bruce Abel said that staff would be willing to bring that up in the conversations.

Chair Sisk said that he anticipates an increase in ridership on Flatiron Flyer routes FF4 and FF5.  He asked staff to consider increasing service during certain periods of the day.

Director Bagley noted that Denver’s request to expand the rerouting of the 16th Street Mall Ride for 26 days is basically a whole month of service.  He does not think there has been enough research done.  He thinks that the research should be done by RTD in conjunction with Denver.  The areas to be looked into include security, service, marketing, and other alternatives.  He added that this is a good start into looking at how something different may be done; however, there must be a lot more work to be done for him to approve rearranging one twelfth of the 16th Street Mall Ride operations.

Committee Chair Anderson suggested testing the same activities with the 16th Street Mall Ride running regular operations and to note what the difference may be.

Networked Family of Services

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, explained that this item is presented in conjunction with the Finance Department.  He introduced Jeff Becker, Senior Manager for Service Development, who was available to answer any questions.  Bruce Abel referred the Directors to the Service Performance 2014 Networked Family of Services report as included in the Operations and Customer Service committee agenda packet for December 8, 2015.

Director Bagley noted that the Access-a-Ride subsidy is $57.30.  He wondered how this number has changed throughout the past 5 years.  Bruce Abel replied that he would have to research the specifics number, but that the amount has not changed significantly.
