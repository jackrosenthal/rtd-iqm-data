Re:

December Board Update

Prior to the November Election BBMK coordinated a call with Shad Murib, Chief of Staff for
Governor Elect Polis to discuss transit-oriented development and affordable housing. General
Manager Genova and Sherry Ellebracht provided an update on RTD’s experience with TOD and
offered the District as a resource on these issues. In addition to this call, at the request of
Governor Elect Polis BBMK submitted a two-page memo detailing RTD’s priorities for 2019.
BBMK is working with RTD Executive Staff to coordinate a tour for legislators of the Transit
Oriented Development sites within the District. The tour will be on November 28th at 9:45am
meeting at the Whole Foods Store on the corner by Chestnut Place. BBMK invited the newly
elected members to participate in this tour and will continue to educate legislators about the
District’s impact in Colorado. To date we have a number of new legislators attending as well as
legislative council staff for the Transportation Committee.
Governor Hickenlooper submitted his final budget request on November 1st. Governor Elect
Polis will have an opportunity to make changes to this request, but those changes will have to go
through the JBC supplemental process. Governor Hickenlooper’s budget request includes:
•
•
•
•

•

•
•
•
•
•

FY19-20 budget request is for $33.4 billion or a 4.8% increase in total funds. This
includes a General fund request of $13.2 billion or a 4.7% increase over FY18-19.
Reducing the Budget Stabilization Fact by $77 million to $595 million.
Increases per pupil spending by $182.02 to a total of $7,606.68 (2.45 percent).
$10 million investment in key initiatives emerging from the bipartisan Education
Leadership Council to address teacher shortages, incentives for students completing
industry credentials, internships and apprenticeships.
$9.7 million from Marijuana Tax Cash Funds for 105 additional school health
professionals to increase substance abuse, mental health prevention and intervention
programs.
$6.5 million for scholarships to college students that commit to teaching in rural and
underserved school districts.
$200 million will be provided to transportation as a result of SB18-001.
$2 million to hire more state troopers.
$40 million to replenish the controlled maintenance fund as the money was used for
wildfires.
Increase the general fund reserve from 7.25% to 8%. This would require legislation.

Three-year $30 million general investment towards the implementation of Colorado’s
Water Plan.
Increase of $121 million general fund to keep tuition flat at all public institutions of
higher ed for school year 2019-20.
A change in the TABOR surplus refund mechanism to childcare, workforce development
and working families via tax credits, in addition to the existing Senior Homestead Act.
This would require legislation.
Merit pay increase of 3.0 percent for most state employees beginning July 1, 2019.
$247.2 million in total capital construction with $224.4 million coming from the General
Fund.
Medicaid provider rate increase of 1.0 percent across the board for community providers.
$130 million in MTCF appropriations and transfers. Approval of the governor’s request
would leave 19.4 million available for other purposes in FY19-20 or future fiscal years.
PERA Direct distribution allocation to all departments through a compensation common
policy which allocates 56.5. million including 29.2 million to general fund and 27.3
million to cash and federal fund sources. This would require legislation.

The failure of the two transportation ballot initiatives punts transportation funding back to the
legislature to decide a path forward. As a result of SB18-001 the legislation submits a question
to the voter’s in 2019 and this session will determine if that question will indeed be on the ballot.
The Polis Administration announced his transition team and has selected as chairs of the
Transportation, Infrastructure and Local Affairs the following community members;
Co-chairs: Former House Democratic Leader Sal Pace and Former House Speaker Crisanta
Duran. Members: Rutt Bridges; Tim Mauck; and Dr. Florine Raitano.
Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

• Return of CRP funds on RRIF Loan: Seeking the return of the $29 million credit risk
premium on the now-repaid RRIF loan for the DUS project.
• Secured favorable provision in FY 2018 Omnibus Appropriations bill (March 2018)
defining each cohort as loans made in a single year.
• US DOT secured special “anomaly language” in the Continuing Resolution
(September 2018) to effectively un-do our provision.
• FY 2019 transportation spending bill may define cohorts in law.
• Upcoming Opportunities for RTD:
• Shape infrastructure bill and FAST Act reauthorization from RTD’s position as a
national leader: As a recipient of 5 FFGAs, 2 TIFIA loans and a RRIF loan, RTD
knows both the benefits and challenges of advancing major projects.
• Pursue project earmarks if reestablished by Congress.
• In reauthorization, pursue formula funding at or above FY 2018 levels and a HTF

revenue solution to support those levels.
• Continue to pursue Federal discretionary grants, particularly after recent State-level

transportation funding ballot measures were unsuccessful.

• Common Ground: Democrats take control of the House and have reinvigorated efforts to

move a large, well-funded infrastructure bill. President Trump has repeatedly stated he can
work with Democrats on infrastructure.
• Democrats: Envision a big and bold bill, with support for projects of national significance.

Rejected Trump’s earlier infrastructure proposal as lacking new revenues, over reliant on
finance tools and P3s, and undermining transit and environmental protections.
• Trump: After Trump’s infrastructure proposal found few supporters in Republican-led

House and Senate and showed little nexus to his transportation budget proposals, unclear
what Trump may advance in 2019.
• How to pay for it? Same politically-difficult options remain (more later).
• Tax increase:

• Cons: Big infrastructure bill, independent of FAST Act reauthorization, is not a
“must pass” bill so could lack the momentum required to carry a tax increase.
• Pros:
• DeFazio wants $1 trillion bill with “real money” that only a robust revenue
increase could support.
• Restoring earmarks could build direct Congressional support to fund them.
• Deficit spending (tax reform legislation).

• Deadline: FAST Act reauthorization is “must pass” legislation: virtually all FAST Act spending
ends on September 30, 2020.
• New Policies: Where an infrastructure bill may funnel funds into current FAST Act programs, a
reauthorization bill would make substantive policy changes, large and small.
• New Revenues? With Democrats – who are not retreating from the notion of a gas tax increase
– bill could finally include a Highway Trust Fund revenue solution, not just another revenue
patch.
• Closing the gap between spending levels and dedicated HTF revenues seen as “unfinished
business” from FAST Act.
• Even if new revenues are secured, all sides will pursue ways to make limited Federal funds go
further:
• Take from one program and give to another.
• Scale back what constitutes a Federal interest.
• Ask others to do more: incentives to attract greater local, State, and private investment.
• Reduce Federal requirements that may impact project costs.
• Leverage limited Federal funds: TIFIA, RRIF, WIFIA, private activity bonds.
• Return of earmarks? House Democrats may push for reinstating project earmarks, asserting
Congress’ “power of the purse,” particularly where Congress questions Executive Branch
exercise of discretion over programs, like New Starts and BUILD (TIGER).

• Spending exceeds HTF revenues by almost $20 billion/year, shored up by transfers

•

from the General Fund under the FAST Act, through FY 2020.
HTF will be insolvent at the end of the FAST Act, FY 2021. So clear nexus between HTF
solution and FAST Act reauthorization.
To simply fund the next transportation bill at current program levels, Congress must
close this revenue gap.
• Could do yet another revenue patch or a true revenue solution.
• But no expectation that Congress will live within the current means of the HTF,
i.e., reduce program funding in the next bill to levels well below the FAST Act.
Filling the gap? Known, well-defined, and viable options, but each is politically difficult.
• Gas tax increase?
• Supported to varying degrees by many Democrats, President Trump.
• For Republicans, a very heavy political lift and could erode their support for
any infrastructure bill – even one promoted by President Trump.
• Vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) fee? Privacy concerns remain.
Timing: 2019 is the year to act; Congress likely won’t pass a major tax increase in an
election year (2020).
