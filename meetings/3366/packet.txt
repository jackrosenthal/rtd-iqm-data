BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
September 13, 2022

Sales and Use Tax Forecast

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Fiscal Policy requires that:
RTD will contract with a qualified, independent third party to provide sales and use tax forecasts.
As such, RTD has contracted with the Business Research Division of the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business (CU Leeds) to provide semi-annual sales and use tax forecast model reports in March
and September to coincide with the development of RTD’s annual budget and six-year Mid-term
Financial Plan (MTFP). The provision of the Forecast Model Report is followed by a presentation to the
Board by CU Leeds.
DISCUSSION
The March 2022 sales and use tax forecast was included in the 2022 Amended Budget. The September
2022 sales and use tax forecast will be included in the 2023-2028 MTFP and the 2023 Budget.
The September 2022 Forecast Model Report reflects a projected increase from the March 2022 forecast
in RTD’s sales and use taxes as follows:

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Non-represented Employee Pension Plan Fund Status

Committee Meeting Date:
September 13, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD provides a defined benefit pension plan for non-represented employees who began employment
prior to January 1, 2008. Annually, the actuarial firm of Rael Letson prepares a report on the funding
status of that pension plan to RTD to incorporate in the RTD Annual Comprehensive Financial Report.
Subsequently, an actuary from Rael Letson presents a summary of that report to the RTD Board of
Directors.
Non-represented employees hired January 1, 2008 and thereafter participate in a defined contribution
plan for which RTD is contributing 9.0% of an employee’s wages. Non-represented employees do not
contribute to either the defined benefit or defined contribution plans but may voluntarily contribute to a
separate 457(b) deferred compensation plan up to IRS limits.
DISCUSSION
This presentation is intended to update the Board of Directors on the current funded status of the nonrepresented employee pension plan, the actuarially recommended contributions going forward and the
historical performance of the pension funding status.

Recommended Contribution Information

1.C.2.a

▪ The Board’s funding policy (since 2016) remains the same – the contribution is
determined as an amount to keep the Trust “actuarially sound” based on the

recommendations of the Actuary and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer

▪ Based on January 1, 2021 actuarial valuation results and an estimated 2021 net
investment return of 11.8%, the Plan was projected to reach 100% funding in 2031
with the recommended contribution made each year beginning in 2022, if all
assumptions were met in the future, including a net investment return of 7.0%

▪ What changed since last year?
➢ The actual net investment return for 2021 was 13.7% based on the 12/31/2021 Plan audit

➢ The Plan experienced an asset gain of $2.4M (8.7% net return on the Actuarial Value of Assets
vs. 7.0% assumption) and a liability loss of $2.4M during 2021

➢ The demographic assumptions for retirement, disability, salary scale and J&S election were
updated to reflect expected experience

❑ These approved assumption changes increased the Actuarial Accrued Liability by
approximately $1.1M and the recommended contribution by about $0.3M

Long-Term Funding

1.C.2.a

▪ Reflecting January 1, 2022 valuation results, the Plan is projected to reach 100%
funding in 2031 with an $8.4M contribution in 2022 and the recommended contribution
each year thereafter if all actuarial assumptions are met in the future, including a net
investment return of 7.0% per year beginning in 2022

▪ What has happened since January 1, 2022?
➢ The preliminary YTD investment return through July 2022 is -8.7%, net of investment
expenses, per the investment consultant (vs. the 7.0% assumption)

▪ After reflecting a -8.7% preliminary net return on assets in 2022 (instead of the
assumed 7.0%), the Plan is expected to achieve 100% funding in 2032 (one year
later)

▪ Due to the Plan’s maturity, future investment returns have a significant impact on
projected liabilities – we will keep the Board apprised of the impact of the Plan’s
investment performance on future costs

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001 Pension
Plan Fund Status

Committee Meeting Date:
September 13, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD provides a defined benefit pension plan for all represented employees. Annually, the actuarial firm
of Gabriel Roeder Smith (GRS) prepares a report on the funding status of that pension plan, which is
provided to the ATU Pension Trust and also is incorporated in the RTD Annual Comprehensive Financial
Report. Subsequently, an actuary from GRS presents a summary of that report to the RTD Board of
Directors.
The ATU Pension Trust will continue for current employees and retirees but will be closed to new RTD
represented employees after December 31, 2022. New RTD represented employees beginning
employment January 1, 2023 and thereafter will participate in a defined contribution retirement plan as
agreed in the 2022-2024 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
The defined contribution plan that will be available for new employees beginning in 2023 requires a
9.0% agency contribution, and those employees may elect to voluntarily contribute up to 5.0%, which
RTD will match. Represented employees may also voluntarily contribute to a separate 457(b) deferred
compensation plan up to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) limits.
DISCUSSION
This presentation is intended to update the Board of Directors on the current funded status of the ATU
pension plan, the actuarially recommended contributions going forward and the historical performance of
the pension funding status.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
September 13, 2022

Internal Audit Update

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In December 2020, the Colorado Office of the State Auditor (OSA) completed a performance audit of
RTD and in April 2021, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) completed a peer review
of RTD’s internal audit function both of which included recommendations for improving RTD’s internal
audit function. RTD entered an engagement with RubinBrown, LLP for professional assistance in
implementing those recommendations according to standards promulgated by the Institute of Internal
Auditors (IIA) as well as to provide guidance regarding the proper staffing of RTD’s internal audit
function.
In January 2022, RubinBrown recommended that RTD outsource its internal audit function in order to
leverage the professional expertise of subject matter experts while also benefitting from the efficiencies
to be gained by contracting for hourly services as opposed to full-time employees.
In February 2022, RTD issued a request for proposals to outsource the internal audit function.
In June 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the agency to enter a contract with RubinBrown, LLP to
provide internal audit services for three base years and two option years.
In July 2022, the Board Chair appointed an Audit Ad Hoc Committee to work with RubinBrown to
develop recommendations to implement the outsourced internal audit function and form an RTD
Independent Audit Committee.
DISCUSSION
The Audit Ad Hoc Committee has held six meetings, which commenced in July 2022. The purpose of
this Discussion Item is to present information to the full Board regarding the status of internal audit
efforts as well as provide the timeline for full implementation of an internal audit function.

RubinBrown used data from the IIA*, comparison’s of other clients, the IIA Benchmarking Report, and a
discussion with Alameda Contra Costa County Transit District to identify best practices for RTD’s Audit
Committee (Committee). Best/common practices include:
Composition:
o Three – five Committee members
o Committee members should have an appropriate mix of skills and relevant experience, including a
financial expert
o Committee members should be independent – To qualify as independent, an audit committee
member may not be employed by, or provide any services to, the organization beyond their duties as
a committee member
Audit Committee Responsibilities:
o Governance initiatives – oversight on initiatives established by the board ad maintained by
management
o Risk management – Oversight of the establishment, implementation, and effectiveness of risk
assessment, risk management and risk reporting
o Internal control framework – provide oversight of the organizations internal control framework
o Audit Activity – Review and approve the internal audit department charter, the internal audit plan,
and manage the recruitment, appointment, retention and removal of the chief audit executive
including annual performance reviews and raise/bonus decisions
o External Audit – Advised on all audit work to be completed by external assurance providers, including
management's response and audit-related issues and priorities
o Financial statements and public accountability reporting – review and provide advice to the board on
key financial management and performance reports and disclosures issues to the public

INTRODUCTION:
The Internal Audit Function is an independent and objective assurance and consulting function that is guided by
a philosophy of adding value to improve the operations of the Regional Transportation District (RTD). The
Internal Audit Function assists RTD in accomplishing its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined
approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of RTD's governance, risk management, and internal control.

PROFESSIONALISM:
The Internal Audit Function adheres to the Institute of Internal Auditors' mandatory guidance including the
Definition of Internal Auditing, the Code of Ethics, and the International Standards for the Professional Practice
of Internal Auditing (Standards). This mandatory guidance constitutes principles of the fundamental
requirements for the professional practice of internal auditing and for evaluating the effectiveness of the Internal
Audit Function’s performance.
The Internal Audit Function adheres to the Institute of Internal Auditors' Practice Advisories, Practice Guides,
and Position Papers as applicable to guide operations. In addition, the Internal Audit Function also adheres to
relevant RTD policies and procedures and the Internal Audit Function’s Standard Operating Procedures Manual.
The Chief Audit Executive (CAE) periodically reports to Executive Leadership and the Audit Committee regarding
the Internal Audit Function’s conformance to the Code of Ethics and the Standards.
AUTHORITY:
The Internal Audit Function, with strict accountability for confidentiality and safeguarding records and
information, is authorized full, free, and unrestricted access to any and all RTD records, physical properties, and
personnel pertinent to carrying out any engagement. All employees must assist the Internal Audit Function in
fulfilling its roles and responsibilities. The Internal Audit Function has direct access to the Audit Committee and
the Board.

operations, programs, systems, and controls. Any significant deviation from the approved internal audit plan
must be communicated to Executive Leadership and the Board through periodic activity reports.

quality assurance and improvement program, including results of ongoing internal assessments and external
assessments conducted at least every five years.

The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) survey asked each participant to rate
potential risk events based on the severity, probability, and risk preparedness.
Participants were asked to consider the following:
Severity – If the risk event occurs, how severe will the consequences be given
the controls and processes in place to mitigate or lower the impact?
Probability – What is the likelihood that the controls and processes designed to
mitigate this risk event will not prevent or detect the risk event?

Not evaluated by Board of Directors by design

Risk Preparedness – When assessing the risk preparedness, reflect on the RTD's
current processes and controls designed to prevent the risk event and/or
manage the risk event if it does occur. The key questions to consider when
rating the risk preparedness are:
1. How well is RTD monitoring potential risk events?
2. Has RTD implemented controls and processes for preventing, where
possible, the risk event from occurring?
3. How prepared is RTD to address the risk event if it occurs?

From Management Group Respondents:
"Leadership/Management Competencies"
"The risk that Management gets too much, too little or incorrect information or even manipulate
information and use it to make decisions. Risk that decisions are not made for RTD's best interest but for
Management to achieve their own personal goals and objectives. Risk that salaried staff moral does
not recover and the already high attrition rate increases."
“Lack of facilities, locations, offices, shop space and organization structure for personnel needed in
every area needs to be increased. Marginal risk of what we do getting worse but high risk towards
improving the agency.”
“Within the boundaries of RTD, there are large areas beyond the reach of fixed-route or paratransit
service, but within the RTD service area, leading to service inequity for a customer base which are
disproportionately racial minorities, low-income, or disabled.”
"RTD has a lack of management systems that ensure consistent performance. There has been
improvement in adherence to the adherence to generating the asset management plan (AMP) that is
the prioritized list of asset investments, however the investments are not clearly prioritized against
strategic objectives to ensure agency success. RTD does not have a data-driven culture. Intuition
shapes actions and the results of actions are frequently unchecked. Assessments of asset information
maturity have found that data is often insufficient to generate data-driven plans of action. Data-driven
plans and performance monitoring are a hallmark of effective management systems, and are explicitly
required for Safety Management System and Transit Asset Management compliance, yet RTD needs to
undergo cultural change in order to shift to such a model.”

“ - Impact of Union Relations on finances, personnel, morale. - Risk of mandatory vaccines and/or lack
of remote work options resulting in personnel finding other employment”

From Board of Directors Respondents:
"Political & Legislative Risk - Due to a variety of factors (e.g., FasTracks remaining incomplete, public mistrust of
RTD, and political rhetoric), local & state government & legislative bodies could pursue and produce changes
that threaten RTD's ability to achieve its current business objectives and purpose as RTD is currently structured.
• Severity: 4 • Probability: 1"
"I believe that there's a significant political risk entailed by the agency not fully appreciating, accepting as
legitimate, and attempting in some manner to address the gap in regional expectations for service. A smaller
swath of the District's area, Denver in particular, is seeing even more abundant, high quality service, while those
footing the majority of the bill are seeing less or sometimes none. My worry is that sooner or later this will put
wind in the sails of legislative/structural changes that are to RTD's detriment. Meanwhile, the value of an
elected board has been that, through its collective advocacy for all corners of and the varying perspectives
within the District, it has assured some measure of responsiveness that acts to head off that outcome. But these
days Board member advocacy, mediated as it should be for concern for the whole and a commitment to the
policies that guide service delivery, is less tolerated, further increasing this political risk."
"Risk of legislative interference in policy or financial decision-making. Risk of interference from the Governor's
office. Risk of areas of the District seceding and eroding the tax base"
“I believe there is a risk to the agency in focusing so much service on Denver at the expense of regional areas
that also contribute and get much reduced service. It is probably a risk that the legislature will act, although
there are a couple of mayors mentioning lawsuits. The elected board may help buffer this by advocating for
their regions. We need a strategic, focused plan, probably emphasizing partnerships, to address this.”

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Account-based Ticketing Contract Extension and Fixed
Fees

Committee Meeting Date:
September 13, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
September 28, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to extend the
contract with Masabi by one year and implement a fixed monthly fee.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Tonya Anderson, Senior Product Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Account-based Ticketing (ABT) initiative is a fare modernization project to decommission the current
card-based Conduent Smart Media Technology System implemented in 2013 and replace it with the
Masabi Justride Platform. The Board of Directors approved the project with an amendment to the Masabi
contract to implement ABT on October 27, 2020, and a new bus and rail platform validator contract
with Masabi on April 20, 2021.
The key project elements include adding new features to the RTD Mobile Tickets app, including stored
value accounts, tap-to-ride fare payment, and fare capping; launching a newly branded MyRide card;
replacing bus and rail platform validators, upgrading the fare enforcement inspection devices and app,
and transitioning pass program customers from using the legacy smart cards to using mobile barcodes or
new ABT smart cards.
RTD and Masabi have been implementing the ABT system components during the course of July and
August 2022, with an anticipated go-live date in October 2022, with full completion expected at the end
of 2022.
DISCUSSION
Masabi currently charges RTD a commission for each transaction in the mobile ticketing application. In
addition, RTD reimburses Masabi for the payment card fees that Masabi incurs on behalf of RTD. RTD
and Masabi began discussions in March 2022 regarding the potential to negotiate a fixed fee
arrangement with the implementation of ABT to provide both entities with a more stable revenue and
cost agreement which would also incorporate the costs of software licensing related to the ABT
validators and other features such as the fare inspection app licenses, an online portal for customers,
and a vendor portal for the ABT retail network.

Packet Pg. 83

1.D.1

A fixed fee arrangement with Masabi would combine the existing mobile ticketing fees, ABT fees, and
customer and vendor portal fees into a fixed monthly payment and amend the contract with Masabi to
extend the term for one year under this arrangement. Masabi would continue to charge RTD for payment
card fees at a reduced rate.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of this recommended action results in a one-year extension of the Masabi contract
with a not-to-exceed amount of $2,800,000. This cost will be partially offset by the elimination of the
legacy Conduent smart card system with identified savings of $988,000 and possibly more, depending
on adoption of ABT electronic fare media as opposed to MyRide cards. Funding has been included in the
2022 Amended Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2023-2028 Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP)

Committee Meeting Date:
September 13, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
September 28, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2023-2028 Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 2023-2028 MTFP is the six-year financial forecast used as the basis for the development of the
2023 Budget and provides guidance for future year financial planning. The development of this forecast
seeks to balance planned expenditures with anticipated available funding sources in alignment with
RTD’s Strategic Plan. Adoption of the 2023-2028 MTFP by the Board is not a commitment or
appropriation of funding.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s financial position has improved since the Board last approved an MTFP in November 2021. In the
intervening period, RTD has gained additional clarity regarding post-COVID fare revenue and sales and
use tax receipts, approved a three-year collective bargaining agreement, completed two debt
refinancings for interest savings, progressed in refining asset management needs and further
implemented the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan.
2023-2028 MTFP Assumptions
• Fare revenue volatility has moderated during the past year ending June 2022 with the MTFP
assuming up to a 20% decrease in the average fare rate beginning in 2024 in anticipation of
results from the Fare Study and Equity Analysis. Ridership was reforecast based on current trends
and is assumed to grow annually by 1.8%. No fare increase is contemplated in the MTFP
• Sales and use tax projections provided in August 2022 by the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business project a $91.4 million increase over the March 2022 forecast. The increase
is primarily due to strong collections during 2022 and higher inflation, which is driving the prices
of goods higher, tempered by lower year-over-year growth due to forecasted Base System growth
capped at 1.4% after 2024 for TABOR limits. The 1.4% Base System growth assumption
matches the assumptions from Reimagine RTD in which growth was capped at the growth rate of
property taxes in alignment with TABOR revenue growth limits

Federal COVID-19 relief funding apportionments of $202 million for a total of $774 million for the
period 2020-2024
Increase of approximately $30 million annually for increased FTA Section 5307 preventive
maintenance grant funding resulting from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA)/Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)
Operating expense increase of $254 million over the six-year MTFP period for increased service
levels and inflationary increases
Debt service decrease of $129 million over the six-year MTFP period due to debt refinancing for
interest savings
Asset management includes an additional $163 million over the six-year MTFP for state of good
repair needs. The average annual expenditure is $133 million, compared to the long-term
forecasted annual average of $120 million due to the backlog of needs, which is significantly
reduced from the 2021 MTFP
Increase in reserves of $118 million during the six-year MTFP, which results in meeting the
Board-established fiscal policy of maintaining three months’ operating expenses in reserves

Current Outlook
• The 2023-2028 period balances funding sources and uses while strengthening reserves
• Service level increases are based on anticipated demand
• Funding for full asset management backlog plus reserves is maintained for future needs
• Debt service coverage ratio policy of 1.2X is met or exceeded each year
• Reserves of three months’ operating expenses are maintained in each year
• Base System funding continues to supplement FasTracks, however at a lower level due to
decreases in FasTracks debt service requirements
• Limited new projects are included
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2023-2028 MTFP projects balanced funding sources and uses while meeting asset management
needs and fiscal policy requirements for reserves and debt service coverage ratios.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Bank Signature Authorization

Committee Meeting Date:
September 13, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
September 28, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization to authorize
certain staff members to sign payments exceeding certain thresholds regarding checks, automated
clearing house payments, and wire transfers and to remove the requirement that Board Officers provide
wet signatures for certain payments.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Throughout RTD’s procurement, invoicing and payment processes, several internal budgetary controls
serve to prevent incorrect payments including a robust approval process that must conform with the
Board appropriated budget.
Signature authorizations for certain large payments are one such control. Payment thresholds have been
established that require specific signatures for these payments to be processed by the Accounts Payable
Division and RTD’s commercial bank, currently Wells Fargo.
Board approval is currently necessary to designate which individuals may sign these payments and to
authorize them to do so. Current practice requires a signature from an authorized staff member as well
as a Board Officer for payments of $100,000 and above. This requires a Board Officer to provide wet
signatures for these payments at least once a week.
Budgetary controls prevent the issuance of payments without explicit prior authorization; by definition,
spending authority for any pending payment that currently requires Board Officer signature has already
been granted, either under the Board’s authority or that of the General Manager and CEO GM/CEO,
meaning that a wet signature is in essence perfunctory.
Wells Fargo relies on a positive pay system in which requests for disbursements by customers must
match payment files received from RTD in order to avoid fraud. Wells Fargo does not review payment
requests for correct signatures or the number of signatures but does require authorized signatories to
complete a separate Wells Fargo form “signature card” for their record of authorized individuals.

Packet Pg. 98

1.D.3

Currently, the Accounts Payable Division processes approximately 400 checks, Automated Clearing
House (ACH) transfers and wire payments each week, of which approximately 10 such transactions
require a wet signature from a Board Officer under current practices.
In order to obtain a wet signature from a Board member, this process requires that the Accounts Payable
Division send these payment requests from the District Shops facility to the Blake Street offices twice a
week to obtain signatures, which necessitates additional administrative efforts and record-keeping and
can result in delayed payment to vendors.
DISCUSSION
Aligned with the Strategic Priority of Financial Success, RTD takes very seriously the management of all
financial resources, this Recommended Action seeks Board approval to remove the requirement for Board
Officer signatures for checks, ACH transfers and wire payments.
Best practices for payment authorization are included in RTD’s internal control process. Obtaining
additional signatures from Board creates additional burdens for staff as well as for the Board member
who must travel to the Blake Street offices to provide payment signatures.
Both Wells Fargo and Plante Moran, RTD’s external auditor, have independently confirmed that requiring
a second signature from a Board Officer is a highly uncommon practice and does not enhance controls.
In approving this Recommended Action, the Board duly authorizes the GM/CEO, the Chief Financial
Officer, the Chief Operations Officer, and the Chief Administrative Officer to continue to approve
payments within their designated signing authority.
Any future change to the staff positions authorized as bank signatories requires Board approval.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of this Recommended Action.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Salaried Trustee Appointment

Committee Meeting Date:
September 13, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
September 28, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve Resolution No. ______, Series of 2022, appointing Bill Sirois,
Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities, to a term expiring December 31, 2023, as a Trustee for
the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit Pension Plan (pension plan) and Salaried Employee Defined
Contribution Retirement Plan (DC plan) effective October 1, 2022.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 001, Series of 2008 (Resolution No.
1), which established a committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee
Pension Trust Fund, and the Finance Chair (i.e., the Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit
Committee as it existed at that time) to screen applications from prospective pension and DC plan
trustees from among “the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management
salaried employee class and…[to] bring recommendations back to the Board.”
As a revision to the process established in Resolution No. 001, the Board adopted Resolution No. 27,
Series of 2010, which stated that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have served satisfactorily and in
whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to seek applications
for renewal, and instead the application process established by the Board in 2008 would be used on
those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or appropriate to appoint new salaried Trustees to
the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008, Series of 2016 (Resolution No. 008), the RTD Board of
Directors amended the Defined Benefit Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Retirement Trust
(Trusts, collectively) to remove the “senior” and “middle” management distinction established in
Resolution No. 001. Instead, Resolution No. 008 authorized the Board to appoint two employee trustees
who participate in the pension plan and two who participate in the DC plan, as well as two Directors
appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a permanent member of the Trusts, to
serve as the same trustees on both trusts.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) Program
Participation Consideration

Committee Meeting Date:
September 13, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Leah Riley, Chief Administrative Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In November 2020, Colorado voters approved Proposition 118, the Family and Medical Leave Insurance
Program (FAMLI), which created a statewide paid family and medical leave insurance program. Employee
benefits under FAMLI are funded by a 0.9% premium on employee wages, split between the employee
and the employer. Premium collections for participating entities begin January 2023, and benefits begin
January 2024.
For local government entities that opt to participate in FAMLI, the program supplements the provisions
of the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which provides eligible employees up to 12 weeks
of unpaid job-protected leave per year for specified reasons, by providing eligible employees access to
12 weeks of paid medical and family leave. FMLA also provides military leave entitlements for those on
active duty or on call to active duty.
FAMLI provides 12 weeks of paid leave per year for the same reasons as FMLA but goes beyond by:
• Covering a percentage of an employee’s salary during the leave
• Extending the definition of family member beyond immediate family to grandparents,
grandchildren, siblings and any other individual with whom the employee has a significant
personal bond
• Providing safe leaves for the employee if they or a family member are the victim of domestic
violence, stalking, sexual assault or abuse
• Providing an additional four weeks of leave for complications due to pregnancy or childbirth
Eligibility for FAMLI is based on earnings, whereas FMLA is based on length of employment. An
employee becomes eligible for FAMLI after earning at least $2,500 in wages within the previous four
quarters, whereas the person would need to be employed by the same employer for at least 12 months
and would need to have worked a minimum of 1,250 hours to be eligible for FMLA. Leave for any
qualifying reason under FAMLI that also qualifies under FMLA runs concurrently.
Paid benefits under FAMLI equate to 90 percent of the State Average Weekly Wage (SAWW) plus 50
percent of the employee’s wage above SAWW, up to a $1,100 weekly max. As of May 2022, the
SAWW annual salary equivalent is $63,024.

Packet Pg. 114

1.E.1

FAMLI is designed to run concurrently with FMLA. Employees will be able to use FAMLI and FMLA
leaves for circumstances covered by both laws. Eligible employees may take FAMLI related leave for
circumstances not covered by FMLA. Employers cannot require that an employee first use their accrued
paid time off or sick/vacation leave to be paid under FAMLI.
Local governments1 have three options under the FAMLI provisions:
1. Participate fully
2. Decline participation fully
3. Decline employer participation and provide an alternative
A local government that elects to fully participate in FAMLI must remain in the program and agree to pay
premiums for a minimum of three years. An employee of a local government that has declined
participation may elect coverage and pay 50 percent of the required premium.
The governing body of a local government that elects to decline participation, whether fully or for the
employer only, must take testimony and provide notice to employees and the opportunity to submit
comments through a public process prior to final action. In addition, notice of the final action must be
provided to employees and the FAMLI Division of the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment
must be notified of the outcome by January 1, 2023.
As of the submission date of this Discussion Item, the Colorado municipalities that have opted-out of
FAMLI include:
• City and County of Denver
• City of Golden
• City of Lafayette
• City of Loveland
• City of Wheat Ridge
• City of Black Hawk
• City of Greenwood Village
• City of Louisville
• Town of Silverthorne
• Town of Frisco
DISCUSSION
Staff anticipates returning to the Board in the October 2022 meeting cycle with a recommended action
for the Board’s consideration regarding the agency’s participation or non-participation in the FAMLI
program.

“Local government” means any county, city and county, town, school district, special district, authority, or other political
subdivision of the state.

1.E.1

Staff has begun the employee notification process regarding FAMLI program participation to ensure
understanding and awareness. This advance notification goes above and beyond FAMLI requirements
and will allow ample time for employees to prepare for public testimony at the Board meeting during
which FAMLI participation is considered for final action.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated financial impact of opting in to FAMLI is $2,022,683 for the initial program year, split
equally between the agency and employees.

BACKGROUND
RTD's Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) mission is to facilitate TOD opportunities that increase
ridership and enhance transit investments throughout the District through station design and close
coordination with local jurisdictions and developers. The agency plays a proactive role in facilitating
transit-supportive development around transit stations and strives to realize the following goals:
• Promote multi-sector, cross-jurisdictional partnerships
• Encourage sustainable development that supports the transit system
• Ensure a hierarchy of multi-modal access
• Protect and enhance RTD’s transit assets
Pursuant to the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, the Planning Department is responsible for increasing revenue
from development on RTD land year over year.
DISCUSSION
Development at and around RTD stations is constantly evolving. The presentation provides details on
current projects advancing on RTD land, including 29th•Welton, 38th•Blake and Sheridan Stations;
updates on past projects, such as Sheridan Station Apartments, Alameda Station and Olde Town Arvada
Station; and information about progress towards the goal of the Equitable TOD Policy of 2021, the
current status of unsolicited proposals RTD received from developers, and highlights from the recently
published TOD Status Report, which covers development in station areas through the end of 2021.

Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager
Carl Green, Jr., Acting Director, Civil Rights
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Since RTD implemented the most recent fare changes derived from the Pass Program Study
recommendations in 2019, the agency has received feedback from many customers and stakeholders
stating that current fares and pass programs are overly expensive and complicated. RTD is also
experiencing other changes that affect the outlook on fare policy. Like many other agencies in the United
States, there has been a consistent concerning trend of declining ridership over the last several years.
That trend dramatically worsened due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.
DISCUSSION
The Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis project began in December 2021. The project team has
now completed the second round of public engagement where conceptual fare options were introduced
along with conceptual evaluation criteria. Community engagement and outreach efforts included:
•
•

Customer and community meetings held in English and Spanish
Feedback panels representing equity, pass programs, and jurisdictional stakeholders

Additionally, the project team conducted internal staff outreach and presented updates.
The presentation provides an overview of the study goals and schedule; summary of the feedback
received from the outreach activities in June and July 2022; the Alternatives Evaluation; concepts under
consideration; conceptual options to be modeled; and next steps with a summary of upcoming
community engagement and outreach activities.
