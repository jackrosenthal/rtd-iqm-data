Information

INFORMATION
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
The Performance Report is presented for Board review each quarter according to Fiscal Policy Statement,
Budget Policy 10. These year-to-date measures provide a framework in which RTD determines how well
it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within its mission statement
objectives.
DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Third Quarter of 2020. Of the 42 performance measures
tracked for the GM, RTD met 34 of the goals (81%) in Q3. The following is a review of the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – Maintain system-wide on time performance
Regional (bus) on-time service of 85.8% was below goal of 88.0%. For regional bus service, the
pandemic service plan has been problematic such that by adopting a Saturday schedule for weekday
service. There were significant changes to many routes in September that should improve on-time
performance.
Goal 6.1 – Maintain all required recovery ratios
The Operating Cost Recovery ratio was 12.6% through Q3 and below goal of 20%. This ratio measures
farebox revenue and other operating revenue coverage of operating and administrative costs (excluding
ADA costs and interest expense). The measure was not met due to a large decline in farebox revenue in
Q2 and Q3 due to the pandemic.
Goal 6.2 – Increase in Ridership
Q3 ridership for 2020 was down 45.7% from same time in 2019. Through Q1, the decline was
centered in bus service mirroring the national trend, but Q2 and Q3 ridership were negatively impacted
by the pandemic throughout the system. This goal is an annual measure and we will continue to
monitor.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
Q3 fare revenue and total operating revenue were down 51.6% and 49.9%, respectively, from the same
time in 2019 due to the impact of the pandemic in Q2 and Q3. These goals for 2020 are annual
measures based on the 2020 budget.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
Bus operator vacancies, bus mechanic vacancies, and light rail operator vacancies exceeded their goals
through Q3 due to measuring actual headcount versus authorized headcount. The current authorized

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

headcount exceeds the headcount necessary to deliver the current level of service. Once the authorized
headcount is adjusted with the 2021 budget these measurements should be within goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact from this informational item.

Executive Summary

In 2016, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) mandated ‘Transit Asset Management Plans’ for all
federally-funded transit agencies in the United States by October 2018. The FTA is concerned about
the sustainability of transit assets when the backlog of renewals is estimated at $98 billion
nationwide. The Federal Government’s Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) said
the time had come to change focus from construction to longer term stewardship (2012).
This Regional Transportation District (RTD) Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan is a formal report
that meets the FTA TAM requirements under MAP-21.
A Transit Asset Management Plan (TAMP) is the cornerstone of asset stewardship. It is the public
case for investment in the assets, to justify the use of tax dollars and fares to meet community
requirements. It aims to demonstrate the best use of funding to deliver services now and into the
future.
Accordingly, this document summarizes:
•

The principles RTD uses to make asset decisions aligned to Agency priorities

•

What assets RTD uses in the provision of public transportation

•

The current state of those assets for which RTD has capital responsibility

•

How RTD makes asset investment decisions

•

The proposed capital investment plan for the period 2020-2025

•

Actions to further improve asset management decision making

•

How this plan will be evaluated for continuous improvement

RTD, like all transit agencies, is highly asset-intensive. In the past fifteen years, RTD has spent $5.5
billion on expansion, including new rail and bus rapid transit lines.
When MAP-21 was passed in 2012, RTD appointed dedicated staff to focus on asset management and
began to review both its asset inventory data (the details of what assets RTD owns and manages) and
the condition of these assets, using the principle of State of Good Repair (SGR). Both of these are
now requirements from the FTA.
RTD then made the decision to move beyond FTA minimum requirements and commit to
implementing established international good practice in the form of ISO 55000 certification. This is
focused on better decision-making across the asset portfolio for asset optimization. By 2017, RTD
had put in place the first steps towards an integrated process to prioritize all capital investment by
agency objectives. This has further been refined to categorize all investment proposals by
Compliance, Renewal, or Enhancement, with the intention of funding them in that order to ensure
good stewardship. This encourages investment in maintaining existing assets before funding new
asset or non-asset projects.
This process forms the basis for this TAM Plan, along with RTD’s commitment to continue to develop
its asset management practices.
RTD is actively involved in transit asset management thought-leadership, through the American Public
Transportation Association (APTA) and Transportation Research Board (TRB). RTD examples were
used by the FTA in its TAM Facility Performance Measure Reporting Guidebook (U.S. Department of
Transportation, 2018). RTD believes that a shift in culture is needed towards improved stewardship
of assets using better information and decision tools.
RTD’s long-term strategy is to make consistently good decisions across RTD’s asset portfolio and asset
systems to deliver customer needs in a financially sustainable and safe way, using the ISO 55000
framework. This effort has led to the implementation of an investment planning process for planning
and budgeting, as well as the goal of achieving ISO 55000 certification.
An ISO 55000 health check, a mid-point review of the entire RTD Asset Management System against
the requirements of ISO 55000, was conducted in 2019. The health check identified risks to achieving
certification, one of which was lack of “leadership and commitment” (AMCL, 2019). Shortly after the
health check, RTD’s CEO/GM announced their retirement and in 2020 an interim CEO/GM was hired
to helm the Agency while a search was conducted for a permanent replacement.
RTD’s previously stated target of attaining ISO 55000 certification by the end of 2020 has been further
delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the pandemic Agency resources have been
reallocated or reduced, however the Agency still intends to achieve certification and is actively
making progress towards that goal.
The Asset Management System (AMS) in RTD is being developed in close coordination with the safety
management system, with both informed by a risk-based prioritization approach with the intention of
developing that approach into a corporate risk framework.
RTD exists to move people effectively and efficiently, and the focus here is to ensure effective
stewardship of the assets that deliver this purpose. The communities RTD serves should know what

inventory?

On an annual basis, RTD executes a process which prepares and updates a six-year
Mid Term Financial Plan including projected capital construction and
improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the
capital and operating programs. Part of the process includes prioritizing the
projects into three funding categories: Compliance, Renewal, and Enhancement.



4. PRIORITIZED LIST OF INVESTMENTS

What is the result or
output of those decision
support tools and
processes?

The output of the annual Mid Term Financial Plan process is two primary lists of
projects; Capital Projects & Capital Maintenance Projects. Each list is subdivided
into three funding categories: Compliance, Renewal, and Enhancement.

5. TAM AND SGR POLICY

What are the guiding
principles for asset
management efforts at
RTD?

RTD adopted an Asset Management Policy in June 2014 and most recently
updated July 2019.
The intent of the policy is to improve how RTD manages assets from now on - it is
therefore forward-looking in nature and represents the Agency’s vision and
shared commitment for good Asset Management at RTD. The Asset Management
System applies to the entire organization and directs the short, medium, and longterm plans for assets to achieve the Agency purpose of moving people.



6. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

How is RTD going to
execute the TAM plan?

RTD has chosen ISO 55000 as the framework to build its Asset Management
System. As part of that choice, RTD underwent a gap assessment to determine
the necessary tasks needed to achieve ISO 55000 certification.



7. LIST OF KEY ANNUAL ACTIVITIES

What activities does RTD
perform to maintain its
TAM system?

RTD identifies two types of asset management activities: those ongoing asset
management activities that RTD performs as part of ‘business as usual,’ and those
activities specific to achieving ISO 55000 certification. TAM activities are the
subset of these ISO activities targeting specific TAM elements.



8. IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES

What resources are
needed to execute RTD
TAM plan activities?

Personnel from across the Agency are involved in RTD’s Asset Management
activities, including the CEO/GM, the Senior Leadership Team, the Asset
Management Division (AMD), Bus Operations, Rail Operations, Capital Programs,
Finance and Administration, Communications, Planning, and General Counsel.



The AMD has expertise that enables the Agency to mature asset management
practices. From 2012 through 2016, the AMD added additional staff in two key
areas: physical asset business analysis and data science.
9. EVALUATION PLAN

What is the Agency
doing to ensure that the
TAM plan delivers the
intended results?

There are two primary areas of the Evaluation Plan; the TAM Plan itself and ISO
55000.
The current TAM Plan provides the baseline for evaluating future TAM Plans
produced by the Agency. RTD intends to regularly review its asset management
maturity, setting maturity targets in its Strategic Asset Management Plan.
RTD intends to evaluate the degree to which it is meeting the requirements for
ISO 55000, and therefore its readiness for an ISO 55001 certification audit,
through the following measures:



• ISO spot checks
• ISO health check
• ISO mock audit
• ISO audit
• ISO surveillance audits

1 Introduction
1.1

Background

On June 29, 2012, Congress passed MAP-21. In accordance with section 20019 of this law, the
Federal Transit Administration established standards that transit providers shall follow. The final rule
was published on July 26, 2016 in the Federal Register with an effective date of October 1, 2016
(Transit Asset Management; National Transit Database, 2016). RTD is a Tier I Agency, so all the
requirements apply.
The FTA requirements for a Transit Asset Management Plan are as follows:
Tier

Element
1. An inventory of
assets

Brief Description
A register of capital assets and information about those
assets.

2. A condition
assessment of
inventoried assets

A rating of the assets' physical state; to be completed for
assets an agency has direct capital responsibility for;
should be at a level of detail sufficient to monitor and
predict performance of inventoried assets.

3. Description of a
decision support tool

An analytic process or tool that (1) assists in capital asset
investment prioritization and/or (2) estimates capital
needs over time (does not necessarily mean software).

4. A prioritized list of
investments

A prioritized list of projects or programs to manage or
improve the SGR of capital assets.

5. TAM and SGR policy

A TAM policy is the executive-level direction regarding
expectations for transit asset management; a TAM strategy
consists of the actions that support the implementation of
the TAM policy.

6. Implementation
strategy

The operational actions that a transit provider decides to
conduct, in order to achieve its TAM goals and policies.

7. List of key annual
activities

The actions needed to implement a TAM plan for each year
of the plan's horizon.

8. Identification of

Asset Management Policy

A TAM policy is a documented commitment to achieving and maintaining a state of good repair for all
capital assets. The FTA has defined state of good repair as “The condition in which a capital asset is
able to operate at a full level of performance” (Transit Asset Management; National Transit Database,
2016).
RTD’s Asset Management Policy was updated on July 31, 2019. The policy describes a forwardlooking commitment to good asset management practice, intended to pursue investment
optimization across the entire asset portfolio to maximize its value. Value means delivering on the
agency objectives, two of which are safety and reliability. Asset management performed according to
this policy will result in assets that are in a state of good repair.

2 RTD and its Assets

The Regional Transportation District provides transportation services to 3.08 million people located
within its 2,400 square mile service area, including bus, rail, shuttles, ADA paratransit services,
demand responsive services like FlexRide, and special event services. Using these assets, RTD delivers
59 million service miles, across 142 routes, including 86 local bus, 8 light rail and 3 commuter rail
routes.

2.1

The RTD Story

RTD was created in 1969 by the 47th session of the Colorado General Assembly. Efforts
in these early years focused on regional transportation planning. In 1973, voters
approved a 0.5% sales tax initiative to finance a multi-modal transit system. At this
time, RTD acquired privately owned bus companies, improved service frequencies, and
expanded routes in numerous counties throughout the metro area. By 1976, ridership
grew to 35 million rides annually.

RTD celebrated its first light rail opening in October 1994. The 5.3-mile D Line attracted
hundreds of thousands of riders when it began operations with just eleven light rail
vehicles. Now, eight light rail lines service 57 stations along 7 individually constructed
corridors.
In November 2004, region voters approved the FasTracks transit tax for region-wide
expansion of transit service. The 0.04% sales tax provides funds to build RTD’s FasTracks program,
122 miles of new commuter rail and light rail, 18 miles of bus rapid transit, and bus stations. The
program consists of six new rapid transit corridors and three existing corridor extensions, and
expands and enhances service for easy, convenient bus/rail connections across the eight-county
district.

2.2

RTD Service Area

The RTD service area comprises eight counties including all of Boulder, Broomfield, Denver and
Jefferson counties, parts of Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas counties, and a small portion of Weld
County.

At the turn of the millennium RTD had approximately 77 million passenger trips (U.S. Department of
Transportation, 2000) and 105 million passenger trips in 2019, a 30% increase in boardings. Over the
same period, per the Colorado State Demography’s Office, the Denver Boulder region has increased
from approximately 2.4 million residents to approximately 3.2 million residents, a 31% increase
(2019).

RTD Assets

RTD is an asset-intensive organization. RTD’s Statement of Net Position notes that total capital assets
sum to nearly $9.2 billion (Regional Transportation District, 2020). Much of this total expenditure
resulted in assets in the scope of Transit Asset Management. This section provides further details on
RTD’s asset inventory and condition for assets in-scope of TAM.
As assets are operated, their condition degrades over time and their risk of failure increases. Failures
can manifest themselves in a variety of ways, including those having an impact on safety. Asset
condition is therefore a leading indicator for safety risks, and so understanding asset condition today,
and how quickly it might degrade in the future, is an important aspect of good asset, safety and risk
management. Organizations that know their assets’ deterioration rates can also make more
informed decisions on renewal frequencies and their approach to preventive maintenance.
For the purposes of this TAMP, RTD has categorized its assets in accordance with FTA guidelines:
revenue vehicles, equipment, facilities, and infrastructure, using the logic depicted in Figure 5 below,
which ensures repeatable results and an improvement in inventory data quality.

Revenue Vehicles

RTD’s revenue vehicles comprise 1,464 buses and 199 light rail vehicles. Sixty-six commuter rail
vehicles are operated and maintained by a third-party, Denver Transit Operators (DTO).
Buses include fixed route standard transit buses which are 40 feet long and carry 40 passengers; fixed
route articulated buses with 33% greater capacity than standard buses; regional intercity coaches,
such as the Flatiron Flyer, built for longer trips at highway speed which are typically 45 feet long and
have a seated capacity of 55 passengers; and cutaways which are made by second stage
manufacturers, using the chassis of full size vans, and used to provide on-demand service for some
ADA passengers (Access-a-Ride) and in areas where ridership does not support fixed route service
(FlexRide).
RTD buses are procured from a variety of manufacturers including: Gillig, BYD, New Flyer, MCI,
Goshen, Eldorado, and Startrans. Approximately 50% of standard and articulated (fixed route) buses
are operated and maintained by RTD, with the operations and maintenance for the remainder
outsourced 6 to two external partner companies (First Transit and TransDev). All intercity coaches are
operated and maintained by RTD, and all cutaway buses are operated and maintained by third-parties
(Via Transportation, MV Transportation and Evergreen Senior Center).

Figure 6: Transit Bus (Gillig)

Figure 7: Articulated Bus (New Flyer)

6 Buses operated by third-parties are sometimes referred to as ‘contracted services.’

Light rail vehicles (LRV) are electrically-powered using a 750-volt DC overhead catenary system.
Individual vehicles can be coupled together to form up to four cars per consist, with a seated capacity
of 64. LRVs can carry up to 236 passengers per car utilizing the standing room. All light rail vehicles
are manufactured by Siemens and are acquired, owned, operated and maintained by RTD.

Figure 10: Light Rail Vehicle (Siemens SD-160)

All commuter rail vehicles are delivered under the FasTracks program and their ongoing operation
and maintenance is outsourced to a third-party, Denver Transit Operators. RTD will assume
ownership at the end of the contracted period of performance (30 years). Condition assessments will
not be performed on these assets until such time as RTD assumes capital responsibility for the
vehicles.

Figure 11: Commuter Rail Vehicle (Hyundai Rotem)

RTD has historically managed its revenue vehicle inventory based on age: the vehicles are procured,
maintained in a state of good repair for a specified number of years through a preventative
maintenance program, and then replaced. This approach is adopted for revenue vehicles maintained
by third-parties, including bus and commuter rail.
Table 3 below presents the total number of revenue vehicles for which RTD has capital responsibility,
along with their Useful Life Benchmark (ULB), which is the expected duration in years that an asset
will remain in service according to RTD’s standards and the average condition based on its age. The
condition range is from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the vehicle is significantly beyond its useful life
benchmark and 5 is considered brand new. A vehicle that has reached the end of its useful life
benchmark is scored at 2.5 and from that point onwards is considered in backlog.
RTD’s current renewal approach for revenue vehicles is to keep them operating reliably and safely
beyond their useful life benchmark with maintenance intervals and interventions based on cost and
performance trade-offs. Table 3 provides the backlog for each vehicle type. RTD uses the FTA
definition for revenue vehicle backlog, which is the percentage of revenue vehicles that have met or
exceeded their useful life benchmark (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2016).
RTD’s bus fleet has been a focus of renewals, however some transit buses are now considered to be
in backlog. Based on a combination of vehicle performance, condition, and cost of maintaining rather
than replacing vehicles, some transit buses will continue to be operated in backlog.
Table 3 also presents the total initial capital cost 7 of the vehicles in each sub-fleet.

7 In the future, RTD intends to determine the whole-life cost (e.g., capex and opex) of its assets and this will be considered

for inclusion in a subsequent generation of the TAMP.

Facilities

For the purposes of this TAMP, RTD has: 5 administrative facilities where RTD administrative
functions take place; 9 maintenance facilities where maintenance work takes place; 123 public
facilities which includes stations, buildings and other structures where riders can board or disembark
from an RTD transit vehicle; and 111 conveyances (elevators and escalators), installed within facilities
but are treated here separately based on National Transit Database (NTD) reporting requirements.
Administrative, maintenance, and public facilities for which RTD has capital responsibility are
operated and maintained by RTD, although some services, such as cleaning and snow removal, may
be contracted to third-parties. Conveyance manufacturers include Kone and ThyssenKrupp and their
maintenance is outsourced to third-parties.

Figure 16: Bus Maintenance Facility

RTD has historically managed its facilities (and their related equipment) on a reactive basis, i.e.,
maintain or replace the assets when they fail. The more critical facility elements, such as
underground storage tanks and boilers, have redundancy built in to minimize service interruptions
when they fail to perform as designed. RTD fully complies with all regulations relating to safety
inspections for certain facility assets (Regional Transportation District, 2016).

9 The Agency has not yet been able to determine an appropriate EUL for all equipment types.
10 Age scores and backlog are dependent on establishing an EUL.

From 2015 onwards, RTD has performed in-house assessments to determine the condition score of
individual elements of each facility for which RTD has capital responsibility. As such, facility condition
scores are assessment-based.

Figure 17: Light Rail Maintenance Facility

Figure 18: Public Facility

The condition score of each of the elements that exist at an Administrative or Maintenance facility is
averaged to provide the condition score of the facility. Currently, each extant facility element is
weighted equally. The following table presents the elements of each facility that are assigned an
individual condition score. Not all facilities have all listed elements.

Figure 19: Conveyance (elevator)

Conveyance inspections are outsourced to third-parties in accordance with applicable legislation and
regulations but are not used to determine condition. Condition scores for conveyances for which RTD
has capital responsibility are age-based, based on an Estimate Useful Life (EUL) of 25 years (Regional
Transportation District, 2016). Conveyance SGR condition scores are linearly mapped to age, with
brand new conveyances assigned a score of 5.0, conveyances between 25-30 years old assigned a
score of 2.5, and conveyances older than 37 years assigned a score of 1.0. A conveyance that has
reached the end of its estimated useful life is scored at 2.5 and from that point onwards is considered
in backlog.
Table 8 presents the total number of facility assets for which RTD has capital responsibility, along with
their EUL and a score representing the condition of the asset. The table provides backlog for each
asset, for which RTD uses the FTA definition for facilities backlog, the percentage of facilities with a
condition rating below 3.0 on the FTA Transit Economic Requirements Model (TERM) scale (U.S.
Department of Transportation, 2018).
Tables 8 and 9 also present the total initial capital cost for each asset type.

Infrastructure

For the purposes of this TAMP, RTD has light rail
infrastructure (including grade crossings, catenary wire
segments, track, relay cases, switches, and substations),
light rail vehicle bridges, and commuter rail alignments
operated and maintained by a third-party.

Figure 20: Light Rail Vehicle Bridge

Light rail infrastructure is purchased or constructed by a
variety of manufacturers, and is owned, operated and
maintained by RTD. All commuter rail infrastructure is
Figure 21: Track Infrastructure
delivered under the FasTracks program and its ongoing
operation and maintenance is outsourced to a third-party, Denver Transit Operators. RTD will
assume ownership for commuter rail infrastructure at the end of the contracted period of
performance (30 years). Condition assessments will not be performed on these assets until such time
as RTD assumes capital responsibility.
RTD has historically managed light rail infrastructure assets based on age but performed condition
assessments of right-of-way light rail infrastructure for three years which better established the asset
types and inventory, determined condition scores for each type of asset and refined the anticipated
renewal frequencies for some assets. In doing so, RTD determined that age-based condition scores
provided similar levels of accuracy as assessment-based condition scores, and so has stopped
performing condition assessments. As such, light rail infrastructure condition scores are age-based
(Regional Transportation District, 2017).
Seventy light rail vehicle bridges are owned and maintained by RTD. Seven light rail vehicle bridges
are owned and maintained by third-parties.
Light rail vehicle bridges are inspected biannually by an independent third-party contractor per state
law. The inspection reports received by the inspection agency describe the condition of seven bridge
elements: abutments, caps, deck, girders/beams, head/wing walls, PPC (pillars, piers, columns) and

railings. The inspection report condition data is turned into an SGR score from 1 to 5 for each
element. All the element scores are averaged together to give an SGR score for the bridge (Regional
Transportation District, 2016). As such, condition scores for bridges for which RTD has capital
responsibility are assessment-based. Condition assessments for bridges owned and maintained by
third-parties are not recorded in the TAMP.
Tables 11 and 12 present the total number of light rail infrastructure assets for which RTD has capital
responsibility, along with their Estimated Useful Life (EUL) and age-based condition and backlog
scores.
Table 13 presents the total number of light rail vehicle bridges for which RTD has capital
responsibility, along with their EUL and assessment-based condition scores.
Table 14 presents the FTA performance measure for infrastructure which is the percentage of
guideway directional route miles (DRM) with performance restrictions by class. However, RTD
anticipates that the guideway under performance restriction may not be an adequate measure of
condition for rail infrastructure assets in the future (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2017).
There are many reasons why rail infrastructure assets would be under a temporary performance
restriction: routine maintenance, inspection personnel in the right of way, police activity at or near
crossings. These reasons provide no indication of the condition of the assets. Additionally, track
assets that are in very poor condition but exist in a high-density urban environment may not have a
performance restriction because the design speed is so low to begin with. This case also fails to give
any indication of the condition of the assets. The age of these assets along with physical inspections
will likely be more useful for investment decisions; consequently, RTD also provides age-based
condition and backlog scores for light rail infrastructure assets.
RTD’s first light rail line opened in 1994. Those 1994 assets with an EUL of 25 years are currently
shown in backlog in Table 11, however this may not reflect the true condition of the assets. Major
repairs to assets, such as replacing or refurbishing components, which extends the life of those
assets, have not been recorded in a system of record. The Asset Management Division is working
with light rail maintenance of way to improve asset information and begin recording major repairs of
assets in a system of record for reporting, compliance, and planning purposes.
Tables 11, 12, and 13 also present the total initial capital cost for each asset type.

3 Current Capital Investment Decision Process

The Capital Improvement Policy of RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement states that “On an annual basis, RTD
will prepare and update a six-year Mid Term Financial Plan including projected capital construction
and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating
programs” (Regional Transportation District, 2016).
The Mid Term Financial Plan also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit
funding through the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional
Council of Governments (DRCOG). The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region
that receive federal funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying Mid
Term Financial Plan projects are included in the TIP.
In 2020, at the time of reporting, RTD’s Board of Directors has yet to approve an updated Mid Term
Financial Plan for the period 2021-2026. The Board is also considering shortening the budget
planning cycle to two years in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the foreseen difficulty in
developing the traditional six-year planning model (Regional Transportation District, 2020).
Projects initiated in 2020 and currently underway will continue to be funded. However, funding for
future projects may be reactionary rather than adhere to the established Capital Improvement Policy.
As an updated Mid Term Financial Plan has not been approved at the time of this reporting nor has
the Capital Improvement Policy been amended, the following process and list of prioritized
investments is based on the 2020-2025 Mid Term Financial Plan.
The 2020-2025 Mid Term Financial Plan includes projects funded from the base system’s 0.6% sales
and use taxes. Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2020-2025 are
presented separately in the FasTracks financial plan (Regional Transportation District, 2016).
The process used to prioritize investments for the 2020-2025 Mid Term Financial Plan is built upon a
legacy project prioritization process. The process is shown in Figure 22 below, and detailed in
Appendix C.
For some years, RTD has been improving the sophistication of its investment prioritization system.
RTD has moved from a process that was primarily the product of professional judgement to a more
standardized method of evaluating capital projects.
Significant effort has recently been placed into the development of an investment planning process.
The intent of this process is to align all investment with the Asset Management Policy, Agency
Objectives, and Strategic Asset Management Plan.
An important additional element of an investment planning process is an evaluation step. This step
will determine the degree to which projects came in at budget and on-time, as well as if they
delivered stated outcomes. Stated outcomes will be part of a required business case that describes
the intended effect of the capital project on the agency objectives. This will better allow RTD to
continuously improve its investment prioritization process.

One key step implemented toward the next generation process is classifying and prioritizing capital
projects based on three categories:
1. Compliance
2. Renewal
3. Enhancement
The aim is asset-focused investments to prioritize sustainable management of existing assets over
expansion of the transit system. An investment planning process will serve as one of RTD’s decision
support tools.

5 Improving Asset Management Capabilities at RTD

As a relatively young agency, RTD has not experienced the decaying infrastructure or immediate
funding shortages that many older and larger transit systems have. Historically, RTD had the
necessary funding in place and the professional expertise to maintain its transit assets in a state of
good repair while keeping up with the growing demand for service. However, the COVID-19
pandemic has resulted in a projected budget deficit of $215 million in 2021, and in response Agency
resources have been reallocated or reduced.
RTD’s asset management maturity improvement initiative was not initially driven by a growing set of
decaying assets, but by the expansion of the asset base in recent years. Beginning with the T-REX
project and continuing with the current FasTracks project, over the past 15 years RTD has spent over
$5.5 billion on new rail and bus rapid transit lines.
The funding for the most recent expansion projects did not make provision for the long-term
maintenance and capital renewal of the new assets. Without a solid, long-term renewal plan in place,
with funding earmarked, the risk of a growing backlog of renewal projects without adequate funding
is too great. A growing backlog increases risk to safety, service, and future sustainability. It feeds a
pattern of expensive reactionary repair and remediation tasks.
RTD’s bold increase in the scope of its transit system requires a more rigorous management process
than in the past if it is to maximize value from the assets. To avoid the asset condition backlog that
plagues some agencies, RTD intends to take the path toward good whole-life asset management
while the assets are relatively new.
RTD is preparing an Asset Management Plan (AMP) that addresses future funding needs for existing
assets, prioritizing renewals over enhancements. The original cost of assets is less useful to the
Agency than projected future costs, therefore RTD’s efforts emphasize creating accurate and
increasingly precise estimates of what investments are needed over the coming budget planning
cycle.
The AMP is the combined output of individual Asset Class Strategies that focus on what will need to
be renewed, when it will need to be renewed, and the expected costs of renewals. The AMP will
populate the renewal bucket of the investment prioritization process. The projected funding needs
over the period 2021-2027 are illustrated in the graphs that follow.

Strategic Asset Management Plan

RTD aims to comply fully with MAP-21 requirements for transit asset management and beyond. It
has developed an overall Strategic Asset Management Plan to summarize its strategy to improve
asset management over the next period.
From 2004, with the publication of BSI PAS-55, and then ISO 55000 in 2014, organizations have been
able to exploit a standardized good practice framework for implementing an aligned Asset
Management System.
Typically, organizations have started with a focus on asset information: particularly the inventory of
all their assets, and assessing asset condition. This information supports clearer planning, because
now the organization knows what assets it has and what state they are in. But the aim is not just a
clear plan to cover all the assets, but a prioritized and optimized plan based on understanding the
risks to objectives, and using this to make the best use of limited resources.
RTD has invested heavily in both its asset inventory and asset condition measures over the past five
years, and started on its journey to an integrated planning process that will optimize its asset base.
The current strategy is to achieve certification to ISO 55000, and use this as the foundation to align
the management of its assets to the Agency purpose and objectives.

In 2017, RTD commissioned an external gap assessment comparing current practices to the ISO 55000
standard. The results of the gap assessment were used to create an Asset Management Roadmap for
the Agency to achieve certification to the ISO standard (AMCL, 2017). The Roadmap is included in
Appendix D.

Figure 29: Gap Assessment Results

Key Annual Activities

RTD identifies two types of asset management activity: those ongoing asset management activities
that RTD performs as part of ‘business as usual,’ and those activities specific to achieving ISO 55000
certification. TAM activities are the subset of these targeting the specific TAM elements, and these
are pulled out into a third section here.

Business As Usual Asset Management Activities
As an asset-intensive organization, RTD already performs a number of asset management activities on
a routine basis, and these will continue and improve through the plan horizon of this document.
This section summarizes those ‘business as usual’ activities, using The Institute of Asset
Management’s Conceptual Model for Asset Management to categorize into six main blocks (2015).
This should not be interpreted to imply these ongoing activities are all necessarily well aligned or
integrated at the moment.

Figure 31: The Institute of Asset Management (IAM) Conceptual Model for Asset Management

The RTD Planning Department periodically conducts demand analysis for its
transit service and uses this to support long-term strategic planning for system
optimization, expansion and enhancement. Strategic planning for capital
renewals and maintenance volumes is not currently formally performed, however RTD anticipates
enhancing its capabilities in this area through the development of Asset Class Strategies and an Asset
Management Plan (see next section for details). Although not yet a ‘business as usual’ activity, in
undertaking the development of this TAM Plan, RTD has started on Asset Management Planning.
RTD’s current approach to capital investment decision-making is described in
Section 3, and this activity is performed annually to develop RTD’s Mid Term
Financial Plan. Operations and maintenance decision-making is performed
within each asset owner group, but does not currently formally consider or align with agency
objectives.
Ongoing activities include capital project processes for asset acquisition,
which is split between Capital Programs for Commuter Rail (FasTracks) and
Facility assets, and Operations for Rail, Bus and Rail Infrastructure assets.
Compliance with appropriate technical standards and legislation is ensured within the capital projects
and operations/maintenance functions, with some basic configuration management principles

applied to in-house engineering designs. Maintenance delivery occurs for each major asset class and
includes preventive and corrective maintenance, along with condition assessments. Some asset
classes have a larger focus on preventative maintenance, while others have more emphasis on
corrective maintenance and maintain assets when they fail. Most maintenance delivery is performed
by RTD staff, with some being outsourced. Asset operations is a significant part of RTD’s ongoing
activities, and includes bus, rail, equipment and infrastructure operations, some of which is also
outsourced. Basic resource management principles are applied to ensure enough operational
resources are available as needed. RTD also performs shutdown and outage management of its
assets to enable maintenance access. As assets develop operating faults, RTD implements its fault
and incident response plans in accordance with agreed methods.
RTD uses several asset information systems to manage its Asset Information,
including Trapeze EAM for asset inventory and maintenance management,
and the Oracle Enterprise Business Suite for related financial information.
There are several basic data and information management processes in effect, including regular
reporting to the National Transit Database (NTD), and regular data quality assessment and cleansing
processes for Trapeze EAM information. RTD’s Asset Management Division employs a Data Science &
Analytics team to handle collection of non-physical data, perform data assurance tasks on corporate
data and perform all FTA TAM Reporting.
RTD applies some procurement and supply chain management principles for
its outsourced asset management functions. These include the capital
delivery of its FasTracks program, along with some ongoing operations and
maintenance of the assets the program delivers. The operation and
maintenance of approximately half of RTD’s bus services is outsourced among two service providers,
and the maintenance of certain facility assets, such as elevators is also outsourced.
RTD’s Finance group uses standard accounting practices to perform asset
costing and valuation, including their valuation and deprecation over time.
The Asset Management Division employs an Asset Compliance Manager and
an Asset Performance Manager. Some informal stakeholder management
principles are applied for engaging and managing key external stakeholders.

ISO 55000 Activities

In addition to the ongoing asset management activities described above, RTD also has activities
defined as part of its plan towards ISO 55000, or its Asset Management Roadmap.
The central requirement for ISO 55000 is to design, implement, maintain and continually improve an
Asset Management System based on Plan-Do-Check-Act principles. Once certification is achieved,
ongoing ISO 55000 activities will continue to occur indefinitely to maintain and continually improve
the AMS, while many of the ISO 55000 practices will transition to become ‘business as usual.’
The Roadmap and associated detailed activities are held in the ISO 55000 Gap Assessment and
Roadmap report, but a summary is provided below:

Resourcing Strategy

This section describes the resourcing strategy and plans to support the annual activities described
above.
Resources from across the Agency are involved in RTD’s Asset Management (AM) activities, including
the CEO/GM, the Senior Leadership Team, the Asset Management Division, Bus Operations, Rail
Operations, Capital Programs, Finance and Administration, Communications, Planning, and General
Counsel.

Business As Usual Asset Management activities

The resourcing strategy for the ‘business as usual’ annual Asset Management activities is to continue
with the current strategy, i.e. resourcing the activities through the Agency departments that currently
perform or are involved in them.

As ISO 55000 and TAM activities become ‘business as usual’ over time, it is anticipated that changes
to the current resources may arise.

ISO 55000 Strategy Activities

ISO 55000 requires the establishment of a functioning, effective, sufficiently-resourced management
system for assets. The resourcing strategy is to establish clear accountability and responsibility for
the Asset Management System, with the authority to direct and allocate resources being granted to
the accountable group. The diagram below illustrates the accountability structure and other
contributors.

Figure 32: ISO 55000 Contributing Resource Groups

In late 2011, RTD assigned two people the task of building an Asset Management Division (AMD). The
Division would be responsible for improving the management of assets and building an Agency-wide
Asset Management System.
It was important to the senior leadership team that to ensure the most accurate, non-biased
information possible, the AMD should be independent of the asset delivery functions.
As Chris Lloyd, asset management leadership and culture expert says, “Strategic Asset Management
calls for risk-based decision making, cross-functional working, and long-term thinking. It needs clarity
on competence requirements and accountability and honesty about performance” (Johnson & Lloyd,
2012).
The AMD was placed alongside the Safety Division, with both reporting to the Chief Safety Officer
(CSO). The nexus between asset condition and safety and their management system frameworks
made this a sensible structure.
To avoid creating an asset management silo, the AMD would be experts that would serve as an
enabling function to the Agency. From the passage of MAP-21 in 2012 through 2016 when the final
rule came out, the AMD added additional staff in two key areas: physical asset business analysis and
data science. These teams were recruited both internally and externally. Internal hires were proven

problem solvers from across the organization, with experience in maintenance in each of the asset
classes. This expertise and experience added credibility across the Agency. External candidates were
recruited where no internal candidate was available with the right blend of knowledge, skills, abilities,
drive, fit and balance. More details are in Appendix F.
The AMD will continue to attract and retain the best talent to deliver asset management expertise at
RTD. The AMD recruiting process emphasizes a culture of excellence. The Division continues to build
AM competencies through training and practical application.

TAM Activities

The resourcing strategy for the TAM activities is not only to define an Accountable Executive for all
TAM requirements but to assign TAM responsibilities to the Asset Management Division. Supporting
resources from other RTD departments will be utilized and consulted or informed on an as-needed
basis. Details of both the Accountable Executive and the Asset Management Division are in
Appendix F.

6 Evaluation Plan
6.1

TAM Plan Evaluation

The TAM Plan will be evaluated on degree of compliance when RTD receives its next triennial audit.
However, it is intended to do more than meet compliance. It is a statement of intentions and
commitment to deliver the culture, policy, and procedural changes necessary for the improved
efficacy and efficiency of transit agencies that is implied in the regulations.
This TAM Plan provides a baseline for evaluating future TAM Plans produced by the Agency. RTD
intends to regularly review its asset management maturity, setting maturity targets in its Strategic
Asset Management Plan. This document will also serve as a basis of comparison to peer agencies,
allowing RTD to learn from other TAM Plans to identify where improvements can be made.
RTD will annually evaluate its performance against the previous cycle’s TAM Plan improvement goals
and agency objectives with documentation and explanation of progress (Regional Transportation
District, 2019). The RTD agency objectives are in Appendix G.

6.2

ISO 55000 Performance Evaluation and Improvement

6.3

ISO 55000 Certification Evaluation

RTD has committed to achieving certification to the asset management standard ISO 55000. This
requires the implementation of a management system for assets, based on Plan-Do-Check-Act
principles with specific elements for performance evaluation and improvement. These are still in
development in RTD and will be described in a future update.
RTD intends to evaluate the degree to which it is meeting the requirements for ISO 55000, and
therefore its readiness for an ISO 55001 certification audit, through the following measures:
1. ISO spot checks – regular detailed reviews of specific elements of the emerging Asset
Management System to identify risks to certification, and implement corrective measures

2. ISO health check – mid-point review of the entire RTD Asset Management System against the
requirements of ISO 55000
3. ISO mock audit – prior to the ISO audit, RTD intends to conduct a ‘mock audit’ to evaluate its
readiness for an actual ISO audit. Results from the mock audit will be used to determine the
appropriate time for the actual audit, along with any gaps that still exist
4. ISO audit – formal assessment by an approved ISO auditor of RTD’s Asset Management
System against the requirements of ISO 55000
5. ISO surveillance audits – once certified, RTD is required to conduct periodic ‘surveillance
audits’ to retain its certification status

Accountable Executive – A single, identifiable person who has ultimate responsibility for
carrying out the safety management system of a public transportation agency; responsibility
for carrying out transit asset management practices; and control or direction over the human
and capital resources needed to develop and maintain both the agency's public
transportation agency safety plan, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5329(d), and the agency's
transit asset management plan in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5326.
Backlog – State of Good Repair backlog is representative of the reinvestment cost to replace
any transit assets whose condition is below the midpoint on TERM’s 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent)
scale, or 2.5.
Base System – Base System refers to RTD’s assets funded by a 0.6% sales tax prior to the
passage of the FasTracks ballot initiative. RTD’s base system funding and FasTracks funding
are currently segregated.
Capital Responsibility – Transit agencies are required to report condition assessments for
assets in which they own, jointly own with another entity, or for assets that they are
responsible for replacing, overhauling, refurbishing, or conducting major repairs on that
asset, or the cost of those activities are itemized as a capital line item in the agency's budget.
CDOT – Colorado Department of Transportation.
Consist – A set of railroad vehicles forming a complete train.
Contracted Services – A contract for services is a formal, legally binding agreement between
RTD and a private company to provide service delivery.
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) – Metropolitan Planning Organization
(MPO) for Regional Transportation District, Denver. https://drcog.org/
Direct operated and purchased services – Direct operated services are those services
provided by RTD staff using RTD assets. Purchased Services are those operated under
contract on behalf of RTD using outside staffing. See also Contracted Services.
Estimated Useful Life (EUL) – The Estimated Useful Life indicates the expected duration in
years that the asset will remain in service under normal operating conditions and
maintenance. This metric is Agency-defined as opposed to FTA established Useful Life
Benchmarks. At the end of useful life of the asset, major renewal or replacement is expected.
FasTracks – FasTracks is a ballot initiative that levied an additional 0.4% sales tax for
expansion of the RTD system. FasTracks introduced commuter rail service as well as a Public
Private Partnership (P3) to the RTD System. RTD’s base system funding and FasTracks funding
are currently segregated. http://www.rtd-denver.com/Fastracks.shtml
ISO 55000 – The international standard covering management of assets of any kind. Before
it, a Publicly Available Specification (BSI PAS-55) was published by the British Standards
Institution in 2004 for physical assets. The ISO 55000 series of Asset Management standards
was formalized in 2014. The standard is made up of three parts:
o ISO 55000:2014 Asset management – Overview, principles and terminology
o ISO 55001:2014 Asset management – Management Systems – Requirements
o ISO 55002:2014 Guidelines for the application of ISO 55001
MAP-21 – MAP-21, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (P.L. 112-141) was
signed into law by President Obama on July 6, 2012.

Mid Term Financial Plan – A portion of RTD’s total budget not already committed to specific
capital projects and not apportioned to ongoing operations and maintenance that is
evaluated and prioritized through a process described in Section 3 of this document.
National Transit Database – A federal reporting program for transit agencies receiving
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) funding. It serves as a primary repository for all transitrelated data and statistics in the United States. The performance data from the NTD is used
to allocate FTA funding and to report on public transit performance to Congress and
researchers.
Senior Leadership Team (SLT) – The group of Assistant General Managers that report directly
to the General Manager and CEO. This group is equivalent to the C-Suite in a private
organization.
State of Good Repair – “The condition in which a capital asset is able to operate at a full level
of performance” (Transit Asset Management; National Transit Database, 2016).
TERM – Transit Economic Requirements model is a tool used by the FTA along with a numeric
code that represents the categorization of assets, as indicated in the TERM-Lite model.
Useful Life Benchmark (ULB) – The Useful Life Benchmark indicates the expected duration in
years that the asset will remain in service under normal operating conditions and
maintenance. This metric is established by the FTA as opposed to the Agency-defined
Estimated Useful Life metric. At the end of useful life of the asset, major renewal or
replacement is expected.

Appendix B: SGR Master Condition Rating Definitions for RTD
RTD follows the FTA guidance on condition ratings. This rating is based on how close an asset or
component is to replacement or major overhaul. Scores will not have a greater granularity than a half
point.
An asset is in a State of Good Repair if the score is greater than (2.5). Refer to individual asset group
Inspection Standards Documents for confidence in reliability and specific examples.

Confidence in Reliability = Remaining Useful Life

5.0) New or like new, 95% to 100% confidence in reliability; no visible defects, no damage,
cosmetically looks new. An asset is only new once, after rebuild some old parts are not new and
therefore the highest score after rebuild is (4.5).
4.5) The inspector is 90% to 95% confident in the reliability of the component / asset.
4.0) The inspector is 80% to 90% confident in the reliability of the component / asset. Shows
minimal signs of wear, no major defects, and some minor defects with only minimal signs of
deterioration.
Cosmetic defects/minor wear.
3.5) The inspector is 70% to 80% confident in the reliability of the component / asset.
3.0) The inspector is 60% to 70% confident in the reliability of the component / asset. Some
moderately defective or deteriorated components; expected maintenance needs. Cosmetically
‘fair’ but all devices are functioning as designed.

Small repairs or minor refurbishment.

2.5) The inspector is 50% to 60% confident in the reliability of the component / asset.
2.0) The inspector is 40% to 50% confident in the reliability of the component / asset. Asset
near overhaul or retirement, but in serviceable condition. Asset has increasing number of
defects or deteriorated component(s).

Significant or multiple repairs needed.

1.5) The inspector is 30% to 40% confident in the reliability of the component / asset.
1.0) The inspector is less than 30% confident in the reliability of the component / asset. Asset is
in need of major repair or refurbishment, multiple minor defects or major defects. Evidence of
corrosion may be apparent; major or numerous minor areas of damage or structural issues.
Safety concern, critical damage, close to or time for overhaul or replacement.

1. Annual call for projects.
2. Projects are submitted for consideration on an annual basis based on individual departmental
Decision Criteria.
a. Revenue Vehicle submits project requests based on ULB.
b. Non-Revenue Equipment submits project requests based on primarily age.
c. Rail Infrastructure submits projects requests based on the immediate need.
d. Facilities submits projects requests based on the immediate need.
e. Enabling departments submit project requests based on the immediate need.
3. Projects that have a considerable technology component are redirected to Information
Technology and their Technology Architecture Steering Committee (TASC) for a Risk
Assessment.
a. The TASC Risk Assessment is comprised of basic technology and operational risk
components.
4. Projects are approved by each department head.
5. Asset Management Division prioritizes by Request Type:
a. Compliance – The primary intent of a Compliance project request is to address
specific legal requirements or to mitigate RTD liabilities, approved by General
Counsel.
b. Renewal – The primary intent of a Renewal project request is to address existing
assets and systems. Backlog is also addressed in this request type.
c. Enhancement – The primary intent of an Enhancement project request is to expand
RTD’s ‘footprint’, enhance the value of the current service being provided, and/or
procure additional assets.
i. The aforementioned steps in the Mid Term Financial Plan Process were
underway when additional TAM requirements were released by the FTA. To
provide a process that would more closely align to future requirements of the
TAM, RTD added an additional step of classifying projects being evaluated for
investment according to their status as either Renewal or Enhancement. This
was done to provide information on future investment prioritization
requirements to the RTD’s Senior Leadership Team.
6. Initial list of projects are reviewed by the Budget & Financial Analysis Division.
7. Project requests are scored on established Scoring Criteria which includes items in RTD’s
mission statement and basic business unit benefits.
a. Mission Statement Criteria includes the following areas:
i. Accessible Service: Improve accessibility to bus and rail services for our
passengers by improving ADA on-time performance, improving ADA
availability or improving ADA courtesy.
ii. Clean Service: Improve the ability to provide clean bus and rail service and
clean public facilities by improving promptness of graffiti removal,
promptness of bus and rail interior and exterior cleaning and promptness of
shelter cleaning.
iii. Cost-Effective Service: Provide efficiencies in operations or support functions
which enable RTD to increase levels of bus and rail service by increasing

i. To aid in informing project raters about the condition of an asset, a State of
Good Repair (SGR) Report including an assessment of an asset being
considered for renewal or replacement was included at the initiator’s
request.
8. Budget & Financial Analysis reviews the prioritized list of projects against current Funding
Requirements.
9. The prioritized list of projects are then evaluated by SLT who considers a number of
additional factors, including but not limited to the annual goals set by the RTD Board of
Directors, the projected available funding, grant and/or private funding availability for a
project, and strategic importance to regional objectives.
10. A recommended list is then submitted to the RTD Board of Directors for evaluation and
approval.

Appendix E: TAM Resources
It is anticipated the following specific resources will be required for TAM activities for the duration of
the plan horizon:
•

•

•

Staff resources
o One accountable executive
o Seventeen FTEs from the Asset Management Division, who will split their time
between TAM and ISO 55000 implementation
o FTE requirements for other RTD resources necessary for TAM activities are not
defined in this generation of the TAM Plan
Technology resources: the technologies are used to support AM across the Agency. RTD’s
aim is to use the tools it already owns, rather than invest in new ones at this time.
o Hardware and Software necessary to support:
 Multiple source software systems – e.g. Trapeze EAM, Oracle EBS
 Data Warehouse – provides aggregation and integration of data
 Analysis and reporting tools – Power BI, Access, Excel, SPSS and others
Financial resources
o Financial resources necessary to support asset management ‘business as usual’
activities, TAM and ISO implementation. Beyond these, RTD has not defined any
requirement for further resources for this generation of the TAM Plan.

Appendix F: Asset Management Roles & Responsibilities
1. Accountable Executive – a single position with ultimate accountability for Asset Management
and the Asset Management System within RTD.
2. Asset Management Accountability Team (AMAT) – this group has formal accountability
delegated from the Accountable Executive for the delivery, embedding, review and continual
improvement of the Asset Management System. The group is comprised of RTD’s Chief
Financial Officer, Chief Operations Officer, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs
and the Assistant General Manager for Asset Management, Security and Safety, and the
Senior Manager for Asset Management Division.
3. Asset Management Division – the AMD is responsible for the design, delivery, embedding,
review and continual improvement of the Asset Management System’s products, processes
and information, as well as preparing for and undertaking the ISO 55001 certification audit.
It is anticipated that the Asset Management Division will have the following roles and
responsibilities for ISO 55000 during the plan horizon:
The organization chart for the Asset Management Division is shown below.

The Asset Management Senior Manager reports to the Chief Safety Officer, which is the
Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management.
4. Other RTD resources – as needed, other RTD resources will be utilized, consulted or informed
regarding the Asset Management System. This could include operations, maintenance,
finance, human resources, communications, IT, legal and procurement staff. The Asset
Management Accountability Team will allocate these resources directly when within their
reporting line, or via a request to other members of the Senior Leadership Team when they
are not.
5. External resources – RTD will also utilize external expertise to develop the internal asset
management competencies of both the Asset Management Division and other RTD resources
involved with the Asset Management System. The alternative to this is to be continually
reliant on an external entity to supply expertise indefinitely. Selecting both an established
asset management framework and interactions with consultants, RTD intends to cultivate an
Asset Management Division capable of acting as an internal consulting service to the Agency.
The intention is to ‘own the process, not the product’ as it relates to functions and
competencies that will become annual activities for the AMD. Additional external resources
will also be utilized to deliver aspects of the Asset Management System, specifically the
operations and maintenance of approximately half of the bus fleet.

Appendix G: RTD Agency Objectives
The figure below is a representation of RTD’s purpose and objectives, adopted June 2019. RTD’s
purpose is to move people (Regional Transportation District, 2019). This purpose provides direction
for the Agency that activities can be aligned towards. The phrase that ‘a three-quarter full bus is
better than a one-quarter full bus, all else held equal’ captures RTD’s intention of increasing the
effective and efficient utilization of assets in carrying out activities. This is a shift in how the Agency is
conceptualized, wherein previous efforts were focused on completion of the FasTracks expansion
effort and an emphasis on increasing available service hours and geographic coverage, rather than
utilization.
RTD’s efforts to improve the movement of
people are attained through improving its
ability to attract and retain customers by
enhancing Leading Indicators, and the
optimization of service within Constraints.
RTD has adopted both performance and
maturity targets for each of these concepts
and is in the process of managing to these
targets.

Components of a Safety Management System (SMS) are in place, but there are
significant deficiencies.
Procedures and instructions to manage safety activities exist, but there are serious issues
about how well understood these are.
Individual risks are mostly controlled; however, the overall process that manages this is
weak.

Access-a-Ride/Cab 3rd Quarter Reports 2020
Access-a-Ride 3rd Quarter 2020 Highlights

1. Paratransit services is currently using a legacy software product or dispatch and scheduling which is
over 12 years old. A Scope of Work for an RFP has been developed for an at-risk proposal to be paid
for through savings accrued through operational efficiencies which would improve our productivity,
reduce revenue hours, and increase on-time performance. The RFP is expected to be reviewed by
Legal and Procurement within the next few months and released in the first quarter of 2021.
2. Since its inception on April 2, 2020, the Access-a-Ride service has performed over 700 food deliveries.
The program is considered a win-win, as our at-risk passengers do not have to travel outside of their
homes in order to purchase food while RTD saves money by not needing to provide round trip services.
To date, the program has saved the District approximately $42,000.
3. Recovery of demand for paratransit service has continued through the third quarter with Access-a-Ride
trip demand now at 43% of pre-COVID levels and overall paratransit demand, (which includes Access-aCab services), at 49% of pre-COVID.

I.

Public Comment: Non-APAC members in attendance may provide 3-minute input (information to
the APAC, not a discussion with APAC).

No public comment.
II.

Welcome New Members

APAC now has the full complement of 13 members. Three new members joined, since the September
meeting, replacing term-out members; their terms will end August 2023. APAC members attending their
first meeting introduced themselves: Tex Elam, Craig Towler–Center for People with Disabilities, Lindsay
Leith–Goodwill, Lyndsey Sent–Global Down Syndrome, Melisa Mascarenas–Shalom Denver, and Roberto
Cabrera–Colorado Commission for the Deaf.
III.

Update: Advisory Committee for People with Disabilities (ACPD) Meeting – Brenda Carney, APAC
liaison

ACPD Meeting Update
No ACPD meeting occurred between the September and November APAC meeting; next ACPD meeting is
November 19th, 2-4pm.
RTD Pilot to possibly combine ACPD and APAC – Zamy Silva, RTD
• History –
o 2016 ADA manager convened an ADA Design Panel to discuss RTD facility. In 2017, Sr.
Manager of Civil Rights, along with Education and Development Division created the ACPD
committee to discuss all other ADA matters, except paratransit which already had a
committee (APAC)(. ACPD was established with an internal RTD Steering Committee of
assistant general managers and senior managers. The RTD internal Steering Committee
ensures input is heard by each RTD department and ACPD voted on recommendations are
addressed (considered and responded to). Example: RTD Steering Committee responded
to ACPD’s recommendation to address rotating doors at Union Station – project
completed.
o 2019, one of RTD Board’s goals to the General Manager assigned to Civil Rights was to
improve and build relationships with people with disabilities in the community. One
consideration was to include an RTD Board member on the ACPD internal Steering

Committee; another was to adopt a steering committee for APAC. Also, considering other
ways to work with or changes to both APAC and ACPD to enhance RTD’s relationship with
the disability community and the committees’ efforts.
Pilot – One possible change is to unite the APAC-transit service group and the ACPD-facilities group.
To pilot this idea the committees will meet jointly for three of their six meetings in 2021 – March,
July, and November. The joint meetings will be 1-hour of ACPD work and 1-hour of APAC work, and
attended by members of both committees and the ACPD Steering Committee.
No decision has been made about combining the groups. At the end of 2021 both committees will
be asked about the effectiveness of joint meetings, and asked for their input on joining or staying
separate committees.
Input requested: For joint meetings, which day of the week is better Tuesday (ACPA day) or
Thursday (ACPD day) and which time 10am-12pm (APAC time) or 1-2pm. APAC members input:
o Most were flexible.
o Flexible, but prefer the day and time are consistent for joint meetings.
o Several said they were flexible, but prefer Tuesday mid-morning.
o A couple said they prefer mornings.
o Flexible, but prefer Thursday.
o If Thursday, prefer afternoon.

The first joint ACPD and APAC meeting will be March 2021, day and time to be decided.
IV.

Updates:

Fiscally constrained service plan – development process – Larry Buter, RTD
RTD and the Board have developed a reduced fixed-route plan (expectation is approval by the Board this
month). RTD is legally bound to provide paratransit service at the same level as fixed route, but the Board
directed paratransit staff to ignore changes to fixed-route and maintain Access-a-Ride’s service levels,
started on January 2020. Access-a-Ride will not be impacted by service reductions to fixed-route during
covid19, and maintained at pre-covid19 levels for as long as RTD Board determines.
Eligibility RFP – select a vendor (not a process change/review) – Larry Buter, RTD
The eligibility vendor’s 5-year contract is ending. RTD will release the request for proposals (RFP) with a
preferred scope of work for an eligibility vendor soon. The eligibility contract is currently held by Easter
Seals, who may or may not bid on the RFP. The RFP will require the vendor provide both functional
assessment of Eligibility, and Travel Training (currently supplied by Via Mobility Services).
Mobile App/web portal – Brandon Fowler, RTD
Four years ago, APAC and RTD started working on the concept of a mobile app/web portal. Nine months
ago, RTD’s IT team said they could develop it. Since it went live on October 26, 2020, 3400 active Access-aRide emails were alerted and accounts made available, 126 clients have logged-in more than 600 times,
and booked/taken 278 trips (and 64 canceled trips). The web portal is an APAC and RTD success story in
this year of challenges. It went live a couple weeks ago and has had no known issues.

Discussion
• The ETA function (“where is my ride”) is amazing and always on time, where the phone call 10minutes ahead of your ride is rarely on time.
• Six APAC members were interviewed about their experience and accessibility of the portal, all said
there were no issues, except for the desire to be able to add new locations (RTD is working on this),
and screen-readers were working well.
o One member still has an iPhone accessibility issue. RTD IT will call and work it out.
o APAC will beta test the new function to add a location, once it is developed; could be as
soon as next month.
• Question: Can providers go onto the portal to help set up rides?
Answer: Yes, but only to designated “favorites” locations for now (working on being able to add a
new location in the portal).
• Question: When will subscriptions be reenabled – many people forget to schedule rides and don’t
come to school or other facilities?
Answer: Due to covid19 RTD is not yet ready to reenable subscriptions. We will watch how covid19
progresses and reenable as soon as it seems possible.
V.
Brainstorm needs for the software replacement for reservations, scheduling and dispatch
Routematch is the current software vendor for reservations, scheduling and dispatch – went live with
that software in June 2008. The contract is coming to an end and RTD is ready for an improved system.
RTD is developing a list of preferred needs for any new software for the request for proposal (RFP). RTD
is looking to purchase an off-the-shelf software rather than create or seriously customize a software as
this can often lead to problems. The hope is to find an existing software that meets as many of RTDs
needs as possible, knowing that it is unlikely to find an off-the-shelf software that meet all of RTD’s
needs and desires. It has been over 10 years since the current software was installed and there are lots
of innovations and new vendors to evaluate – exciting. All vendors are welcome to bid, RTD expects
Routematch will bid their latest improved software. RTD will select the one that meets the greatest
number of RTD needs and preferences.
Discussion – software needs
• Question: Is the software for Access-a-Ride and Access-a-cab or only Access-a-Ride?
Answer: Our desire for any software is that it can interact with other software systems of different
services (api); most do interact with other software systems.
• Good to change from Routematch; it has been difficult on occasion, and those occasions often
were when you needed it to work.
o This will be an open bid process, all software providers will bid, RTD assumes Routematch
will likely bid with their new software.

Attachment: APAC Update (4425 : Access-a-Ride/Cab 3rd Quarter Reports 2020)

RTD is still improving it; they are working on a request that it be able to add a location not on a client’s
“favorites” list (currently, a client must call to schedule a trip to a new location). When this function is made
possible, APAC will beta-test it for functionality and accessibility before it goes live on the portal.

SUGGESTION: Include in the touch-tone system the ability to select locations from favorites (ex.,
“push #1 for 123 Main st., #2 for 789 South Blah ave”).
o The touch-tone system/IVR system is not being changed as part of this software RFP.
SUGGESTION: It must work with the new web portal
o This is in RTD’s 60 pages of requirements - the new software must either provide an
approved equal or better web portal OR be compatible with the web portal just released.
Question: How will we know the proposed new software options are “better”?
Answer: Once RTD has made a final selection, prior to being accepted.
Question: Will the software take complaints?
Answer: No, complaints will still go through customer service; this is the best way to ensure
complaints are addressed by the customer care team.

Discussion – other items that came up
• The updated web form to apply for eligibility is great.
VI.

APAC Meetings – until we are able to meet in person should meetings be by phone or
online/phone?

Discussion
• Flexible as long as the system is accessible.
• If online,
o Meetings need to accessible both online OR by phone;
o Should still include a phone number and that should be a link to auto call and enter code;
and
o Keyboard short-cuts to mute audio and close the video should be communicated (easier
for visually impaired than trying to find the small “mute” and “video” buttons) – before the
meeting and verbally at the start of the meeting.
• Either options must have visual content emailed in advance.
• Phone is good for sign language interpreters – the person can see the interpreter.
• Sometimes it has been technically difficult to call in.
• ACPD does their meeting on Teams, and it works, the visually impaired call in to the teams meeting
more often.

Contractor Fixed-Route Report – 3rd Quarter
2020

Information

RTD currently provides 45% of its fixed route bus service via four contracted bus divisions operated by
First Transit and Transdev. With bus divisions located in Longmont, Denver, Commerce City and
Englewood, our contract partners provide fixed route bus service throughout the RTD District. The
performance for First Transit and Transdev is measured on the following performance indicators:
Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 miles, Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 miles, OnTime Preventive Maintenance Inspections, On-Time Performance, Miles Between Lost Service Road Calls
and Operator Complaints per Boarding.
Because of their commitment to excellence, dedicated corporate support and detailed problem solving,
First Transit and Transdev as a group, met all the Board of Director adopted 2020 key performance
measures through the 3rd quarter 2020. In the areas where our contract partners fell slightly short of
their individual goals, they implemented both procedural and staff changes which should result in
continuous improvement throughout 2020. The following is a more detailed discussion of fixed route
contractor performance through the 3rd quarter of 2020.
•

PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles through the 3rd quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to
utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of
operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety
meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities and on the
street.

•

PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles
through the 3rd quarter. Only four of the twenty passenger accidents that occurred during the
3rd quarter were classified preventable. First Transit Commerce City did not meet the goal (0.28)
however, only one of their passenger accidents was classified as preventable. All of the bus
operators involved in passenger accidents were provided retraining on the proper procedures for
addressing passenger safety. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness of
passenger safety through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger
accidents per 100,000 miles.

•

ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled through the 3rd quarter. Competitive Services staff will
continue to monitor the contractor operations to ensure PMIs are completed on-time.

Packet Pg. 128

1.D.2

•

ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
The contractors, as a group, met the target of 86% Local On-Time Service through the 3rd
quarter. Transdev (84.6%) did not meet the goal due in part to unexpected detours and traffic.
The Pandemic Service Plan adopted in April has been very problematic for Bus Operations as well.
Running times for weekday services are based upon weekday traffic, traffic lights, and trip loads.
Saturday services are significantly different than weekday services. By adopting a Saturday
schedule for a weekday service, the differences in service characteristics impacts on-time
performance. RTD Service Planning is currently working on correcting some of these schedule
challenges with the September 2020 and January 2021 runboard since we are currently
expecting to operate reduced service schedules into 2021. RTD and the private contractors
continue to campaign routes and operators with low on-time performance with a strong focus on
first time point departures. On a regular basis, contractors review the OTP reports and meet with
operators of low performing routes to discuss factors that are impacting their ability to reach
86% on-time performance. Additionally, RTD and the private contractors recently began a
campaign to address early on-time performance. While an operator may run into factors beyond
their control, running early is something the operator can directly impact.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.

•

MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, as a group, exceeded the target of 30,000 Miles Between Lost Service
Maintenance Road Calls through the 3rd quarter. First Transit Longmont did not meet the goal
during the 3rd quarter; however, First Transit Longmont has shown improvement since the
beginning of the year. In addition to continuing to address deficiencies identified in First Transit
Longmont’s Preventive Maintenance Inspection (PMI) and Quality Control (QC) practices, an
expanded maintenance action plan was implemented during the 2nd quarter to further address all
issues. Competitive Services staff will continue to monitor the contractor operations and work
closely with local and corporate management teams to ensure this goal is being addressed by
completing preventive maintenance inspections on-time, working off defects in a timely manner,
monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a pro-active
approach to maintaining the buses in their fleet.

•

OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
At this time boarding information is not available; however, the contractors continue to
investigate and address customer complaints with operators. The contractors utilize onboard
video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist operators in improving customer interactions. In
addition, the steps noted above regarding on-time performance should help address some
customer complaints. The contractors also continue to address complaint trends with all
operators at monthly safety meetings.

Customer Comment Analysis – 3rd Quarter
2020

Information

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer comment trends through the 3rd Quarter of 2020. Also
included is a comparison of customer comment data for the same period in 2019.
Customer commendations through the 3rd Quarter of 2020 for both RTD and the private contractors
showed a decrease from the same period in 2019. The total number of commendations was 1,047 in
2020 versus 1,983 in 2019.
Customer complaints through the 3rd Quarter of 2020 for both RTD and the private contractors showed
improvement over the same period in 2019. The total number of operator-related complaints for the
District as a whole for the 3rd Quarter of 2020 was 8,045. The total number for the same period in
2019 was 12,679. Every customer complaint category showed improvement over 2020 except for
Discrimination.
RTD and the private contractors review customer comments on a daily basis and implement corrective
action as needed to address deficiencies and improve performance or provide operators with recognition
for a job well done. Additionally, reduced ridership due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to less
comments overall.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not supported by factual data. Some of the
reasons for the “Not Valid” classification include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the comment

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer concerns.
•

Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator, running time of the route, or
other circumstances such as construction and detours.

Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
RTD conducts refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado Cross Disability Coalition,
Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis, DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force, RTD Advisory
Committee for People with Disabilities-ACPD) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service
for passengers with disabilities.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Operating Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
Trends in customer service challenges are also addressed through bulletins, campaigns, and other
communications to ensure that RTD and Contractor employees are aware of our customers’
concerns.

Historically, and in 2020, the following categories generated the highest number of customer comments:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Commendations
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop

All of these comment categories are what RTD considers “operator-related” and are included in the
comment numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high comment categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and external,
that are impacting the number of comments. The input received from both RTD and private contractor
operations is noted below:
Commendations – 3rd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category decreased by 47.2% compared to the
same period in 2019. This decrease is attributable to the substantial decrease in ridership due to
COVID-19. Both RTD and our contracted operators who receive commendations are recognized in a
variety of ways by their division, such as with pins and lanyards; through the Operator of the Month
program; at safety meetings; and on division electronic messaging screens. The YTD average in this
category for 2020 is 3.82 comments per day. The comparable number for 2019 was 7.26 comments
per day.
Bus Did Not Show – 3rd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category significantly decreased by 63.1%
compared to the same period in 2019. “Flashbacks” for “bus did not show” comments often show

buses running late. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 1.49 comments per day.
comparable number for 2019 was 4.04 comments per day.

The

Bus Early – 3rd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category decreased 29.4% compared to the same
period in 2019. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” comments often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The
YTD average in this category for 2020 is 2.53 comments per day. The comparable number for 2019
was 3.60 comments per day.
Bus Late – 3rd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category significantly decreased 62.6% compared to
the same period in 2019. Improving on-time performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of
reasons including construction, traffic and heavy ridership delays. Running time issues are continually
reviewed by RTD Service Planning and Scheduling. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 2.79
comments per day. The comparable number for 2019 was 7.50 comments per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category significantly decreased
46.7% compared to the same period in 2019. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and
undercover ride checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate
manner. In addition, RTD and the private contractors have “G-Force Activated” event-recording systems
(Drive Cam, Smart Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis.
Operators continue to be counseled and retrained, as needed, to improve driving performance. Also,
periodic safety campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this
category for 2020 is 2.18 comments per day. The comparable number for 2019 was 4.11 comments
per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category decreased 32.9% compared to
the same period in 2019. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined appropriately if video evidence confirms that
they treated passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions
for handling similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 5.93
comments per day. The comparable number for 2019 was 8.87 comments per day.
Discrimination – 3rd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category increased 22.8% compared to the same
period in 2019. Investigation into discrimination-related comments usually shows the operator not at
fault. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 0.26 comments per day. The comparable number
for 2019 was 0.21 comments per day.
Fare Dispute – 3rd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category significantly decreased 46.0% compared
to the same period in 2019. Investigations into “fare dispute” comments often show that passengers
presented an improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare
policies. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 0.54 comments per day. The comparable
number for 2019 was 1.00 comments per day. It should also be noted that RTD made a decision to
suspend fares in the 2nd quarter of 2020. This is a major factor in the reduction of fare disputes during
this reporting period.

Packet Pg. 135

1.D.3

Improper Procedure/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category decreased 11.0%
compared to the same period in 2019. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held
at the private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of
RTD passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not
following proper procedures, appropriate coaching activities are taken. The YTD average in this category
for 2020 is 5.33 comments per day. The comparable number for 2019 was 6.01 comments per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category decreased by 31.7% compared
to the same period in 2019. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation,
Operations Managers, the Bus Operator Training teams, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to
provide operators with up-to-date information to answer customer questions and address customer
concerns. Although RTD and the private contractors have seen an influx of new operators, their impact
on this category is minimal, thanks to annual refresher training, assistance from Street Supervisors and
trainers, and improved communication. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 0.25 comments
per day. The comparable number for 2019 was 0.37 comments per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 3rd Quarter 2020: Comments in this category decreased 24.6%
compared to the same period in 2019. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these comments will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop as the bus
passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting
directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” comments from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
comments (176 of the total 2,211 = 7.96%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded
to the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjusted, as needed, as resources will
allow. The YTD average in this category for 2020 is 8.07 comments per day. The comparable number
for 2019 was 10.75 comments per day.

Information

Funding Agreements
RTD currently has Funding Agreements with various municipalities and non-profit organizations to
support local transportation efforts throughout the District. These include supporting fixed-route bus
service with the Cities of Boulder, Englewood and Littleton; Vanpool service with the Denver Regional
Council of Governments; and rural demand response services with Via Mobility, Focus Point and Douglas
County.
Ridership/Productivity
Similar to RTD provided services, ridership for the fixed-route and Vanpool services was down when
compared to the same period in 2019, with significant reductions in ridership since Pandemic service
levels were implemented. While the Englewood Trolley has not reduced service in response to COVID19, both the Boulder HOP and DRCOG Vanpool have reduced service levels and the Littleton Shopping
Cart is currently not in operation.

While ridership is not tracked in the same way for demand response services, Via Mobility and Douglas
County are operating at reduced service levels and Focus Points has suspended operations.
All of the transportation services supported through Funding Agreements have seen a significant
decrease in productivity when compared to the same period in 2019. The attached 2020 Special
Services 3rd Quarter Report provides the productivity numbers for each of these services.
Senior Services
RTD provides special services for senior citizens to keep them active and engaged in their communities.
Every year, SeniorRide transports thousands of senior citizens to a variety of cultural, educational, and
entertainment events. Additionally, RTD provides regularly scheduled SeniorShopper service to help

Packet Pg. 140

1.D.4

senior citizens access essential retail locations that they might not otherwise be able to access, such as
grocery stores and pharmacies.
Ridership/Productivity
Since March, due to COVID-19 and the cancellation of many events, RTD’s SeniorRide service has been
suspended. SeniorShopper ridership for the third quarter for 2020 was down in comparison to the same
quarter in 2019 but not significantly. Boardings in 2019 were 21,368 and 2020 were 21,138. Since
this service provides access to essential retail locations, ridership has not declined as much as with other
services.
The attached 2020 Special Services 3rd Quarter Report provides the productivity numbers for each of
these services.
FlexRide
RTD’s FlexRide services are currently operated by Via Mobility and MV Transit. With FlexRide bus
divisions located in Boulder and Denver, our contract partners provide FlexRide services to 23 distinct
service areas throughout the RTD District. The performance for Via Mobility and MV Transit is
measured on Customer Contacts, Preventable Vehicle Accidents and Ridership/Productivity (boardings
per service hour).
Customer Contacts
FlexRide experienced a decrease in overall customer contacts in the third quarter for 2020 when
compared to 2019.
Customer contacts are reviewed on a daily basis. Those contacts that are considered operator related
(within the operator’s control) are monitored for trends and improvement.

At Fault contacts decreased by four when comparing quarters. The number of all other customer
contacts received regarding FlexRide service (requests for new service or a change in service which can
include boundary changes, service day and hours, web site issues, no return calls, etc.) are as follows:
2020: 194
2019: 310
Preventable Accidents

Packet Pg. 141

1.D.4

The preventable accident rate for the third quarter dropped compared to 2019.
Contractors have
continued to retrain operators identified as being involved in accidents and have increased the number of
“ride-alongs” performed by operations specialists and training staff.
RTD Safety and Training
Compliance Officer has been working with contractors and researching additional defensive driving
refresher courses.
2020: 6
Preventable Vehicle Accidents: 0.85 per 100,000 miles
2019: 18
Preventable Vehicle Accidents: 1.75 per 100,000 miles
Ridership/Productivity
FlexRide ridership for the third quarter for 2020 was down in comparison to the same quarter in 2019.
Boardings in 2019 were 336,891 and 2020 were 169,546. Contributing to the decrease in ridership is
the continued reduced service levels due to adoption of the COVID-19 pandemic service plan. Similar to
our fixed-route bus service, beginning April 19, 2020 all FlexRide services began operating a reduced
weekday schedule in response to decreased demand. Additionally, low fuel prices are giving customers
a low-cost alternative to using the FlexRide service.
The majority of the FlexRide areas have seen a decrease in productivity when compared to the same
period in 2019. COVID started having an effect on ridership in March and has continued through the
third quarter. The attached 2020 Special Services 3rd Quarter Report provides the productivity numbers
for each of the FlexRides. The acceptable level of productivity for FlexRide service continues to be 3.0
boardings per hour.

Drug & Alcohol Compliance Monitoring Report 3rd Quarter 2020

Information

In compliance with the Recommendation included in the Performance Audit of the RTD conducted in
2015 on behalf of the State of Colorado, the following is a summary of the monitoring activities
completed by RTD Drug & Alcohol compliance personnel through the 3rd Quarter of 2020:
Number of files reviewed:

85

Percentage of records in compliance with requirements:

95.3%

These statistics represent the verification of records reviewed for the private contractor operations for a
portion of the quarter. Generally, these numbers are much greater, but due to Covid-19, RTD has
suspended all in-person meetings-which are required for physical review of the files. Scheduled visits for
the contractors are going to resume once RTD allows in-person meetings and when deemed safe to do
so.

Attachment: Service Availability - November 2020 (4427 : Service Availability – November 2020)

TO:

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.85% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in November 2020. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflects an
improvement as compared to the same month (November) last year. Lost service for
personnel related reasons follows:
•
•
•
•

November 2020 – 6.27 hours
November 2019 – 451.32 hours
Year to date hours for 2020 – 1699.64 hours
Year to date hours 2019 – 3516.58 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in November were emergency and planned
bus bridges, the COVID-19 pandemic and the pandemic service reduction.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.85% of all scheduled hours of service in the month,
it was necessary to cover 0 shifts with RTD operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 0 hours of service being provided by a
“6th day” RTD operator. Additionally, our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev,
covered 0 shifts, or approximately 0 hours of service, with operators working a “6th day”.
