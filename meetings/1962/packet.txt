BACKGROUND
Staff is required to present the 2015 Requested Budget to the Board of Directors prior to
posting it for public inspection. RTD must post its 2015 Requested Budget for public
review and comment by October 15, 2014 in order to meet Colorado legal requirements
(CRS 29-1-101). The preliminary 2015 Requested Budget is included in this document in
order to comply with these requirements.
At this time, Staff is presenting the preliminary first draft 2015 Requested Budget.
Preliminary 2015 Requested Budget numbers are subject to further revision and a budget
update will be presented at the October 21st Financial Administration and Audit Committee
meeting. The 2015 Recommended Budget will then be presented at the November 18th
Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting with Staff requesting approval to
move to the Board of Directors for ratification of the 2015 Adopted Budget on November
25th.
DISCUSSION
The Board has requested that staff keep it informed on key budget issues that RTD is
facing and provide opportunities for Board members to offer early input during the
development of the 2015 annual budget. Our previous communication included the 20152020 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), which forms the basis for the 2015 budget and which
was approved by the Board in July, as well as a presentation on our budget theme,
assumptions and targets for 2015. The budget is driven by the strategic goals established
by the Board of Directors for 2015, which consist of advancing/completing FasTracks,
fiscal sustainability/financial plan, improving service delivery, and implementing
technological advancements.
During development of the 2015-2020 SBP for the Base System, staff presented a
balanced budget to the Board for 2015. Staff has worked to develop a preliminary
proposed budget for the Base System as set forth in the approved 2015-2020 SBP. Staff
also incorporates FasTracks budget numbers for both FasTracks Project and Fas Tracks
Operations. The FasTracks budget is developed separately from the SBP. Both the Base
System and FasTracks preliminary budget make up the 2015 Requested Budget presented
here.
The 2015 Requested Budget is compared to the 2014 Amended Budget below with
change from period to period (in thousands). The summary is from the attached Exhibit I.

Overview
The 2015 Requested Budget is a first draft budget and includes estimates for sources and
uses. The budget items will continue to be reviewed and the final version incorporating
any necessary adjustments will be the 2015 Recommended Budget scheduled for adoption
in November. This Requested Budget will be updated for items such as fare revenue
estimates, sales taxes, grant revenue, and capital expenditures for both new capital and
capital carry forward amounts. Operating expenses may be revised for specific changes
but any changes from this point forward are expected to be minor.
As stated earlier, staff has developed the 2015 Requested Budget based on guidance from
the SBP for 2015 for the Base System and by incorporating the FasTracks 2015 budget.
The 2015 Requested Budget on a combined basis includes the following:
(1) Fare revenue:
a. A fare rate increase is not budgeted for 2015. No fare rate increases
have occurred since 2011, and while the Board historically has given
consideration to a fare rate increase every three years such an increase
was foregone in 2014.
b. Fare revenue of $124.9 million in 2015 is budgeted to remain flat from
2014 due to expected minimal growth in ridership and no fare rate
increase. Ridership projections are derived from RTD’s planning model.
(2) Other operating revenue:
a. This amount includes advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, and
miscellaneous operating revenue.

Board of Directors Report
September 30, 2014
Page 6

Attachment: 2015 Requested Budget Board Report 093014 (2084 : 2015 Requested Budget)

b. Other operating revenue is increased at the CPI over the 2014 Amended
Budget but otherwise kept flat. The amount will change if more
information becomes available for the 2015 Recommended Budget. The
current run rate for other operating revenue is on track with the 2014
budget.
(3) Sales/use tax:
a. Combined sales/use tax of $535.1 million is budgeted to increase 5.9%
over the 2014 projection, concurrent with the CU-Leeds School of
Business September forecast.
b. The 2014 projection will increase 7.8% over 2013 actuals in the CULeeds School of Business September forecast.
c. The 2015 budget will incorporate no further updates from CU-Leeds
School because the December forecast will be received after the 2015
budget is approved by the Board.
(4) Grant revenue:
a. Of total grant revenue of $261.3 million, operating grant revenue is
$87.4 million on the Base System and $0.8 million for FasTracks.
b. Base System operating grant revenue is budgeted to decrease $1.5
million from the 2014 Amended Budget due to a net decrease in carry
forward grants. FasTracks operating grant revenue is budgeted to
decrease $3.2 million due to a decrease in STAMPS grants.
c. Remaining grant funds consist of capital grant revenue of $173.1 million.
Of this amount, $8.6 million is budgeted in the Base System and $164.5
million is budgeted in FasTracks. Combined capital grant revenue is
expected to decline $53.1 million from the 2014 Amended Budget due to
identified decreases primarily in West Corridor New Starts grants, CMAQ
grants on Eagle and US36, and carry forward grants for park-n-Rides, the
Free Metro Ride, and SmartCard.
d. As more information becomes available and the capital carry forward
budget is finalized, capital grant revenue estimates will change
accordingly in the Recommended Budget.
(5) Investment income:
a. Combined investment income is projected to decrease $0.2 million from
the 2014 Amended Budget due to continued low short term rates and
deployment of invested funds. In addition, unrestricted investable fund
balances are projected to decline as project funds are drawn down for
fleet purchases and construction projects.
(6) Other (non-operating) income:
a. Other income is reduced by $10.0 million from the 2014 Amended
Budget due to the non-recurring land sale of DUS Block B that took place
in 2014.
b. Recurring non-operating revenue is increased at the CPI (with the
exception of the Build America Bonds subsidy) over the 2014 Amended
Budget but otherwise kept flat. The amount will change if more
information becomes available for the 2015 Recommended Budget. The
current run rate for other operating revenue is on track with the 2014
budget.
(7) Operating expenses:

Board of Directors Report
September 30, 2014
Page 7

Attachment: 2015 Requested Budget Board Report 093014 (2084 : 2015 Requested Budget)

a. District-wide operating expenses (including expense projects) of $484.4
million are budgeted to decline $58.7 million from the 2014 Amended
Budget due to project completion, 2015 expense projects now scheduled
in 2016 and beyond, and expense projects reclassified to capital. Note
that the expense projects carry forward (previously approved expense
projects) is not included in the 2015 Requested Budget; this drives the
budget-to-budget swing downward until the final 2015 budget in which
the expense carry forward is identified and included.
b. FasTracks Capital Programs currently accounts for $50.5 million of this
decline due in large part to completion of the US36/CDOT managed lanes
carry forward project.
c. Operating expenses are allocated to the FasTracks Operations using a
cost allocation model that allocates historical unit costs on the basis of
resource drivers. Sales tax is allocated from FasTracks in an amount to
fund FasTracks operations costs and result in sources minus uses of
zero. FasTracks Operations consists of West Line, Denver Union Station,
and Free Metro Ride.
d. Diesel fuel is currently budgeted at $3.12/gallon, which is the lock price
in 2014 for no incremental change. Subsequent to the preparation of the
2015 Requested Budget, diesel fuel was locked at $2.95/gallon for all of
2015 and the impact will be reflected in the budget update to be
presented to the Board in October.
e. Gasoline is currently budgeted at an average cost of $3.54/gallon, which
is the same price used in the 2014 Amended Budget for no incremental
change.
f. Certain items budgeted in the 2015 Requested Budget totaling $7.7
million materialized after the SBP was approved, including RTD’s
increased contribution to the union benefit plans, a maintenance
campaign in Rail Operations for a LRV half-life overhaul program, and
additional dollars for the Civic Center rehab capital project. These items
will be covered in part by staging the work in 2016 of certain capital and
expense projects approved in the SBP for 2015 as follows:
1) Track Maintenance Equipment for $1.0 million (capital)
2) Power Switching on Emergency Crossovers at SW, CPV, SE,
CC for $2.0 million (capital)
3) Grade Grossing Upgrade & Rail Replacement at Speer & Stout
Street for $0.352 million (capital)
4) Railway Worker Protection Early Warning System for $1.0
million (capital)
5) 3 Lane Bus Wash Replacement for $1.4 million (expense)
(8) Debt:
a. Budgeted principal payments of $62.5 million are essentially unchanged
from the 2014 Amended Budget.
b. Base System principal payments of $53.7 million are $5.0 higher than
the 2014 Amended Budget due to issuance of Base System COPs for
fleet purchases.

Packet Pg. 9

2.1.a

c. FasTracks principal payments of $8.7 million are $4.8 million lower than
the 2014 Amended Budget due to lower actual debt issued than was
anticipated in 2014.
d. Budgeted financing proceeds of $333.4 million result from anticipated
new debt of $59.6 million for Base System for COPs and $273.8 million
for FasTracks, consisting of $198.8 million for future FasTracks
construction and $75.0 million in TIFIA loan draws for the Eagle Project
construction.
e. Financing proceeds, or the issuance of new debt, will be lower by
$462.2 million from 2014 Amended Budget mainly due to a decrease in
FasTracks debt issuance.
(9) Interest expense:
a. Interest expense is budgeted at $97.5 million, a decrease of $1.9 million
from the 2014 Amended Budget and essentially remaining flat.
b. Of total interest expense, $26.5 million is budgeted for Base System and
$71.0 million is budgeted on FasTracks.
c. Capitalized interest is budgeted at $45.0 million for FasTracks only,
unchanged from the 2014 Amended Budget. Capitalized interest is the
interest expense associated with construction projects that is capitalized
as part of the asset value on the balance sheet.
(10) Capital expenditures:
a. Base System new capital expenditures total $94.5 million. The amount
approved in the SBP totaled $96.4 million. The difference is due to $4.3
million in additional 2015 capital projects deferred to 2016 in Rail
Operations offset by $2.5 million in additional budget needed for Civic
Center in 2015 (see (7)f above).
b. FasTracks new capital expenditures are estimated at $511.4 million.
This is a preliminary amount subject to change in the Recommended
Budget as estimates for project expenditures in 2015 are reviewed and
completed.
c. Capital carry forward (previously approved capital) is not estimated at
this time but will be included in the Recommended Budget.
(11) Reserves:
a. The combined TABOR reserve is budgeted at $19.5 million.
b. The FasTracks contingency reserve is budgeted at $30.0 million which
reflects no change from 2014.
c. The FasTracks construction reserve is budgeted at $100.0 million.
(12) Fund balances:
a. Base System:
i. Increase of $3.0 million to Board-appropriated fund per the SBP
for a total fund balance of $22.2 million.
ii. Increase of $3.0 million to capital acquisition fund per the SBP for
a total fund balance of $15.0 million.
iii. The unrestricted fund balance is budgeted at $3.8 million, which
is $1.0 million less than the fund balance estimated in the SBP
due to the net effect of unanticipated expenditures and necessary
adjustments. The objective is to arrive at a budgeted unrestricted
fund balance as close as possible to that estimated in the SBP.

iv. Fund balances are increased in a manner consistent with Board
policy and the SBP. The total of the above fund balances are
expected to be 9.6% of projected Base System operating
expenses, or $41.0 million by the end of 2015.
b. FasTracks:
i. The total of the Board-appropriated fund, the capital acquisition
fund, and the unrestricted fund is $9.3 million and reflects 2
months
of
operating
expenses
for
both
FasTracks
Project/Construction and FasTracks Operations.
c. District-wide:
i. The total combined fund balances are expected to be 10.4% of
projected District-wide operating expenses by the end of 2015.

operating and capital sources and expenditures of the District for Base System and
FasTracks is included as Exhibit I.
