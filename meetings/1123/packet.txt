Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to award a contract (22DJ010) to DLT solutions
LLC in the amount of $2,020,472 for Oracle hardware, software and services.
BACKGROUND
RTD’s current core server and data storage infrastructure reached its end of useful life of 5 years in early 2012. This
procurement is part of a 5 year IT strategic plan included in the 2012 and 2013 strategic budget plan (SBP).
To meet operational requirements of the many new systems, RTD’s business applications have increasingly required
more processing and storage capacity, higher availability and recovery capabilities.
With this foundational hardware and software, over the next 12 months, the Information Technology team will be able
to consolidate over 30 servers into just 6 servers, increase system and application performance by over 600% and
provide critical system failover and disaster recovery.
RTD currently runs all critical business and operational systems using Oracle hardware and software. Below is a list,
although not all inclusive, of the services impacted by this procurement:
1. RTD’s finance, accounts receivable/payable, payroll and budgeting
2. Human resources employee management, benefits and recruiting
3. Purchase requisition, procurement, contracts and RTD’s inventory and warehousing
4. State of Good Repair (SoGR)
5. Rail and bus maintenance and work order system, operator management system
6. Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) such as Trip Planner, Farebox, Smartcard, CAD/AVL, passenger
information display, Internet and Intranet web and mobile applications
DISCUSSION
RTD received proposals from 2 vendors (DLT Solutions LLC and Mythics) for Invitation for Bid (IFB) No. 22DJ010. The
responsible low bidder was DLT Solutions LLC.
RTD is in various stages of implementing many new systems and upgrades to support the Fastracks program, our riders
as well as our operations and business staff. The hardware and software included in this contract will provide RTD the
core foundation that will enable us to continue to:
1. Create operational efficiencies throughout the District
2. Provide new services to our riders and constituents such as real time passenger information and automatic stop
announcements
3. Improve access to information including reporting and information analytics
4. Reduce system lifecycle support costs

Packet Pg. 3

B.1

5. Improve new software release quality assurance (QA) testing
6. Dramatically improve system performance and reliability
7. Provide the required hardware and software licensing infrastructure for continuation of operations disaster
recovery site located at the State of Colorado disaster recovery site (eFort)
The scope of this procurement includes the following:
 One additional engineered Oracle database server and storage (Exadata) plus required database licenses and 1
year of maintenance.
 Two engineered application servers and storage (Exalogic) plus required licenses and 1 year of maintenance.
 Foundation software licenses plus maintenance for real time passenger information systems.
 Foundation software licenses plus maintenance for an enterprise data warehouse.
 Software licenses plus maintenance for advanced reporting and business intelligence.
 Software licenses plus maintenance to provide business operations efficiency such as automating the purchase
requisition to DBE and contracts through accounts payable final invoice payment (procure to pay).
 Oracle advanced customer services to provide:
o Expert assessments and recommendations, incorporating best practices throughout the deployment and
asset lifecycle from Oracle advanced support engineers.
o Installation and configuration services for all hardware and associated software.
o Proactive quarterly patch and upgrade services for all hardware and software throughout the lifecycle of
assets.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Cost to the District for this long term foundational hardware and software is $2,020,472. Funding has been
appropriated in the 2013 IT operational expense budget.
ALTERNATIVES
Approve the request to replace legacy hardware and associated software licensing and continue to:
 Create operational efficiencies throughout the District
 Provide new services to our riders and constituents such as real time passenger information and automatic stop
announcements
 Improve access to information including reporting and information analytics
 Reduce system lifecycle support costs
 Improve new software release quality assurance (QA) testing
 Dramatically improve system performance and reliability
 Provide the required hardware and software licensing infrastructure for continuation of operations disaster
recovery site located at the State of Colorado disaster recovery site (eFort)
This is the recommendation from staff.
Do not approve the request and procure the necessary hardware and software over a few additional years which would
require RTD to:




Accept the inherent risk of prolonged system outages due to hardware which is beyond its useful life
Delay the rollout of various business and rider services such as procure to pay automation and real time
passenger information
Delay portions of the program for State of Good Repair

Packet Pg. 4

B.1



Delay advanced reporting and business intelligence for simpler access to information and reduce the need for
spreadsheets

Integrity of Model Forecasts
• Forecasts may be too high or too low, reflecting
uncertainty in the economy
• The forecasts are generated from theoretically sound
economic relations, modeled with state-of-the-art
methods of modern econometric time series analysis.
• BRD forecasts do not incorporate add factors or other
subjective adjustments of model forecasts
• BRD is independent from RTD with no political or
financial stake in the forecast numbers

(1) The variance is primarily due to wages and vehicle replacement parts
(2) The variance is due to lower West Line activition costs for wages
(3) The variance is primarily due to the DRCOG Front Range Travel Survey costs not yet being incurred
(4) The variance is primarily due to transit improvements not yet being incurred as well as funds budgeted for the Southeast extension and US36 projects not yet incurred
(5) The variance is primarily due to the timing of projects associated with facilities engineering
(6) The variance consists of lower data processing services, computer hardware purchases, recruitment, training, medical exams and the timing of fare media purchases
(7) The variance is due to lower costs for route promotions, SmartCard, general ridership campaign and graphics
(8) The variance is primarily due to the timing of WIN program expenses
(9) The variance is due to accrual reversal for the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force as well as lower travel
(10) The variance is due to a $11m capital contribution to USA for DUS renovations that will occur in December
(11) The variance is due to capitalized interest being different than budget. The interest expense and interest capitalized variances offset
