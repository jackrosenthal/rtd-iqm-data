PRESENTATION LENGTH

BACKGROUND
Article VI of the Board Bylaws governs the Committees of the Board and Section 1 outlines the selection
of members of the Board’s standing committees. Section 1 states:
Each year the newly elected Executive Committee will appoint between five and seven Directors
to the other standing committees based upon Directors’ stated interest in serving on standing
committees, and the Board will ratify the selections.
The amended Bylaws also provide that the chairs and vice chairs of the other standing committees will
be selected by the members of the committee. The elections for chair and vice chair of each standing
committee are scheduled to occur at the respective committee’s first meeting in 2025.
DISCUSSION
In late December 2024, the Board Office solicited feedback from returning and incoming Directors on
which standing committees each Director has interest in serving in 2025. The Board Office compiled
responses from the individual Directors for the Executive Committee to review during the January 9,
2025, Executive Committee Meeting.
After review and discussion, the Executive Committee made the following standing committee
appointments:
Finance and Planning Committee

Operations, Safety, and Security Committee
