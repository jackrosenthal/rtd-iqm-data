Committee Chair Francone called the meeting to order at 3:05 p.m.

Committee members in attendance: Chair Francone, Vice Chair Bagley, Directors Anderson, Archuleta, Menten, Tobiassen and Walker.

Others Present:               General Manager Genova, Barbara McManus, Tai-Shrae Parish, Director Solano

Director Bagley asked how many of the Directors had participated in the survey.

Barbara McManus, Executive Manager to the Board, said there were 11 full respondents.  She added that there was one partially completed survey, but it was not counted.

Committee Chair Francone said she could only say so many times, and only so many emails can be sent to impress upon the importance of completing the surveys.  She said if there were questions, resources are and were available.  She has discussed this with Barbara and Chair Tobiassen and while these responses are anonymous, she would like to see some way of tracking who has completed and participated in the various surveys.  She said that she does not need to know the Directors specific answers, but the Directors participations should be tracked.

Chair Tobiassen asked about the audit results.  He said we need to notate the process and make it very clear to everyone that it is their responsibility as part of the state audit.

Director Bagley said the Board is responsible for the management of the General Manager and that’s why the committee has suggested some type of methodology.  He added that if someone is on this committee, they are obliged to serve their district and fill out the survey.

Chair Tobiassen said staff would research and find out the best way to move forward.

General Manger Genova passed out an overview of his self-assessment that was not included in the Board Packet.  He stated that the details were similar to the previous memo’s the Board received.

Core Goal 1 – Performance Measures

General Manager Genova stated that the third quarter performance measures have not been put together yet, but they will be available by the final vote in December.  He added that this was a big year regarding service changes, and new services that were offered.  He reminded the Board about the shortage of operators and said that while numbers had improved, RTD is now in a lull again.

Director Bagley asked if the shortage was for Bus or Rail operators.

General Manager Genova remarked that the shortage affects both departments.  He noted that RTD previously had a policy which stated that light rail operators had to be hired in house, but that has since changed and RTD can hire externally for those positions.  He added that RTD still requires rail operators to have a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL), even though that is not a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) requirement.

Chair Tobiassen stated that one of the issues he has seen is that if someone moves from Bus to Rail, they cannot take their seniority with them.

Director Bagley commented that he went to the Elati Rail Facility to participate in the simulator and it was very difficult.  He recommended that the Board do so as well.

General Manager Genova said that another goal was to further advance smart card technology.  He said that staff did not get far, but there was advancement.  He stated that after the cyber security assessment, RTD has chosen to do additional work to protect our patrons.

Director Bagley said this is a big issue for the Board as the Xerox contract is six years old.  He added that it is significant for the Board to understand and he is glad that it is being addressed by both the Board and staff.

Core Goal 2 – Strong & Ethical Leadership

General Manager Genova said his appointment to General Manager has been a big transition for the agency.  He added that there has been a lot of shared vision and collaboration and he has provided testimony at the state capitol five times.

General Manager Genova added that RTD has been using a continuous improvement model to engage employees.  He stated that it was been well received and because of the improvement programs and better communication throughout the agency, workflow has improved within the agency.

General Manager Genova further added that he has been asked to participate in a variety of national and regional groups.  He stated that RTD has been called upon to participate in national conferences and webinars.  He commented that RTD continues to influence and lead the industry.  He noted that he has added quarterly press conferences, to be as transparent as possible.

Director Bagley asked that the General Manager’s press conferences be archived on youtube so that in the future, people can easily access the information.

Core Goal 3 – Strong Financial Management

General Manager Genova said this was the first time RTD has had a Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) cycle that no new debt was issued.  He added that RTD was also the recipient of a $92-million-dollar grant.

Core Goal 4 – Ensure Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action/Disadvantaged Business Enterprise/Small Business Enterprise

General Manger Genova commented that RTD is meeting all of its EEO requests.  He added that RTD hosted a four day national ADA Symposium, and has established a reasonable modification process for ADA.  The ADA office has established the first ADA review panel, and the Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) program continues to be reviewed as a national model.

Director Bagley remarked that his understanding is that since RTD established the WIN program, there are not a lot of other organizations such as CDOT and the City and County of Denver that must establish the same.

General Manager Genova stated that in order to be successful on a national level, organizations must provide a ladder of opportunity.

Director Menten asked where RTD was on modifying the light rail vehicles for ADA use.

General Manager Genova stated that the modifications will occur over a number of years, and the retrofit will remove eight seats per vehicle.

Director Bagley asked if there was anything in writing that specifies that the light rail highblocks can only be used for ADA access.  He commented that the highblock usage needs to be reviewed in depth.

General Manager Genova remarked that the priority users of the highblocks and ramps are for patrons with ADA needs.

Core Goal 5 – Effective Communications and Community Outreach

General Manager Genova stated that a lot of community outreach this year was done in correlation with the new openings.  He added that another issue is the 16th Street Mall discussion.  He has been happy with RTD and how the agency has been able to work with its stakeholders.  He referenced that RTD is doing work on a national level and noted the various national conferences and committees that RTD attends and the various awards that RTD has received.

Task Goal Number 1 – Fiscal Sustainability

General Manager Genova said staff will be presenting guiding principles for the Board to consider on Parking.  He added that there was a significant mishap with a light rail vehicle and the car was significantly damaged, but our team was able to do all of those repairs in house.

General Manager Genova commented that under exceeds was improvement from non-profit agency distribution channels and in 2016, RTD executed the first naming rights contract.

Committee Chair Francone asked if the results of those improvements have seen an improvement in non-profit agency participation.

General Manager Genova said he would have to come back to the Board with that information.

Director Bagley said he thought the affordable fare task force was completed, but now he senses that we are doing it again.

General Manager Genova said staff continues to have dialogue.  He commented that staff didn’t have an endpoint with that group, but we continue to look at options.  One viable alternative is that a third party can come to the table with funds to fund those passes.  What RTD has done with the pass program working group is that it has approved Board Objectives, and we are identifying the members.  One of the components will be low income or affordable fare representation.

Bagley said one of the major issues was working with Mile High Connect that would come up with the money for an affordable fare program.  He thinks having conversations to keep the lines of communication open is great, but this issue was already decided.

General Manager Genova outlined how the program worked today and the working group will examine all of the existing pass programs and evaluate how they were being used within the working group.

Director Anderson feels that the transit agency should be at the table, but it is not responsible for the welfare system

Director Solano was not happy that the check he just signed and was not sure why.

Director Bagley said we should stick to the agenda at hand and not add additional questions and information.

Director Francone said she thought General Counsel Marla Lien used to bring the Board an over view of where we were with legal actions.

Task Goal # 2 Openings of Five FasTracks Rail and BRT corridors in 2016 – Achieved Goal

General Manager Genova gave an overview of the three lines that are currently open and an overview of the additional openings of the last two corridors.  He outlined the plan he will bring to Washington for the meeting with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regarding the University of Colorado A line and the extension of the current waiver.  He stated that he would be traveling with Greg Straight and Henry Stopplecamp.  He commented that staff was on track with the R Line, but they are targeting mid-December for the opening.

Director Menten asked if General Manager Genova could update the entire Board at the meeting this evening.  He agreed to include this information on his General Manager’s report this evening.

Director Solano asked if the problems on the University of Colorado A Line had anything to do with the system Terry Emmons is asking for with regard to safety.

General Manager Genova said this is a separate piece of software and does not affect the University of Colorado’s A line issues that we are currently experiencing.

He added that the North Metro and SERE are moving along on schedule for 2108 and 2019 respectively.

Task Goal # 3 Technology

General Manager Genova gave an overview of all of the elements of this goal and where the agency is technology wise.  He spoke about Cyber Security and the Executive session given to the Board.  He mentioned that he, along with staff, is working on real-time information with the concessionaire as it was not spelled out clearly in the agreement and this is valuable information for service planning and performance.

A cursory review of the survey was discussed.  Chair Francone asked if General Manager Genova had any comments on the survey results.

General Manager Genova indicated he had not analyzed the results to date and he would review and respond to any specific comment directed to his current goals and incorporate as needed.

Chair Francone suggested General Manager Genova take a look at the survey as he is always interested in what the Board is thinking.

Committee Chair Francone said that the General Manager would make any adjustments to the performance appraisal self-assessment and resubmit to the committee for the November packet

General Manager Genova said he would provide a highlighted copy of the self-assessment by November 10th.

Committee Chair Francone asked that the committee be fully prepared to make the appropriate evaluation on November 15th.  The committee agreed.

There were no additional questions or next steps.

Committee Chair Francone adjourned the meeting at 4:50 p.m.
