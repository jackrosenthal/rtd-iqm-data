Cost Sharing Agreement - City of Boulder/HOP
for 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of Colorado at
Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year 2020 and is for
an amount not to exceed $1,901,675.
This recommended action supports the General Manager’s 2020 Task Goal – Successful Delivery of
Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City
of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of
the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to
provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.
The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on
Saturdays, and from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. In addition, Night HOP service is
provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately
2,800 passenger trips per weekday. RTD staff has been working with the City staff in a Hop redesign
planned originally for 2018. Part of the redesign has taken place with the majority planned for 2020.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount not
to exceed $1,901,675 in 2020.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the Hop will be assessed at the
end of the year in cooperation with the City of Boulder. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s
service standards. If it appears that the service performance is not in line with similar RTD bus routes,
then the RTD and the City of Boulder will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into
conformance. Ridership for a similar RTD route averages 20.3 boardings per hour. The provision of
HOP service through the 3rd Quarter of 2019 resulted in 22.8 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy
per HOP passenger trip of $1.92.

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for RTD support of the HOP service is included in the recommended 2020 RTD budget and is
subject to formal budget adoption. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a
Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the operation
of the HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of
Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar
year 2020 and is for an amount not to exceed $1,901,675.
2.

Do not approve entering into a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder. This course of
action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of the heavily-used HOP
circulator service which would have a negative impact on the residents, students and businesses in
the City of Boulder.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into funding
agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD financial
support for non-urbanized services for Boulder County, Adams County and Jefferson County. These
Agreements are for calendar year 2020 and for amounts not to exceed $395,752.00 for Boulder
County, $389,148.00 for Adams County and $138,204.00 for Jefferson County.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals for 2020:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
Since 1991, RTD has provided funding to various private, non-profit agencies to assist with the
provision of transit services in non-urbanized areas of the district. RTD has provided financial assistance
for the provision of non-urbanized service in Jefferson County since 1991 and has provided financial
assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Adams and Boulder Counties since 1993.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services
in Boulder County in an amount not to exceed $395,752.00 in 2020. RTD shall also contribute funding
to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams County in amount
not to exceed $389,148.00 in 2020. RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to
support the provision of non-urbanized services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed
$138,204.00 in 2020.
Non-urbanized service performance will be assessed at the end of each year in cooperation with Via
Mobility and the Seniors’ Resource Center (SRC). Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s
service performance. If it appears that the service performance is not in line with similar RTD services,
then the RTD and Via Mobility or the SRC will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it
into conformance. Ridership for a similar RTD paratransit services averages 1.4 boardings per hour.
The provision of non-urbanized service in 2019 (thru September) resulted in monthly performance that
ranged from 1.9 to 2.5 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per passenger boarding ranging from
approximately $1.07 to approximately $4.30 (subsidy reflects only the RTD contribution).

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.2

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for RTD support of the non-urbanized services is included in the recommended 2020 RTD
budget and is subject to formal budget adoption. This Agreement will be for a period of one year.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD
financial support for non-urbanized services for Boulder County, Adams County and Jefferson County.

County, $389,148.00 for Adams County and $138,204.00 for Jefferson County.
2.
Do not approve the funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource
Center. This course of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of
transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties which would
have a negative impact on the individuals that depend on this service.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
Englewood Trolley circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year
2020 and is for an amount not to exceed $394,284.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals for 2020:
Task Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circulator bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The service, named the “art shuttle,” was implemented in 2004 as
a free service. In September 2007, with the expiration of the CMAQ grant, RTD took over funding of
the art shuttle because the high ridership exceeded RTD’s expectations. The City of Englewood
continued the management and marketing of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood also covered all
marketing and related expenses. In 2018, the City of Englewood gave the art shuttle a new name and
look – The Englewood Trolley. The Englewood Trolley shuttle continues to be a free service that is
sponsored by the City of Englewood. The City of Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would
have been paid if the Englewood Trolley charged a RTD fare.
The Englewood Trolley currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service
on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. In 2019, RTD agreed to a pilot program to extend the hours to
8:00pm to cover the shift workers at the hospitals. Ridership was extremely low, therefore the hours
will return to a 6:30pm end time in January 2020. The Englewood Trolley operates between the
Englewood light rail station and Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The Englewood Trolley operates
as a free shuttle on a twenty (20) minute frequency.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the Englewood Trolley
in an amount not to exceed $394,284 in 2020.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the Englewood Trolley will be
assessed at the end of the year in cooperation with the City of Englewood. Performance will be
evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards. If it appears that the service performance is not in line
with similar RTD bus routes, then the RTD and the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the

service in order to bring it into conformance. Ridership for a similar RTD route averages 20.3 boardings
per hour. The provision of the Englewood Trolley service through the 3rd Quarter in 2019 resulted in
23.7 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per Englewood Trolley passenger trip of $2.35. The City
of Englewood will continue to pay for all fares for the Englewood Trolley.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for RTD support of the Englewood Trolley is included in the recommended 2020 RTD budget
and is subject to formal budget adoption. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.

2.

Do not approve entering into a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood. This course
of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of the Englewood
Trolley circulator service which would have a negative impact on the residents, visitors and
businesses in the City of Englewood.

Vanpooling Agreement with DRCOG for 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD financial support
and expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This
agreement is for calendar year 2020 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $780,000.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals for 2020:
Task Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites on a regularly scheduled basis in a van
that is driven and maintained by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry between six (6)
to twelve (12) riders, and the vehicles are provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be
sustainable and to render regular, on-going service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing,
fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
Vanpool participants must commit to a vanpool for an extended period of time. These vanpools provide
regularly scheduled personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater opportunities for increased
capacity as compared to carpooling.
RTD has supported the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program since 2001. Prior to this, the vanpool
program had experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, RTD and DRCOG entered into a partnership in April of
2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG believed
that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering desirable
mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver metropolitan area.
Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement of marginal bus
routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary marketing programs and
increased commuter transportation alternatives.
In 2009 DRCOG elected to pursue an outside vendor to operate the vanpool program. After a
competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool program. VPSI (Enterprise) took
over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. VPSI ensures all requests for accessibility are
accommodated at no extra cost.

Packet Pg. 10

1.B.4

DISCUSSION
RTD financial support is used to help underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. Currently the vanpools carry an average of 5.5 riders per van and the fleet is at 78%
capacity. DRCOG vanpool performance through August 2019 resulted in an RTD subsidy per passenger
seat of approximately $2.26.
RTD support is also used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers and to provide capital
funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since receiving RTD support in late
2001, the number of vans has grown from 11 to 93 active vans. RTD subsidies only pertain to vanpools
that operate within the RTD District. RTD claims all mileages that vanpools generate within the RTD
District. These miles are reported for inclusion in the RTD’s National Transit Data numbers.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for RTD support of the DRCOG vanpool program is included in the recommended 2020 budget
and is subject to formal budget adoption. This Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to
provide RTD financial support and expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the
Denver metropolitan area. This agreement is for calendar year 2020 and shall be in an amount not
to exceed $780,000.
2.

Do not approve the financial support and expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program.
This course of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of the
DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program which would eliminate this transportation option for
residents of the Denver metropolitan area who work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area
and could result in an increase in single occupant commuting.

Access-a-Cab 2020 Service Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary in order to continue
providing a subsidy for Access-a-Cab program for calendar year 2020.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals for 2020:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #3 – Enhance Current and Future Transportation Methods
DISCUSSION
In March 1997, the RTD Board of Directors introduced the Access-a-Cab program to our Access-a-Ride
program participants. The program offers flexibility in transportation services for individuals with
disabilities. Passengers may schedule same day trips with participating taxi companies. Current
participating companies are Metro/Yellow Transportation, zTrip, Green Taxi, and Union Taxi. All persons
using Access-a-Cab are certified as eligible to use RTD paratransit service.
The service provided is not RTD-branded transit service but rather taxi trips subsidized by RTD. The
passenger pays the taxi company the total cost of the trip, at a minimum charge of $2.00 to the
passenger, and RTD provides a subsidy to the taxi company of $12 for that trip. If the total charges for
the trip exceed $14.00, the passenger pays the additional amounts.
The Access-a-Cab program is beneficial to RTD due to its smaller subsidy per ride when compared to
trips taken on the RTD-operated Access-a-Ride service. Trips taken by passengers on the Access-a-Ride
service costs RTD an average of $57.00 per trip, as opposed to$12.00.
In 2019, Access-a-Cab provided 135,874 cab trips at a total cost to RTD of $1,630,488. While we do
not know whether those same trips would have been taken on Access-a-Ride, if those same trips had
been taken on Access-a-Ride, the total cost to RTD would have been approximately, $7,744,818.
Risk Management, in partnership with RTD’s insurance broker, Marsh, and Associate General Counsel
Aimee Beckwith, reviewed RTD’s standard insurance requirements for contracts in 2018. As a result of
that review, insurance policy limits were raised in new contracts to be consistent with standard industry
requirements based on type of coverage and potential exposure to RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The budget for 2020 is as follows: Metro/Yellow $1,800,000, zTrip, $75,000, Green Taxi $150,000,
and Union Taxi, $388,000. Funding for the Access-a-Cab service is budgeted annually based on
ridership and anticipated demand and must be approved by the RTD Board of Directors on an annual
basis.

Packet Pg. 12

1.B.5

Funds for the Access-a-Cab service are included in the 2020 recommended budget. Funds for Access-aCab service in future years will be requested as part of the budget process.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to
provide a subsidy for Access-a-Cab for calendar year 2020.
2. Do not approve the recommended action for the Access-a-Cab program and attempt to absorb
the increase in ridership onto the Access-a-Ride program at an increased subsidy per boarding.
This alternative is not recommended as it has the potential of raising the cost of Access-a-Ride
services.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the 2020 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) as required by 49 CFR Part 674
State Safety Oversight Regulations.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #1 Enhance Safety and Security
DISCUSSION
The FTA created a new State Safety Oversight regulation 49 CFR Part 674 in 2016 and the Colorado
Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) was certified in April of 2018 making the new ruling effective in August
2018. The new regulation replaced State Safety Oversight/System Safety Program Plan (SSPP) regulation
49 CFR 659 which required transit agency’s to develop a System Safety Program Plan. The new regulation
requires Rail Transit Agencies to develop a Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) based on
a Safety Management System (SMS) framework that is signed by the Agency Accountable Executive
(General Manager and CEO) approved by the Board of Directors and then submitted to the CPUC/State
Safety Oversight Agency for certification annually.
However, the FTA released the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan regulation 49 CFR Part 673 last
year which requires agencies to develop and be compliant with a PUC approved PTASP by July 20,
2020. As a result of the mismatched timing of the regulations, we are in a transitional period, still
technically under Part 659 SSPP as an Agency, but also technically beholden to the new Part 674 State
Safety Oversight regulation. Therefore, we are submitting a PTASP in the SMS Framework that is still a
bridge document that includes all required PTASP and SMS elements. We are asking for your approval of
this 2020 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan, understanding that it will meet all requirements for
the current Agency SSPP requirements and the current PUC 49 CFR Part 674 State Safety Oversight
requirements. This 2020 PTASP is very similar to the 2019 PTASP the board approved in November of
2018, with just a few minor edits to format and the safety reporting process.
Financial Impact – There is no financial impact.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the 2020 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) to ensure
compliance with 49 CFR Part 674 State Safety Oversight regulations.
2. Do not approve the 2020 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) and RTD will not be
in compliance with 49 CFR Part 674 State Safety Oversight Regulations potentially forfeiting
government funding.

I POLICY
The first element of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan is Safety Policy. This is at its most
simple, the safety policy developed, approved and signed by the District. However, this element also
describes RTD’s commitment to safety, its objectives and safety goals and the organizational structure
established and plans written to obtain these goals and objectives.
RTD is a multimodal agency comprised of light rail, commuter rail, bus, and special services.
RTD's mission is to meet its constituents’ present and future public transit needs by providing safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective service throughout the District. In accordance with the
directives of Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, (MAP-21) and Fixing America’s
Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, RTD undertook the conversion of the System Safety Program Plan
(SSPP) into the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) in 2018. The PTASP consists of a
series of policies and procedures, which must be undertaken to ensure the safety of its customers,
employees, emergency responders, and the general public. Development of the PTASP was completed in
accordance with Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Chapter 53, Colorado Public Utilities
Commission (PUC) State Safety Oversight (SSO) Program Procedures and Standards 49 CFR Part 674;
Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) and Federal Railroad Administration rules and regulations
(FRA). The PTASP is the system-wide governing safety document for all transit modes operated by RTD.
The RTD PTASP has adopted a Safety Management System (SMS) approach to administering safety
throughout the organization. SMS is flexible and scalable and consists of four elements as described in
the following table.
SMS Element

Definition of safety policies, procedures and
organizational structure
Formal process for management of hazards to
an acceptable level of risk
Establishment of process measures, assessments
and controls to assess the effectiveness of risk

Safety training and risk communication practices to
promote a culture of safety

Described throughout the PTASP are: RTD’s safety policies and procedures; safety risk management in
the form of RTD’s hazard management program; safety assurance mainly accomplished through RTD’s
internal safety review program; and training and practices to support safety promotion.

1.B.6.a

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) is a special transportation district of the State of Colorado
and authorized under Colorado Revised Statutes Title 32, Article 9. As such, the District has its own
taxing power and operates within the counties of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver,
Douglas, and Jefferson. The District is managed by a fifteen member elected Board of Directors who have
authorized the RTD General Manager to develop and implement a comprehensive and integrated Public
Transportation Agency Safety Plan. To that end, the General Manager, by signature authority of the
District’s Safety Policy Statement, has authorized the RTD Chief Safety Officer, Assistant General
Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management to develop and implement a Public Transportation
Agency Safety Plan as an operating document of the District for all modes of operations including
commuter rail, light rail, and bus/paratransit. RTD’s contractors, including RTD’s commuter rail operator
– Denver Transit Partners - are also governed under this Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan.
In April 2005, the U.S. Congress expanded the FTA regulatory role by granting authority to develop state
safety oversight programs, as defined by 49 CFR 659 - Final Rule, Rail Fixed Guideway Systems; State
Safety Oversight.
The FTA recognizes Colorado PUC, as the state safety oversight agency for RTD. PUC-SSO is FTA's
certified safety oversight agency, working cooperatively to regulate RTD's light rail transit, by ensuring
compliance with state and federal requirements, regulations, and guidance, as applicable.
The FTA functions as both an administrator of funds for capital projects and as a federal regulator as
defined by 49 CFR 674, 670 and 673. The FTA conducts regular reviews of the state safety oversight
agency (PUC- SSOA), to determine the SSO's and RTD's compliance to the FTA's general requirements.
RTD's light rail service is regulated by the FTA, and PUC SSO agencies.
RTD's commuter rail service is fully regulated by the FRA, and is not regulated by the PUC- SSO
(excepting at-grade crossings), or the FTA.

Ensuring that all staff are provided with appropriate safety-related information, equipment and
training
Establishing and measuring our safety performance against realistic, data-driven safety
performance indicators and targets
Continually improving our safety performance through management processes that ensure
appropriate actions are taken and assuring effectiveness
Ensuring externally supplied systems and services meet RTD’s safety performance standards.

RTD utilizes a Safety Management System (SMS) to prevent accidents, to reduce risk of injury and
minimize damage to property and equipment. We will work proactively towards identifying and reducing
the existence of hazards and risks in the workplace and in our system.
As the Accountable Executive for all operations and activities I will ensure that resources are available to
ensure our SMS is robust and successful. RTD management will take steps to prevent workplace
incidents, injuries, and illnesses and will provide support of safety program initiatives. They will consider
employee suggestions for achieving a safer, healthier workplace; keep informed about workplace safety
and health hazards, and regularly review the company safety programs.
RTD managers and supervisors are responsible for supervising and training workers in safe work
practices. They are expected to reinforce safe work and behaviors and compliance with company safety
rules and work to eliminate hazardous conditions. Managers and Supervisors will lead safety efforts by
example.
All RTD employees are expected and encouraged to participate in safety activities including reporting
hazards, reporting unsafe work practices, near misses, and accidents immediately to their supervisor or a
safety committee/department representative. All employees will wear required personal protective
equipment (PPE) and participate in and support safety activities. Employees will serve as Safety
Ambassadors by working safely, complying with requirements and serving as an example to others.
Disciplinary action will not be taken against an employee who acts to prevent an injury or who reports
any accident, incident, concern or hazard. All employees are required to abide by the standards and
procedures set forth in the SMS policy and the Public Transit Agency Safety Plan (PTASP). Behaviors,
such as illegal activity, negligence, acts of willful misconduct, or undue care and attention shall be
considered outside the scope of this policy.
The SMS Program is managed under my authority by the Chief Safety and Security Officer who reports
directly to me. All levels of management and all employees are accountable for the delivery of the highest
level of safety performance, starting with the General Manager and CEO.

Goals and Objectives

The RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) establishes formal structure and
processes to be used by RTD to identify, assess, track, control, minimize, and resolve hazards
associated with RTD bus and rail systems. The PTASP will be used as a means of preventing
injuries, incidents, system disruption, accidents, environmental damage, and other losses. It
demonstrates RTD's commitment to safety and compliance through loss prevention programs.
The plan is consistent with federal, state, and local regulations, and it sets forth procedures to
comply with standards and conditions of industry, 49 CFR Part 674, PUC's SSO Program
Standards, and applicable FRA rules and regulations applicable to Commuter Rail as contained in
49 CFR.
The PTASP applies to the planning, design, procurement, construction, activation, operations,
and maintenance services of the bus and rail system. The PTASP is approved by the General
manager /CEO and implemented under the direction of the Chief Safety Officer, the Senior
Leadership team, and Executive Safety and Security Committee (ESSC). RTD embraces and
participates with the Colorado Department of Transportation in achieving the state wide goal of
“Zero Fatalities” program. “This is a goal that everyone can live with”.
RTD's annual objectives for 2020 are:
 Zero Fatalities in RTD operating systems; Bus, Light Rail and Commuter Rail
 Preventable accident rate per 100,000 miles:
o Bus less than 2.0
 10% reduction in Light Rail preventable accidents
 10% reduction in Commuter Rail preventable accidents
 25% reduction of Lost time employee injuries
 15% reduction of OJI’s
o 25% reduction of Slip and Fall injuries
o 25% reduction of injuries from strains
The overall consideration in the development of the RTD PTASP is to provide safe and reliable
movement of passengers throughout the transit system. The passengers and the general public
must be confident that the RTD transit system is a safe system. To achieve this it is necessary to
design, construct and maintain a system that is free from recognized hazards with the safety of
employees, passengers and the general public in mind. RTD’s objectives will be met by drawing
information from system observation, local and state codes, federal guidelines, and specific RTD
requirements into a unified document to ensure a safe transportation system.

Goals

The goal of RTD's PTASP is to utilize and achieve the highest practical level of safety in order to
protect passengers, employees, emergency responders, contractors, invitees, and property. At a
minimum, the PTASP ensures the following processes are incorporated into RTD's system safety
programs, plans, processes, and practices to achieve its goals to:
 Define the physical, functional, and operational characteristics of its transit system with
its potential impact to people, equipment, infrastructure, facilities, and its operating
environment.
 Identify hazards or undesired events by examining historical data, causes, and
contributing factors.
 Provide a level of safety that is consistent with transit bus and rail standards.
 Assess risks by balancing the potential frequency of a hazard occurring against the
severity of the event, and quantify the event into acceptable or unacceptable categories.
 Eliminate, mitigate, or control unacceptable or undesirable hazards to acceptable levels.
 Determine if RTD's goals and objectives were achieved.
 Monitor hazard resolution effectiveness and determine if there are unexpected hazards.
 Comply with federal, state, and local rules and regulations.
 Continually improve and evaluate the Safety Management System and the processes that
support the SMS.
 Ensure that all customers perceive the system is safe and secure by maintaining a high
level of safety comparable to other transit systems as measured by maintaining a good
safety record, and by maintaining the visual aspects of the system in good repair

program. All RTD corporate safety policies are available on the RTD intranet.

I 2.3

Integrating Safety into all Aspects of RTD

The objective of safety at RTD is the continual improvement of our processes and operations to
maximize safety to the highest practicable level. This effort is undertaken by providing continual
opportunities for employees to be reminded of safety, incorporate safe practices into their
operations, and multiple means for each employee to identify potential hazards.
We accomplish this through Safety Moments at RTD meetings, Safety committee meetings,
weekly Safety messages, safety poster campaigns, identification and mitigation of hazards,
proactive reviews and inspections to identify potential hazards.
Within the different departments, multiple means of incorporating safety are presented. As
examples:

I 3 Overview of Management Structure
I 3.1

RTD Board of Directors and Executive Staff

RTD was created in 1969, by the 47th Colorado General Assembly for the purpose of providing a
public mass transportation system for RTD communities, and began operation in 1972. A 15member elected board of directors, which is the legislative body for RTD and determines all
questions of overall governance policy for RTD. RTD's board of directors appoints the General
Manager and chief executive officer (GM/CEO), who is ultimately responsible for safety.
The CEO has full charge of the acquisition, construction, maintenance, and operations of the
system and facilities of RTD, and of the administration of RTD business affairs. The CEO
supervises executive staff of chief department officers and Assistant General Managers. Included
in these officers, the chief operations officer is responsible for bus and rail transit operations. The
chief safety and security officer has responsibility for corporate safety. The safety department
reports monthly to the GM/CEO and executive staff during meetings of the Executive Safety and
Security Committee (ESSC)

The Executive Safety and Security Committee is the safety and security authority for the District
and has the following authority and responsibilities: to set and implement policies; to review and
approve rules and procedures; to assure the District’s safety and security goals and objectives are
achieved; approve and assure implementation of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan
(PTASP); and to review and advise on reports from RTD’s Asset Management and State of Good
Repair division. As such, the Committee recommends action for safety and security policy
development, reviews and approves policies, and has final decision-making authority regarding
safety and security issues. The Committee also serves as the District’s authority on management
of change/configuration management and safety and security certification processes. The
following policies will assure that safety goals and objectives are achieved.

Management—Key Role in Safety Overview

RTD's safety program is incorporated into every aspect of transit services, by rail and bus service
managers. Safe operations of bus and rail units are the responsibility of the Assistant General
Managers (AGM). Each operating division has an appointed AGM, who along with managers and
supervisors are responsible for implementing policies and procedures for safe operations. The
assistant general managers of the rail and bus units have charged their management teams to
effectively manage safety, and to develop safety programs, plans, procedures, training, policies,
and rules to govern safety; and to fully comply with the PTASP. Bus and rail maintenance
facilities are staffed with a manager of maintenance responsible for the safe operation of the
facility, and are supported by shift supervisors and maintenance workers during their performing
maintenance, servicing, and inspection. It is the RTD’s policy to comply with OSHA and FRA
regulations. RTD develops policies and procedures for occupational safety and health in
compliance with OSHA and applicable FRA regulations.
Supervisors' responsibilities place them at the forefront of RTD's rail and bus services safety
efforts. A significant portion of their duty is to serve as frontline safety specialists; monitoring,
ensuring, and emphasizing safety performance, rules compliance, and promoting a strong safety
climate. All employees are charged with adhering to safety, but supervisors are RTD's key to

improved safety-related behavior, and positive safety outcomes. Supervisors have the
responsibility to monitor safety compliance of their employees and ascertain that employees
understand their job functions and the safety requirements of that job.
RTD safety and health are managed at the lowest levels. Each employee is trained in safety, job
duties, and given responsibility for their own safety and the safety with whom he/she works. All
employees have the authority to halt an operation if it is deemed to be unsafe. RTD's system
safety processes emphasize open and fair dialog between leaders and subordinates to increase the
commitment to safety at all levels.
In an oversight role, transit safety specialists report to the Manager of Safety, who reports to the
Senior Manager, Safety and Environmental, who reports to the chief safety officer. Transit safety
specialists have a role in executing the functions necessary to ensure safety, to include the
following:
 Coordinate safety activities of the agency.
 Compile safety data and perform analysis to identify and assess operational risk.
 Assist in the investigation of accidents and incidents as appropriate.
 Evaluate hazard resolutions proposed by departments.
 Perform analysis to identify and resolve hazards.
 Evaluate proposed system modifications from a safety perspective.
 Conduct safety reviews and inspections.
 Provide safety support such as field and laboratory testing.
 Regulatory Reporting, including creation and submittal of PUC required Corrective
Action Plans and updates.
The Safety Department will conduct regularly scheduled internal safety reviews to evaluate
compliance and conformance with RTD's PTASP, PUC-SSO Program Standards 49 CFR Part
674; and 49 CFR 673. Transit safety specialists serve as alternates to each other. Transit safety
specialists work closely with management and employees, through various processes and
committees, and have authority to determine compliance. When warranted, transit safety
specialists may issue corrective action plans (CAP), and ensure appropriate departments
implement those plans. Transit safety specialists are the designated contacts to regulatory
agencies, and serve as alternate contacts to the PUC-SSO oversight agency.

Climate / Geography

The Denver Metro region normally has a semi-arid continental climate with four well-defined
seasons. Summers are characterized by hot, dry weather, but the high temperatures are usually not
oppressive since the relative humidity is generally low and the nights usually cool. August is the
hottest month with temperatures reading 90– 100 degrees F. Winters are cold, but usually not
severe. The average annual snowfall is less than 65 inches at the Denver airport but much higher
amounts fall in foothill locations. Precipitation is generally light during the summer and early fall
but may be heavy in the spring when storms from the Pacific Ocean are moving through the area
more frequently than at any other season of the year.
The RTD transit services extend throughout the Front Range Area approximately 60 miles wide
(E-W) between Pine Junction, Denver and Denver International Airport. The area also ranges
from Longmont on the north to Lone Tree on the South, a distance of 70 Miles. Service areas
include the foothills situated along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. Elevations range
from approximately 4,850 feet above sea level to greater than 9000 feet above sea level in the
foothills.

I 5 TRANSIT SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
I 5.1

Light Rail System Description

The RTD light rail system was designed as the first piece of a planned regional rapid transit
system. In 1989, the Colorado Supreme Court declared that the Denver metro area Regional
Transportation District was eligible to collect a Use Tax that enabled the District to accumulate
funding of $67 million for construction of a rail system.
The project was approved by DRCOG (Denver Regional Council of Governments) in 1991 and
construction on the initial 5.3 mile rail system and a functional maintenance facility began
without Federal funding or an increase in local taxes in October of 1992.
Safety Certification and Construction of the light rail system was completed by the end of
September, 1994 and the system opened for revenue service with eleven light rail vehicles on
October 7, 1994.

I 5.1.1 Scope and Service
Regular service of the light rail system is regulated by timetables and varies between peak (AM
and PM commuter times) and off-peak hours, weekends and weekdays, and special events, such
as conventions, sports, and parades. Light rail transit carries over 80,000 riders daily. Trains
operate as one, two, three, or four-car consists. Revenue service is generally available 21 hours
per day.
The Regional Transportation District’s objective is to operate the Light Rail Transit System
safely, reliably and efficiently and to integrate the light rail’s operation with bus service for the
greatest convenience to the public. This is the means by which the integration of transportation
services could assist the region in meeting clean air standards, alleviating traffic congestion, and
improving the overall quality of life of the area.
Light rail service operates on the existing 5.3 mile Central Corridor, the 8.7 mile Southwest
Corridor the 1.8 mile Central Platte Valley Spur, the 19 mile Southeast Corridor, and the 12.1
mile West Rail Line, the 10.5 mile I-225 corridor, and the 1.6 mile Southeast Rail Extension
(SERE). The system accommodates six lines; C, D, E, F, H, L, W and R.

I 5.1.2 Organizational Structure
The Light Rail Transit safety specialist’s office is located at the Elati Light Rail Operations and
Maintenance center. Thus, the lines of communication between Safety and Light Rail Operations
are effective. Key positions with Light Rail Operations are the Assistant General Manager of Rail

Packet Pg. 48

Operations, Senior Manager, Rail Operations, Planning &Systems, Business Program Manager,
General Superintendent of Light Rail Transportation, Manager of Rail Service Delivery, Manager
LRV Operator Training, Manager of LRT Operations, General Superintendent of Infrastructure.,
Manager of Light Rail Maintenance of Way, General Superintendent of Light Rail Vehicle
Maintenance, and Manager of Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance. All of these key positions have
access to the Light Rail Transit safety specialist.

I 5.1.3 Light Rail Corridors
Central Corridor
Central Corridor transit service is supported by a maintenance facility, light rail vehicles, 13
passenger stations, administrative offices, warehousing, traction power substations, and exclusive
and public rights-of-way through service areas. The light rail Mariposa maintenance facility is
located in Denver at 655 Mariposa Street near 6th Avenue. Light rail operates at speeds up to 55
mph along an exclusive right-of-way section adjacent to freight rail from the south, through the
central or downtown section at reduced speed, and continues at reduced speed through a
business/residential area to the north. The Central Corridor operates on 5.3 miles of trackway
with 13 stations including 3 park-n-ride locations. Light rail operates at surface level except for
one fly-over structure near Kalamath. There are two gated controlled high speed grade crossings
along the Central Corridor alignment, one at 13th Avenue and one at Bayaud.
The Central Corridor extends from I-25 and Broadway on the southwest end to 30th Avenue and
Downing Street on the north. Operations through downtown Denver is a contra-flow relative to
normal traffic, with trains heading northeasterly on California and southwesterly on Stout. The
Central Corridor provides direct connections between the I-25 and Broadway Station transfer
facility, Broadway Marketplace, Auraria Campus, Colorado Convention Center, and the 16th
Street Mall (Market Street, Civic Center Transit Stations, and Union Station, Five Points, and
many major hotels and businesses in between).
Major attractions within a short walking distance of the Central Corridor stations or the 16th
Street Mall shuttles include the Denver Center for the Performing Arts Complex, Federal
Courthouse, 17th Street Financial District, U.S. Mint, Tabor Center, State Capitol, Denver Art
Museum, Denver Public Library, Colorado History Museum, Larimer Square, and Coors Field.
Exhibit I shows the alignment of the Central Corridor and the locations of the thirteen passenger
stations which it serves.
The majority of the Central Corridor alignment is double tracked and parallels I-25 to the east on
an existing railroad right-of-way purchased by RTD from the D&RGW Railroad. The southern
terminus is at the I-25/Broadway Transfer Station where the alignment proceeds adjacent to the
Old Burnham Yard and proceeds down to the Colfax viaduct and Auraria campus. From the
Auraria campus on through the Central Business District area and out to the northern terminus,
the trackway is adjacent to the Denver public streets. The I- 25/Broadway southern terminus
station serves as a major bus transfer facility for Express, Regional and local buses previously
destined to the Denver Central Business District.
Approximately ½ mile north from the south end of the alignment and I-25/Broadway, another bus
transfer facility and passenger station is located at the Broadway Marketplace at Alameda.
Further north, the alignment is grade separated from Santa Fe and Kalamath by an elevated
structure. There are two high-speed grade crossings, one at Bayaud and one at 13th Avenue. Each

crossing is protected by a street median, flashing lights, gates and warning bells.. Another
passenger station is located at 10th and Osage. The station is primarily accessed as a pedestrian
and kiss-and ride.
Continuing north, the Colfax at Auraria passenger station near the Auraria Campus allows direct
access to the campus via a plaza as well as a bus transfer point. After leaving the Colfax at
Auraria station, the double track alignment proceeds across Kalamath and Speer Boulevard,
across a structure over Cherry Creek along Stout to the Convention Center Station near 14th
Street and Stout. At 14th Street, the inbound track turns east and then north to travel along
California. The outbound track continues on Stout Street between 14th and 19th Streets. There are
two passenger stations located on Stout at 16th and 18th Streets. The inbound track along
California travels in an automobile traffic contra-flow direction across 15th Street to the 16th
Street and California passenger station located on the bus mall. Continuing on the single northeast
bound track the alignment then crosses 17th Street to the next passenger station at 18th
Street on California. The single track proceeds northerly along California and southerly along
Stout and lying between 14th and 19th Streets and is referred to as the Crossmall. The Crossmall
is a loop formed by the single-track along the streets of California, 19th, Stout, and 14th, and
provides contra-flow in normally counterclockwise movements.
The alignment turns southeast on 19th where it joins the track to Welton and where the double
track now travels east on Welton Street to the 20th Street passenger station located between 19th
and 20th on Welton. The double track alignment continues as it crosses over to the south side of
Welton near 20th Street to 24th Street. Between 24th and 25th the double track configuration
transitions into a single track configuration. The single-track alignment is retained as it continues
northeasterly on Welton and next proceeds to the 25th Street passenger station located at the
nearside of 26th Street. Still traveling northeasterly along the alignment, the LRV approaches the
27th Street mini station located between 27th and 28th Streets, the alignment then transitions into
a double track configuration as it enters the 30th Avenue/Downing northern terminus station.
Station platforms are unattended and utilize Automated Fare Equipment for ticket sales and ticket
validation. Fare Inspectors monitor the proof of payment honor system. Roving Rail Supervisors,
contracted security specialists, and local police departments provide platform security.
An initial fleet of eleven light rail vehicles (LRVs) was procured for the operation of the Central
Corridor. Shortly after opening for service, six additional LRVs were ordered. The LRVs are a
Siemens Duewag SD100 model. They are 6-axle, single articulated, double ended, bi-directional,
high floor vehicles. They are approximately 80 feet in length, 8 feet and 9 inches in width, 13 feet
high and operate on a standard railroad track gauge of 4 feet and 8 ½ inches. They are powered
from an overhead wire by 750 volts direct current and capable of speeds up to 55 MPH. Each
vehicle is able to seat 48 to 56 passengers and will accommodate up to an additional 61 standing
passengers at normal loads. Additional standees may be accommodated at a crush load capacity.
Exhibit II shows the vehicle layout and critical exterior measurements to maximize the level of
comfort with which the passenger is afforded for their trip. In addition, the LRV is equipped with
HVAC and good lighting configuration.
Light rail vehicles are operated manually. Automatic block wayside signals, traffic signals, radio
communication, operational procedures and train orders govern operators regarding all
movements of the vehicles. Appropriate street traffic signals, speed limit signage and wayside
signals assist the operator in selecting proper movement sequence and speeds. City operations are

by line of sight. All city street crossing are governed by coordinating adjacent street intersection
traffic signals while the at-grade crossings at 13th Avenue and at Bayaud are governed by a gate
crossing with flashers and warning bells. The crossing at 13th Avenue and at Bayaud are jointly
used and maintained by the Union Pacific Railroad and RTD.
A 2.5 acre yard and Light Rail Mariposa Facility is located adjacent to the Southern Pacific
Railroad switching yard near 6th Avenue at 655 Mariposa Street. Powered switches on the
double track mainline provide access to and from yard leads at either end of the storage yard,
allowing access from ladder tracks into the shop. The Light Rail Mariposa Facility includes a
yard for vehicle storage and a maintenance facility for vehicle maintenance and system support
maintenance. Central Control is located on the second floor of the facility and is the operational
governing authority for all mainline vehicle movement. Central Control personnel
(Controller/Supervisors) direct, control and monitor revenue-service operations using radio,
telephone, and public address communications. Mainline operations is controlled by a schedule
timetable and directed by Central Control in accordance with established operating schedules,
rules and procedures. Controllers implement all corrective actions necessary to maintain service
schedules and to minimize adverse impacts of equipment failures, emergency situations, or
weather related problems. In addition, some unit repair, facility maintenance and non- revenue
maintenance occurs at RTD’s District Shop.
Passenger service on the Central Corridor Light Rail System began October 7, 1994. The system
is operated by Denver’s Regional Transportation District as part of a fully integrated mass transit
system which includes local bus routes, express bus routes, regional bus routes, shuttle bus routes,
and demand-response service for disabled customers.

Southwest Corridor
The Southwest Corridor opened for revenue service in July of 2000. It is an 8.7 mile extension of
the existing light rail system. Integrating into the existing system at I-25 and Broadway in
Denver, the Southwest Corridor extends south to Mineral Avenue in Littleton. There are five light
rail stations at the following locations: Evans Avenue Station; Englewood Station near Hampden
Avenue; Oxford Avenue Station; Littleton Station (downtown Littleton); and Mineral Avenue
Station. Each station location has an associated Park-n-Ride with the exception of the Oxford
Station. Refer to Exhibit I for a diagram of the Southwest Corridor alignment.
The corridor consists of mixed-use operations including three freight railroad mainline tracks,
two light rail tracks, and Santa Fe Drive on the west side of the corridor. The entire corridor is
grade-separated with the exception of a pedestrian-freight spur crossing at the Evans Avenue
Station. Traditional active grade crossing equipment and signals including warning bells, lights,
and gates control this crossing. The light rail tracks parallel the freight mainline tracks throughout
the corridor. To enhance patron use, the light rail corridor resides on the east side of the freight
rail corridor from I-25 and Broadway to Tufts Avenue, and on the west side of the freight corridor
from Tufts Avenue to Mineral Avenue. Two flyover structures accommodate grade separation
between freight railroad and light rail tracks; one near Tufts Avenue where the east/west
transition occurs, and one near Iowa where the light rail tracks cross the Iowa freight spur track.
The Southwest Corridor is a double track alignment operating in high-speed territory at a
maximum speed of 55mph. An additional fourteen light rail vehicles were added to the existing
fleet to accommodate the extension. The light rail vehicles are Siemens Duewag SD100 models,

the same vehicle in use for the Central Corridor. The light rail Mariposa maintenance facility was
expanded to accommodate the fleet size increase. All operational characteristics for the
Southwest Corridor are similar to the existing operational characteristics of the Central Corridor.
Since service origination of the Southwest Corridor, eighteen additional SD 100s have been
placed into revenue service.

Central Platte Valley Spur
The Central Platte Valley (CPV) Spur is approximately 1.8 miles in length, linking the existing
Central Corridor light rail line at Colfax Avenue to the Denver Union Station. This is a doubletrack alignment along the entire corridor including the junction.
The CPV Spur begins at approximately Colfax Avenue and Rio Court (at the location where the
existing Central Corridor light rail lines curves to the east under the Colfax Avenue viaduct). The
alignment generally follows Curtis Street from Colfax Avenue to west of 5th Street, on the
western edge of the Auraria Campus. At this point, the alignment turns north and parallels 5th
Street to Walnut Street. The alignment crosses Walnut and enters Auraria West Station. The
alignment parallels the Consolidated Mainline, to the Pepsi Center Station, then continues North
and ends at the Denver Union Station. Stations are located at the new Administration Building of
the Auraria Campus (Auraria West); near the existing "Sports Walk" that serves Empower Field
at Mile High Station near the Stadium; at the pedestrian bridge serving the Pepsi Center and
Elitch Gardens; and the Denver Union Station.
The alignment has two at-grade crossings:, 5th Street and Walnut Street.. The alignment includes
control and safety considerations to mitigate impacts to traffic in these areas. Specifically, these
include active warning devices at the light rail crossing of 5th Street and Walnut Street.
During major events, such as games and concerts at the Pepsi Center, Coors Field and Empower
Field at Mile High Stadium special service will be provided with trains running as frequently as
every four to five minutes between the event venue and the Southwest and Southeast Corridors.
Some of these special events trains may terminate at the I- 25/Broadway station while other will
continue to the Mineral Avenue, and Ridgegate end-of-line stations.

Southeast Corridor
The Southeast Corridor began revenue service in November 2006. The Southeast Corridor
consists of 34.47 kilometers (21.42 miles) of double-tracked light rail transit, beginning at the
existing Broadway station and ending at Ridgegate Station. This includes an alignment along I225 in the median, from I-25 to Parker Road. There are 16 stations: Louisiana; University;
Colorado; Yale; Southmoor; Belleview; Orchard; Arapahoe; Dry Creek; County Line; Lincoln;
Skyridge; Lone Tree Transit Center; Ridgegate Parkway; Dayton; and Nine Mile: . All facilities,
including RTD trains, stations, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and other design elements, are in
full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
In May 2019 the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) was opened for revenue service. This
extended double track rail service from the old Lincoln End of Line 1.6 miles to the new end of
line Ridgegate Station. Two other stations, Skyridge and Lone Tree City Center are located on
the extension.

1.B.6.a

The Southeast Corridor LRT alignment begins with a wye connection south of the existing
Broadway Rail Station. This connection allows LRT vehicles from the Southeast Corridor to
access both the Southwest Corridor and existing LRT line to central downtown. Following the
wye tracks, the LRT alignment rises above grade to pass over Broadway on an aerial structure.
After crossing Broadway, the alignment turns to the south along the southbound I-25 on ramp and
drops down to match the grade of I-25. This allows the LRT alignment to pass under the cross
streets maintaining a 5.1-meter (17-foot) vertical clearance above the top of rail. Through the
Narrows (Broadway to University) the LRT alignment parallels I-25 between I-25's collector
distributor road and Buchtel Boulevard. The tracks generally pass behind the abutment of the
highway bridges through a separate LRT bridge structure.
At the University interchange, the LRT alignment moves away from I-25 and runs along the
outside edge of the University off-ramp and rises up to pass over University on the aerial
structure. After crossing University, the LRT alignment continues along the outside edge of the
University on-ramp, returning to an alignment adjacent to the I-25 shoulder and at the same grade
as the highway.
Colorado to Evans
At Colorado, the LRT alignment follows the Colorado Boulevard off-ramp and travels under
Colorado Boulevard in a short tunnel section. After passing under Colorado, the LRT alignment
remains below grade, in an open trench section, and again parallels I-25, remaining as it passes
under Evans in a tunnel section.
Evans to Union
After passing under Evans, the LRT alignment rises up to return to the highway grade running
adjacent to the highway to Yale. At Yale Avenue, the LRT alignment runs along the edge of the
Yale ramps and passes over Yale on an aerial structure.
South of Yale, the LRT alignment follows along the west side of I-25, to Hampden Avenue. At
Hampden, the LRT alignment enters a very short tunnel section under Hampden and then returns
to the I-25 grade on the south side of Hampden.
The alignment passes under Quincy and then travels along the western edge of the I-25/I- 225
freeway interchange. Special track-work at this location allows for a wye connection to the LRT
alignment located along I-225. These connecting tracks are primarily at- grade and pass below the
I-25/I-225 interchange.
Union to Arapahoe Road
Proceeding south from the I-225 wye connection, the LRT alignment passes under Union Avenue
along the west edge of I-25. After passing under Union Avenue, the LRT alignment continues
south to Belleview where it travels along the ramps and over Belleview on an aerial structure.
Continuing south from Belleview, the LRT alignment runs adjacent to I-25 to Orchard where it
again shifts out along the ramps and over Orchard on an aerial structure. South of Orchard, the
LRT alignment returns to the west edge of the highway to Arapahoe Road. At Arapahoe Road,

the LRT alignment rises up to pass over the three west side ramps and Arapahoe Road on a long
aerial structure.
Arapahoe Road to Ridgegate Parkway
South of Arapahoe Road, the LRT alignment continues south, adjacent to the I-25 shoulder to
Dry Creek. At Dry Creek, the LRT alignment travels adjacent to the ramps and over Dry Creek
on an aerial structure. After passing Dry Creek, the LRT alignment returns to the I-25 shoulder to
County Line Road where it rises up to pass over two ramps and County Line Road on an aerial
structure. After passing County Line Road and the ramp in the southwest quadrant of the
interchange, the LRT alignment runs along the west edge of I-25 to the C-470/E470 interchange.
Through the C-470/E470 interchange, the LRT travels under the ramps in short tunnels and over
C470, around the western side of the interchange ramps and then adjacent to I- 25, where it
continues south to Skyridge station then crosses over to the east side of I-25 to Lone Tree City
Center and then south where it continues to an end of line station at Ridgegate Parkway.
I-225 from I-25 to Parker Road
The LRT alignment along I-225 begins at the I-25/I-225 interchange, where it connects to the I25 alignment through a wye connection, allowing LRT vehicles to connect to both the
northbound and southbound lines on the I-25 LRT alignment. After the wye connection, the LRT
alignment travels in the I-225 median at the highway grade. The LRT alignment continues in the
I-225 median to Parker Road where it passes over Parker and terminates with tail tracks on the
north side of Parker.
The Corridor operates with similar characteristics as existing corridors including traction power
substations and signal systems. A SCADA system is included in the Southeast Corridor project
and is retrofitted into the existing system. Additionally, an automatic trip stop system was added
to stop trains if they bypass a red signal.

West Corridor
The West Rail Line is a 12.1-mile light rail transit corridor that began revenue service in April
2013 extending from Denver Union Station (DUS) to Jefferson County, through Denver,
Lakewood and Golden. The West Rail Line has twelve stations including Auraria West,
Decatur/Federal, Knox, Perry, Sheridan, Lamar, Wadsworth, Garrison, Oak, Federal Center, Red
Rocks Community College, and Jeffco Government Center.
The alignment is double track from DUS to the Federal Center and is single track from the
Federal Center to the Jeffco Government Center station. Total travel time from DUS
to Jefferson County Government Center-Golden is 35 minutes. The corridor operates similarly to
existing RTD light rail corridors.
Starting from Denver Union Station the alignment travels to the Pepsi Center-Elitch Garden
Station, Sports Authority Field at Mile High Station, and then the Auraria West Campus Station.
Departing from the Auraria West Campus station, the alignment winds through a junction and
curves south and under Colfax Avenue and then crosses over the Consolidated Main Line (CML)
39
Packet Pg. 54

Bridge-Flyover. The alignment turns to the west and crosses the South Platte River Bridge. After
the descent the alignment goes under the I-25 viaduct and continues onto the West Rail Line
alignment traveling to the Decatur-Federal Station.
From Decatur-Federal Station the train continues west on the alignment under the Federal Bridge
to Knox Station. Leaving Knox Station, the alignment curves south towards 10th Avenue and
then continues west to the Perry Station. The alignment continues west to Sheridan Station.
Departing Sheridan Station the alignment goes under the Sheridan Bridge and curves north to
alongside 13th Avenue and then west to Lamar Station. Traveling west on the alignment the next
station is Lakewood-Wadsworth. The alignment approaches a bridge and stops at the station on
the bridge where there is pedestrian and bike access. Declining off of the bridge the alignment
continues west to the Garrison Station.
Continuing west, the alignment crosses the Kipling Bridge that goes over Kipling and has
pedestrian and bike access. After crossing the Kipling Bridge, the alignment continues and curves
slightly north to the Oak Station.
From the Oak Station the alignment curves south at Simms Street to 6th Avenue and crosses the
6th Avenue Bridge then continues to the south towards 2nd Street and approaches the Federal
Center Station.
Departing the Federal Center Station the alignment curves north towards 6th Avenue. The tracks
become single track at North Avenue. It goes through the Union Blvd. tunnel and continues north
until it approaches 6th Avenue. The alignment travels west alongside and on the south side of 6th
Avenue to the Red Rocks College Station where it splits into double track at the station.
Departing the Red Rocks College Station, the alignment continues west along 6th Avenue and
becomes a single track. The alignment curves north and approaches and crosses the Indiana Street
Bridge-Flyover to the north side of 6th Avenue where the alignment continues west and goes
through the I-70 underground tunnel. Continuing west the alignment approaches and crosses the
Colfax Bridge where 6th Avenue and Colfax meet. After descending from the Colfax Bridge, the
alignment continues west alongside 6th Avenue and curves north to the Jeffco Government
Center-Golden where it splits into double track and the line terminates.

I-225 Rail Corridor
The I-225 project added 10.5-miles to the Light Rail System within the city of Aurora that
provides key regional connections to the East and southeast rail lines. It was part of Fastracks,
RTD’s voter-approved plan passed in November 2004 to expand transit service across the Denver
metro region. Construction on the full line began in 2013. This light rail line opened for service to
the public featuring eight stations, Florida, Iliff, Aurora Metro Center, 2nd and Abilene, 13th
Avenue, Colfax, Fitzsimmons, and Peoria; as the R line in February 2017. This corridor extends
Light Rail service North from Nine Mile Station to the Peoria station where customers can
connect to the Commuter Line to Denver International Airport.

I 5.1.4 Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)

40
Packet Pg. 55

Attachment: Board Action- 2020 PTASP Approval (4056 : Approval of the 2020 Public Agency Transportation Safety Plan)

1.B.6.a

The RTD Light Rail System includes a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system. The SCADA system provides two types of general functions: control over certain system
elements from the Central Control center; and system monitoring and status information to the
Central Control Center. The SCADA system allows light rail controllers certain capabilities such
as remote capability to power down sections of the alignment and control over power switches. It
also provides information to the light rail controllers on the status of certain elements of the light
rail system. SCADA information includes: train locations, switch alignments, power status, signal
status and a variety of additional system information.

I 5.1.5 Light Rail Vehicles
The RTD light rail vehicle fleet consists of two models from Siemens: the SD 100 and the SD
160. The vehicles are very similar and have two main differences. The SD 160 has an AC
propulsion system and sliding plug doors where the SD 100 has a DC propulsion system and bifold doors. The SD 100 model is the original RTD vehicle and there are 49 vehicles in the fleet.
The SD 160 was originally ordered for the Southeast Corridor extension: 68 were delivered with
an additional 55 vehicles ordered for FasTracks, the first of which arrived in August 2009. An
additional 29 SD 160 vehicles were ordered in July 2018.RTD now has a total fleet of 201
vehicles..

I 5.1.6 Operations
Central Control, which underwent a major remodel to accommodate the system expansion and
SCADA, governs the operation, control, and dispatch of light rail vehicles. Control maintains
contact with the train operators by means of radio located in each light rail vehicle cab. Light rail
operators also carry a portable radio to be used in case they have to leave the cab or radio failure.
Controller/Supervisors rove throughout the system during operations. Their role is to provide
support and coordination between Central Control and light rail vehicle operators during an
emergency or upset in the system that may require a manual block operation, bus bridge,
evacuation, or accident response and investigation.
Current operations consist of eight lines; C, D, E, F, H, L, W and R. The C line serves from
Mineral Avenue to Denver Union Station. The D line serves from Mineral Avenue to 18th and
California. The E line serves from Ridgegate to Denver Union Station. The F line serves from
Ridgegate to 18th and California. The H line serves from Florida to 18th and California. The L
line is a downtown loop between 16th and Stout and 30th and Downing. The W line serves from
Jeffco Government Center to Denver Union Station. The R Line which opened February 2017
serves from Ridgegate to Peoria Station. Typical headways vary from 5 to 15 minutes during
peak operations with increased service operated for certain special events. Early morning or late
night headways on weekends and holidays are typically 30 minutes.
In the case of an accident or breakdown of the system, the controller controls train movement
using a manual block system. When necessary, buses are used in a “bridging” procedure to move
passengers around a trouble area.

I 5.2

Commuter Rail Service

The owner of RTDC, which is the Regional Transportation District (RTD) in Denver, has a
Concession Agreement with Denver Transit Partners (DTP), LLC, for the operation and
41
Packet Pg. 56

1.B.6.a

maintenance of the current RTDC commuter rail lines. Denver Transit Operators (DTO) under
this agreement is responsible for performing all services connected with the operation and
maintenance of the Concession Agreement. The lines operated by DTP comprise the East
Corridor (A-Line), Northwest Electrified Segment (B-Line) and the Gold Line (G Line).
In 2020, an additional commuter rail line, the North Metro (N-Line) will be starting revenue
service. Regional Transportation District (RTD) employees will perform all operations and
maintenance on the N-Line.
Denver Union Station (DUS) is the hub for multiple transportation modes in the Denver metro
area. Services operating on the East Corridor, Northwest Electrified Segment (NWES), and the
Gold Line terminate at DUS, which also accommodates Amtrak and other heavy rail movements.
The North Metro (N Line) operated by RTD will also operate out of DUS hub. DTO is
responsible for dispatching all commuter rail trains in and out of DUS and for maintaining the
infrastructure within the station.
The East Corridor (A Line) is a 22.8-mile segment running from Denver Union station (DUS) to
Denver International Airport (DEN). This line has six intermediate stations. The Northwest
Electrified Segment (B Line) is 5.5 miles operating north from DUS to Westminster. Two
stations are located on a portion of the Gold and B Lines share a portion of the track. The Gold
Line (G Line) is an 11.2-mile line that runs from DUS, west to Wheat Ridge. This line has six
intermediate stations.
The Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF) is the central control center for Denver Transit
Operators (DTO). This facility has a rolling stock maintenance shop, warehouse, administrative
offices and storage yard including a car wash.
The North Metro (N Line) is currently under testing and has six stations. Four of these stations
have pedestrian crossings. This 13.8-mile corridor will include 6 Highway Grade Crossings and
11 bridges.
Commuter Rail is regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration, and is subject to FRA rules,
regulations, and inspections. Hours of operation are, generally, 3:00 a.m.–1:30 a.m.

I 5.3

BUS OPERATIONS SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

The Regional Transportation District was created by an act of the Colorado General Assembly in
1969 and became an operating unit on July 1 of that year. The purpose of creating this agency
was to provide a regional approach to public transportation.
On January 1, 1974, RTD began collecting the half percent sales tax and became fully
operational. RTD initially inherited 321 buses from Denver Metro Transit.
Many of these vehicles were over 20 years old. Total bus mileage was nine million miles per
year, with fewer than 20 million riders annually.
Only one maintenance and storage facility existed for buses. There was little or no maintenance
capacity for buses in the small system operating in the District. These systems served several
local areas and there was a private Denver-Boulder bus line.

1.B.6.a

RTD began building a modern bus fleet and its needed support facilities. In 1975, the six
fragmented bus systems that had provided service to different areas of the District were integrated
into a single, unified system. New and improved service became the focal points for future
growth.
The improved service included the extension of routes, new local and express routes; more
frequent service; new nighttime service on many routes; increased service to the mountain areas
of the District; exclusive bus lanes and the inauguration of special service for the elderly and
disabled. Meeting special needs made RTD the first transit system in the nation with a
comprehensive bus program to service the needs of the elderly and disabled. All of these factors
led to a significant increase in ridership.
To support and encourage new riders, RTD also launched a program to establish Park-n- Ride
facilities. Additional bus maintenance and storage facilities were acquired to accommodate the
growing bus fleet.
The Mall bus service became operational in 1982. This was the first step in a unique transit
concept, which would pull 50 percent of the buses off downtown streets during peak hours and
provide opportunities for additional suburban service.
The District has evolved into a transit system that has a service area of 2,348 square miles. It
serves 40 municipalities in 8 counties. The system is comprised of 148 routes. The fleet currently
has 1011 buses of which 434 are leased to private carriers. There are currently four maintenance
and storage facilities District wide, 77 Park-n-Rides and 6 transfer stations.

I 5.3.1 Scope and Service
Regular service of the bus transit system is regulated by timetables and varies between peak and
off-peak hours, weekends, weekdays, and special events. The bus system transports an average of
344,339 weekday boarding’s. Denver Union Street Station and Civic Center Station are the main
transfer stations in the downtown Denver area.

I 5.3.2 Organizational Structure
The Bus Transit safety specialist’s office is located at the 1660 Blake Street office. Key positions
with Bus Operations are the Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, Deputy Assistant
General Manager of Bus Operations, General Superintendent of Bus Transportation, Manager of
Bus Transportation, General Superintendent of Bus Maintenance, Manager of Bus Maintenance,
and Manager of Street Supervision. All of these key positions have daily contact with the Bus
Transit safety specialist.

I 5.3.3 Bus Transportation Operations
Dispatch governs the operation, control and dispatch of buses and other RTD vehicles. Dispatch
maintains control with bus operators by means of two-way radios, standard telephones, and the
Global Positioning System. Street Supervisors also carry portable radios in the event of a system
failure. Street supervisors rove throughout the system during operations. Their role is to provide

1.B.6.a

support and coordination between Dispatch and bus operators during an emergency, accident
response and investigation, rerouting, or other bus-related issues.
Transportation Operations is responsible for providing safe, reliable and efficient service to all
areas served by our mass transit system. This is accomplished by scheduling bus service from
three divisions with 910 full-time and 133 part time bus operators. Service is provided seven days
a week over approximately 21 hours of each day.
Street Supervisors monitor service and performance of bus operators to insure the safe, efficient,
on-time delivery of scheduled bus service. The District also provides continuous evaluation of
routes, schedules, bus stops, shelters and facilities to determine the effectiveness and condition of
the service and amenities.
Effective, two-way radio communication is provided to all revenue and non-revenue vehicles.
Information is received and relayed to the proper sources to provide assistance and coordination
for bus operations. Communication is provided through the radio system, telephones, and a stateof the art tracking system.
The District also monitors bus service provided by private contractors, who operate
approximately 50% of RTD’s fixed route service. Assistance is provided to customers at transit
centers, transfer stations and the Telephone Information Center. The District also coordinates
special community events planning. In the event of a transit emergency, Dispatchers and Street
Supervisors will coordinate bus activities.

I 5.3.4 Standard Operating Procedures and Employee Rule Book
Bus Operations are strictly governed by policies and procedures outlined in the “Trailblazer”.
Standard rules of conduct and procedure are necessary. The rules outlined in this document have
been adopted for the requirements of RTD’s operations and are considered necessary for
rendering a quality level of service to customers. The “Trailblazer” is comprehensive manual with
procedures and guidelines for every aspect of bus operations including: the performance code;
passenger relations and interaction; ADA requirements; personnel practices; operating
procedures; emergency and legal procedures; equipment care and operation; personal appearance;
radio procedures; fares, transfers, and passes; operation procedures; routes maps and diagrams;
maintenance tips; fleet data; and street guides.
Service Planning/Scheduling updates the “Trailblazer” on an as-needed basis. Transportation
bulletins are a common practice that addresses day to day issues.

Management
I 6.1

System Security Plan (SSP)

The security program for RTD is described in the System Security Plan (SSP) filed with the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The
SSP is considered sensitive security information (SSI) per 49 CFR 15 and 1520, with distribution
controlled to only those with a need-to-know. The SSP complies with DHS guidance including
the National Response Framework, National Incident Management System (NIMS), and National
Preparedness Goal. For response to terrorism or natural disaster incidents, RTD Emergency
Management Plan is based on partnerships with the Urban Area Security Initiative working
group, and first-responder organizations of cities and counties throughout RTD's service area.
For traditional security functions as well as terrorism prevention, RTD's plans are based upon a
formally-adopted policy of awareness, observation and reporting by all employees, especially
front-line personnel, combined with effective responses by both RTD Security Operations
Command and first-responder law enforcement and emergency management organizations. RTD
riders are also asked to report suspicious behaviors or packages to employees, the RTD Security
Command Center, via the RTD Transit Watch App for mobile phones, or call 9-1-1 in the event
of an incident. RTD's Transit Police Division works in partnership with Police and Sheriff’s
departments throughout RTD's service area for high responsiveness to calls for police assistance
on the transit system, for application of the RTD Code of Conduct throughout the RTD service
area, and for effective criminal investigations and prosecutions. In support of security awareness
and reporting by transit system employees, RTD design criteria for new service projects applies
Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles, and provides Closed
Circuit Television and other equipment throughout the system to enhance security.

I 6.2

Emergency Management

The ability to respond quickly and in an organized manner is vital to the continuation of transit
service during a special event, emergency, or during the recovery from a catastrophic incident,
including but not limited to:
 Earthquake
 Fire
 Flooding
 Hazardous material spill
 Medical emergency
 Severe weather
 Transit related accidents
 Acts of Violence

Packet Pg. 64

1.B.6.a

Acts of terrorism

A more extensive discussion of RTD emergency management activities is contained in the RTD
Emergency Preparedness Plans, and the Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP), which are being
developed/revised for RTD. Each mode within RTD has the requirement to develop their specific
emergency response plan. Light Rail Emergency Response Plan, Commuter Rail Emergency
response Plan and Bus Emergency Preparedness Plan. These plans detail activities and
responsibilities for Rail Service personnel and are the responsibility of the Safety Department.
This plan (along with the safety program documents and SSP) also describes coordination of the
following emergency preparedness/management activities:
 Incident management – RTD management of an emergency event or incident is based on
the principles of NIMS and the Incident Command System (ICS). Using National
Incident Management System (NIMS) principles allows emergency response agencies to
communicate with RTD Field Supervisors and/or the RTD Security Command Center
(SCC). The structure of the ICS can be as simple as a single RTD Field Supervisor
responding to an incident, or may require the activation of a field Incident Command Post
or the RTD Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
 Coordination with external agencies – the RTD Chief of Police and Emergency
Management is principally responsible for the coordination of incident management
resources with various emergency service agencies to provide for effective interaction
between RTD and those agencies. Liaison with law enforcement agencies is primarily
the responsibility of the Chief Safety Officer, with assistance from the Chief of Police
and Emergency Management
 Emergency response planning and mitigation – RTD establishes a Fire/Life Safety and
Security Committee for each new rail extension or significant transit facility project. The
committee is comprised of safety and security staff; RTD operations, maintenance, and
engineering representatives; and police, fire, emergency medical, and other area
emergency response agency representatives. The committee reviews transit system
designs and recommends fire protection, life safety and security measures, and
procedural response and training needs related to the new extension or facility project.
 Emergency planning – As a critical transportation provider in the Denver metropolitan
area, RTD is a member of the Regional Emergency Management COOP and Urban Area
Security Initiative (UASI). It is RTD’s intent to develop a task force with regional
Emergency Management agencies responsible for emergency preparedness, response,
recovery, and mitigation planning and coordination among the counties and cities in the
metropolitan area, emergency response agencies, RTD, utility companies, and other
critical groups. RTD, with assistance from the Fire/Life Safety and Security Committee,
has developed emergency management operating plans and procedures to address a wide
range of emergency incidents and events, including criminal activity, earthquakes, fire at
transit stations and along the rights-of-way, hazardous materials releases, medical
emergencies, severe weather, terrorism, transportation mishaps, and other emergency
situations occurring within the RTD transit system.
 Emergency preparedness exercises – a minimum of one emergency tabletop or field
exercise is planned and conducted annually to ensure the adequacy of emergency plans
and procedures; readiness of RTD personnel to perform under emergency conditions;
effective coordination between RTD and emergency response agencies; and coordination
of regional emergency exercises that are facilitated through Use of the TERA Software or
other means. All exercises are followed by after-action analyses and reports to document
lessons learned and actions needed to improve RTD’s emergency operations capabilities.





Emergency response training – All front line RTD transportation and maintenance
personnel will undergo emergency response training to ensure they have a full
understanding of their role and responsibility during an emergency incident. The level of
training will be based on their anticipated role during the incident. At a minimum,
training is provided on the emergency plans and procedures that the employee may be
required to implement. Training to familiarize fire, rescue, and other emergency service
personnel with special transit system requirements is coordinated through the Fire and
Life Safety Committees and Safety and Security staff with assistance from the
Transportation and Maintenance Departments, as appropriate.

I 7 Hazard/Risk Management Overview
The hazard management program is developed and implemented by the Safety and
Environmental Division. Under the direction of the RTD Chief Safety and Security Officer,
Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management, the Senior Manager of
Safety and Environmental is responsible for managing this program. RTD utilizes the American
Passenger Transportation Association (APTA) guidelines and Military Standard 882E regarding
the identification and classification of hazards based on severity and probability. The hazard risk
index matrix is used to determine the overall hazard risk index. Hazard identification and
notification is accomplished in a variety of ways. Any employee may report potential hazards to
the Safety and Environmental Division by: use of the RTD safety issue/hazard reporting systems
that include Safety Committees, Safety Concern Reporting (HUB), Safety Hotline, Safety
@RTD-Denver.com, and Safety Suggestion boxes, or by contacting any of the Safety Division
staff or their immediate supervisor. Many hazards are reported and managed through the safety
committee process. Hazards will also be reported through formal mechanisms such as facility and
equipment inspections, internal safety reviews, system modification proposals, design review,
safety open items lists, integrated testing, and safety and security certification. This is an
integrated, system-wide approach to hazard management.
Once identified and reported, the Safety and Environmental Division will conduct a formal
hazard/risk analysis. All identified hazards will be tracked by the Safety and Environmental
Division and documented in the RTD Hazard/Event system or risk register. Regarding hazard
control and elimination, the system safety or hazard reduction precedence will be applied: design
for minimum risk (eliminate hazard through design when feasible/practical); incorporate safety
devices; provide warning devices; and develop policies, procedures and training.
The State Safety Oversight rules require that transit agencies with fixed rail guideways develop
and implement a hazard management program. The requirements include that the program
identify minimum thresholds, using RTD system data for the notification and reporting of hazards
to the oversight agency. For RTD’s program, hazards defined as meeting the minimum threshold
as reportable to the Public Utilities Commission (which utilizing Mil. Stan. 882E will be hazards
of hazard risk assessment matrix “High/unacceptable” – 1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, and 3A) will be
reported to the PUC as soon as practicable, but not later than 24 hours from the time of
occurrence or discovery. Hazard investigation reports will be provided to the PUC within 45 days
of the initial report date and include all PUC required information including a corrective action
plan and schedule for implementation. RTD will provide the PUC with quarterly progress reports
for hazards defined as reportable to the PUC. Refer to section 3.3.2 for additional information on
hazard management program. Hazards that do not fall into the “High/Unacceptable” category
51
Packet Pg. 66

1.B.6.a

will be reported to the PUC in monthly reports and will have all corrective action plans created
and implemented by RTD staff as outlined in the Safety Risk Management and Safety Assurance
sections of the PTASP.
Hazard management for the existing and future commuter rail system is described in Commuter
Rail System Safety Program Plan.

I8

Safety Assurance Overview

Safety Assurance is accomplished through implementation of safety oversight and risk
monitoring activities. As RTD implements its SMS, several activities will be initiated and tools
will be developed to support these safety oversight and risk monitoring activities. Safety
assurance includes safety reviews, evaluations, reviews, and inspections, as well as safety data
collection, tracking, and analysis, from various sources, including investigations; and
development of Key Safety Performance Indicators and Targets.
Safety Assurance also requires RTD to describe safety performance measures, and RTD will
initially focus on areas based on existing data delivered to the National Transit Database (NTD),
as the following:
 Fatalities – total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles
by mode
 Injuries – total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by
mode
 Safety Events – total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles
by mode
 System Reliability – mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode
These safety performance measures are used to select improvement targets for these four
measures and each mode of transit, in order to encourage improvements and monitor safety
performance of delivering transit services. In addition, RTD will select additional performance
measures, both leading and lagging, to insure continual improvement of our Safety Management
System.

I 8.1

Management of Change

Change Management is critical to an effective Safety Assurance program. The primary purpose of
change management, system modification, and safety and security certification is to ensure that
changes to the baseline/existing or significant capital projects for the transit system are reviewed
for conformance with existing RTD standards and to identify and assess potential hazards before
making changes to documents, equipment, facilities, or transit routes. Safety critical operational
documents, bus and rail fixed facilities, revenue and non-revenue vehicles equipment, and transit
routes are subject to change management and formal document control procedures. They include,
but are not limited to, agency policies standard operating procedures, emergency operating
procedures, safety and operating rules, training materials, drawings, and engineering reference
information.
These documents are subject to review or revision as a result of (not exclusive):
 Incidents or mishaps

In 2019, RTD created the Infrastructure Change Review Committee. The management of change
will be managed by the Infrastructure Change Review process. Details of this change
management process and the safety and security certification process can be found in the Safety
Assurance Section of the PTASP. In addition, the RTD Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan
and State of Good Repair efforts are managed separately, but are inputs to the SMS processes.

I 8.2

Continuous Improvement

Continuous improvement is defined by FTA as a process by which a transit agency examines
safety performance to identify safety deficiencies and carry out a plan to address the identified
safety deficiencies. RTD will use the management review cycle along with performance data for
the Safety Management System to identify and prioritize continuous improvement of each
process. This method is consistent with safety management systems principles and allows for the
resourcing and prioritization of RTD’s SMS efforts.

I9

Safety Promotion Overview

Safety promotion includes safety culture, safety-related lessons learned, and reporting systems,
recommendations based on safety metrics, data, and safety training. The intent of safety
promotion is to foster a positive safety culture in which RTD employees receive ongoing training
and updates of safety progress; feel comfortable reporting safety issues or concerns; and
understand why safety is important and how staff actions or inactions impact safety. Through
safety promotion, the Leadership Team broadcasts its commitment to safety and the SMS, and
demonstrates its commitment to the importance of safety.
The RTD Safety Promotion plans focus on three main areas:
1. Safety Culture - A positive safety culture focuses on finding and correcting systemic
issues rather than finding someone or something to blame. A positive safety culture
flourishes in an environment of trust, encouraging error-reporting and discouraging
covering up mistakes. The need to address behavior that is malicious or recklessly
negligent must be balanced with the need for a just culture that is not excessively
punitive. A positive safety culture goes beyond simply adhering to procedures. It is
demonstrated when employees carry out their duties correctly, with attention to detail,
full knowledge, sound judgment, and a sense of accountability.
2. Safety Communication - Effective communication of safety risks is critical and a key
component of the safety culture.

53
Packet Pg. 68

1.B.6.a

Attachment: Board Action- 2020 PTASP Approval (4056 : Approval of the 2020 Public Agency Transportation Safety Plan)

A Safety Promotion Communication Plan will be created with the assistance of the RTD
Communication Department. The Safety Promotion Communication Plan will include at least the
following topics:
 Dissemination of safety messages, progress towards safety performance targets, and
lessons learned
 Safety Hazards and risks
 Inform employees of actions taken in response to Safety Concern Reporting and trends
 Measuring or assessing safety culture
 Safety culture promotion
Safety Communication also includes the riders of the transit systems and the public that interacts
with the transit system. RTD leads and participates in several safety outreach activities and
provides safety awareness messages for riders and the public. The RTD Senior Specialist, Safety
Communications works directly with the SS&AM department to ensure a consistent internal and
external safety messaging.
3. Safety Training - Appropriate safety training is provided for each employee
commensurate with their position.
All RTD personnel will receive training to become familiar with:
 Safety Management Systems Overview
 Safety Reporting /Risk Management
 Safety Assurance
 Employee Roles and Responsibilities

I 9.1

Specific Job Safety Training

Safety specific training is provided by the division and department for employees. The training
includes an understanding of safety risks and controls, rules, and procedures. It is the
responsibility of department managers and supervisors to ensure the training requirements are
identified and fulfilled. SS&AM coordinates with department training instructors in formulating
and refining the training programs.
Managers and supervisors must arrange appropriate safety training for each position. This
includes both technical and non-technical training, on-the-job training, and refresher training.
Trainers must be competent and qualified in the delivery of training. A complete and
comprehensive training and qualification record by employee is maintained.
Suitable qualifications of employees are maintained and revalidated in accordance with the
requirements of the division and department, and regulatory requirements.

I 10

SMS Documentation and Records

Documentation and recordkeeping pertinent to each component or subcomponent of SMS is
described in the relevant section of the RTD SMS. This subcomponent will also include changes
for the management of new or revised safety requirements from regulations or otherwise, such as
the introduction of minimum standards for safety. In addition, this subcomponent includes safety
data and analyses delivered to and used by RTD management for safety-related decision-making.

System. A hazard is defined as a condition or set of conditions, internal or external to the RTD
system, which when activated could cause injury or death or damage or loss of equipment or
property. An unacceptable hazard is a condition that may endanger human life or property or
result in system loss. This includes harm to passengers, employees, contractors, equipment, and to
the general public. These hazardous conditions must be mitigated. Hazards are identified in
several different internal and external sources. Hazards may be observed in the operating
environment, through procedures, during system modifications and capital projects, accidents,
extensions or operational changes.
RTD has implemented the guidance as outlined in FTA’s Clarification letter September 6, 2007
on the hazard management requirements. The Hazard Management Program applies to all RTD
employees and obligates everyone to constantly observe hazards in their work areas and report
them to their safety committee, the transit safety specialist or to their supervisor or manager. The
overall hazard management program incorporates a system-wide hazard identification process,
including activities for:
 Identification
 Investigation
 Evaluation and analysis
 Control and elimination
 Tracking
 Ongoing reporting to PUC SSO and RTD senior management relating to hazard
management activities and status

II 1.1.2

Local Hazard Management

RTD Department Managers will play a key role in the hazard management process and ensure
that the process has been fully integrated within their departments. Managers will also ensure the
following elements of the hazard management process are present in their departments:
 Ensure employees have the ability to report hazards to management in person or through
the use of the electronic hazard reporting form via the hub;
 Ensure hazards are placed on a local hazard log for tracking and documentation;

committee;
Ensure each hazard has been assigned to a specific individual /Point Of Contact;
Participate in assigning hazard ratings (in accordance with the RTD Risk Assessment
Matrix); and
Ensure employees receive appropriate hazard management training.

II 1.1.3

Local Hazard Logs

Department managers along with transit safety specialists will ensure local hazard logs are used
to track hazards at the departmental level within RTD. These logs are to be maintained within the
department and are reviewed by the local safety committee on a monthly basis. Hazards placed on
the local log receive their initial and final hazard rating using RTD’s 21 box risk assessment
matrix. Management may give hazards their initial rating when hazards are received and final
ratings when they are closed. Management may also present hazards to the local safety committee
for hazard ratings or employ the Safety Department for assistance in rating hazards. Hazard
ratings may be changed when new information or as a result of data analysis.

II 1.1.4

Hazard Management

When a hazard is identified as needing mitigation that requires cost or changes beyond that of the
local safety committee or department abilities, the hazard will be elevated to the corresponding
Safety Department Hazard Logs and be reviewed by the future Safety and Security Review
Committee (SSRC). The SSRC will represent key department managers that have the ability to
make decisions and will employ multiple disciplines at RTD and have access to higher level
budgeted solutions.

II 1.1.5

Safety Department Hazard Logs

Transit safety specialists (TSS) are responsible for the maintenance of Safety Department Hazard
Logs. TSS’s ensure that hazards meeting defined criteria are entered into the appropriate category
within the Hazard Reporting System for accurate record keeping. Hazard rating can be assigned
by the either the TSS or the future SSRC. The following are Specific hazards that are identified
and mitigated at the corporate level:
 Unacceptable hazards (High Hazards);
 Hazards identified from reviews from outside agency’s (PUC, FTA, FRA, OSHA);
 Hazards identified from accident investigations;
 Hazards where corrective action will cost more than an estimate of $25,000;
 Serious or high hazards on local department hazard log over 180 day;
 When warranted by the Safety Department

II 1.1.6

Corrective Action Plan (CAP)

Corrective action plans are utilized within RTD for hazards that meet certain criteria. The
following hazards require the usage of a corrective action plan:
 Unacceptable hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, or 1C (High
Hazards);





Review findings from regulatory agencies resulting in Non-conformance (PUC, FTA,
FRA, OSHA);
Corrective action resulting from accident investigations;
When warranted by the Safety Department

In the following instances corrective action plans must receive prior approval by the SSO
Manager before corrective action plans may be carried out:
 Unacceptable hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, or 1C (High
Hazards);
 Review findings from regulatory agencies resulting in Non-conformance (PUC, FTA,
FRA, OSHA);
 Accident investigations requiring corrective action,
 Testing or reviews of Industrial Hygiene which potentially exceed OSHA PEL limits,
For hazards that do not meet the Unacceptable Risk Assessment Codes of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B or 1C
(High Hazards), SSO staff will review and preliminarily approve the CAP before safety risk
mitigation activities are implemented.
If an emergency corrective action must be taken immediately to ensure safety, the SSO must be
notified of the issue immediately and RTD must follow up with the SSO for subsequent review
and approval of the corrective action, within 5 business days.
The SSO will review and provide final approval of all Corrective Action Plans on a quarterly
basis.
CAP’s are assigned a specific tracking numbers by the Electronic Hazard Reporting System and
are and are linked with its associated hazard. CAP’s must contain at a minimum:
 A person of responsibility for the corrective action
 A proposed completion date
 Plan approval when applicable

II 1.1.7

Corrective Action Plan/Preventative Action Plan Development

Corrective action plans are developed by department managers/designee in conjunction with the
Safety Department and associated safety committees (Local Safety Committee, future SSRC, and
ESSC). Accident Evaluation Groups (to be formalized) will also be utilized when developing
CAP’s resulting from hazards identified after an accident. TSS’s will ensure that the CAP process
is followed and properly tracked until it is closed.

II 1.2 Hazard Process Overview
RTD's hazard process includes light rail, commuter rail, and bus systems. The following hazard
management flow chart lays out an overall description of how hazards are identified, evaluated,
analyzed, controlled or eliminated, tracked and reported to RTD senior management and PUC
State Safety Oversight.
 The Transit safety specialists assigned to light rail, bus, and capital projects are the
primary points of contact (POC) for the hazard management process.

Safety Committee members for rail and bus will be able to identify, evaluate, and analyze
hazards.
The TSS’s will enter identified hazards into the electronic hazard reporting system.
The TSS and or committee will develop a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) for each
unacceptable and undesirable hazard entry and identify point of contact or owner of the
hazard and places this information within the hazard reporting system for tracking
purposes.
CAP's may also be identified as a result of an incident and investigation.
Safety committee members also participate in the evaluation and control or elimination of
the hazard.
Hazards must be mitigated at the lowest level possible. However, when a hazard is
identified as having a mitigation that involves multiple departments, or requires cost or
changes beyond the safety committee or department abilities or budgets the hazard will
be elevated to the future Safety and Security Review Committee (SSRC). The SSRC will
represent key department managers and have the capability to employ multiple
disciplines at RTD and have access to higher level budgeted solutions.
Recommendations/Results from Contractor or Internal review, testing, industrial or
environmental sampling results requiring corrective actions will be placed in the hazard
log for follow up and possible need for retesting for compliance with Safety or
Environmental requirements.
If mitigation or control of a hazard is not achieved through the future SSRC, the hazard
mitigation process may be elevated to the Chief Safety Officer’s Safety and Security
Committee (ESSC) for final resolution.

II 1.3 Hazard Identification
Identification of hazards is the responsibility of all RTD employees and contractors. The
continuous identification, monitoring, and elimination of hazards is key to an effective system
safety program.
 Hazard identification methods include, but are not limited to the following:
 Observation, inspection, and interaction of all RTD employees and contractors,
 Reports from safety committee members, passengers, customer service, and field
personnel,
 Evaluation of accidents, incidents, near misses, to include data trends and projections.
 Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) of a design or new construction,
 Safety certification, system integration testing, pre-revenue testing, system modification,
configuration management verification, and inspection processes,
 Operation Hazard Analysis (OHA) of revenue operations
 Internal and external safety reviews, inspections, observations, defects, findings,
observations, violations, and reviews
 Controller logs, daily operating clearances/bulletins, and training feedback
 "Lesson learned" inputs.
 Review of applicable regulatory codes and standards
 "NTSB, FRA, FTA, OSHA, safety recommendations, guidance, initiatives, and alerts
 Nonconformance Reports, Corrective Action Reports (NCR and CARS)
Examples of observed hazards may include:
 An uneven sidewalk joint that could cause a trip and fall
 Opening in a section of corridor fencing which allows access of a trespasser

The RTD hazard logs (by mode – light rail, bus) are managed by the transit safety specialists
(TSS). Hazards identified by an employee to his/her supervisor may be resolved by the employee
and supervisor. For example, a discharged fire extinguisher may be identified by an employee and
brought to the attention of his/her supervisor and the supervisor gives the employee authorization
to order a newly charged extinguisher from the supply room for a replacement. If the supervisor
is unable to solve the identified hazard, he/she will forward the hazard to a safety committee
representative to be brought to the safety committee for resolution. The safety committee and
TSS will review the hazard and assign an initial hazard rating (IHR) and place the hazard into the
hazard reporting system to be tracked. The following flow process will be followed by employees
in identifying and correcting hazards at the employee/supervisor level and actions taken to move
the hazard to the safety committee and beyond if necessary.

Potential Sources of Hazard Identification

II 1.4 Hazard Investigation, Evaluation, and Analysis
RTD is currently in the process of developing and refining a database where incidents and
observed hazards can be tracked and analyzed for leading indicators of potential hazards. This
will allow management to be proactive in correcting hazards.
Safety concerns should be identified and corrected at the lowest level (employee/department) as
soon as practicable. Safety concerns that are not eliminated at this level are reported to a
supervisor or a transit safety specialist. Reported concerns will be assessed by the TSS and or
safety committee to determine if a safety hazard exists and assign an initial hazard rating (IHR).

II 1.4.1

Root Cause Analysis and Accident Evaluation

Hazards are investigated as they are identified through evaluating accidents, incidents, and near
misses. Hazards originating from accidents are reviewed by the transit safety specialist and
respective safety evaluation committees. As part of evaluating accidents and incidents, root cause
analysis using the “FIVE Why?” methodology is used to help focus on the bottom-line
fundamental cause and determine the most effective solutions to mitigating hazards. The primary
purpose of the accident evaluation process is to determine root causes potential hazards that may
have contributed to an incident. A third party expert may be used to assist with an investigation if
deemed necessary. This will be determined based upon a RTD hazard assessments, to be
determined frequent and high (Catastrophic HIGH).
HIGH risk hazards (1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B) that receive an unacceptable initial hazard analysis
made by management, safety committee or the transit safety specialist receive immediate
attention/control. A high hazard rating requires corrective action.
Hazards that receive a high hazard rating will be elevated from the local hazard log to the
electronic hazard reporting system.

SERIOUS hazards (1D, 2C, 3A, 3B) that are undesirable may require corrective action and
decisions by management. Hazards that receive a serious hazard rating will remain on the local
hazard logs no more than 150 days before being moved to the appropriate Safety Department
Log.
MEDIUM (1E, 2D, 2E, 3C, 3D, 3E, 4A, 4B) hazards may be acceptable with review by
management. Events from a medium hazard are less likely to occur and are less severe in nature.
LOW (4C, 4D, 4E) hazards do not require review and are acceptable.
ELIMINATED hazard is no longer present.

II 1.4.2

Hazard Reporting Threshold to PUC

RTD will notify the PUC of all identified hazards via the electronic reporting system and
monthly/quarterly reporting. RTD will notify PUC of all hazardous conditions that affect the
immediate safety or security of the rail system in a timely fashion. At a minimum, RTD notifies
PUC within one business day, according to the notification procedures in the PUC standard, of
hazardous conditions that are rated as High and set forth in the transit agency’s Hazard
Identification/Resolution Matrix:
 I-A (Catastrophic/Frequent)
 II-A (Critical/Frequent)
 I-B (Catastrophic/Probable)
 II-B (Critical/Probable)
 I-C (Catastrophic/Occasional)
RTD is responsible for assigning severity/probability ratings to hazardous conditions.
RTD will include in its hazard log and hazard management process hazardous conditions,
incidents, occurrences, and events, including the following:
 Incidents involving individuals working in the transit agency-controlled right of way that
are investigated by the transit agency.
 Malfunctions of safety-critical systems that could result, or have resulted in catastrophic
or single-point failure.
 Broken or missing safety-critical equipment, infrastructure, or systems that could result,
or have resulted, in employee or passenger injury, or damage to RTD property.
 Discoveries of systemic or patterns of employee non-compliance with transit agency
rules and procedures.
 Rail transit vehicle collisions with fixed objects on the mainline or in the yards.
 Rail transit vehicle derailments in the yards.
 Face-up or near miss of rail vehicles.
 Grade crossing warning system activation failure.
 Speed restriction or track closure due to track or facility damage.
 Fire or smoke on the track, on a vehicle, or in a facility.
 Broken or loose wheel or axle.
 Fallen or dragging rail vehicle equipment
 Split switch without derailment

Hazard Severity

Hazard severity is a subjective determination of the worst case that could be anticipated to result
from human error, design inadequacies, component failure or malfunction. The categories of
hazards based on the modified MIL-STD-882 are as follows:
Category 1 Catastrophic - Operating conditions are such that human error, design deficiencies,
element, subsystem or component failure or procedural deficiencies may cause death or major
system loss and require immediate termination of the unsafe activity or operation
Category 2 Critical - operating conditions are such that human error, subsystem or component
failure or procedural deficiencies may cause severe injury, severe occupational illness or major
system damage and require immediate corrective action.
Category 3 Marginal - Operating conditions are such that they may result in minor injury,
occupational illness or system damage and are such that human error, subsystem or component
failures can be counteracted or controlled.
Category 4 Negligible - Operating conditions are such that human error, subsystem or component
failure or procedural deficiencies will result in less than minor injury, occupational illness or
system damage.
The categorization of hazards is consistent with risk-based criteria for severity; it reflects the
principle that not all hazards pose an equal amount of risk to personal safety.

II 1.4.45

Hazard Probability

The probability of a particular event or a specific hazard occurring may be defined as a nondimensional ratio of the number of times that a specific event occurs to the total number of trials
in which this event will occur during the planned life expectancy of a system. Generally, hazard
probability is described qualitatively in potential occurrences per units of time, miles, trips/runs
or passengers carried. A hazard probability may be derived from the analysis of transit system
operating experience, evaluation of RTD safety data, the analysis of reliability and failure data, or
from historical safety data from other passenger rail systems or bus systems. (see Exhibit VIII)

1.B.6.a

Hazard or Risk Assessments

RTD has adopted a system for assessing the level of risk for each identified hazard to determine
what action(s) must be taken to correct or document the hazard risk. This assessment system has
been incorporated into the formal system safety analysis which enables the Transit safety
specialist or safety committees as decision makers to understand the amount of risk involved in
accepting the hazard in relation to the cost (schedule, cost, operations) to reduce the hazard to an
acceptable level.
The Hazard Matrix (6.4.2) identifies the hazard risk index (HRI) based upon hazard category and
probability and the criteria for defining further actions based upon the index.

II 1.5

Hazard Control, Elimination, and Tracking

Safety critical hazards that have been identified must be controlled or eliminated so that the
hazard does not continue to pose a danger. This may be done in a temporary manner as long as
the hazard is controlled. The process of controlling, tracking, and elimination, of hazards is
recorded on the hazard log which is generated from the electronic hazard reporting system. The
hazard log will be forwarded to PUC SSO on a monthly basis.
All hazard log entries require a mitigation plan or corrective action plan (CAP) (depending on
risk ranking), tracking number, brief description, projected completion date, and an initial
hazard/risk rating (IHR/IRR) using the RTD Hazard Analysis Matrix.
Corrective action plans include the following information:
 Element of activity identified as deficient
 Planned activities to resolve deficiency
 RTD department responsible for implementing corrective action
 Scheduled completion date for implementation
 Estimated cost of implementation
Hazard log entries with their associated corrective action plan are reviewed regularly by the
safety department, safety committees, PUC SSO and periodically reviewed by senior
management. CAP's may be tracked and sorted from the hazard log. When a CAP is closed the
hazard log will reflect this action and a closed date.
Individual CAP files are stored in the enterprise content management system by hazard tracking
number.

1.B.6.a

Hazard Resolution and Elimination

Hazard resolution is defined as the analysis and subsequent actions taken to reduce to the lowest
level practical, the risk associated with an identified hazard. Hazard resolution is not synonymous
with hazard elimination. In a transit environment, there are some hazards, which are impossible to
eliminate and others, which are highly impractical to eliminate. Reduction of risk to the lowest
practical level can be accomplished in a variety of ways from protective and warning devices to
special procedures.
1. Design out or design to minimize hazard severity. To the extent permitted by cost and
practicality, identified hazards will be eliminated or controlled by the design of
equipment, systems and facilities.
2. Hazards that cannot reasonably be eliminated or controlled through design will be
controlled to the extent practicable to an acceptable level through the use of fixed,
automatic, or other protective safety design features or devices. Provisions will be made
for periodic functional checks of safety devices and training for employees to ensure that
system safety objectives are met.
3. When design and safety devices cannot reasonably nor effective, eliminate or control an
identified hazard, safety warning devices will be used (to the extent practicable) to alert
persons to the hazards.
4. Where it is impossible to reasonably eliminate or adequately control a hazard through
design of the use of safety warning devices, procedures and training will be used to
control the hazard.

II 1.6

Hazard Tracking

Each CAP developed for hazards, findings from investigations or deficiencies will be submitted
to PUC SSO as required for review and approval. The CAP form is automatically assigned a
tracking number and placed on the Hazard log with its identified hazard. Upon completion of the
corrective action the safety department will submit to PUC as required. The completed CAP is
formally adopted by receiving PUC SSO's signature. The Hazard Log will then be updated to
show the status of the identified hazard with its CAP to "CLOSED".
RTD will monitor all Corrective Action Plans with the use of the RTD Hazard Log and will
provide PUC with an updated hazard log quarterly.
Internally, the safety department will coordinate with the appropriate department to develop a
Mitigation plan and fill out the appropriate form for the identified hazard. The form will be
assigned a tracking number by the electronic hazard reporting system and placed on the hazard
log with the corresponding hazards for tracking purposes.

The transit safety specialist will review the current status and identify any issues with the
resolution action and dates. The hazard log, at a minimum is provided to the SSO monthly
All hazards identified and rated as unacceptable hazardous conditions will be separately tracked
and reported to PUC along with the corrective action plans for each unacceptable hazardous
condition found. All hazards identified and rated as unacceptable hazardous conditions will be
separately tracked and reported to PUC with determination of an unacceptable hazardous
condition.
PUC will notify RTD in writing of its acceptance or rejection of the corrective action plan and in
accordance with procedures specified in the PUC SSO standard. The RTD CAP form requires the
PUC SSO electronic or wet signature approval indicating the assigned resolution and completion
of the CAP. The CAP is maintained in the Laserfiche hazard reporting system files and is
identified by a specific hazard log identifier tracking number. After a hazard has been resolved, it
will be assigned its final hazard rating.

II 1.8

Job Safety Briefing

Hazards that are identified in the work area will be recorded on the hazard log which is
maintained by the Transit safety specialist to the specific transportation mode at RTD. All
employees are encouraged to identify and control or resolve hazards at the lowest management
level possible. Employees that perform job tasks are required to discuss job tasks and identified
hazards that are associated with those tasks or job steps during job briefings. Identified hazards
that cannot be controlled with PPE or procedures must be resolved or mitigated through the
hazard management process.

these types of materials are ordered, they are not received until the SDS is provided. SDS forms
are forwarded to the transit safety specialists or and transit environmental specialists who place
the forms in the appropriate SDS database in RTD’s facilities and electronic system.

Packet Pg. 84

RTD will develop a comprehensive Environmental Management System Policy Manual that will
have jurisdiction over all hazardous materials activities and aspects of the organization. RTD
employees and department managers will be provided with and will be required to comply with
this management system. The manual and the EMS standard operating procedures (SOPs) will
require RTD personnel to comply with applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
The EMS policy manual will govern hazardous materials procurement, receiving, storage, use,
and disposal, as well as complying with legal and other requirements. A continual process of
assessment, corrections, and improvement will be adopted by RTD management as a part of the
adoption of the environmental management system program.
During 2013 the new addition of the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) was announced by
OSHA. RTD has incorporated awareness training and announced the new changes to the Hazard
Communications 29 CFR 1200 which are to be implemented over the next two years. All
material safety data sheets (MSDS) will change format and be known as SDS sheets and are
accessible through an Intranet-based system. All MSDS/SDS are available through the SharePoint
Site:
https://otis.osmanager4.com/#/chemical/righttoknow?rtkid=61fabd57-17a7-4a23-88d708aa3caec485&hv=7EBC55B743Z39E5A3578D01BB9E04008
Each employee receives training on hazardous materials management and is instructed as to their
responsibilities right to know about potential hazards that they work with. RTD's safety and
environmental compliance officers, as described in the EMS manual, review compliance with this
manual.

II 2.3

Management of Hazardous Materials

For any hazardous chemical used or stored in the workplace, RTD facilities must maintain a
safety data sheet (SDS), and submit the SDSs (or a list of the chemicals) to their state emergency
response commission (SERC), local emergency planning committee (LEPC), and local fire
department. RTD facilities must also report an annual inventory of these chemicals by March 1 of
each year to their SERC, LEPC, and local fire department. The Environmental Department has
been given this reporting responsibility. The information must be made available to the public.
There are over 2,000 listed hazardous materials and over 600 extremely hazardous chemicals
subject to reporting. Reporting requirements have been limited by quantity. RTD submits an
annual Tier II chemical inventory report for our facilities that are subject to reporting.
The common hazardous materials used by RTD that are subject to reporting are:
 Diesel Fuel
 Gasoline
 New and used oil
 Antifreeze (ethylene glycol)
 Lead acid batteries (sulfuric acid)
The liquids are stored in tanks or drums within secondary containment. RTD also uses many
hazardous chemicals contained in soaps, solvents, brake cleaners, paints, and aerosols. These
hazardous materials are described in the product-specific safety data sheets (SDS).

RTD is also a small quantity generator of hazardous waste. Hazardous waste is a hazardous
material that has outlived its usefulness or has become contaminated through use. Hazardous
wastes, can be generated by:
 Discarding a hazardous material (oil-based paint, pesticides, some soaps, expired
products)
 Using a product (used batteries, fluorescent lamps, HID lamps, paint thinner, aerosol
dregs)
Hazardous wastes are stored in closed containers and accumulated in satellite accumulation areas.
These containers are labeled hazardous waste and are located near where the waste is generated.
The environmental compliance officers are responsible for preparing appropriate manifests,
scheduling hazardous materials transportation, and final disposal.

Element III of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan is Safety Assurance, which
describes how RTD will measure and review its processes to ensure that it remains in compliance
with established standards. These processes, safety performance targets, and reports will provide
the confidence to RTD leadership that the organization and system is functioning in an acceptable
level of safety. The reviews, inspections, rules checks and compliance verification procedures are
described, required schedules set and acceptable measures established.

III 1 Internal Safety Review Process
Internal safety reviews and inspections are critical components of an integrated system safety
program. As such, internal safety reviews of the light rail system are conducted semiannually
parallel to the PUC to assure compliance with the System Safety Program Plan and that the plan
is effectively implemented. Facilities are inspected monthly for occupational safety issues and
local fire codes. The overall light rail system is reviewed to assure that activities required by
RTD’s operating, maintenance, and System Safety Program Plan are completed. Written reports
of each review are prepared and distributed to the various light rail departments reviewed. The
Executive Safety and Security Committee may also discuss safety reviews, evaluate the
effectiveness of the System Safety Program Plan, recommend corrective action if necessary, and
ensure timely implementation and follow up. An annual internal light rail review report is
compiled in January of each year and submitted to the PUC by February 15 of each year. The
report documents the review findings for the year including the results of the internal reviews
performed during the previous year, a summary of required corrective actions taken, if any, and
provision for follow up to ensure timely implementation and to determine effectiveness of the
system safety program plan. The annual report will be accompanied by a formal letter of
certification signed by the General Manager indicating that the RTD is in compliance with its
system safety program plan and system security plan. If RTD identifies areas of deficiency, the
General Manager, by letter, will identify the activities RTD will take to achieve compliance.
Documentation of inspection and reviews are maintained in the Safety and Environmental
Division.
As part of the safety review program, all RTD departments are subject to review. Under the
direction of the Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management, the Senior
Manager of Safety and Environmental is responsible for and has complete authority to conduct
internal safety reviews. Two reviews are conducted each year, one in the spring and one in the
fall. Within a three-year period, all system safety plan elements are reviewed for compliance with
the plan and state safety oversight requirements. The sixth review cycle is usually reserved to
review and revise the review process to assure that all elements are completed and that the
program meets the state safety oversight requirements.
RTD will notify the PUC of an upcoming review cycle at least 30 days prior to the start of the
safety review. The review team consists of representatives from the Safety Unit of RTD. Each
checklist is assigned a lead reviewer for the final development of the checklist and to be the
responsible person to complete the checklist including back up documentation when the review
cycle is complete.

III ASSURANCE

An opening conference may be scheduled with the departments subject to safety review; in some
cases an opening conference is not required. At the opening conference, the checklists are
distributed and each checklist is discussed and reviewed for accuracy; the schedule is then set
with the affected departments. The actual internal safety review consists of interviews with key
personnel, documentation review, and observation of activities to assess compliance and
understanding of rules, training, and procedures. After completion of the onsite activities, the
checklists are completed and a written draft report is developed. The draft report may include
recommendations or findings. Recommendations are defined as suggestions to make
improvements, while findings are defined as documented deficiencies in the implementation of
established programs, rules or procedures. The draft report is distributed for review and comment
to the affected parties. Parties have 30 days to respond to the draft report including an
opportunity to correct any findings. A final report is completed and distributed to all parties.
Recorded findings require the development of a corrective action plan. Each year, the annual
internal safety review report is prepared and submitted to the PUC, will include an evaluation of
the adequacy and effectiveness of the System Safety Program Plan.
Recommendation and findings will be tracked in two ways. Recommendations from previous
review cycles will be reviewed and evaluated in subsequent cycles. Findings will be tracked
under the corrective action plan process of placing all findings on a tracking spreadsheet and the
subsequent quarterly corrective action plan progress reports filed with the PUC.

III 1.1 Inspections and Reviews
The Safety Division conducts periodic inspections and safety reviews. Maintenance facilities are
inspected monthly to ensure compliance with occupational safety regulations and local fire codes.
Semiannual safety reviews are conducted in parallel with the Colorado Public Utilities
Commission to document compliance with established standard operating procedures,
maintenance plans and the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan. Any deviations from
required activities or identified safety hazards are resolved through a formal reporting process.
For additional information on system safety reviews, refer to section 5.3.

III 1.2 Accident Investigation, Notification, Reporting and Corrective Action Plans
Formal investigations shall be conducted for all light rail and bus accidents. All accidents are
investigated by either a Light Rail Supervisor or Transportation Street Supervisor Regarding bus
accidents, if damage is minor, personnel are unavailable or certain weather conditions exist,
operators may be instructed by Dispatch or law enforcement personnel to just complete an
accident report. Subsequent accident investigation reports are completed and distributed to the
Operations Division and the Safety and Environmental Division.
Light rail control will notify Safety Division of every accident that meets the criteria listed below.
Upon notification, Safety Division will determine the level of investigation to be performed by
the Safety Unit. Light rail accidents and incidents are investigated according to RTD Standard
Operating Procedure 103.2 – Incident/Accident Investigation.
This procedure is included as Exhibit V.
Safety Division personnel will either conduct light rail accident investigations or evaluate
accident investigation reports conducted by others, determine which agencies require notification
74
Packet Pg. 89

1.B.6.a

and make notification, determine most probable cause, prepare all necessary reports for the PUC
and other agencies, coordinate the preparation and implementation of corrective action plans if
necessary, prepare an accident tracking matrix, and provide summaries to the Executive Safety
and Security Committee. Light rail accidents will be tracked and evaluated by the Executive
Safety and Security Committee. The Safety Division will also coordinate all accident
investigation activities with the PUC and will provide as much advance notice as practical to
notify the PUC of an accident investigation. When investigating an accident as defined in rule
7347(a), RTD will give prior sufficient telephone or facsimile notice to the PUC's staff of the
times that an accident investigation team will convene to conduct interviews, inspections,
examinations, or tests to determine the cause of the accident.
Serious bus accidents are similarly investigated by the Accident Investigation Team consisting of
the following members: Street Supervisors, Manager of Dispatch-Street Supervision, Liability
Claims Representative, Division Manager, Manager of the bus operator’s division, Transportation
Manager of the bus operator’s division, Transit safety specialist/Bus Operations, and Technical
Services Representative.
Notification is required within two hours pursuant to 4 CCR 723-7-7348(a) for any accident
occurring on an RFGPTS where one or more of the following occurs:
1. Fatality at the scene, or confirmation of death within 30 days of accident
2. Serious Injuries as defined in Rule 7341 (tt) requiring immediate medical attention away
from the scene for one or more individuals
3. Property damage resulting from a collision involving a rail transit vehicle
4. An evacuation due to life safety reasons
5. A collision at a grade crossing
6. A derailment of a rail transit vehicle
7. A runaway train
8. A collision between a rail transit vehicle and a second rail transit vehicle, or a rail transit
non-revenue vehicle
Accident notification under 4-CCR 723-7, 7347(b) is not required by RTD as RTD has no light
rail track that is shared with the general railroad system.
RTD will also provide accident follow-up notification by e-mail in the form of a checklist to the
PUC including the following information:
 The nature of the accident as described above.
 The time, date, and location of the accident.
 The time and date of the notification to the PUC.
 A description of the vehicles, rail transit vehicles, passengers, individuals, rail transitcontrolled property, and other property involved in the accident and the direction they
were traveling at the time of the incident, if known.
For accidents involving a rail transit vehicle or taking place on rail transit-controlled property
where one or more of the above thresholds are met, the RTD will conduct accident investigations
for RTD and on behalf of the PUC. Written accident investigation reports will be provided to the
PUC within 45 days from the date of occurrence and shall include the following:

III 1.3 Collect, Analyze and Report System Safety Data, and Maintain Records
System safety data is collected through a variety of sources including near miss information,
accident investigation reports, internal safety reviews, safety committee meetings, occupational
injury reports, incident reports, use of an accident matrix, system monitoring including testing
and inspection records, and the hazard management program. This safety data will be analyzed,
and used for development of Key Safety Performance Indicators and Targets. RTD will initially
focus on areas based on data delivered to the National Transit Database (NTD), as the following:





Fatalities – total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles
by mode
Injuries – total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by
mode
Safety Events – total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles
by mode
System Reliability – mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode

These safety performance measures are used to select improvement targets for these four
measures and for each mode of transit, in order to encourage improvements and monitor the
safety performance of delivering transit services. In addition, RTD will select additional
performance measures and targets, both leading and lagging, to insure continual improvement of
our Safety Management System.
RTD will make its safety performance measures improvement targets available to applicable
State agencies (i.e. CDOT) and metropolitan planning organizations (currently Denver Regional
Council of Governments – DRCOG) (together, “External Entities”); and, to the maximum extent
practicable, will coordinate with the External Entities in the selection of External Entity safety
performance targets.
The safety data collected from the above sources will be analyzed for potential safety impacts.
Identified areas of concern are reported to appropriate personnel in the form of specific project
reports, memos, and recommendations from the Executive Safety and Security Committee.
Records of system safety data are maintained in the office of the Safety and Environmental
Division for a minimum of three years. Certain information, such as safety certification back up
documentation is maintained by RTD’s document control process managed by the Capital
Programs Department. In addition to safety, the Safety and Environmental Division maintains
data and documentation of activities required by the System Safety Program Plan. Distribution of
safety-related reports and data is accomplished through the RTD Executive Safety and Security
Committee.

III 1.4 System Modifications
New equipment modifications and retrofits are determined, reviewed, and approved by the RTD
engineering group and the Technical Support staff. Review may also take place by the RTD
Infrastructure Change Review Committee or Executive Safety and Security Committee if
necessary.

78
Packet Pg. 93

III 1.5 System Modifications and Configuration Management
System modifications are managed according to Light Rail Standard Operating Procedure 101.11,
Light Rail System Change Procedure. The SOP defines system change as follows: modifications,
alterations, additions, or deletions to the contracts, specifications, components, equipment or
facilities affecting any part of the light rail operating system.
This procedure is intended to assure that any potential hazards that may be introduced through
system modification are addressed through RTD’s hazard management program, and affected
RTD Departments are afforded the opportunity and given due consideration for any proposed
change or modification to the light rail system. System changes are proposed by submitting a
“Proposal for LRT System Change” form. This system change form includes the following
information:






Brief description including support data
Description of benefits expected
Resources required
Operation implications
Safety considerations

Completed forms are forwarded to the initiator’s supervisor, department head, and lastly to the
Executive Safety and Security Committee via the Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security
and Asset Management. Upon receipt of the proposed change, the Safety Unit determines if a
preliminary hazard analysis (PHA) is necessary. If a PHA is necessary, it is performed by the
Safety Unit. All information is distributed to the Executive Safety and Security Committee for
evaluation based on safety, operational, and cost criteria. The Committee must reach consensus
for the proposal to be accepted. Recommended proposals are forwarded to the Assistant General
Manager of Rail Operations for final signature approval. A review schedule is followed to ensure
proposals are evaluated in a timely manner. The Executive Safety and Security Committee meets
monthly to address proposals and other light rail safety and security issues.
Documentation is accomplished by tracking the system change form and keeping a log of
proposed changes with notes and final action disposition. The scope of this section applies to the
light rail system.
Management of Change/Configuration management is managed in a similar fashion. Authority to
make configuration changes lies with the Infrastructure Change Review Committee with the
consensus of the Executive Safety and Security Committee. The process for making configuration
changes is controlled by the Executive Safety and Security Committee. Specific members of the
Executive Safety and Security Committee participate in the design review and acceptance of
modifications, new equipment and facilities, and system expansion. In managing this process
through the Executive Safety and Security Committee, all departments are assured the
opportunity to review and provide input. Design is further controlled by RTD’s Light Rail Design
Criteria. Any deviation from the design criteria must be approved by the Executive Safety and
Security Committee. The formal safety certification process is applied to system expansions and
new systems. Refer to safety certification section for additional information.

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modifications Hazard

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are included in the hazard management
program process as described in sections 3.3.2, 3.3.3, and 3.3.4. This process is administered by
the Safety and Environmental Division and performed jointly by the Engineering Division, the
Light Rail Operations Division, and the Safety and Environmental Division. New equipment,
system expansions, and modifications are ultimately reviewed, approved, and documented by the
Executive Safety and Security Committee.

III 1.5.2

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification Review

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are reviewed and approved by the
Engineering Division, the Light Rail Operations Division, and the Safety and Environmental
Division. This review is conducted to assure that new equipment, expansions, and modifications
safely and operationally integrate into the existing system.

III 1.5.3
Acceptance

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification

Operational readiness of new equipment and system expansions is verified through the equipment
acceptance and safety and security certification process. The Light Rail Operations Division
performs rigorous equipment and integration testing as part of the Vehicle and Equipment
Acceptance process. Once complete, new vehicles and equipment are formally accepted by the
Light Rail Operations Division. This information is presented and approved by the Safety
Certification Program and described in section 3.3.13. The Safety and Security Certification
Program provides an identification, design, review and verification process for system expansions
and modifications. Certification process completion is verified by sign-off from the Chairman of
the Executive Safety and Security Committee.

III 1.5.4

Exceptions to Established Design Criteria

Level 4 and above exceptions to RTD’s Light Rail Design Criteria are approved only by the
acceptance of the Executive Safety and Security Committee. If appropriate, the Design Criteria
may be amended or modified to accommodate acceptable modifications. The Assistant General
Manager of Capital Programs is responsible for the maintenance and distribution of the light rail
design criteria.

III 1.5.5

Procurement Procedures

Procurement of equipment and materials is controlled by RTD’s Procurement Standards Manual.
Each procurement requires the development of detailed specifications assembled by the
requesting manager. Levels of review are built into the procurement process depending upon the
scope of the procurement. As the scope of the procurement increases, so does the level of review.
Minor procurements require authorization from the Contracts and Procurement division and the
Division Manager of the requesting division. Major procurements such as light rail construction
related projects or procurement of light rail vehicles, are subject to the following review process.
The Engineering Division and Technical Support Staff develop detailed specifications through

Resolution

the design process. These specifications are subject to several internal reviews at varying levels of
design, peer reviews by personnel from other transit agencies, and ultimate approval by the
Executive Safety and Security Committee. In addition to procurement specifications, the Safety
and Security Certification Review Process described in Section 3.3.13 governs light rail
construction. This procurement procedure in combination with the system modification
procedure, established design criteria, and hazard communication program precludes the
introduction of unauthorized hazardous materials and supplies as well as defective or deficient
equipment into the District’s Transit Systems.

III 2 Management of Change
Management of Change/Configuration control within RTD will be managed through the
Infrastructure Change Review (ICR) process during design and construction. The ICR process is
managed for RTD by Capital Development. The MOC process is managed by the Executive
Safety and Security Committee (ESSC) chaired by the chief safety officer. Management of
Change/Configuration management within RTD consists of the ICR process during design and
construction, and the management of change (MOC) process during operations, in coordination
with the ESSC.
The ICR process is managed for RTD by Capital Programs Department, and coordinates new
systems or extensions before they are implemented in the existing operating environment. Project
managers use the Project Management Plan (PMP) to guide capital projects. In addition to the
Project Management Plan (PMP) the Project Control Specialist will implement guidance from the
Project Control User Manual. This manual is updated periodically and contains direction for as
built and document control procedures. Specific guidance for document control procedures, File
Creation (4.2), File codes, is provided in the Project Control User Manual Section 4.0. Smaller
projects may include an abbreviated PMP specific to the project.
Representatives from each involved department and safety are represented in the ICR process.
Project changes to existing structures or facilities is critical that effected RTD personnel, public,
or other affected groups be notified of the change which might have potential safety or security
impacts. Affected personnel are invited to participate in project meetings and coordinate any
changes. Additional training may be required. Operations and maintenance procedures, bulletins
or SOP’s may need to be developed. General public may be affected. The Public Relations
Department personnel assist with communications to outside agencies or effected groups. There
is an essential element of communications that must take place after the project is completed and
being used. Any observed negative or hazardous impacts of a change must be reported to
management personnel as soon as possible.

III 2.1 Safety and Security Certification
System Safety personnel develop and implement Safety and Security Certification Programs to
assure that safety and security concerns and hazards are addressed prior to the initiation of rail
passenger operations for new corridors, system extensions, rehabilitation, modification or
replacement of equipment. RTD utilizes the FTA Handbook for Transit Safety and Security
Certification to develop the requirements for each safety and security certification program. An
individual safety and security certification plan is developed for each new corridor. For minor
extensions or projects, safety and security certification is addressed through the preparation of
safety and security certification forms applicable to the scope of work. Modifications are
managed through the light rail change/modification process. Regarding new equipment, if it is
procured as part of a new maintenance facility, the equipment is included in the certification

Packet Pg. 97

1.B.6.a

program for the facility. Rail vehicles undergo a formalized acceptance program under the
supervision of rail operations. The Safety and Security Certification Program has the following
goals: verify that acceptable safety and security levels are met or exceeded; document the
verification of safety and security standards; and provide consistency for project certification.
With these goals in mind, the objectives of the Program can be more narrowly defined.
Objectives of the Program include: identify and verify safety and security requirements of the
system design; identify and verify safety and security requirements for construction and system
equipment installation; identify and verify safety and security requirements are met or exceeded
for system testing; and identify and verify safety and security requirements are met for changes or
modifications to standard operating procedures, training manuals, rule book, and system
elements. Under the direction of the RTD Chief Safety Officer, Assistant General Manager of
Safety, Security and Asset Management, the Senior Manager of Safety and Environmental and
the System Safety and Security Manager are responsible for the management of the Program. The
Executive Safety and Security Committee, chaired by the Assistant General Manager of Safety,
Security and Asset Management, oversee the process, in coordination with the ICR.

III 2.2 Quality Assurance
Large projects at RTD have a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) function built into the
design and construction of the project. Specific personnel are responsible for QA/QC activities. In
general, QA/QC activities in large projects follow standard industry practice and are subject to
review by the FTA and others. Quality control during construction projects is a requirement of the
contractor, and submitted in his quality plan prior to initiation of construction. RTD retains
qualified inspectors and testing firms to provide Quality Assurance by document submittal
reviews and periodic testing of materials throughout the project.
Received goods are compared to items ordered, lot numbering or other certifications as required
on safety critical items. Where applicable, receiving personnel assure that lot number
documentation is provided before materials are received or accepted. Periodically, purchasing
personnel or transit safety specialists will randomly sample hardware, slings, lifting devices, and
other devices for compliance with specifications. Items will also be periodically functionally
tested to assure they meet standards.

III 3 Rules Compliance
III 3.1 Reports and Data Analysis
The results of the operational tests are compiled and reviewed quarterly by the Manager of Rail
Operations or a designated supervisor(s) and the Safety Manager. A written form of the
discussion and review will be provided to the Safety Department within 30 days after the end of
the quarter. An annual report is completed by a designated supervisor(s) summarizing the
previous year’s results of the operational tests. The annual report is turned over to the Safety
Department for further review and trend analysis. See SOP 109.23 Operational Rule Compliance
Testing.

III 3.1.1

Enforcement Violations

Rule violations are addressed through the corporate positive people management process (PPM)
which includes: coaching, retraining, and, formal discipline (performance agreement and
termination) that may result in termination. See RTD Corporate Policy 6.3.1. Rail operations
maintains a log for all stop indications and wrong route violations, and may further investigate
any rules violation that is reported, or that may be part of an accident or incident. Additionally, all
accidents and incidents are reviewed by supervisors and the safety administrator to determine if
rules have been violated, or if revisions, changes, or additions are necessary.

III 3.1.2

Hazard Management

The transit safety specialist may incorporate violation trends or deficiencies for any rule or
procedure into the hazard management program for resolution. Hazards unresolved by the Rail
Safety Committee (RSC) are directed to the SSRC committee for further tracking, review,
resolution, and or correction. Non-compliant review findings determined to be hazardous are
documented in the hazard log. A date of observation, description of the hazardous condition,
corrective action required, and implementation date are tracked until the hazardous condition is
corrected. See the Hazard Management Program portion of the PTASP for further information.
The Safety Administrator conducts ongoing and regular observations and reviews to determine
the effectiveness of the rule compliance program. Rail Service and the Rail Safety Committee
review rules and procedures regularly to determine if changes, revisions, or additions are
necessary.

III 3.2 Standard Operating Procedures and Employee Rule Book
Adopted Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and the Employee Rule Books strictly govern
light rail operations. The SOP manual is comprehensive with procedures for every aspect of light
rail operation including: administration, communication, operations- normal, operations-

Packet Pg. 99

Attachment: Board Action- 2020 PTASP Approval (4056 : Approval of the 2020 Public Agency Transportation Safety Plan)

1.B.6.a

abnormal, safety, and signals/switches. SOPs are reviewed periodically and updated as necessary
according to the following guidelines: prior to revenue service of a system expansion or new
corridor; prior to opening a new rail maintenance facility; or as recommended by the internal
safety review process. A committee consisting of Light Rail Controller/Supervisors, Operators,
and the Light Rail Transit safety specialist performs review. Recommended SOP changes are
reviewed and approved by the Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations and then sent for
review and approval by the Executive Safety and Security Committee.
The Employee Rule Book contains the body of RTD’s light rail operating rules. It has been
designed to meet the following three purposes to ensure the safe operation of the system.
 To identify RTD’s operating practices and standards;
 To aid in the instruction of these practices; and
 To serve employees as a reference manual whenever questions rise on the safest course of
action.
The Rule Book contains the General Manager’s Statement, instructions for use, types of operating
regulations, and the operations policy statement. Rules are segregated by the following
categories: safety rules, general rules, train operating rules, and standard operating procedures.
The Rule Book is printed in a portable format for ease of reference. Similar to the SOPs, the Rule
Book is periodically reviewed and updated as necessary according to the following guidelines:
prior to revenue service of a system expansion or new corridor; prior to opening a new rail
maintenance facility; or as recommended by the internal safety review process.

III 3.3 Emergency and Contingency Planning
The RTD outlines emergency and contingency plans in the Light Rail Emergency Response Plan.
The purpose of this program is to provide direction to RTD and emergency response personnel in
the case of an emergency situation, which adversely affects operations. There is a training
component to familiarize Denver metropolitan area emergency response agency personnel with
safety features and operating characteristics of RTD’s Light Rail Transit system.
Included in the program are brief descriptions of system elements and illustrations that depict
these elements.
The objectives of this program are threefold:




Generate common knowledge among personnel in emergency response agencies, such as
police and fire departments as well as paramedic units, to enhance their interaction with
RTD personnel when required;
Minimize potential danger to passengers during incidents, emergency or otherwise, that
requires response from agencies external to RTD; and
Maximize the effectiveness of responding personnel dealing with emergency situations
by increasing their overall knowledge of unique elements within the respective
communities.

Planning, updates, and drills are discussed in the emergency plans. Documentation of drills is
tracked either through specific files for each drill or the Executive Safety and Security
Committee. The light rail emergency plan is reviewed and updated if necessary according to the
following criteria: following an emergency incident to review and critique operations if requested

by a Fire Life Safety Committee Member, upon change or modification to the light rail system
requiring changes to this plan, upon the request of any Fire Life Safety Committee Member, or at
least annually to review/revise the plan and arrange for periodic drills and possible refresher
training. Emergency drills are documented in the plan.
Emergency response procedures (internal RTD standard operating procedures) are reviewed and
revised as necessary and distributed to RTD personnel accordingly. Additional information
regarding emergency management is included in Section I 6.1.

III 3.4 Standard Operating Procedures and Employee Rule Book
Bus Operations are strictly governed by policies and procedures outlined in the “Trailblazer”.
Standard rules of conduct and procedure are necessary. The rules outlined in this document have
been adopted for the requirements of RTD’s operations and are considered necessary for
rendering a quality level of service to customers. The “Trailblazer” is comprehensive manual with
procedures and guidelines for every aspect of bus operations including: the performance code;
passenger relations and interaction; ADA requirements; personnel practices; operating
procedures; emergency and legal procedures; equipment care and operation; personal appearance;
radio procedures; fares, transfers, and passes; operation procedures; routes maps and diagrams;
maintenance tips; fleet data; and street guides.
Service Planning/Scheduling updates the “Trailblazer” on an as-needed basis. Transportation
bulletins are a common practice that addresses day to day issues.

III 3.4.1
Book

Review of Standard Operating Procedures and Employee Rule

The Safety personnel review Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), the Trailblazer, and the
Employee Rule Book as necessary. These reviews are conducted when system monitoring and
data analysis imply that either the SOPs or rules are not as effective as possible, or when change
or expansion to operations occurs. Review also occurs during the RTD internal safety review
process. Recommendations for any policy or rule change are presented to the Executive Safety
and Security Committee for approval.

III 4 Facilities, Structures and Equipment Inspections
RTD's bus and rail facilities and equipment will be inspected on a regular basis according to
company policies and SOPs, equipment manufacturer's guidelines and recommendations, and as
required by local, state, and federal regulations.

III 4.1 Facilities and Equipment to Be Inspected
Operating facilities and equipment routinely inspected and tested by employees, supervisors,
management, and safety and environmental personnel include the following:
 Bus and rail maintenance/support shops/administrative offices, and equipment within the
shops
 Fire system equipment
 Safety eyewash and shower systems
 Floor and portable hoist systems and cranes
 Heating, air conditioning, lighting, and ventilation systems
 Hydraulic presses, grinders, welders, wheel-truing equipment, lathes, etc.
 Hazardous materials handling and storage, etc.
 Locomotives, cab-cars, passenger cars, light rail vehicles, and buses
 Support equipment (i.e. rolling stock) including high-rail vehicles, track maintenance
vehicles, bucket trucks, loaders, forklifts, aerial lifts, etc.
 Infrastructure including rail station platforms, track, switches, OCS, bridges, gradecrossing equipment, etc.

III 4.2 Techniques, Schedules, and Procedures
Preventative maintenance inspection schedules are generated through the computer system per
equipment manufacturer's guidelines and recommendations, and as required by local, state, and
federal regulations. A maintenance supervisor identifies upcoming PM inspections and assigns
the work out to their crew for completion. Inspectors use checklists to identify potential physical
hazards, unsafe equipment, unsafe acts, and policy and procedural deficiencies with the facility or
equipment being inspected. Completed inspection reports and checklists are returned to the
supervisor for review. Each department is responsible for maintaining inspection and repair
records to confirm the inspection process.

Line and Signal uses a maintenance of way plan “MOW Procedures” that outlines specific testing
and maintenance procedures in accordance with FRA regulations. These are in accordance 49
CFR parts 233 - 236.
Right of way rail maintenance uses a maintenance plan “rail maintenance standards” to maintain
the track in accordance with FRA regulations 49 CFR part 213. The standard outlines all aspects
of proper maintenance and inspections regarding track.

III 4.3

Tracking and Resolving Hazards Identified During Inspections

The majority of safety hazards and concerns are resolved immediately by employees, and
supervisors, and require no formal tracking process. Safety-critical hazards that cannot receive
immediate attention are forwarded to the appropriate supervision and will be reported to the
safety administrator or safety committee. An observed safety critical hazard that cannot be
corrected in a timely manner will be entered into the hazard log for tracking purposes and
managed by the SSRC committee. A corrective action plan, responsible person, and completion
date will be assigned. Follow-up inspections will verify that the hazard has been resolved.

III 4.4

Railroad Bridge Safety Management and Inspection Program

The railroad Bridge Safety Management Program (BSMP) has been developed and implemented
by RTD to minimize damages and identify and repair deficiencies in bridges carrying RTD
traffic, to safeguard their ability to carry RTD traffic, and to minimize risk of human casualties.

III 5 System Safety Inspections and Reviews
The Safety Division conducts periodic inspections and reviews. Maintenance facilities are
inspected monthly to ensure compliance with occupational safety regulations and local fire codes.
Semiannual reviews are conducted in conjunction with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission
to document compliance with established standard operating procedures, maintenance plans and
the Public Transit Agency Safety Plan. Any deviations from required activities or identified
safety hazards are resolved through a formal reporting process. For additional information on
system safety reviews, refer to section 5.3.

III 5.1 Internal Safety Review Process
Internal safety reviews and inspections are critical components of an integrated system safety
program. As such, internal safety reviews of the light rail system are conducted semiannually to
assure compliance with the Public Transit Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) and that the plan is
effectively implemented. Facilities are inspected monthly for occupational safety issues and local
fire codes. The overall light rail and bus systems are reviewed to assure that activities required by
RTD’s operating, maintenance, and PTASP are completed. Written reports of each review are
prepared and distributed to the reviewed parties. The Executive Safety and Security Committee
may also discuss review findings, evaluate the effectiveness of the Public Transit Agency Safety
Plan, recommend corrective action if necessary, and ensure timely implementation and follow up.
An annual internal light rail review report is compiled in January of each year and submitted to
the PUC by February 15 of each year. The report documents the review findings for the year
including the results of the internal reviews performed during the previous year, a summary of

Attachment: Board Action- 2020 PTASP Approval (4056 : Approval of the 2020 Public Agency Transportation Safety Plan)

1.B.6.a

88
Packet Pg. 103

required corrective actions taken, if any, and provision for follow up to ensure timely
implementation and to determine effectiveness of the system safety program plan. The annual
report will be accompanied by a formal letter of certification signed by the General Manager
indicating that the RTD is in compliance with its system safety program plan and system security
plan. If RTD identifies areas of deficiency, the General Manager, by letter, will identify the
activities RTD will take to achieve compliance. Documentation of inspection and reviews are
maintained in the Safety and Environmental Division.
As part of the internal review program, all RTD departments are subject to review under the
direction of the Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management, the Senior
Manager of Safety and Environmental is responsible for and has complete authority to conduct
internal safety reviews. Two reviews are conducted each year. Within a three-year period, all
system safety program plan elements are reviewed for compliance with the plan and state safety
oversight requirements. The sixth review cycle is usually reserved to review the review process to
assure that all elements are completed and that the review program meets the state safety
oversight requirements.
RTD will notify the PUC of an upcoming review cycle at least 30 days prior to the start of the
review. The internal review team consists of representatives from the Safety Unit of RTD. Each
checklist is assigned a lead reviewer for the final development of the checklist and to be the
responsible person to complete the checklist including back up documentation when the review is
complete. When a review element under the administration of the Safety and Environmental
Division is conducted, PUC staff serves as the lead reviewer to assure an independent review
process. Written checklists are developed by the lead reviewer.
An opening conference may be scheduled with the departments subject to review and the review
team. In some cases an opening conference is not required. At the opening conference, the
checklists are distributed and each checklist is discussed and reviewed for accuracy. The review
schedule is then set with the affected departments. The actual review consists of interviews with
key personnel, documentation review, and observation of activities to assess compliance and
understanding of rules, training, and procedures. After completion of the onsite review activities,
the checklists are completed and a written draft report is developed. The draft report may include
recommendations or findings. Recommendations are defined as suggestions to make
improvements, while findings are defined as documented deficiencies in the implementation of
established programs, rules or procedures. The draft report is distributed for review and comment
to the reviewed parties. Reviewed parties have 30 days to respond to the draft report including an
opportunity to correct any findings. A final report is completed and distributed to the reviewed
parties. Recorded findings require the development of a corrective action plan. Each year, the
annual review report prepared and submitted to the PUC, will include an evaluation of the
adequacy and effectiveness of the new Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan.
Recommendation and findings will be tracked in two ways. Recommendations from previous
review cycles will be reviewed and evaluated in subsequent review cycles. Findings will be
tracked under the corrective action plan process of placing all findings on a tracking spreadsheet
and the subsequent quarterly corrective action plan progress reports filed with the PUC.

Packet Pg. 104

Maintenance and service of all vehicles, equipment and facilities is performed by the RTD in
accordance with manufacturer’s manuals, codes, standards and established procedures.
Maintenance is performed at a level of readiness that ensures safe, efficient and reliable mass
transit. RTD maintains data to track scheduled maintenance of vehicles and equipment.
Safety critical equipment that does not meet established requirements is withdrawn from service.
Vehicles or equipment that are involved in an accident are removed from service if there is reason
to suspect equipment failure contributed to the cause of the accident or if a fatality is involved.
Vehicles or equipment are returned to service only after it is determined that there are no defects
that could have contributed to the accident. The light rail maintenance crew has an established
strategic plan to ensure rapid deployment, recovery and return to service in the event of an
emergency.
Effective maintenance is an indispensable prerequisite to safe and efficient light rail and bus
operations. The Maintenance Departments have standards that make safety and reliability the
primary objectives of the system. These goals are met by the incorporation of preventive and
repair maintenance programs for all aspects of the system. These systems include: traction
electrification (substation and overhead wire), signals, trackway, buses, rail vehicles, and support
equipment such as shop equipment, non-revenue vehicles, and facilities (shop, passenger stations,
park-n-rides, right-of-way). The foundation of the rail maintenance documentation material is the
Rail Maintenance Plan. A well-developed plan ensures: 1) a high degree of continuity and
consistency in routine maintenance activities, 2) a structured process for improving the
productivity and efficiency of Rail Maintenance functions, and 3) a fulfillment of FTA’s Section
9 requirements.
The Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance Strategic Plan addresses the following areas: 1) Preventive
maintenance programs will be cost-effective in minimizing service failures. 2) Changes in
preventive maintenance programs may be expected periodically as experience is gained on the
equipment maintained. 3) Preventive maintenance goals and polices will not be altered due to
time constraints or as a cost-reduction measure in times of financial stress. 4) Effective
maintenance procedures require much record keeping and information storage/retrieval. 5) The
technical sophistication of the LRV, the tracking of a large, expensive inventory and the scale of
the physical plant, place a heavy responsibility on the information capabilities of the Rail
Maintenance Department.
The maintenance philosophy for RTD is to incorporate a mix of in-house and contracted
maintenance activities so that the system is safely and efficiently maintained. This type of
philosophy has successfully been implemented in other transit properties. The maintenance
philosophy also utilizes existing RTD transit operations, and in many instances will share
organizational services, personnel, and equipment.
Certain maintenance activities, due to space required, expensive repair/test equipment required, or
semi-skilled labor required, may be considered for contract services. Some of those activities as
listed below may include contracted service.

safe operation.

III 6 Drug and Alcohol Program and Medical Monitoring
6.1

Drug and Alcohol Program

The RTD maintains an employee drug and alcohol program in compliance with U.S. Department
of Transportation and Federal Transit Administration regulations and to ensure the safe operation
and maintenance of systems and equipment. The program includes criteria for random testing of
safety sensitive personnel and testing for cause either accident related or from observed behavior.
The RTD Finance and Administration Department manages this program. The program is subject
to frequent review by the FTA. To date, the program has been found exemplary by the FTA.
Drug and alcohol testing and information about drug and alcohol abuse is included in RTD’s
Drug and Alcohol Policy. The program is administered by RTD’s Drug and Alcohol Coordinator
which includes verification of compliance with the program and training. Training is given to all
employees during orientation training. Revisions to the program are distributed to all employees.
If necessary, follow-up training is provided.
Compliance and knowledge of the program is accomplished through direct supervision of
employees and refresher training if necessary.
GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT
The Regional Transportation District is dedicated to providing safe, dependable, and economical
transportation services to the public, and to providing a healthy, safe and satisfying work
environment for our employees. RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union, Division 1001, agree
that employees of the system must be able to work in a drug and alcohol-free work environment.

Attachment: Board Action- 2020 PTASP Approval (4056 : Approval of the 2020 Public Agency Transportation Safety Plan)

1.B.6.a

Packet Pg. 107

At the same time, every effort must be made to protect the rights and respect the privacy of all
employees. The employer has the right and duty to protect its employees, passengers and the
public from the adverse effects of drug and alcohol abuse. It is not the intent of the employer to
restrict the employees' off-the-job conduct.
A successful drug and alcohol program must address the safety implications of drug and alcohol
abuse, and must also institute proper procedures and controls guaranteeing accurate alcohol and
drug testing results, while preserving confidentiality and focusing on rehabilitation through an
effective employee assistance program.
It is the responsibility of all employees to report to work free of alcohol and controlled
substances. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect and respect employees' rights
and privacy.
To meet these goals and comply with legal requirements, RTD has implement this policy to
1. Detect drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through testing;
2. Encourage employees to obtain treatment and rehabilitation for drug and alcohol
problems;
3. Deter drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through education, training, and
discipline; and
4. Enforce RTD’s goal of a drug- and alcohol-free work environment through appropriate
discipline.
Drug and alcohol abuse can have profound effects on the health, work, and personal life not only
of the abuser but also the abuser’s family, friends, and the public at large. Employees should be
aware of the signs and symptoms of drug or alcohol problems, and of available methods of
intervening when a substance abuse problem is suspected. Exhibits A to this policy contains
additional discussion of these matters.
This policy was originally adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on October 18, 1994 and
subsequent modifications were adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on September 1998, July
2000, May 2003, July 2011, and March 2013. Many elements of this policy are required by
federal regulations covering persons in safety-sensitive job classifications. Other elements of this
policy are not required by federal regulations but are official RTD policy.
Exhibits B to this policy explains which elements of this policy are not federally required.
Employees wishing to review federal regulations on drug and alcohol use may contact RTD’s
Drug and Alcohol Program Coordinator.
This policy supersedes all other RTD drug, alcohol or substance abuse policies. To the extent that
any elements of this policy may conflict with federal or state regulations as they may be amended
or revised in the future, the regulations shall control. Employees are expected to review, be
familiar with, and obey this policy and all laws concerning drug and alcohol use and testing. All
existing and new RTD employees must receive at least 60 minutes of training on the effects and
consequences of prohibited drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment, and
the signs and symptoms which may indicate prohibited drug use.
Compliance with this policy, including participation in RTD’s drug and alcohol testing program,
is a required condition of employment.

APPLICABILITY
III 6.2.1

Categories of Employees

This policy applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive RTD employees, volunteers,
and contractors. For ease of reference, all of the above persons are referred to in this policy as
"employees" unless otherwise noted. This policy applies to all employees while on the property
of RTD to perform RTD duty or while performing any RTD-related business. Visitors and
vendors are expected to adhere to this policy while on RTD property.
In addition to being subject to all other elements of this policy, employees who perform "safety
sensitive functions" for RTD, as that term is defined in federal regulations 49 CFR Parts 40 as
amended and Part 655, are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other special
requirements set forth in this policy. Generally, a safety-sensitive function occurs when an
employee is performing, ready to perform or immediately available to perform any duty related to
the safe operation of public transportation.
The following are safety-sensitive functions:
 Operation of a revenue service vehicle, whether or not such vehicle is in revenue service.
 Controlling dispatch or movement of a revenue service vehicle.
 Maintaining revenue service vehicles or equipment used in revenue service.
 Operating a non-revenue service vehicle when required to be operated by a holder of a
CDL.
 Carrying a firearm for security purposes.
 Supervising, where the supervisor performs any function listed in items above.
RTD has reviewed the actual duties performed by employees in all job classifications to
determine which employees perform safety-sensitive functions, and has determined which job
functions may require the performance of safety-sensitive corporate policies.

III 6.3

Employee Safety Training, Certification, Verification and
Performance Testing

RTD employees receive formal training and certification for the work they perform according to
job classification. The categories of safety-related work requiring training and certification are
rail and bus operators, and rail and bus maintainers. The specific programs are discussed below.
However, each training and certification program contains classroom and hands-on training, and
written exams. Certification documentation, including tests and test scores, are maintained in
employee files and are subject to review during the RTD internal safety review program.
Except for the RTD on-track safety training program required of contractors working on or near
RTD rail property, RTD does not train or certify contractors or employees of contractors. The ontrack safety training program is required of contractors prior to issuance of an access permit to
work near or on RTD rail property. The program is usually instructed in a train-the-trainer format
allowing contractors to train their own personnel. Compliance with this program is verified
through in-field observation and examination of contractor’s training cards. The Safety and
Environmental Division maintains a log of all contractors trained under the program.

Attachment: Board Action- 2020 PTASP Approval (4056 : Approval of the 2020 Public Agency Transportation Safety Plan)

III 6.2

94
Packet Pg. 109

Regarding performance testing, any operating or maintenance rule is subject to verification and
compliance. Compliance with rules, training and certification requirements is verified in several
ways. Rail and bus operators are frequently observed in the field by supervisors and safety unit
personnel. If supervisors observe an issue, they discuss it with the operator as soon as practical. In
addition to this on-going monitoring and observation, rail and bus operators are subject to formal
ride checks in which supervisors, usually anonymously or covertly, observe bus and rail operators
according to a predetermined criteria or check list. These ride checks are documented, reviewed
with the operator and maintained in the operator’s employee file. These records are subject to
verification during the RTD internal safety review process. If a trend or issue is discovered during
system monitoring, observation and ride checks, they are reported to the RTD Executive Safety
and Security Committee for inclusion into the RTD hazard management program.
Bus, rail and facility maintainers also receive direct supervision including observation and
verification of their maintenance activities. Each piece of work that is assigned to a maintainer is
reviewed and approved for correctness by their immediate supervisor through the work order
process. When a maintainer completes their work assignment, their direct supervisor verifies and
approves the work through observation and signature approval on the work order. In late 2007,
this process was automated in the new enterprise system. The maintainer will enter in the system
that the work is complete, the direct supervisor will verify and approve the work, and then accept
that the work was properly completed in the enterprise system. Maintenance activities are also
observed during the RTD internal safety review process. Supervision is also assessed during the
RTD internal safety review program by the review of documentation and compliance with
schedules. If issues are discovered, they are reported as recommendations or findings in the
review report. Review findings are referred to the Senior Manager of Safety and Environmental
for inclusion in RTD’s hazard management program.

III 6.3.1

Operator Certification

LRV Operators must complete a course on RTD Light Rail Rules and Standard Operating
Procedures before being certified. Written tests, alignment map tests, and practical examination
are administered and must be passed with a minimum correct score of eighty percent. Four of the
six weeks are spent in the LRV in actual operation with a training Supervisor.

III 6.3.2

Operator Annual Re-Certification

Annual re-certification is required of all LRV Operators and Controller/Supervisors.
Controller/Supervisors complete this annual training as they are required to maintain their
operator certification. Re-certification consists of the following: one day review of SOPs, rules
and alignment; review of operators’ performance file including accidents, incidents, near misses
and attendance; LRV ride check with operator; and a written test covering SOPs, rules, and
alignment map. Re- certification requires a score of at least eighty percent.

III 6.3.3

Maintenance Certification

Maintenance personnel including electromotive mechanics, general repair mechanics, track
maintainers, and signal and power maintainers receive classroom and hands-on training
resembling a one-year apprenticeship program. At the end of one year, demonstrating passing
scores on a written exam and hands-on practical exam certifies maintenance personnel.

personnel must again demonstrate passing scores on a written exam and a hands-on practical
exam.

III 6.3.5

Bus Operator Training

Bus operators must complete a six-week course on RTD rules and standard operating procedures
before entering service. A series of eight written tests are given throughout each class session.
The certification consists of hands-on and classroom instruction. After the first two days of
instruction, all class participants spend time on the bus daily. Prior to entering service, operators
must pass a final examination with a minimum correct score of seventy-five percent. Operators
must also obtain a CDL.

III 6.3.6

Operator Recertification

Bus operators undergo training after an extended absence from work. The general criteria for
retraining are listed:


Operators, who have been out-of service for up to ninety (90) days due to non- medical
leave of absence of vacation, will be required to undergo retraining for at least one (1)
day before returning to service.



Operators who have been out-of-service for over than thirty (30) days due to medical
reasons or on-the-job injury, will be required to retrain at least one (1) day before
returning to service.



Any operator who is away from the job over thirty (30) days may request and receive
retraining before returning to service.

Bus operators also receive training on new equipment and major changes in procedures.

III 6.3.7

Maintenance Certification

The General Repair Certification Program is a structural program for General Repair mechanics.
This program is voluntary, self-paced program designed to help employees increase their skills
and expertise and to improve opportunity for promotion. The certification process assures that
mechanics have the qualifications, knowledge and skills to perform their jobs. This program has
been divided into nine zones which represent the major skills that mechanics must have. The
skill zones are: Chassis, Power Train, Electrical, Air Systems, Preventative Maintenance,
Wheelchair Lifts, Heating and Air Conditioning, and Brakes.

specific training classes. The training includes the Rail System Safety Course presented by the
Transportation Safety Institute and other courses covering occupational safety.
Personnel outside the safety unit may receive the Rail System Safety Course and attend APTA
seminars. System safety personnel conduct in-house training for RTD personnel regarding safety
certification, hazard analysis, and construction safety.

III 6.4

Procurement

Procurement of equipment and materials is controlled by RTD’s Procurement Standards Manual.
Each procurement requires the development of detailed specifications assembled by the
requesting manager. Levels of review are built into the procurement process depending upon the
scope of the procurement. As the scope of the procurement increases, so does the level of review.
Minor procurements require authorization from the Contracts and Procurement Division and the
Division Manager of the requesting division. Major procurements, such as light rail construction
related projects or procurement of light rail vehicles, are subject to the following review process.
The Engineering Division and Technical Support Staff develop detailed specifications through
the design process. These specifications are subject to several internal reviews at varying levels of
design, peer reviews by personnel from other transit agencies, and ultimate approval by the
Executive Safety and Security Committee.

PTASP Implementation Activities and
Responsibilities

PTASP Committees and Position Responsibilities

RTD implements the PTASP through Leadership and line management and also utilizes a series
of committees and department positions who have responsibility for specific areas, yet work in a
coordinated manner to ensure the safety management systems are in place and providing the
results desired. As related in section 3.2, safety is a key responsibility of all managers at RTD.
All employees have the right to present safety concerns to their immediate supervisor, manager,
or transit safety specialists. Any employee, supervisor, or manager that brings an incident,
accident, safety concern, or hazard, in good faith will not be adversely affected, or be subjected to
harassment or intimidation. These retaliations are not tolerated by RTD.

IV 1.2

PTASP Committees

RTD implements the PTASP through Leadership and line management and also utilizes a series
of committees coordinating bus and rail operation and maintenance services. Concerns, if not
resolved by the manager or supervisor, will be referred to and addressed by the respective safety
committee. The following hierarchy of committees at RTD are established to address all safety
issues.

IV 1.2.1
(ESSC)

General Managers Executive Safety and Security Committee

The ESSC is RTD's highest level safety committee, chaired by the General Manager. The
committee is alternately chaired by the Chief Safety Officer. The ESSC is comprised of members
of the RTD corporate staff, which includes representation from the executive level, and the rail,
and bus, and facilities business unit general managers, and the Safety, Security, and Asset
Management Department.

Attachment: Board Action- 2020 PTASP Approval (4056 : Approval of the 2020 Public Agency Transportation Safety Plan)

1.B.6.a

Packet Pg. 114

The ESSC reviews and approves safety policies, goals, and objectives. It coordinates the support
and resources needed to maintain high safety standards for all aspects of service and system
safety. The general manager (GM), through the ESSC, is the ultimate authority for safety
certification, system modification, and configuration management. This authority includes
approving each project's safety and security certification statement.
The ESSC committee meets monthly to review reports on safety, accident trends, major
accidents, urgent/safety critical concerns or hazards, internal/external review findings,
certification recommendations, items referred from the SSRC, and other items of concern to the
ESSC for comment, direction, resolution, and execution. Minutes are maintained and
disseminated to members of the committee.

IV 1.2.3
Management of Change/Infrastructure Change Review
(MOC/ICR) Teams or Committees
Management of Change/Configuration control within RTD will be managed through the
Infrastructure Change Review (ICR) process during design and construction. The ICR process is
managed for RTD by Capital Development. The MOC process is managed by the Executive
Safety and Security Committee (ESSC) chaired by the chief safety officer. Management of
Change/Configuration management within RTD consists of the ICR process during design and
construction, and the management of change (MOC) process during operations, in coordination
with the ESSC.
.
MOC process applies to existing bus and rail services systems, vehicles, facilities, and equipment
that may not require formal safety certification but which may have safety impacts.

IV 1.2.4

Bus Safety Committee (BSC)

The bus safety committees coordinate on-going safety efforts within the Transportation,
Facilities, and Maintenance departments of the bus system. They meet monthly to update and
mitigate hazards within their facilities, and on their Systems. Committees are formed for the
District Shops, Platte and Treasury, East Metro, and Boulder Divisions. The BSC committees are
chaired by the Safety Division’s delegate, usually a Transit safety specialist. The committees
consist of up to any manager within the Division, and an employee(s) from the following areas:
bus operators, bus maintenance workers, facilities maintenance workers (to include Service and
Cleaning), Health and Wellness, RTD Security, and any other unique area (i.e. – Treasury). The
union (ATU) appoints bargaining unit employees to the BSC as needed to serve as safety
representatives from the ranks of each department.
Committee members are granted an opportunity to speak, and to present safety issues to the BSC
committee through an open communication process. Minutes will be maintained and distributed
to the members of the BSC, the Transportation Managers, and posted to the local Safety Board in
the division, and be made available to others.
The BSC minutes will contain an open item log listing issues brought forward at BSC meetings,
submitted through the Hazard Management System, and the Safety Suggestion Boxes posted at
each Division. The log will include the month/year the item was brought forward to the

Attachment: Board Action- 2020 PTASP Approval (4056 : Approval of the 2020 Public Agency Transportation Safety Plan)

1.B.6.a

committee, an initial hazard rating (Risk Assessment Code), and the estimated month/year the
corrective action will be complete. There will also be a log of closed/completed items, as well as
informational items for RTD employees. This log will be posted at each Division for all
employees to view. Most safety issues will be resolved within the parameters of the BSC. Issues
not resolved in the BSC, or safety critical hazards, are referred to the SSRC.
BSC actions will include the following:
 Reviews facility and operations system safety issues identified by members, staff,
reviews, or inspections
 Assigns responsibility for correcting hazards
 Reviews open items for completion
 Ensure safety and regulatory rule compliance (FTA, PUC)

IV 1.2.5

Rail Safety Committee (RSC)

The rail safety committees (RSC) coordinate on-going safety efforts within the operations and
maintenance services of the rail system. They meet monthly to update and mitigate hazards in
their facilities and on their systems. A committee is formed for light rail. The committees consist
of the Operations manager, two representatives (one Union rep, one admin rep) from operations,
LRV maintenance , Facility Maintenance, Maintenance of Way and the transit safety specialistrail, who serves as a technical advisor and Chair to the committee. The corresponding
maintenance facilities (Elati, Rio Court, and Mariposa) are represented respectively on their RSC.
The union appoints bargaining unit employees to the RSC annually to serve as safety
representatives from the ranks of each department, voicing safety concerns to the RSC.
Committee members are granted an opportunity to speak, and to present safety issues to the RSC
committee through an open communication process. Minutes of discussion and action will be
maintained and distributed to the members of the RSC, and be available to others.
The RSC will maintain a local hazard log listing issues, corrective actions, and close-out dates.
The log will include the date entered and the responsible party to correct the action. Most safety
issues will be resolved within the parameters of the RSC. Issues not resolved in the RSC, or
safety critical hazards, are referred to the SSRC.
RSC actions are similar to those listed under the BSC above. Additionally the RSC examines
compliance with General Code of Operating Rules (GCOR), (FRA 49 CFR Part 214, 49 CFR
200-399; FTA 49 CFR 659).

IV 1.2.6

Fire and Life Safety Committee (FLSC) (Projects Only)

The Fire and Life Safety and Committee serves as a liaison between project safety and local
police, fire and emergency response agencies. The FLSSC is chaired by the System Safety
Engineer. Members include local police, fire, and EMS staff, and RTD's public safety, bus
operations, and rail supervisors.
The FLSC coordinates inspections and drills to verify the fire life safety and security emergency
response, and familiarization and compliance in the system. Drills are initiated during the
activation phase, and continue during revenue operations, per federal requirement, to maintain an
effective inter-agency rapport.

IV 1.2.8
/ (FAC)

Activation Committee (AC) / Rail (RAC) / Bus (BAC) / Facility

The Activation Committee is a working committee of managers that meets regularly, combining
safety and security verification process functions into RTD's construction, systems integration,
and testing phases of new rail projects. The RAC is made up of an activation manager (RAM) and
one manager from each of the following four supporting disciplines: Safety, Civil, Systems and
Operations.
RTD has instituted the use of the Activation Committee and the Hold Point process to bring on
new bus and facility projects. The membership of the committee may change slightly to best fit
the role of the RAC, BAC or FAC. The remainder of this section describes the Rail project
process, but is readily adaptable to a bus or facility project.
Each discipline manager will be responsible for ensuring all certified items lists (CILs),
procedures, tests, filing of documents, and any other assigned activities for his/her group are
completed in accordance with applicable parts of the rail activation plan (RAP). Three of the four
discipline managers, identified above, will each be assigned coordination responsibilities for one
of the three rail activation primary functions-safety and security certification, system integration
testing, and rail services. The RAC will oversee and approve all rail activation documents and
activities.
The RAM, with help from the RAC, will ensure that the project follows the rail activation
process, that all documents are properly completed and filed correctly, and that all necessary

Attachment: Board Action- 2020 PTASP Approval (4056 : Approval of the 2020 Public Agency Transportation Safety Plan)

1.B.6.a

safety and security certifications are properly completed and signed before the project enters
revenue service.
The RAC will meet regularly to develop and finalize details of the RAP specific to the project,
and then manage rail activation activities against the plan. They will also discuss progress, issues,
and concerns in regard to activation activities and requirements. Meeting minutes will be
recorded and filed each time the committee meets. An action items list will be included with the
minutes, and will be updated and discussed each time the committee meets to ensure
responsibility and completion of items deemed critical to successful rail activation. The
committee will create, maintain, and adhere to a rail activation-specific schedule, which will help
to ensure completion of activation and start-up activities prior to scheduled revenue service dates.
Following commencement of revenue operations, the RAC provides "lessons learned" input to
planning and design teams, and for improved processes for the next activation.

IV 1.2.9

Safety and Security Working Group (SSWG)

The Safety and Security Working Group (SSWG) is established by the Project Manager (PM) for
each project that significantly changes the interaction of employees or patrons with the RTD
system. The SSWG examines the design and specifications of safety and security critical systems
on the project. The SSWG is chaired by the PM, project director, or a designee. Primary
responsibilities of the SSWG are to establish the preliminary hazard analysis, focus on and
mitigate hazards on the project, and coordinate the project safety elements through design,
construction and activation. The threat and vulnerability assessment (TVA), if conducted, is also
coordinated by the SSWG.
The SSWG begins during the design phase and conducts regular review meetings, separate from
ongoing design efforts, to focus specifically on safety issues. The project manager ensures that
safety considerations are continually considered during regular design reviews. Design
modifications that are recommended to be incorporated into the RTD design criteria are referred
to the Capital Development civil design manager for review at the design and construction
meeting (DCM). Modifications are then forwarded to the Configuration Control Committee
(CCC) for approval if the modifications are significant enough.

Intent – to review systems from an end-user perspective, looking for hazards that can be 1)
engineered out of the system, 2) corrected with SOP, procedures, etc. or 3) addressed with PPE.
The SSWG may not change the scope of the project, but may make decisions that relate directly
to the remediation of specific hazards. To this end, it is best for the SSWG to be included in the
scope phase of the project plan.
The SSWG defines the job specific CILS and creates and maintains the PHA. If the SSWG
determines that the residual risk of a hazard cannot be reduced below Medium, then the SSWG
presents its findings to the SSRC for final risk analysis.

Training and Certification Program

Employee and Contractor Safety

Training and certification is a paramount concern, and as such RTD has developed a number of
educational programs. The following employee classifications perform work that requires safety
training and or certification:
 Train and Bus operators
 Operations personnel
 Vehicle maintenance
 Maintenance of way (infrastructure/systems)
 Facility maintenance
 Public facilities maintenance
 Controllers
 Other personal and contractors that foul or potentially foul RTD's rail right of way

IV 2.1.2

Line and Signal Technicians and Rail Maintenance
workers

Line and Signal technicians and Rail Maintenance workers are required to complete On-Track
Safety Training (OTST) on an annual basis. Line and Signal Technicians undergo training that is
conducted by RTD. This training includes all elements related to signals and crossings and their
maintenance, trouble shooting, and repair. In addition to signal training employees may
participate in a lineman’s correspondence course after completing all phases of the signalmen’s
school. All equipment training is conducted as on the job training and is provided by the LRV
Maintenance or MOW trainers. Rail Maintenance workers participate in two correspondence
training courses: “Basic principles of track maintenance and advanced principles of track
maintenance”. After the completion of these courses a track maintenance worker must complete
one year of maintenance work and must obtain approval of management before becoming a track
inspector. Track Maintenance Supervisors must complete the same training in order to be able to
inspect track. All equipment training is conducted as on the job training and is provided by the
LRV Maintenance or MOW trainers.

Employee Roles and Responsibilities

RTD employees and contractor personnel, whether construction or service contractors, are
required to be in compliance with applicable RTD rules and standard operating procedures (SOP)
as well as local, state, and federal safety regulations. Service contractors who perform specific
jobs under contract are required to be in compliance with specific safety or environmental laws
that are or may be affected by their work.
RTD has developed the RTD FasTracks Construction Safety Guidelines for Light Rail Transit
that governs contractor safety specifically for contracted construction workers for RTD. This
manual outlines procedures and responsibilities of RTD project managers and contractor
personnel who contract with RTD to perform construction work activities. Additionally, the RTD
safety goal is to achieve accident-free construction projects.
The RTD FasTracks Construction Safety Guidelines for Light Rail Transit reflect minimal
standards. All general contractors, contractors, and their sub-tiers will be expected to meet or
exceed the standards and good safe practices outlined in the manual and their own safety
program, whichever is more stringent.
The RTD grants and contract administrator will review and implement into contract language
requirements for the contract employees to meet. These contracts are written and reviewed by
RTD's Office of General Counsel and Safety and Environmental Divisions, as well as the contract
administrator to assure that specific safety and environmental requirements for contract
employees are met.

IV 2.3

Work-Required Training for Employees and Contractors

RTD is a public employer within the State of Colorado. As such, RTD is not subject to
enforcement under Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). However, it is the
District’s policy to voluntarily comply with OSHA regulations. To that end, the Safety Division
develops safety policies and procedures for occupational safety in compliance with OSHA
guidelines. Regular training sessions are conducted with affected employees based on job hazard
analysis. Annual refresher training is conducted for high hazard areas such as confined spaces and
lockout/tagout (LOTO). Safety staff conducts training. In addition to safety policies, the
environmental unit develops policies for environmental compliance. All RTD employees and
contractor personnel who foul or have the potential to foul the tracks (within 10' of centerline of
track), must receive the OTST prior to beginning their work. Contractors are responsible to train
their employees on OSHA-Required training prior to performing RTD projects. Other related
training that contract employees and RTD employees will be current on includes the following:
•
Hazard communication
•
Blood-borne pathogen awareness

These specific work positions, whether they are held by RTD employees or contractors
functioning for RTD Rail Services, may be regulated by 49 CFR 228. Other FRA regulatory
requirements, including the following, must be met by employees and contract personnel as it is
required by their function.
•
Maintaining and accessing employee and contractor training records
•
Compliance with training and certification requirements
Employees and contractors, who are under a legal contract with RTD, are obligated to comply
with specific safety and environmental requirements and demonstrate quality of workmanship by
observation and records reviews. Employees and/or contract employees will meet the training,
inspections, testing, and maintenance specifications as outlined in 49 CFR, as it relates to
commuter rail vehicle maintenance and personnel training. RTD supervisors, managers, and
transit safety specialists are authorized to make regular observations of work being performed,
and will determine whether or not safety and environmental requirements are being complied
with. The quality of materials and construction processes will also be reviewed by designated
quality assurance personnel. Training courses given to employees and contractors will require
that tests be completed prior to the completion of coursework. These will be the primary methods
used to assure that compliance is obtained.
RTD will identify the tasks related to the inspection, testing, and maintenance required by Part
238 that must be performed on each type of equipment that RTD LRV operates.

Contractor Safety Coordination and Construction Safety

Except for the RTD on-track safety training program required of contractors working on or near
RTD rail property, RTD does not train or certify contractors or employees of contractors. The
On-Track Safety Training (OTST) program is required of contractors prior to issuance of an
access permit to work near or on RTD rail property. The program is usually instructed in a trainthe-trainer format allowing contractors to train their own personnel. Compliance with this
program is verified through in-field observation and examination of contractor’s training cards.
The Safety and Environmental Division maintains a log of all contractors trained under the
program.
All contractor work on or near RTD rail property is controlled by access permits. Prior to issuing
an access permit, the contractor is required to meet with RTD staff to describe and coordinate
their work. After this initial coordination, the contractor applies for a permit which is reviewed
and approved by light rail maintenance-of-way, light rail transportation and safety prior to
signature issue by light rail control. The contractor is bound to the requirements of the permit. All
contractors contracted with RTD are also bound by contract specifications for the work they are
to perform.
The Safety and Environmental Division has developed two documents for the management of
construction safety; the Construction Safety Guidelines, and the Safety and Security Certification
Plan. The Construction Safety Guidelines presents the requirements for RTD construction
projects and follows the OSHA construction requirements and regulations. Contractors are
required to follow OSHA construction safety requirements and requirements of RTD contract
specifications and access permits.
RTD safety officers conduct construction safety oversight to monitor contractor work place safety
and conformance to OSHA standards. Oversight includes contractor safety orientation prior to
project commencement, field monitoring, and site safety inspections. Periodic safety meetings are
conducted between RTD and contractors to ensure safe project construction.
The Safety and Security Certification Plan describes the process for project and construction
verification. The Plan contains design and procurement specifications, field inspection
documentation, equipment testing requirements, and integrated testing procedures.

IV 2.5

Construction Safety Requirements

The construction safety program is developed and managed by RTD transit safety specialists.
This program defines construction safety functions and responsibilities and other construction
safety requirements such as safety equipment, documentation, and safety personnel. All
contractors and RTD employees must comply with Occupation Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) rules and the requirements of the construction safety program, RTD Rail Services rule
books, SOPs, and individual company contract agreements with RTD.
Contractors who have personnel working around rail systems may be regulated by 49 CFR Part
214, the Roadway Worker Protection Act. Responsive to that requirement, RTD has established a

Attachment: Board Action- 2020 PTASP Approval (4056 : Approval of the 2020 Public Agency Transportation Safety Plan)

Equip Cert

Packet Pg. 129

training and certification class for rail roadway workers (OTST). All construction and RTD
employees who may work on or near the tracks are required to attend this training annually and
obtain a certification card or sticker to keep on their person.
The RTD construction safety program will be reviewed and updated on a bi-annual (two-year)
basis. The safety administrator–construction will have primary responsibility for this update. The
safety administrator– construction will also be the responsible party for participating in the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA Triennial Reviews 49 CFR 659.27) as they are conducted
each three-year cycle.

IV 2.6

Training and Certification Training, Courses, Education

The Safety Division maintains electronic training records for the following items: blood borne
pathogens, hazardous communications, lockout tag out, blue flag protection and forklift
certification. All safety related courses that are conducted in a classroom environment or through
computer based delivery are also maintained electronically by the Safety Division.
Records for the following training: Train operator certification, Train operator re-certification,
controller certification, controller re-certification, equipment certification, train license (N.S.T.),
lineman’s course, signal certification and basic/advanced track principles are maintained in the
employee training records, in paper form and are available for review. These records are available
directly from the rail department managers. The training supervisor and management review the
training records to determine completion. Most training is done annually, with all operators,
employees, and supervisors being trained in the same month.

IV 2.6.1

Transit safety specialists Certification

The Safety Department recognizes the FTA Transportation Safety Institute (TSI) to administer
Transit Safety and Security Program (TSSP) certification for all transit safety specialists at RTD.
All transit safety specialists will complete the TSSP within the first two years of their safety
assignment. This certification involves the successful completion of the Transit Safety and
Security Program Certificate as outlined by TSI training manual. Courses required are:
 Transit Rail/Bus System Safety
 Transit Rail/Bus Incident Investigation
 Transit System Security
 Effectively Managing Transit Emergencies
RTD Transit safety specialists are TSSP Certified through the Transportation Safety Institute and
are eligible to receive additional safety certification through the World Safety Organization.
Safety related instruction is emphasized through RTD's corporate policies and procedures,
maintained on RTD's intranet.

Federal Railroad Administration and Commuter Rail

It is the intent of this Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan to meet all of the applicable FRA
requirements for commuter rail as well as to address the Light Rail system. This plan will not
identify all of the specific requirements of 49 CFR; however, it will identify the parts that will be
regulated by the FRA. Specific standard operating procedures (SOP) will be developed in each of
the operating areas of maintenance and operations, with the exception of waivers that have been
approved by the FRA for the operation of the Commuter Rail system. These procedures will
identify the inspection, testing, and maintenance of numerous tasks. The following is a list of
Code of Federal Railroad Administration Regulations (49 CFR) relating to commuter rail
operating equipment on standard gage rail that operates on or is connected to the general railroad
system. This list is taken from the Manual for the Development of System Safety Program Plans
for Commuter Railroads published May 15, 2006 by APTA.

Construction Safety

Construction safety is administered in accordance with contract specifications, and applicable
Federal, State and local safety requirements. The RTD System Safety Engineer has primary
responsibility for safety oversight of construction projects. The program is based on, and
complies with applicable federal, state, and local safety codes and regulations. Procedures have
been established for the control of operating hazards, including but not limited to chemicals,
noise, cut and abrasion injuries, strain, and sprain injuries. Contractors are required to comply
with these requirements for the safety of their own employees as well as to safeguard RTD
employees, contractors, passengers and the public.
Engineering and Project Management approves the contractor's safety program plan and
supporting documentation, with the concurrence of the Safety Division. Particular emphasis is
placed on work that may affect RTD operations, passengers, facilities, and personnel. All
contractors working in the RTD rail rights of way, or interfacing with RTD Rail Operations are
required to attend OTST. This training covers track access, right of way flagging, and operating
procedures. Reviews of the contractors are conducted to assure compliance with Federal and State
Law, and the RTD requirements.

IV 3.3.1

Employee and Contractor Awareness of FRA
Requirements

RTD employees and contractors are required to be aware of and comply with specific FRA
regulations. A specific requirement of Roadway Worker Protection (RWP) (49CFR214) is a
safety requirement that employees and contractors must follow. Employees and contractors who
may foul the tracks or have potential to foul the tracks while performing their work are required
to receive specific Roadway Worker Protection training before they perform roadway work. The
rail control centers have established a Work Permit which must be completed and submitted for
approval prior to working on the tracks. Contractors and employees must receive RWP training
and verify competency through testing. Track Access Coordinator reviews and verifies training
requirements prior to approving work permits. Safety personnel and Rail Supervisory personnel
may remove an employee or contractor from a worksite if he/she demonstrates a lack of
knowledge and understanding of applicable RWP rules and procedures. Contracts require
compliance with specific OSHA regulations and employee safety programs as applicable to the

Attachment: Board Action- 2020 PTASP Approval (4056 : Approval of the 2020 Public Agency Transportation Safety Plan)

1.B.6.a

118
Packet Pg. 133

work being performed. Safety personnel and rail supervisory personally conduct inspections of
contractor worksites to assess contractor employee knowledge of and compliance with regulatory
and contract requirements. Deficiencies are brought to the attention of contractor project
managers for corrective action.
Specific RTD employees must comply with Hours of Service requirements set forth by the FRA
while in the performance of specific job duties. Currently Train Operators, Operations
Supervisor/Controllers and Line and Signal Technicians must comply with Hours of Service
requirements.

IV 3.3.2

Personal Protective Equipment

Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as safety glasses, safety boots, gloves,
face shields and work uniforms, etc. is required to be used in performing various work by RTD
personnel. This equipment should be evaluated and approved by the safety department prior to
procurement.

Re:

Service Availability – November 2019

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.31% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in November 2019. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflects a fairly
consistent number compared the same month (November) last year. Service delivery overall has
stabilized and been consistent since July 2018. Lost service for personnel related reasons
follows:




November 2019 – 451.32 hours
November 2018 – 228.30 hours
Year to date hours for 2019 – 3,516.58 hours
Year to date hours 2018 – 9,975.76 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in November were 4 severe weather days, special
events and planned and unplanned bus bridges (events include: CU Buff Ride, Broncos Ride,
Turkey Trot, and Veterans Day Parade).
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.31% of all scheduled hours of service in the month, it
was necessary to cover 2,737 shifts with operators working a 6th day (one of their scheduled
days off). This represents approximately 21,896 hours of service being provided by a “6th day”
RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our contractor
partners, First Transit and TransDev.

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Second Quarter of 2019. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and the
citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 41 performance measures
tracked for the GM, RTD met 31 of the goals (75.6%) in the third quarter. The following is a review
of the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – Maintain system-wide on time performance
Regional on-time service of 87.3% was below goal of 88.0%. The decline was greatly impacted by
the US36 collapse, construction on 18th Street downtown, and the operator shortage. Light Rail ontime service of 89.5% was below goal of 90.0%. A number of factors account for this such as traffic
signal sequencing, large events, incidents, etc., as well as the inability to maintain adequate operator
levels.
Goal 3.2 – Maintain system-wide service availability
Light Rail service availability of 98.2% was below goal of 99.0%.
related to the train operator shortage.

Service availability is directly

Goal 5.1 – Improve ADA On-Time Performance
ADA OTP of 84.3% was below goal of 86.0%. For 2019, the goal of 86.0% reflects passenger OTP,
which is consistent with fixed route. The deficiency is caused by a combination of operator shortage,
a high rate of operators on FMLA, and the increasing number of trips requested during peak travel
hours along with software limitations of current software to smooth the demand.
Goal 5.3 – Improve ADA Courtesy
Average ADA complaints per boarding of 0.002 was higher than goal of 0.001. Staffing challenges
are leading to a higher number of complaints.
Goal 6.2 – Increase in Ridership
Year-to-date ridership for 2019 was down 0.7% from 2018. Although the measure is not meeting
goal, it improved from Q2. The decline was centered in bus service and mirrors the national trend.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
Year-to-date fare revenue and total operating revenue were up 7.3% and 5.9%, respectively, over the
same time last year but are currently short of the budgeted annual goals of 14.2% and 13.6%. These
goals for 2019 are annual measures and we will continue to monitor this revenue.

Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
Both bus operator vacancies and mechanic vacancies exceeded their goals at year-end due to attrition,
retirements, system growth, and full employment in the strong local economy. Bus operator vacancies
are stable to Q2. Bus mechanic vacancies, although stable to Q2, have grown mostly in the body
shop which offset improvements in general repair.

1 Bus and Light Rail are considered on-time if a departure from a location is no more than 1 minute early or 5 minutes
after the scheduled departure time.
2 Commuter Rail is considered on-time if a departure from a location is no more than 0 minutes early or 5 minutes
after the scheduled departure time.
3 Goal is reduced from 92% due to impact from traffic congestion, I-70 corridor construction, drivers buying their way
into HOV lanes, ridership growth, service increases, and regional population growth, all of which are contributing to a
reduction in actual on-time performance.
4 A number of factors account for slippage in Q3. For Regional, these include US36 collapse, 18th Street construction,
and operator shortage. For Light Rail, these include traffic signal sequencing, large events, incidents, and operator
shortage.

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 3rd
Quarter 2019

Information

RTD currently provides 45% of its fixed route bus service via four contracted bus divisions operated by
First Transit and Transdev. With bus divisions located in Longmont, Denver, Commerce City and
Englewood, our contract partners provide fixed route bus service throughout the RTD District. The
performance for First Transit and Transdev is measured on the following performance indicators:
Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 miles, Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 miles, OnTime Preventive Maintenance Inspections, On-Time Performance, Miles Between Lost Service Road Calls
and Operator Complaints per Boarding.
Because of their commitment to excellence, dedicated corporate support and detailed problem solving,
First Transit and Transdev as a group, met all of the Board of Director adopted 2019 key performance
measures through the 3rd quarter 2019. In the areas where our contract partners fell slightly short of
their individual goals, they implemented both procedural and staff changes which should result in
continuous improvement throughout the remainder of 2019. The following is a more detailed discussion
of fixed route contractor performance through the 3rd quarter of 2019.


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles through the 3rd quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to
utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of
operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety
meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities and on the
street.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per
100,000 miles through the 3rd quarter. Of the 13 passenger accidents that occurred through the
3rd quarter, only one was classified as non-preventable. All of the bus operators involved in
passenger accidents were provided retraining on the proper procedures for addressing passenger
safety. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness of passenger safety through
campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled through the 3rd quarter. Competitive Services staff will
continue to monitor the contractor operations to ensure PMIs are completed on-time.

Packet Pg. 152

1.C.4



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
The contractors, as a group, met the target of 86% Local On-Time Service through the 3rd
quarter. First Transit Commerce City (83.7%) did not meet the goal due in part to unexpected
detours and traffic. RTD and the private contractors continue to campaign routes and operators
with low on-time performance with a strong focus on first time point departures. On a monthly
basis contractors review the OTP report and meet with operators of low performing routes to
discuss factors that are impacting their ability to reach 86% on-time performance. Running time
issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, as a group, exceeded the target of 30,000 Miles Between Lost Service
Maintenance Road Calls through the 3rd quarter. First Transit Longmont did not meet the goal
during the 3rd quarter. Deficiencies were identified in First Transit Longmont’s Preventive
Maintenance Inspection (PMI) and Quality Control (QC) practices. Revised procedures have been
implemented to address these issues. Since bringing on a new Maintenance Manager, Miles
Between Lost Service Maintenance Road Calls have improved by more than 15,000 miles during
the 3rd quarter. Competitive Services staff will continue to monitor the contractor operations to
ensure this goal is being addressed by completing preventive maintenance inspections on-time,
working off defects in a timely manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for
mechanics, and taking a pro-active approach to maintaining the buses in their fleet.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of .0004 Complaints per Boarding in
the 3rd quarter. The contractors continue to investigate and address customer complaints with
operators. The contractors utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist
operators in improving customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted above regarding ontime performance should help address some customer complaints. The contractors also continue
to address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.
The contractors continue to take a variety of actions over and above contract requirements to
address their operator hiring/retention challenges which include hiring bonuses, wage increases,
incentives to take on additional work, employing a full-time recruiter, and mentoring programs.

Customer Comment Analysis - 3rd Quarter
2019

Information

Customer comments through the 3rd Quarter of 2019 for both RTD and the private contractors showed
improvement over the same period in 2018. The total number of operator-related comments for the
District as a whole for the 3rd Quarter of 2019 was 12,679. The total number for the same period in
2018 was 14,435. Specific customer comment categories showing improvement in 2019 include “Bus
Did Not Show,” “Bus Early,” “Bus Late,” “Discrimination,” “Fare Dispute,” “Improper
Procedure/Operator,” and “Passed Up Passenger At Stop.” The customer comment categories of
“Careless Driving/Operator,” and “Discourtesy/Operator” showed increases over 2018. RTD and the
private contractors review customer comments on a daily basis and implement corrective action as
needed to address deficiencies and improve performance.
Recapped below is an analysis of the customer comment trends through the 3rd Quarter of 2019. Also
included is a comparison of customer comment data for the same period in 2018.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer comments on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer comments using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the comment is not supported by factual data. Some of the
reasons for the “Not Valid” classification include the following:









Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the comment

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer comments.




Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator, running time of the route, or
other circumstances such as construction and detours.
Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
RTD conducts refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings

Packet Pg. 157

1.C.5







wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado Cross Disability Coalition,
Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis, DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force, RTD Advisory
Committee for People with Disabilities-ACPD) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service
for passengers with disabilities.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Operating Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
Trends in customer service challenges are also addressed through bulletins, campaigns, and other
communications to ensure that RTD and Contractor employees are aware of our customers’
concerns.

Historically, and in 2019, the following comment categories generated the highest number of customer
comments:








Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop

All of these comment categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
comment numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high comment categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and external,
that are impacting the number of comments. The input received from both RTD and private contractor
operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 3rd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 50.8% compared to the
same period in 2018. “Flashbacks” for “bus did not show” comments often show buses running late.
The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 4.04 comments per day. The comparable number for
2018 was 8.21 comments per day.
Bus Early – 3rd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 19.0% compared to the same
period in 2018. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” comments often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The
YTD average in this category for 2019 is 3.60 comments per day. The comparable number for 2018
was 4.44 comments per day.
Bus Late – 3rd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 8.0% compared to the same period
in 2018. Improving on-time performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including
construction, traffic and heavy ridership delays. Running time issues are continually reviewed by RTD

Packet Pg. 158

1.C.5

Service Planning and Scheduling. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 7.50 comments per day.
The comparable number for 2018 was 8.15 comments per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category increased 14.3% compared
to the same period in 2018. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride
checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In
addition, RTD and the private contractors have “G-Force Activated” event-recording systems (Drive
Cam, Smart Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators
continue to be counseled and retrained, as needed, to improve driving performance. Also, periodic
safety campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for
2019 is 4.11 comments per day. The comparable number for 2018 was 3.59 comments per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category increased 14.4% compared to
the same period in 2018. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 8.87 comments per day.
The comparable number for 2018 was 7.75 comments per day.
Discrimination – 3rd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 30.5% compared to the same
period in 2018. Investigation into discrimination-related comments usually shows the operator not at
fault. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 0.21 comments per day. The comparable number
for 2018 was 0.30 comments per day.
Fare Dispute – 3rd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 8.4% compared to the same
period in 2018. Investigations into “fare dispute” comments often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The
YTD average in this category for 2019 is 1.00 comments per day. The comparable number for 2018
was 1.09 comments per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 13.6%
compared to the same period in 2018. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held
at the private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of
RTD passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not
following proper procedures, appropriate coaching activities are taken. The YTD average in this category
for 2019 is 6.01 comments per day. The comparable number for 2018 was 6.96 comments per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category were the same during the same
period in 2018. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, Operations
Managers, the Bus Operator Training teams, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to provide
operators with up-to-date information to answer customer questions and address customer concerns.
Although RTD and the private contractors have seen an influx of new operators, their impact on this
category is minimal, thanks to annual refresher training, assistance from Street Supervisors and trainers,
and improved communication. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 0.37 comments per day.
The comparable number for 2018 was 0.37 comments per day.

Packet Pg. 159

1.C.5

Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 3rd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 10.5%
compared to the same period in 2018. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these comments will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop as the bus
passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting
directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” comments from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
comments (153 of the total 2934 = 5.21%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjusted, as needed, as resources will
allow. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 10.75 comments per day. The comparable number
for 2018 was 12.01 comments per day.

In compliance with the Recommendation included in the Performance Audit of the RTD conducted in
2015 on behalf of the State of Colorado, the following is a summary of the monitoring activities
completed by RTD Drug & Alcohol compliance personnel through the 3rd Quarter of 2019. These
statistics represent the verification of records reviewed for the private contractor operations.

All documents pertaining to testing are reviewed every quarter. Once exceptions are noted, RTD staff
returns to the contractor location to ensure that missing documentation has been obtained. Any
exceptions not addressed are noted and reviewed during the next visit to ensure exceptions have been
corrected.
Scheduled visits for the contractors are no less than quarterly and on-going on an as-needed basis. This
audit schedule was implemented in March of 2016.

ADA Paratransit Advisory Committee (APAC)
3rd Quarter Summary 2019
Membership
Five new members started their 3-year terms at this meeting (two replaced outgoing members, three
filled vacant seats).

APAC Revised Operating Protocols
APAC members reviewed the revised Protocols, specifically a new section on “attendance/engagement”
to ensure APAC can have a full complement of engaged members, and if not, RTD can replace unengaged
members.
Present and Gather Feedback from APAC on RTD Marketing/Communication Strategy
Sara Francois, Marketing/Communications and Access-a-Ride’s assigned communication person, provided
basic information about RTD’s communication strategy broadly (not specifics for Access-a-Ride). Four
touch points:
1. Phone - interactive voice response (IVR) phone tree;
2. Website;
3. Print - signs and brochures in RTD vehicles; and
4. Email - monthly newsletter “Read-n-Ride” is for all RTD.
Sara will be working with RTD staff to develop a communication strategy specifically for Access-a-Ride
services.
Present: Access-a-Ride Driver Shortage
Larry Buter presented data on RTD’s turnover and comparisons to other paratransit systems and other
industries. His result: RTD’s turnover/shortage is similar to other transit agencies throughout county, with
one exception – Wisconsin is enjoying additional drivers. RTD has an 8% shortage, while one transit
agency’s shortage is as high as 20%. It is not just a transportation industry problem, teachers and nurses
also experience shortages. Causation is difficult to pinpoint, but some reasons for Access-a-Ride shortage
may be:
 Low unemployment rate in Colorado.
 Unemployment benefits are good enough that it may be more beneficial to stay on
unemployment (carriers have reported that some people apply, work two days then quit to go
back on unemployment).
 Legalization of marijuana impacts – can’t pass drug testing.
 USDOT physical – may not be able to pass.

Attachment: APAC Summary (4016 : Access-a-Ride/Cab 3rd Quarter 2019 Report)

Update: Access-a-Ride Foundational and Year-to-Date data
Members received a presentation regarding the Access-a-Ride program and a review of accomplishments
over the last year.

RTD has already been working with carriers to increase salaries, but this does not necessarily address the
problem. Carriers have increased starting salaries to match a typical salary (once training is complete),
increased referral bonuses, and updated the application process. RTD continually analyses turnover rates
for causality, but there is no perfect formula.

Special Services 3rd Quarter Report

Information

Ridership
Total FlexRide ridership for 2019 through 3rd quarter was less than the prior year. Boardings in 2018
were 356,236 and 2019 were 336,891. Contributing to the decrease in ridership included the impact
of low fuel prices, which gives customers a low-cost alternative to using the FlexRide service. Seasonal
variations in ridership associated with the end of the 2019 school year also impacted ridership in many
of the FlexRide service areas. This included Brighton, Evergreen, Federal Heights, Longmont and Parker
FlexRides.
Customer Contacts
FlexRide experienced a decrease in overall customer contacts through the 3rd quarter 2019 compared to
2018.
Customer contacts are reviewed on a daily basis. Those contacts that are considered operator related
(within the operator’s control-driver behavior related) are monitored for trends and improvement.
Starting in the 2nd Quarter of 2018, customer contacts were further monitored for an “at fault” and “not
at fault” classification, based on the investigation and review of the contact.

The number of all other customer contacts received regarding FlexRide service (requests for new service
or a change in service which can include boundary changes, service day and hours, web site issues, no
return calls, etc.) are as follows:
3rd Quarter 2019: 310
3rd Quarter 2018: 314
Preventable Accidents
The preventable accident rate through the 3rd quarter 2019 increased to 18 preventable accidents in
comparison with the same period in 2018 with 11 preventable accidents. Contractors have continued to

retrain operators identified as being involved in accidents and have increased the number of “ride-alongs”
performed by operations specialists and training staff.
3rd Quarter 2019: 18
Preventable Vehicle Accidents: 1.75 per 100,000 miles
3rd Quarter 2018: 11
Preventable Vehicle Accidents: 1.08 per 100,000 miles
Productivity
A number of FlexRide areas continued to remain productive-many of these FlexRides serve business
parks and mixed residential areas that connect with the light rail (Arapahoe, Dry Creek, Meridian, North
Inverness, South Inverness and South Jeffco) or communities where residents utilize the service (Golden
and Longmont). Staff continue to monitor FlexRides with low productivity and work with the local
municipalities and RTD Marketing to identify strategies for improving ridership. The attached 2019
Special Services 3rd Quarter Report provides the productivity numbers for each of the FlexRides and
some other special services for which RTD provides cost-share funding. The acceptable level of
productivity for FlexRide service is 3.0 boardings per hour.

1.C.9.a

Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
Third Quarter ~ July 1, 2019 through September 30, 2019

Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection on-board buses
and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then to issue a citation if
that person is contacted a second time without fare. The chart below shows the actual number of patrons
without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers from month to month may be due
to several factors, including special events or other security security-related incidents.

On-Board Enforcement
Transit security officers are assigned to Light Rail and Commuter Rail to check for proper fare and to provide
security. The table below shows how many patrons were contacted for the quarter and the percentage of
patrons that did not present valid fare.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection

Light Rail Operations
The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a slightly
higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain-clothes program than for the rail station sweeps and bus
enforcement because of the following factors:
Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all patrons to
have fare before boarding vehicles
Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
Plain-clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they inherently
find more violations of fare evasion.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Date:

Subject:

Adoption of Pension Plan Contribution

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 4, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopt a 2020 contribution of $6.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust
(the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2020 contribution of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount
to the plan for each year of employment.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #2 – Address Service & Human Capital
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9% of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION
DB Plan
In 2012, the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan
would be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a
result of the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the
DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a
“fully funded” status for the plan in the future. In 2016, the policy was changed to fund an amount that
would keep the Plan “actuarially sound” based on the recommendations of the Actuary and RTD’s Chief
Financial Officer.
The Actuary has updated the DB Plan projections to reflect the final 1/1/2019 valuation assumptions for
the DB Plan. The 2020 Actuary recommended contribution is $8.1 million.
If the Actuarial
recommendation of $8.1 million is made beginning in 2020, the plan is expected to achieve 100%
funding in 2031 and the recommended amount is projected to drop below $5.1 million in 2032.
RTD’s Chief Financial Officer is recommending a contribution of $6.1 million. If RTD contributed $6.1
million in 2020 and beyond, the Plan is expected to achieve 100% funding in 2040. This also assumes
an annual rate of return of 7% per year.

Packet Pg. 197

2.B.2

DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2019.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopt a 2020 contribution of $6.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit
Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also
recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2020 contribution of 9% of each
participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC
Plan”), which contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment.
2. The RTD Board of Directors could certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust or the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution
Plan at amounts other than $6.1 million and 9%, respectively.
3. Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plans. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

BACKGROUND
In accordance with State law, the District submitted its initial 2020 Requested Budget to the
governing body on September 17, 2019 with updates on October 22 and November 12. By legal
notice, the governing body made available/posted the initial 2020 Requested Budget for public

Packet Pg. 203

2.B.3

review prior to October 15. A public hearing to solicit formal public comment for the 2020
Recommended Budget is scheduled for the December 17, 2019 regular meeting of the Board of
Directors.
DISCUSSION

Overview of the 2020 Recommended Budget
Revenues of $1,159.2 million on a combined basis are expected to decrease $59.6 million (4.9%) in
2020 from the 2019 Amended Budget. This is due to 1) a decrease in farebox revenue of $5.5
million, 2) a decrease in grant revenue of $48.3 million, and 3) a decrease in investment income of
$8.2 million, offset by 1) an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $2.4 million.










Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenue of $158.1 million is budgeted to
decrease $5.5 million or 3.4% from the 2019 Amended Budget. Fare revenue is projected
to decrease on the Base System and increase for FasTracks. The increase for FasTracks
will come from full-year ridership on SERE and the G Line and partial year ridership on the
N Line based on a May 2020 opening date.
o On the Base System, farebox revenue is forecast to decrease 11.1% from the 2019
Amended Budget to $111.4 million in 2020.
o For FasTracks, farebox revenue is forecast to increase 22.0% to $46.7 million over the
2019 Amended Budget.
Ridership growth is expected to be flat to lower on Base System with ridership increases
attributed to FasTracks. Total revenue ridership is projected to grow 2.1% in 2020 over
that projected for 2019.
Sales and use tax revenue of $664.7 million in 2020 is forecast to increase 2.0% or
$13.1 million over the 2019 estimate. The 2020 budget incorporates the most recent
September quarterly sales/use tax forecast by the CU-Leeds School of Business.
Total grant revenue, including new and carry-forward amounts, is estimated at $310.3
million, a decrease of $48.3 million from the 2019 Amended Budget.
o Total Base System grants are estimated to total $150.5 million in 2020; of that
amount, $103.3 million is new grants while projected carry-forward grant funding is
$47.2 million. Base System grants are projected to increase $11.8 million over the
2019 Amended Budget. This includes increases in FTA grants for capital maintenance
(5307), fixed guideway (5337), and bus facilities (5339).
o FasTracks grants are budgeted at $159.8 million, which is a decrease of $60.0 million
from the 2019 Amended Budget. Of the amount, $159.8 million is the projected
carry-forward grant funding to 2020. Operating grant revenue is estimated to decrease
$0.2 million while capital grant revenue is estimated to decrease $59.8 million from
the 2019 Amended Budget, a result of project completion and the winding down of
associated grant revenue.
Combined investment income of $7.5 million is projected to decrease $8.2 million from the
2019 Amended Budget due to expectation of lower interest rates on investable fund
balances.

Packet Pg. 204

2.B.3



Other operating income and other income totaling $18.5 million will remain flat from the
2019 Amended Budget. This recurring miscellaneous revenue is increased at the CPI but
is offset by the Build America Bonds subsidy which declines as the bonds are paid off.
Other income also includes payment by the University of Colorado for naming rights on the
A Line (FasTracks Operations) and DUS rental income (Base System and FasTracks
Operations).

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $739.7 million on a combined basis in 2020 (excluding
depreciation), which is $3.6 million lower compared to the 2019 Amended Budget. Base System
operating expenses are budgeted to increase $3.9 million, FasTracks Project operating expenses are
budgeted to decrease $7.4 million, and FasTracks Operations operating expenses are budgeted to
remain essentially flat.
On the Base System, departmental operating expenses are targeted amounts derived from the 20202025 Mid-term Financial Plan, plus operating and maintenance projects approved in the MTFP, plus
operating/expense projects carry-forward from 2019, and other miscellaneous increases unknown at
the time of the MTFP, net of necessary operating expense reductions. For FasTracks Project, the
decrease in operating expenses is due to completion of several FasTracks projects and capitalization
of certain costs to the uncompleted corridors. For FasTracks Operations, operating expenses include
both direct costs and full allocation from Base to FasTracks of costs of operating new service
corridors, including the opening of North Metro, and a higher estimated service payment to Denver
Transit Operators for full-year operation of the G Line. For FasTracks, operating expenses are derived
from the MTFP.
The operating/expense project carry-forward to 2020 is $17.3 million for Base System, $4.6 million
for FasTracks Project, and $1.6 million for FasTracks Operations. New operating and maintenance
projects approved in the MTFP for the Base System for 2020 and carried in the 2020 budget total
$10.3 million (in 2019 dollars).
It should be noted that reductions were made overall to
departmental operating budgets including expense projects to meet the operating expense targets in
the MTFP for Base System and FasTracks and to make up for estimated shortfalls in sales/use tax
revenue and fare revenue compared to the MTFP.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at a lock price of $2.00 per gallon, compared to a budgeted price of $2.30
per gallon in the 2019 Amended Budget, resulting in a savings of approximately $3.0 million from the
2019 budget. Gasoline is budgeted at $2.90/gallon in 2020, same as the 2019 budgeted price.
The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to the posted
Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the initial
Requested Budget consist of various operating expense item reductions, additions for approved
MTFP expense projects, and new expense items requested over the MTFP amounts.
The 2020 Recommended Budget includes funding for costs for operations related to RTD operation
of the North Metro commuter rail line assuming a May 2020 start of revenue service. This budget of
approximately $16.4 million covers staffing, consumables and spare parts for maintenance of the
infrastructure and passenger facilities, training and other support needed to prepare for revenue
service, power, security, vehicle maintenance, insurance, and contingency.
Interest expense in 2020 is budgeted at $170.4 million on a combined basis, an increase of $18.2
million from the 2019 Amended Budget. The decrease is mainly due to a GASB rule to take effect in

Packet Pg. 205

2.B.3

2020 that no longer allows capitalization of interest during construction. Of total interest expense,
$16.8 million is budgeted for Base System and $153.6 million is budgeted for FasTracks. FasTracks
interest expense includes the TABOR interest expense of $35.8 million which is paid with the DTO
service payment.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $88.2 million on a combined basis, which is $11.4
million higher than the 2019 Amended Budget due to payment of principal on the 2015A COPs that
began in 2019 and the inclusion of the TABOR principal payment of $10.0 million in 2020. Base
System principal payments of $65.8 million are $3.2 million higher than the 2019 Amended Budget
due to scheduled principal amortization on current debt. FasTracks principal payments of $22.4
million are $8.2 million higher than the 2019 Amended Budget due to scheduled principal
amortization on current debt and the TABOR principal payment. No new debt issuances are planned
in 2020 for either the Base System or FasTracks. Both will draw from previously issued debt to fund
major capital purchases and construction in 2020.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2019 (previously approved
capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2020. The capital carryforward is $573.6 million made up of $127.7 million on the Base System and $445.9 million on
FasTracks.
New capital spending of $39.7 million on a combined basis will decrease $52.9 million from the
2019 Amended Budget. New capital spending for FasTracks will decrease $40.6 million to $0.8
million in 2020 due mainly to completion of SERE, North Metro mobilization work, Longmont Station
work, and purchases of Flatiron Flyer vehicles. On the Base System, new capital projects will
decrease $12.4 million to $38.8 million. In major categories, Base System will spend $1.2 million
less in transfer stations, $0.5 million less in park-n-rides, $2.6 million less in capital support projects,
$3.8 million less in LRT construction, and $12.1 million less in fleet modernization and expansion,
offset by higher spend of $3.2 million in facilities construction and maintenance, and $5.5 million in
capital support and equipment. The Base System new capital was approved as part of the MTFP in
October 2019 and is the amount identified for minimum critical projects within SOGR priorities.
After the MTFP was approved, certain projects were deferred for the Base System in order to
balance the 2020 budget.
New capital expenditures for 2020 and the change in new capital in the 2020 Recommended Budget
over the 2020 Requested Budget are shown in Attachment B.
The capital carry-forward
expenditures for 2020 and the change in the capital carry-forward in the 2020 Recommended Budget
over the 2019 Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.
Notable designated fund balance and reserve accounts include maintenance of the Base System
unrestricted year-end fund balance at $2.0 million. This projected fund balance is in alignment with
the MTFP after incorporating all revenue and expense adjustments. The actual amount realized,
however, may be lower (or higher) than that projected due to lower (or higher) fare revenue and sales
tax revenue in 2020 (this will become evident in the 2020 amended budget). Also on the Base
System, the Board-appropriated fund is projected to increase by $3.0 million to $26.4 million, the
capital replacement fund is projected to remain at $0, and the unrestricted operating reserve is
projected to be unchanged at $15.4 million.
In FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the three key reserve funds (Board-appropriated,
capital replacement, and unrestricted fund) are maintained at 3 months of operating expenses.
Additionally, in FasTracks Project, the FasTracks management reserve was previously reduced by

Packet Pg. 206

2.B.3

payment in settlement of RRP North Metro project claims in 2018 and is budgeted at $0.9 million.
The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) is budgeted to grow to $103.5 million in 2020 from
savings from construction under budget and internal account growth.
On a District-wide basis, the total of the Board-appropriated fund, the capital replacement fund, the
unrestricted operating reserve and the unrestricted fund balance is projected to remain essentially flat
compared to the 2019 Amended Budget. These fund balances are maintained in minimum
accordance with fiscal policies for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks Project and
FasTracks Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.

Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2020 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures
incurred for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual
target of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.

Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2020 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated fund, a
capital replacement fund, and the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance for both the Base
System and FasTracks, as well as an additional unrestricted operating reserve for the Base System.
The objective is for the total of these funds excluding the capital acquisition fund to equal
approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for both Base System and
FasTracks. The 2020 budget reflects maintenance of the FISA at a level deemed sufficient to fund
adjustments to FasTracks operations and maintenance.
On a District-wide basis, the total of these fund balances (excluding the FISA) for 2020 is projected
at $90.2 million, comprised of 1) the Board-appropriated fund of $41.9 million, 2) the capital
replacement fund of $15.5 million, 3) the unrestricted operating reserve of $15.4 million, and 4) the
remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance of $17.5 million. The Base System portion of these
fund balances listed for 2020 is projected to total $43.8 million.

Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two
exceptions:





Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.
Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.

Attachments
As noted above, please refer to the attached Fiscal Year 2020 Recommended Budget and Fiscal Year
2020 Recommended Budget-Fund Balance (Exhibit I) which shows the operating/non-operating
sources, debt and reserves, and capital sources as well as operating uses, capital expenditures, and

fund balances of the District, and a reconciliation of net assets. Also attached is the Program Capital
Summary including previously approved capital, an Operating Budget Changes Since Posted Budget
summary (Attachment A), a Capital Projects (New) summary (Attachment B), and Capital CarryForward Expenditures (Attachment C).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2020 Recommended Budget is balanced, and the total proposed current year appropriation for
the 2020 Recommended Budget (combined Base and FasTracks) is $1.233 billion. This includes an
operating expense budget of $739.7 million, interest expense of $170.4 million, new capital
expenditures of $39.7 million, debt payments of $88.2 million, FasTracks management reserve of
$0.9 million, FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $103.5 million, Board-appropriated fund of
$41.9 million, capital replacement fund of $15.5 million, unrestricted operating reserve of $15.4
million, and estimated unrestricted fund balance of $17.5 million. The previously approved capital
(capital carry-forward) is $573.6 million. The sum of the budget appropriation and capital carryforward is $1.806 billion.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2019 for the adoption of the 2020 Budget,
Resolution No. ___, Series of 2019 for the 2020 Budget Appropriation and Resolution No. ___,
Series of 2019 for the appropriation of 2020 Previously Appropriated Capital.
2. Do not adopt the 2020 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended since the District will
not be in compliance with State regulations that require the District to adopt a budget by
December 31, 2019. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2019, State
statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations and
maintenance purposes and objects is deemed reappropriated."

From:

Heather McKillop,

Date:

December 4, 2019

Subject:

Free Rides for Active Members of the Military

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 4, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military for the period of
January 1, 2020- December 31, 2020.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #5 – Effective Communications and Community Outreach
BACKGROUND
Since the fall of 2006, RTD has offered free rides for active members of the United States Military. This
action is taken by the RTD Board of Directors on an annual basis. As a result of these actions, all active
duty members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, National Guard, and Reserves are
entitled to ride free on any RTD service including special services such as service to the airport and
BroncosRide. To be eligible to ride for free, active duty military personnel must either be in uniform or
present an active duty military ID card.
DISCUSSION
Staff is recommending to continue to offer this benefit for calendar year 2020.
FINANICAL IMPACT
The exact financial impact of this action is not known, but is expected to be minimal.
ALTERNATIVES

The purpose of RTD’s Internal and Information Systems Audit Function is to provide
independent, objective assurance and consulting services designed to add value and
improve RTD’s processes. The mission of Internal and Information Systems Audit is to
enhance and protect organizational value by providing risk-based and objective
assurance, advice, and insight. The Internal and Information Systems Audit Function helps
RTD accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate
and improve the effectiveness of governance, risk management, and control processes.
(Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing).
The Internal and Information Systems Audit Function will govern itself by adherence to the
mandatory elements of The Institute of Internal Auditors' International Professional
Practices Framework, including the Core Principles for the Professional Practice of
Internal Auditing, the Code of Ethics, the International Standards for the Professional
Practice of Internal Auditing, and the Definition of Internal Auditing. The Manager of
Internal and IT Audit will report periodically to Senior Management and the Board
regarding the function’s conformance to the Code of Ethics and the Standards.

Authority
The Manager of Internal and IT Audit will report functionally to the Board and
administratively (i.e., day-to-day operations) to the General Manager and CEO.
To establish, maintain, and assure that RTD’s Internal and Information Systems Audit
Function has sufficient authority to fulfill its duties, the Board will:

•
•
•
•

Approve the function’s charter.
Approve the risk-based Annual Audit Plan.
Receive communications from the Manager of Internal and IT Audit on the
function’s performance relative to its plan and other matters.
Make appropriate inquiries of management and the Manager of Internal and IT
Audit to determine whether there is inappropriate scope or resource limitations.

The Manager of Internal and IT Audit will have unrestricted access to, and communicate
and interact directly with, the Board.

Attachment: RTD Audit Charter Final Dec2018v1 (4053 : Internal and IT Audit Charter)

Purpose and Mission

The Board and the General Manager and CEO authorize the Internal and Information
Systems Audit Function to:

•

Have full, free, and unrestricted access to all functions, records, property, and
personnel pertinent to carrying out any engagement, subject to accountability for
confidentiality and safeguarding of records and information.

2.C.1.a

•
•

Allocate resources, set frequencies, select subjects, determine scopes of work,
apply techniques required to accomplish audit objectives, and issue reports.
Obtain assistance from the necessary personnel of RTD, as well as other
specialized services from within or outside RTD, in order to complete the
engagement.

The Manager of Internal and IT Audit will ensure that the Internal and Information Systems
Audit Function remains free from all conditions that threaten the ability of all auditors to
carry out their responsibilities in an unbiased manner, including matters of audit selection,
scope, procedures, frequency, timing, and report content. If the Manager of Internal and
IT Audit determines that independence or objectivity may be impaired in fact or
appearance, the details of impairment will be disclosed to appropriate parties.
All auditors will maintain an unbiased mental attitude that allows them to perform
engagements objectively and in such a manner that they believe in their work product,
that no quality compromises are made, and that they do not subordinate their judgment
on audit matters to others.
Auditors will have no direct operational responsibility or authority over any of the activities
audited. Accordingly, auditors will not implement internal controls, develop procedures,
install systems, prepare records, or engage in any other activity that may impair their
judgment, including:

•

Assessing specific operations for which they had responsibility within the previous
year.
• Performing any operational duties for RTD or its affiliates.
• Initiating or approving transactions external to the Internal and Information
Systems Audit Function
• Directing the activities of any RTD employee not employed by the Internal and
Information Systems Audit Function except to the extent that such employees have
been appropriately assigned to auditing teams or to otherwise assist internal
auditors.
Where the Manager of Internal and IT Audit has or is expected to have roles and/or
responsibilities that fall outside of auditing, safeguards will be established to limit
impairments to independence or objectivity.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

December 4, 2019

Subject:

LiVE Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 5, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 10, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND:
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program will transition to
new rules after December 31, 2019.
DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

2.C.3

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of December 1, 2019, 3,420 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 2,016 have been
approved, 972 have been denied and the remaining 432 are pending. Of the 972 denied, 658 of them
were denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65 and older which entitles them to a
better discount. 228 were denied because their address was out of District, 8 were denied because it
was a duplicate application, 5 were denied because the applicants were already enrolled, 5 were denied
because they did not respond to requests for additional information, and 68 were denied because they
did not meet the income threshold.
In addition to going live on July 29th, the following actions have been completed:
