BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: November 26, 2019

From:

Henry
Stopplecamp,
Assistant
Manager, Capital Programs

GM

Date:

November 26, 2019

Subject:

Amend Iliff Initial Parking Management IGA
with Aurora

General

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary to amend an existing agreement with the City of Aurora (Intergovernmental Agreement
Between the City of Aurora and the Regional Transportation District for the Initial Parking Management
Plan for the Iliff Parking Garage, the “Parking Pilot IGA”) to extend the term of the IGA for an additional
two years. With this action, the IGA would terminate in February 2022.
This action addresses the General Manager’s Core Goal #5 for 2019: Effective Communications &
Community Outreach and Task Goal #4 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods.
BACKGROUND
The recommended action would not alter RTD’s obligations under the separate RTD and City of Aurora I225 Rail Line Iliff Station Parking Structure Intergovernmental Agreement (“Iliff Station Parking Structure
IGA”) which details annual operations and maintenance payments from RTD to Aurora. The Iliff Station
Parking Structure IGA was negotiated to fulfill Aurora’s desire to have a parking structure instead of two
surface lots that were in the FasTracks plan. This was conceived as a mutually beneficial partnership
that would accelerate development and enhance ridership long term at no additional cost to RTD with
the same 600 parking spaces available for RTD patrons.
Aurora seeks to, in part, offset its significant investment in the garage by implementing charges for
parking at this facility. Since the 600 spaces were reserved for RTD, the IGA requires that any such
parking plan receive approval in advance by the RTD Board of Directors in the Board’s sole discretion.
The IGA also specifies that a contingency financial plan should be developed by Aurora in the event a
proposed parking plan is not approved by the RTD Board. In the same spirit, the Iliff Garage Land lease
provided that the land upon which the parking structure is located be leased by RTD to Aurora at no
cost, and that the parties shall address revenue generation issues as a part of a parking management
plan.
The Parking Pilot IGA requires that Aurora adjust parking fees in order to reach 75% occupancy in the
garage at peak times. In recent months, during which time Aurora charged every user $3 per day,
occupancy has reached approximately 45%. On November 1, 2019, at RTD’s urging, Aurora reduced its
fee to $2 per day in order to comply with the terms laid out in the IGA.
DISCUSSION
Aurora and RTD wish to extend the three year agreement by two years in order to provide ample time to
continue to reduce the parking fee and determine the optimal pricing for parking in the garage.


Term of Original Agreement: 3 Years (February 2017-February 2020).

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1





Term of Amended Agreement: Additional 2 years (February 2020-February 2022).
Parking Rates: RTD and Aurora will jointly monitor utilization of the garage and adjust pricing with
the common goal of reaching 75% occupancy.
Replacement Agreement: Six months prior to the IGA’s full term, Aurora and RTD will begin good
faith negotiations to negotiate a replacement agreement to be submitted to the RTD Board of
Directors for consideration.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There would be no direct financial impact to RTD because this action would not alter RTD’s obligations
under the separate Iliff Station Parking Structure IGA which details annual operations and maintenance
payments from RTD to Aurora. However, reducing the parking charges at the parking structure to
increase usage of the RTD parking could result in increased ridership on trains and buses serving the Iliff
Station.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his
designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to amend an existing agreement with
the City of Aurora (Intergovernmental Agreement Between the City of Aurora and the Regional
Transportation District for the Initial Parking Management Plan for the Iliff Parking Garage, the
“Parking Pilot IGA”) to extend the term of the IGA for an additional two years. With this action,
the IGA would terminate in February 2022.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not extend the Parking Pilot IGA, and allow the
current IGA to expire in February 2020. This is not recommended because the parking pilot IGA
was interrupted by a change in parking leadership at Aurora and not fully realized. Not accepting
this action would prevent Aurora from charging at this station in February, as board approval is a
requirement for charging RTD patrons.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Date: November 26, 2019

From:

William C. Van Meter,
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

November 25, 2019

Subject:

RTD Boundary Certification & Director District
Designation

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the revised boundary map of the District and authorize the Board Secretary to certify the
boundary map and description. It is further recommended that the areas newly annexed to RTD
pursuant to the provisions of CRS 32-9-106 be designated as follows:
1. The ten Aurora annexations – Bravada/Neher Annexation, Cottonwood Creek Annexation No.1,
Cottonwood Creek Annexation No. 2, Cottonwood Creek Annexation No. 3, Cottonwood Creek
Annexation No. 4, Watkins Road Annexation No. 2, Watkins Road Annexation No. 3, Watkins
Road II Annexation No. 1, Watkins Road II Annexation No. 2 and the Walnut Peacemaker
Annexation – are recommended to be included in Director District F (Director Broom); and
2. The seven Parker annexations – Heirloom Parkway Property Serial I and Heirloom Parkway Serial
II, Chambers Road & Main Street Tract P, Chambers Road & Public Service Company Right-ofWay, Chambers Road No. 1, Chambers Road No. 2 and Chambers Road No. 3 – are
recommended to be included in Director District G (Director Mihalik).
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
HB 1295-07 requires that the District revise its boundary map and legal description following any
changes to the District’s boundary. Further, pursuant to CRS 32-9-106.6 (b), any area annexed by an inDistrict municipality on or after May 25, 1994, is automatically included in the District. The revised RTD
boundary map and legal description must be approved by the RTD Board and the RTD Board Secretary
must certify the map and legal description to the State and appropriate county. Additionally, the Board
must assign the newly annexed areas to specific Director Districts.
Over the last year, the City of Aurora and the Town of Parker have finalized several annexations as listed
in the table below:

The land involved in these annexations encompasses approximately 3,062 acres or approximately 4.8
square miles. With the exception of one farmstead located in the Cottonwood Creek Annexation No. 3,
all of the Aurora properties in these annexations are undeveloped or farmland. In the case of the
Heirloom Parkway annexations, all of the land is solely Town of Parker right-of-way. The Chambers
Road annexations are all for right-of-way and utility purposes.
All of the Aurora annexations are in Southeast Aurora in the general vicinity of Jewel Avenue and
Watkins Road adjacent to Director District F. Currently no transit services exist in this general area of the
District. Any future provisions for service would be reviewed by RTD Service Development as the area
grows out. One set of the Parker annexations are where Heirloom Parkway intersects with Hess Road,
adjacent to District G (Director Mihalik). The other set of the Parker annexations are in the vicinity of
South Chambers Road and Main Street. See the individual annexation maps attached to this report.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact is associated with this action. It should be noted, however, that as these properties
develop, depending on the mix of uses, they will generate sales tax revenue for the District.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors approve the revised boundary map of the
District and authorize the Board Secretary to certify the boundary map and description. It is
further recommended that the areas newly annexed to RTD pursuant to the provisions of CRS 329-106 be designated as follows:
a. The ten Aurora annexations – Bravada/Neher Annexation, Cottonwood Creek Annexation
No.1, Cottonwood Creek Annexation No. 2, Cottonwood Creek Annexation No. 3,
Cottonwood Creek Annexation No. 4, Watkins Road Annexation No. 2, Watkins Road
Annexation No. 3, Watkins Road II Annexation No. 1, Watkins Road II Annexation No. 2
and the Walnut Peacemaker Annexation – are recommended to be included in Director
District F (Director Broom); and
b. The seven Parker annexations – Heirloom Parkway Property Serial I and Heirloom Parkway
Serial II, Chambers Road & Main Street Tract P, Chambers Road & Public Service

Packet Pg. 13

1.B.2

Company Right-of-Way, Chambers Road No. 1, Chambers Road No. 2 and Chambers Road
No. 3 – are recommended to be included in Director District G (Director Mihalik).

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: November 26, 2019

From:

William C. Van Meter,
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

November 25, 2019

Subject:

State Highway (SH) 119 Planning
Environmental Linkages Document

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date:
and

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors accept the Multimodal Corridor Vision for the SH 119 corridor as defined in the Planning and
Environmental Linkages (PEL) document, which was accepted by the Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on October 22, 2019. RTD has currently
committed $30 million to the transit elements of the corridor through the Mid-Term Financial Plan. It is
also recommended that the Board of Directors support the transit elements of the PEL’s Multimodal
Corridor Vision. Further, the RTD Board affirms that the $30 million RTD commitment will be used solely
for implementation of transit elements and directs staff to pursue grant opportunities, partnerships and
other opportunities to leverage this commitment to that end.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #4 Address Future Transportation Needs
BACKGROUND
RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), in April 2013 to develop consensus among
RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the Northwest-area stakeholders, including
local jurisdictions and businesses, on cost effective and efficient mobility improvements to serve the
Northwest area, recognizing that RTD could not complete the Northwest Rail Corridor in the near- or
medium-term timeframe. On June 24, 2014, the Board approved a resolution which accepted the Final
Consensus Statement as developed by the NAMS stakeholders for priorities within the Northwest Study
Area. One of the highest priorities, as described in the Final Consensus Statement, was to proceed into
advanced planning, environmental review and preliminary engineering to establish Bus Rapid Transit
(BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor between Longmont and Boulder.
The NAMS recommendation for BRT in the corridor assumed a bus-on-shoulder type operation. The
capital cost to establish BRT with a bus-on-shoulder operation was estimated to be approximately $60
million dollars. Staff assumed that grants could provide funding for approximately half of this cost.
Accordingly, the Mid-Term Financial Plan (MTFP) includes $30 million in Base System funds in 2023.
In September 2017, RTD, in collaboration with CDOT, DRCOG and local jurisdictional stakeholders,
began the SH 119 environmental and preliminary engineering process. During the alternatives evaluation
phase it became clear that CDOT and local stakeholders wanted to focus more on person-through-put for
the corridor than just a single transit improvement – which a bus-on-shoulder operation would have
provided. Consequently, the PEL’s recommended vision for the corridor includes BRT/Managed Lanes,
which would be used by buses, high-occupancy-vehicles (HOV) and toll-paying autos; a bikeway, which

Packet Pg. 32

1.B.3

would generally run in the highway median between Longmont and Boulder; and, several transit
elements as listed below:






New and upgraded stations and Park-n-Rides;
Additional service for the corridor;
Queue jumps (bus bypass lanes) throughout the corridor;
Business access/turn (BAT) lanes along 28th in Boulder; and
Coffman Street busway in Longmont.

The transit elements are consistent with the presentation that was provided to the Planning/Capital
Programs & FasTracks Committee on October 8, 2019. A copy of that presentation is attached to this
report.
The project was governed by a Policy Advisory Committee, comprised of elected officials, including
Directors Lubow and Guissinger; and a Technical Advisory Committee, comprised of staff members from
CDOT, DRCOG and local jurisdictions. The project team held three rounds of public meetings, which
included two meetings per round: one generally on the Boulder end of the corridor and one on the
Longmont end of the corridor’s BRT/Managed Lanes. One additional joint meeting with Boulder County
was held in Niwot. RTD also surveyed existing corridor riders via a survey on the Bolt and the J routes;
and RTD provided an on-line questionnaire on the project’s website to solicit additional feedback from
the general public.
RTD, with extensive guidance from CDOT, packaged the final corridor vision into the PEL. On October
22, 2019, FTA and FHWA provided a letter accepting the SH 119 PEL. The total cost for the full
corridor vision as described in the PEL is estimated to be approximately $255 million.
DISCUSSION
With the completion of the PEL and preliminary design work, RTD can now work with CDOT and the
local stakeholders to begin implementation of the project elements. CDOT has begun a Traffic and
Revenue study to determine the potential revenue that tolling in the corridor could provide. As the
planning and environmental process is concluding, funding from several other sources, including CDOT,
DRCOG and local jurisdictions, has been identified for the corridor.
As noted, the transit elements for the project are consistent with those provided in the presentation to
the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee on October 8, 2019, attached to this report.
Project construction for the RTD-funded transit elements could occur within the 2023 to 2025
timeframe. Future Board action would be required to obligate the final programming of RTD’s $30
million. Since some of the other sources of funding, noted above, will be available sooner than 2023,
RTD can work with our partners on the final design and construction of those project elements but
cannot contribute funding until 2023. RTD has supported local stakeholders in securing grants for the
corridor through leveraging of RTD’s funds. Along those lines, local stakeholders have requested that
RTD accelerate the programming of $5 million in the Mid-Term Financial Plan to either 2020 or 2021 in
order to leverage additional outside funds.
The proposed action fits within the General Manager Goal of Strong Financial Management, specifically
the sub goal of Address Future Transportation Needs, as the eventual completion of BRT in the SH 119
corridor will increase service reliability, ridership and cost effectiveness of the service.

1.B.3

FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD’s $30 million in funding for the corridor is identified in 2023 in the Mid-Term Financial Plan. As
noted, all other funding for the corridor is assumed to be from other agencies and grants.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors accept the Multimodal Corridor Vision for
the SH 119 corridor as defined in the Planning and Environmental Linkages (PEL) document,
which was accepted by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) on October 22, 2019. RTD has currently committed $30 million to the
transit elements of the corridor through the Mid-Term Financial Plan. It is also recommended that
the Board of Directors support the transit elements of the PEL’s Multimodal Corridor Vision.
Further, the RTD Board affirms that the $30 million RTD commitment will be used solely for
implementation of transit elements and directs staff to pursue grant opportunities, partnerships
and other opportunities to leverage this commitment to that end.
2. Do not accept the Multimodal Corridor Vision for the SH 119 corridor as defined in the Planning
and Environmental Linkage (PEL) document, which was accepted by the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on October 22, 2019. This
action is not recommended since it will delay the implementation of a project that is meant to
address the mobility needs in the Northwest region.

Proposed Regional
BRT Network
Based on input from stakeholders across the
region, it became clear that many communities
within RTD are interested in BRT. The primary
outcome of this Feasibility Study was the
development of an integrated network of BRT
routes throughout the district, as depicted in blue
and white on this map.
Note: BRT routes along Colfax Avenue and SH 119
are included in DRCOG’s 2040 fiscally constrained
Metro Vision Regional Transportation Plan. As
such, they were assumed to be part of the
regional BRT network and did not receive further
evaluation during this study.

The Denver metro area’s
population, and the travel
demands of that population,
continue to grow at a rapid
pace. By 2040, the Regional
Transportation District may
serve a need more than double
its current level. Recognizing
the need to explore new
service types in order to serve
this demand, RTD undertook
this Regional BRT Feasibility
Study. Through a datadriven evaluation process,
supplemented with extensive
stakeholder engagement,
an integrated, district-wide
network of potential BRT routes
that would substantially expand
the reach of high-frequency
transit throughout the region
has been envisioned for future
investment.

BRT Network Development

1.C.1.b

The BRT network includes:
• Corridors with the highest potential to support high quality, high
frequency bus service
• Corridors in communities that have demonstrated substantial
support through study, design, and/or financial commitment
• Corridors with high ridership potential that can operate on an
existing semi-exclusive travelway (i.e., toll lanes, managed lanes,
high-occupancy vehicle lanes) and can therefore be implemented
more cost effectively
The proposed BRT network includes 23 routes for continued
evaluation and development by local agencies with support from RTD.
While some of the envisioned BRT routes have a demonstrated need today, others
are currently developing and need is based on future land use and travel demand.
Other factors that influence the timing of BRT implementation include available
ROW, existing policies, partnerships, and coordination, existing transit-supportive
policies, and route-specific studies. The table below provides a qualitative
assessment of each corridor’s readiness.

1.C.1.b

Identify Congestion and/or Delay
In Tier 2, we evaluated the 29 corridors developed in Tier 1 to determine which corridors have the most
potential for travel time and reliability improvement. These are the locations where congestion is
precluding competitive transit travel times and improving the travel time has the opportunity to capture
higher ridership. Tier 2 evaluation relied heavily on metrics provided by RTD's regional travel model.

Evaluation Metrics
• BRT boardings per revenue mile

• BRT passenger-miles traveled per revenue mile
• Percent of corridor that is severely congested
Other Metrics considered but not included in the analysis include:
• Boardings
• New system-wide boardings
• Line load compared to congested roadway

TIER 2

1.C.1.b

The two primary evaluation criteria for Tier 3 were community support for BRT and the
potential physical viability of a corridor for BRT investment.

Evaluation Metrics
Community Support

Community support for transit was informed in two ways –inventorying transit supportive local policies/plans and
identifying community support for BRT through an online survey distributed to local agencies impacted by the
potential BRT routes. The eight corridors in yellow are those that moved into Tier 4.

Physical Viability

An extensive data collection effort informed the potential
of repurposing existing ROW and/or acquiring ROW for BRT
along each of the 14 corridors. Data collected to inform the
analysis included:
• Roadway characteristics (existing ROW, drive lanes,
turn lanes, medians, parking, bike lanes, sidewalks,
access control)
• Improvements identified in the Regional
Transportation Plan
• Current and 2040 traffic volumes

Conclusion

The past decade has seen something
of a transit renaissance. As concerns
about accessibility, equity, safety, and
sustainability in transportation continue
to grow, high-quality public transit service
increasingly stands out as a potential
panacea for an array of 21st century
mobility challenges. Bus Rapid Transit,
in particular, has proliferated throughout
the United States. The combination of
rail-like frequencies and amenities with
the cost efficiencies of traditional rubbertire service makes it a uniquely promising
opportunity for expanding the reach of
high-frequency transit networks. The
regional BRT network envisioned herein
would greatly enhance the convenience,
connectivity, and comfort of transit for the
region’s rapidly growing population and
act as part of the solution for combating
worsening congestion and environmental
health. RTD looks forward to working with
its partners to bring this vision to fruition.

ensure the level and quality of public
transportation service is provided in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
• The FTA requires RTD establish policies
for evaluating fixed-route service
changes to determine whether the
planned changes will have a disparate
impact on the basis of race, color,
national origin or low-income status.

FRONT RANGE RAIL
PRE-NEPA PLANNING
AND PROJECT
DEVELOPMENT
PROCESS
2019 September - October

The Front Range Passenger Rail project is following an integrated planning process that will directly link with National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements for a federal approval by the
US Department of Transportation (USDOT). Federal Railroad Administration, Federal Transit Administration, and Federal
Highway Administration will oversee the activities in the flowchart below: defining the project, stakeholder
coordination, and identification of environmental issues. This upfront involvement will ensure a more efficient NEPA
process.
The USDOT agencies will also work with other federal, state, and local agencies to streamline permitting and project
approvals once NEPA is initiated. This is consistent with Executive Order 13807, issued in 2017 to reduce the average
time to complete required environmental reviews and authorization decisions for major infrastructure projects.

Front Range Passenger Rail Purpose
“Developing passenger rail service in and along the I-25 corridor
is a critical component of Colorado’s future. Front Range
Passenger Rail (FRPR) will provide a safe, efficient, and reliable
transportation option for travel between major population
centers along the Front Range and create a backbone for
expanding rail and transit options in the state.”

Front Range Passenger Rail Study
Objectives
Increased mobility choices for safe and reliable travel along the Front Range
- limited intercity transit options today
• Connect corridor destinations and communities - jobs, shopping,
recreation, health care, leisure
• Address increasing intercity and regional travel demands - effects of
population growth and increasing congestion on major highways
• Provide a mode choice for our changing demographics and corresponding
transportation demands
• Provide an inter-city transportation alternative for low-income and
underserved communities - connect affordable housing to jobs
•

Legislative Options –
Governance
Public Rail Authority: Establishes a statutory tool for local entities to create an
authority over time as planning and funding options arise. This tool is similar to
PHA and RTA enabling statutes but for rail. (Preferred)
Front Range Rail District: Creates a defined district along the I-25 corridor and
provides a specific governance structure; powers and financing authority would
be detailed in statute.
Rail Enterprise: Could leverage HPTE structure, focused more on fees for
funding; powers and financing authority would depend on statute.
Expand SW Chief/FRPRail Commission: Provide additional scope and authority
to existing Commission to further evaluate above options, along with
appropriation

Board Chair establishes Redistricting Committee
• Update current Director District Map showing population based on
new census data.
• RTD’s enabling legislation doesn’t specify allowable variation
between Districts, but state law allows only 5% deviation between
most and least populous House Districts.
• Director Districts need to be redrawn only if population difference
between any 2 Director Districts exceeds threshold established by
Board
- This is the expected scenario based on District growth.
