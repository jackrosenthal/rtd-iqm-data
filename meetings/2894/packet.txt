Re:

August Board Update

There continues to be talk of a Special Session being called. The call would likely be made
should behind the scene negotiations yield a bi-partisan agreement to deal with the current
TABOR surplus and some type of permanent income tax decrease. Time is running out for an
agreement to be reached but as of this report submission talks are continuing.
BBMK has been busy this Summer monitoring numerous interim committee hearings on behalf
of the District. Two committees of importance are the FAMLI stakeholder meetings to discuss
options for a state funded family and medical leave program as well as the meetings hosted by
CDOT as a result of the passage of SB18-239. SB19-239 directed the Department of
Transportation to convene and consult with a stakeholder group to examine impacts of new
transportation technologies and business models, identify means of addressing impacts, and
report findings and make recommendations to the General Assembly. BBMK will continue to
monitor these interim meetings on behalf of the District and provide a summary of the
recommendations upon conclusion of the committee’s work.
BBMK met with Rep. Hansen a member of the Joint Budget Committee to discuss transportation
funding. Rep. Hansen and other members of the Democratic caucus are interested in examining
ways to increase certain fees to create a fund to bond from in order to increase transportation
infrastructure spending. As part of the RTD legislative committee’s desire to increase
participation from transportation stakeholders in Colorado BBMK has invited and confirmed
attendance with Joint Budget Committee Members Senator Moreno and Rep. Hansen to provide
a pre-session overview on transportation issues during the December RTD Board meeting.
BBMK will work with staff and Director Guissenger to invite other State leaders to brief the
committee on transportation issue as the year continues.
BBMK has scheduled meetings with DRCOG, Conservation Colorado, CML and CCI to learn
about any legislative activity of interest to the District for the 2020 session. Most organizations
are in the planning stages and we hope to have more concrete proposals to review this Fall.
RTD is scheduled to present an update to the Transportation Legislation Review Committee
(TLRC) on October 28th at 9:00am. We strongly encourage Board members to attend this
hearing as legislators always appreciate seeing members of the elected RTD Board.
Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or need anything.

Local Government Relations Update

Below is our update for August 2019:
1. Metro Mayors Caucus Meeting – The next full Caucus meeting is Wednesday, August
7 from 7:30-10 AM at the Metro Denver Chamber, 1445 Market St, Denver, 80202. An
agenda will be available later in the month.
2. November 2019 Municipal Elections – The deadline to file candidate petitions for local
municipal elections in most jurisdictions is August 26. I will circulate an election
“snapshot” shortly after that deadline with information about candidates and their contact
information. We will see significant leadership changes in the region, with eight current
mayors either term-limited or decided not to seek reelection and several other facing very
competitive challengers. This turnover presents both opportunities and challenges for the
District and it will be critical to establish good working relationships with those elected.
3. Citizens Advisory Committee – Last week the Citizens Advisory Committee submitted
a letter outlining recommendations on ways it could better represent the citizen
perspective and be more relevant to the District, and responded to input board members
provided in one-on-one meetings regarding the need for clearer expectations and
communication about the CAC’s role and responsibilities. Committee members will be
attending the October meeting to discuss further and answer any questions you may have.

Federal Update for August 6, 2019, Board Meeting

RTD Receives Federal Grant for Electric Buses and Related Infrastructure
On July 26, the Federal Transit Administration announced a $2.6 million grant award – the full
amount sought – to RTD to purchase electric buses and related infrastructure. RTD will put the
grant toward the purchase of 17 battery electric buses to replace diesel vehicles that are beyond the
end of their useful life. This $85 million Low or No Emission grant program is highly competitive.
This year, 155 eligible proposals sought a total of $498 million. RTD was one of only 38 successful
applicants.
Colorado Senators Introduce RRIF CRP Repayment Legislation
On July 23, Senators Gardner and Bennet introduced the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement
Financing Equity Act, S. 2213. This bill would require the Secretary of Transportation to promptly
repay the credit risk premium on each RRIF loan once all obligations attached to each loan have
been satisfied. Under the bills’ terms, the RRIF CRP on the Denver Union Station project loan
must be repaid, with interest, within 60 days of the date of enactment.
S. 2213 could be advanced in several ways, including on its own, as part of the broader Fixing
America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act reauthorization legislation expected to move through
the Senate later this year, or in the FY 2020 Transportation-HUD appropriations bill. With the new
fiscal year just two months away, the Senate has yet to begin consideration of any of the 12 annual
spending bills, so it is unclear if substantive program changes like the ones made in S. 2213 would be
considered by appropriators under their highly compressed timeline to approve spending for Federal
government programs by October 1.
Senate Committee Advances Legislation Reauthorizing Federal-aid Highway Programs
In the first major advancement of the successor bill to the FAST Act, on July 30, the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee marked up a $287 billion, five-year highway bill,
America’s Transportation Infrastructure Act of 2019. This funding total represents a 27 percent
increase in highway spending over the five years of the FAST Act. Ninety percent of the funding is

Federal Update

1.C.5.a

Important to public transportation stakeholders, the bill would expand TIFIA eligibility to transit
oriented development projects (including commercial and residential development) near major
transit stations. The bill codifies the Trump Administration’s “One Federal Decision” executive
order in an effort to further streamline permitting and reduce project approval times. The bill also
would repeal the $7.6 billion rescission of highway formula funds included in the FAST Act that is
due to occur on July 1, 2020. Repealing the rescission is a top priority of transportation committee
leadership in the House and Senate.
Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman John Barrasso (R-WY) has said that
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is “receptive” to the idea of reserving floor time for the
full Senate to consider the surface transportation bill this fall. However, this bill is just the highway
title of the surface transportation reauthorization; the transit, rail, and safety titles are the jurisdiction
of the Senate Commerce and Banking Committees. Significantly, this bill also does not include
revenues sufficient to fund the programs it authorizes; nor does it include a solution for the
Highway Trust Fund’s chronic revenue shortfall. These matters are in the jurisdiction of the Senate
Finance Committee. On the House side, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is not
expected to consider their surface transportation bill until later this fall or early in 2020.
FRA Issues Proposed Rule to Implement Inward-Facing Camera Requirement
On July 24, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that
would require image and audio recording devices for commuter and intercity passenger trains, as
mandated under the FAST Act. This requirement would not apply to freight trains. Under the
proposal, all lead locomotives in passenger trains would be required to install inward- and outwardfacing recording devices. These devices, which would be considered “safety devices” under federal
railroad regulations prohibiting tampering and disablement, must (1) record while the lead
locomotive is in motion, and (2) retain data in a “crashworthy memory module.”
In addition to their use in accident investigations, the recordings could be used to review train
operations, including determining an operating employee’s compliance with railroad rules and
federal rail safety regulations. All cameras must be installed within four years of date of the final
rule. Comments on this proposed rule are due September 23, 2019.

dedicated to formula programs where funding is apportioned directly to the States. There are
several new programs (formula and discretionary), including climate-focused programs to reduce
carbon emissions and fund resilient infrastructure. The bill would also reestablish dedicated funding
for highway bridges.

Results of Stakeholder Engagement
Initial project scope was to conduct a data driven evaluation process to identify 3 to 5 corridors that have
the highest potential to compete well for FTA Small Starts funding. Stakeholders requested that a regional
network of BRT be included in the study.
As a result of this stakeholder input:
• The study developed a proposed District-wide Regional BRT Network that could be phased in over
time
• The study worked to include language that assured stakeholders of RTD’s support of local agency
BRT investments across the district
Stakeholders requested evaluation of passenger miles of travel and reduced stop spacing to account for
the benefits afforded longer, regional routes that operate in less dense areas.
As a result of this stakeholder input:
• The Tier 2 modeling and evaluation were updated to include evaluation of passenger miles of travel
and reduced stop spacing

2.C.3.a

Results of Stakeholder Engagement
Stakeholders reviewed the proposed District-wide BRT network and suggested that it include all corridors
identified in NAMS rather than just those that were evaluated and appeared to be the highest
performers.
As a result of this stakeholder input:
• The proposed network was modified to include all NAMS corridors
Stakeholders reviewed the updated District-wide BRT network and expressed concern that the phasing
and the term “phase” could be detrimental to implementing corridors that were not identified in Phase 1.
As a result of this stakeholder input:
• The term “phase” was removed, and four phasing categories were changed to two
• The two categories reflect those corridors that are likely to compete better for FTA funds and those
that may have more success seeking local and state funding

Tier 4 Route Development
• This extensive level of analysis focuses on those corridors
that appear to have high potential to compete well for FTA
Small Starts funding
• Tier 4 analysis is necessary to test adherence to Small Starts
project justification criteria.
• Corridors that are not Federal funding candidates did not
require this level of analysis.
