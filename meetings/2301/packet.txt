Authorization to Enter Into Contract with INIT
for Purchase of Day Pass Printers

CFO/AGM,

Board Meeting Date: June 16, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to enter into a $2,700,000 sole source contract
with INIT Innovations in Transportation, Inc. (INIT) for purchase, integration and installation of equipment
and software necessary to accommodate the sale of day-pass fare media under the newly adopted fare
structure (Contract Number 15DH072). This contract will include integration with the Computer Aided
Dispatch/ Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) system, interface changes for the new fare structure,
parking pass validation and a 3-year extended warranty.
BACKGROUND
RTD recently adopted a modified and simplified fare structure to be enacted in January 2016. Under the
new fare structure, many transfers are eliminated and a day pass will be offered to customers for
purchase on board RTD buses. The day passes are priced at two times the single fare and would allow
a customer to have unlimited rides during a service day, thereby not requiring a rider to purchase a fare
at each transfer. Paper transfers would no longer be needed.
DISCUSSION
In order to make the day pass widely available to RTD’s patrons, the ability to purchase day passes is
needed at the location where a patron accesses RTD’s services either on buses or at rail platforms. RTD
currently has the ability to sell day passes at rail platforms through ticket vending machines (TVMs) and
at sales outlets but currently does not have the ability to offer day passes to patrons who purchase their
first fare upon entering a bus. In order to offer a day pass on buses, a printer would be installed in each
bus whereby a customer would pay for the day pass through the farebox and the operator would
produce a day pass from the onboard printer. The day pass will be printed on watermarked paper and
would clearly indicate the service day for which it is valid.
In addition to the Day Pass Printer and software, the scope of work for this procurement includes having
the Day Pass Printer also function as a Parking Pass Validation printer. The scope of work includes
driver interface changes to activate the printer and Smart Media Technology (SMT) driver interface
changes required for the new fare structure.
INIT is the company providing our CAD/AVL system. They have onboard printer and software that
meets our needs and integrates with the existing system. These printers are in use by Tri-Met in
Portland, OR and RTD staff saw them in use during their visit to Portland. A sole source justification
memo for this procurement has been prepared and approved by Legal Counsel. This procurement meets
the sole source criteria in the RTD "Procurement Standards Manual" revised September 2014.
Soul Source Criteria: Unique Capability

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

With multiple types of Day Passes anticipated and a need for a daily security code printed on each ticket
that is known to all drivers, but not passengers, customized and centralized pass printing software will
be needed for whatever printer is chosen. INIT has already developed printer software that is
programmable through the central system. No other vendor would be able to provide this type of central
system interface and remote reprogramming of the onboard system. Any other vendor would require
that new ticket information be reprogrammed by visiting each of RTD’s 1045 onboard computers with a
new data file. This level of labor effort is substantial and not properly staffed to be available for this
purpose.
Sole Source Criteria: Duplication of Costs
An onboard computer is needed to create and send a file to print. This computer is already available
onboard from the INIT CAD/AVL system. Providing an additional onboard computer would cost over
$2,200,000 to furnish and install an onboard computer, hardened to operate in a transit environment.
Additionally, a different onboard computer would require information that is available in the current INIT
CAD/AVL system. So, a different onboard computer would need to have an interface developed to the
INIT system. This would require customized software and interface development assistance from INIT.
Past experience indicates that onboard interface development is about 3 months of development work,
which is duplication of cost that is not needed with this sole source.
Sole Source Criteria: Prevention of Acceptable Delay
This is one of the most compelling justifications for a sole source for this project. The Board directs
starting the new fare structure on January 1, 2016. This is only seven (7) months after the Board made
its decision on the new fare structure. Going to a competitive procurement will take at least three (3)
months, and likely longer, to select a contractor, negotiate and execute a contract. Manufacturing and
shipping 1043 printers will take over five (5) months. Even with pre-wiring, installation of 1043 printers
will take an additional month. So, with only 7 months to procure and implement this six-month project,
a competitive procurement is not feasible.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of installing thermal printers on each of the 1,043 revenue buses currently in the
RTD fleet is $1,900,000. This cost includes required software and equipment, as well as the
connections and installation necessary to tie the printers into the RTD network and a 3-year extended
warranty. The estimate for Parking Pass Validation is $20,000 and the estimate for the driver interface
changes is $450,000.
Budget Source
Board Funded from Certificate of Participation transfer authorized May 2015
CAD/AVL funds for interface, integration and new fare policy changes
Facility Maintenance funds for Parking validation
Operating Expenses: spare hardware, 3-year extended warranty and software
maintenance

Amount
$1,900,000
$450,000
$20,000
$330,000
$2,700,000

The Board previously authorized the funding necessary for the purchase of the thermal printer units by
transferring a portion of the Certificate of Participation (COP) proceeds issued in 2013 for the

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

replacement of Mall Shuttles – those Mall Shuttle funds will be backfilled with the 2015 COP issuance
expected to occur in August. Funding for parking validation requirements will come from the Facilities
Maintenance budget. Interfaces changes with the CAD/AVL system will be funded with remaining
budget from the Radio and CAD/AVL Replacement Project. Extended warranty funding will come from
2017 through 2019 Operational Budget. Therefore, there is no need to seek additional funding for this
procurement and no budgetary impact other than the transfer of funds from one project to another.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with INIT in order
to purchase and install the equipment necessary to accommodate the sale of day passes
under the proposed 2016 fare structure. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with INIT
to purchase and install the equipment necessary to accommodate the sale of the day pass.
This action would result in RTD’s inability to procure needed day pass printer equipment in
time to provide the ability for patrons to purchase day passes on buses and avoid multiple fare
payments for transfers. This is not the recommended action.

Contract

for

External

Audit

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to RubinBrown,
LLP to perform RTD’s annual external audit services. The contract is awarded for audit services for
calendar years 2015, 2016 and 2017 in the amount of $333,500. There is an option to extend the
contract for two additional one year periods, at RTD’s discretion, in the amount of $239,500.
BACKGROUND
According to Section 12 of Article VII of the RTD Bylaws, “The Board of Directors shall cause an
examination of the District’s financial statements to be made in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards following the end of each fiscal year. One certified copy of said audit shall be filed
with the office of the State Auditor. The audit shall be performed by an independent Certified Public
Accountant retained by the Board of Directors at the sole discretion for this or any other purpose they
deem necessary. The auditor shall provide a signed auditor’s opinion as to the fair presentation of the
financial position of the District, the results of RTD operations and changes in its financial position for
the fiscal year ended. The Board of Directors shall cause such other audits to be made as it deems
necessary, utilizing the Internal Audit staff or independent auditor as it alone shall determine.” In
addition, the District is required by the Single Audit Act of 1984 and certain debt and lease covenants to
have an independent audit of other selected information. Additional external audit services include an
annual review of information provided for the National Transit Database as well as a review of the
General Manager’s contract.
DISCUSSION
The current RTD contract for external audit services expires on June 30, 2015. RubinBrown is the
incumbent firm and has provided external audit services to RTD for the past four years after an
acquisition of the preceding contractor, Bondi and Co. RubinBrown will continue to rotate audit
engagement partners, managers and staff on a periodic basis in keeping with auditing best practices.
RTD issued a best value request for proposals to provide external audit services and received five
proposals from the following firms:
 BKD
 Clifton Larson
 Crowe Horwath
 McGladrey
 RubinBrown

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.2

The proposals were evaluated with the following criteria:
40% - Qualifications of individuals proposed for key positions and disciplines
30% - Overall experience of the firm
30% - Cost
The proposal evaluation committee determined that RubinBrown had the best overall proposal.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding of $108,000 for the 2015 fiscal year audit will be included in the 2016 Budget. Funding for
external audit services is an annual recurring expenditure that is regularly included in the budget and SBP
process.

ALTERNATIVES
1) Approve the recommendation to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to
award a contract to RubinBrown, LLP to perform RTD’s annual external audit services. This is
the recommended action.
2) Do not approve the recommendation to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to
award a contract to RubinBrown, LLP to perform RTD’s annual external audit services. This is
not the recommended action because it will delay having an external auditor available and
staff has found RubinBrown, LLP to have the best overall proposal.

BACKGROUND
The purpose of this memorandum is to request an amendment to the 2015 Adopted Budget. This
amendment will account for capital carryforward adjustments from year-end 2014 to 2015. The
amendment also will detail other adjustments to the capital budget and adjustments to the operating and
administrative budget.

Packet Pg. 11

1.B.3

DISCUSSION
Overview of the 2015 Budget Amendment
The total proposed appropriation for the 2015 Amended Budget and the changes from the 2015
Adopted Budget are summarized in the first set of tables above.
2015 Operating Expense Adjustments
The operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment reflects an
increase of $37.0 million from the 2015 Adopted Budget. This increase consists of $4.2 million on the
Base System, $32.1 million in FasTracks Project/Construction, and $0.8 million in FasTracks Operations
(West Line, Denver Union Station, and Free MetroRide). Of the total increase, $13.7 million is attributed
to previously approved transfers primarily for the FasTracks Eagle and I-225 Rail Line projects, and
$17.3 million is attributed to third-party betterments on I-225 and North Metro projects (funded by
capital contributions). On the Base System, the true increase to operating expenses is less than 1% net
of previously approved transfers and one-time expenses.
Shown in detail on the attached Amendment A, major changes are summarized below.
Base System
Bus Operations
 Net increase of $1.0 million for increases in operator overtime, salaried overtime, operator wages,
expanded DRCOG VanPool Program, and the addition of four adjunct equipment supervisors, one
division supervisor, and one rail scheduler/planner.
Private Carrier Operations
 Net increase of $.067 million for expanded DRCOG VanPool Program.
Rail Operations
 Net increase of $1.0 million for increases in operator overtime, salaried overtime, simulator training
software, repair parts, MOW and SCADA materials and supplies, and SCADA hardware (2015 SBP
project).
Planning-Base
 Net increase of $1.5 million from previously-approved transfers, the addition of one Title VI position
and one TOD Analyst position, TOD assessment incorrectly budgeted in Finance and Administration,
RTD parking study, Continuous Improvement project, and grant-funded STAMP projects (offset by
grant funds).
Capital Programs-Base
 Net increase of $0.639 million from previously approved transfers, Jacobs engineering support, and
Stray Current project.

Safety, Security & Facilities-Base
 Net increase of $0.443 million from increased funding for East Metro Controls project, District Shops
HVAC project, District Shops Mezzanine-Asset Management project, environmental clean-up of

Packet Pg. 12

1.B.3

Alameda, snow removal, an emergency project for Security Command Center electrical work, offset
by decreased funding for East Metro Supply Air Units project, and previously approved transfers.
General Counsel
 Net increase of $0.045 million for additional funds for legal services for aviation fuel tax matter
offset by previously approved transfers.
Finance and Administration-Base
 Net increase of $1.3 million from increased IT costs due to conversion of 9 temporary IT employees
to full-time, increased funding for various IT projects and the State audit, funding for Smart Media
RPOS modems, various fees, addition of one Senior Budget Analyst and one Senior Finance Analyst,
offset by elimination of two Senior Accountant position, TOD assessment incorrectly budgeted, and
previously approved transfers.
Communications-Base
 Net increase of $0.496 million for increased funds for Fare Study public meetings and public
awareness advertising, service change advertising, system-wide safety campaign, temporary web
developer for real-time information, and previously approved transfers.
Executive Office
 Net increase of $0.135 million for conversion of temporary employee to permanent in Civil Rights,
additional funds for WIN program training, upgrade of compliance software in Civil Rights.
Board Office
 Net increase of $0.390 million for funds needed for GM search and previously approved transfers.
Non-Departmental-Base
 Net decrease of $2.2 million for over-budget of union bonus.
FasTracks Project/Construction
Capital Programs-FasTracks Construction
 Net increase of $31.4 million for previously approved transfers on Eagle and I-225 Rail Line projects,
third-party betterments on I-225 and North Metro, and additional expense funds on Eagle project.
Finance and Administration-FasTracks Construction
 Net increase of $0.027 million for previously approved transfers.
FasTracks Operations
Rail Operations-FasTracks Operations
 Net increase of $0.763 million for two supervisors for I-225 Rail Line, 20 operators for I-225 Rail
Line, two positions for Commuter Rail.

Debt Service
Interest expense is projected to decline $2.1 million on a combined basis from the Adopted Budget due
to unused debt proceeds from previous debt issues available for use in 2015 on the Base system that
will reduce the amount of planned debt issuance and budgeted interest expense. Principal payments on
debt are projected to decrease $3.5 million for the same reason. Interest expense and principal
payments on FasTracks will remain stable. Capitalized interest is expected to show no change.

Packet Pg. 13

1.B.3

2015 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed amended budget reflects a net increase of $99.4 million over
the 2015 Adopted Budget. These changes result from program changes that have occurred since the
2015 Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
Base System
New capital changes consist of an increase in Base of $12.7 million. Additions to new capital funding
include $3.8 million added for SmartCard stored value card implementation work and $1.9 million added
for thermal printers for buses, and $5.7 million in restoration of funding for the mall shuttles purchase
that was subject of a budget transfer for the SmartCard activity and thermal printers. Other changes
include $1.2 million in Disaster Recovery funds (budget transfer approved by the Board in April 2015).
Please see Attachment B for detail.
FasTracks
New capital changes to FasTracks consist of an increase of $86.8 million. This results from updated
project schedules for the Eagle and I-225 projects that changed the projected expenditures in 2015,
adjustments for grant funding, changes in cost estimates, and corrections to the Adopted Budget.
Additions to new capital funding include $11.9 million for the East Corridor, $6.9 million for the Gold
Line, $63.6 million for the I-225 Rail Line, $3.4 million for Northwest Rail, and $7.0 million for two new
light rail vehicles for I-225. Please see Attachment B for detail and Program Capital attached.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2015 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/14 were used to compute the
estimate of the carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of the adoption of
the annual budget. For the 2015 Amended Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 12/31/14
were used to compute the estimate of the carryforward. This takes into account expenditures that were
made in the last quarter of 2014.
Previously approved capital carryforward is decreased by $315.9 million from the 2015 Adopted Budget
to reflect fourth quarter 2014 actual expenditures, transfers to reclassify certain capital projects as
expense projects, previously approved transfers, completion of projects, and project scope changes.
The Base System portion is a decrease of $67.9 million and the FasTracks decrease is $248.0 million.
Please see Attachment C for detail and Program Capital attached.
Revenue Changes
In the Amended Budget, revenues are projected to increase $16.7 million on a combined basis from the
2015 Adopted Budget.



Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $16.2 million based on the CU-Leeds
School March forecast of 7.1% vs. 5.9% in the Adopted Budget.
Federal grant revenues, including operating grants, capital grants, capital maintenance, FASTER
grants, CMAQ grants, and other grants are projected to remain stable over amounts projected in
the 2015 Adopted Budget. This reflects a decrease of $12.9 million in allocations on the Base
System in capital maintenance, fixed guideway, CMAQ grants, and carryforward grants from the

Packet Pg. 14

1.B.3




2015 Adopted Budget, offset by increases in Bus Facilities funding, FTA Ladders of Opportunity
grants, and certain CDOT grants. FasTracks allocated grants are expected to increase $13.4
million due to increases in CMAQ grants for the Eagle project, STAMPS grants, and FASTER
grants for the US36 project.
Fare revenue is projected to remain flat in the Amended Budget over the Adopted Budget based
on current year actuals run rate.
Other income is projected to remain stable at $11.0 million.

Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance

The Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to increase $3.3 million from the Adopted
Budget to $16.0 million reflecting amended budget increases offset by increases in revenue.
FasTracks Contingency Reserve
The proposed 2015 Amended Budget reflects continued maintenance of the FasTracks Contingency
Reserve at a balance of $30 million. This reserve is appropriated annually, and is used to fund any
changes in the FasTracks schedule that could not be forecast at the time of adoption of the annual
budget. The purpose of this reserve is to allow the District to accommodate minor changes to the
FasTracks schedule without requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from the FasTracks
Future Construction Reserve. The Reserve has been carried at $30 million since 2010 and remains at
that level in both this Amended Budget and the 2015 Adopted Budget.
The FasTracks Construction Reserve at $100 million is split between the Construction Reserve at $60
million and a Start-up Operations Reserve at $40 million. The Start-up Operations Reserve was
established in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation for the years 2015-2016 in order to meet the
1.2x debt service coverage if needed.
Budget Transfers
The proposed 2015 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and further amended on 1/1/93, 5/15/08 and
4/1/10. The policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000
require prior approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2015 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.

Packet Pg. 15

1.B.3

Fund Balance Policy
The proposed 2014 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2015 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and Unrestricted Year-End Fund
balance in the District's working capital. The objective is for the total of these three funds to equal
approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for the Base System and two
months of same for FasTracks. The contributions to the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital
Replacement Fund on the Base System will continue at $3.0 million to each fund in 2015.
Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of principal are treated
as expenditures, and (2) depreciation and gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are
excluded.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Amend the 2015 Budget to reflect the capital project changes and the adjustments to the operating
budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2015 Budget and amend the budget with
revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2015 Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2015 Adopted Budget does
not reflect the capital carryforward adjustments, capital budget adjustments, and material changes to
the operating and administrative budget.

(1) Variance is due to the timing of invoices for diesel, gasoline and parts
(2) Variance is due to the timing of traction power invoices
(3) Variance is due to the timing of payments on Eagle, I-225 and US-36
(4) Variance is primarily due to timing of security and contracted services payments
(5) Variance is due to recording of year-end claims reserve accruals in current year. Those accruals will be adjusted back to 2014.
(6) Variance is primarily due to the timing of IT project invoicing for computer hardware, data processing and software maintenance costs
(7) Variance is due to lower outside processing services for printing and marketing
(8) Variance is due to the temporary coding of purchasing card expenses in this department until coding to the correct departments is recorded
(9) Variance is due to union lump sum final year payment in which long-term employees received a wage adjustment rather than a lump sum. This will be recoded in the Amended Budget.

Board Meeting Date: June 9, 2015

Stored Value is a product that can be purchased by the general public to pay for transit fares on fixed
route buses and rail platforms. Stored Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards encoded with chips.
These cards can be loaded with certain dollar amounts and used much like a debit card. Once the card is
loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar amount on the card is less than the fare
needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card.
We are targeting January 1, 2016 for the Stored Value soft launch go-live which will include:





Stored Value available for purchase at RTD sales outlets only
Changes to the web portal that focus on Customer Care functionality
Changes to the SMT System to accommodate the new fare structure
Day Pass Printers installed and functioning on RTD fixed route buses

There are a considerable number of related efforts underway for the January 1 soft launch of Stored
Value involving several departments within RTD including:









Technology changes
Card distribution and logistics
Merchant arrangements
Training
Marketing campaigns
Updates to the ticket vending machines and platform validators
Changes to financial systems to accommodate fare changes
Other related activities

Until such time we have a sufficiently robust smart card distribution network in place, we anticipate
continuing to sell ten ride ticket books and accepting one ride tickets, and will also continue to issue and
accept paper transfers.
Additional phases of the SMT project will go live by June 30, 2016 including:




Stored value available for purchase at retail outlets
Period passes
Customer facing web portal changes
