B. Recommended Actions

• Authorization to Enter Into Contract with INIT for Purchase of Day Pass
Printers
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee
to enter into a $2,700,000 sole source contract with INIT Innovations in
Transportation, Inc. (INIT) for purchase, integration and installation of
equipment and software necessary to accommodate the sale of day-pass
fare media under the newly adopted fare structure (Contract Number
15DH072). This contract will include integration with the Computer Aided
Dispatch/ Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) system, interface changes
for the new fare structure, parking pass validation and a 3-year extended
warranty.
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the June 16, 2015 Board
meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer, reminded the Directors
that staff is requesting a sole source contract due to the
specifics of the CAD/AVL system and the specific information
that will need to be printed on the Day Pass. She added that
delaying approval would mean a delay in manufacturing and
installation of the printers.
Director Hoy noted that deploying this project will be pretty
complex. He asked the likelihood of staff meeting the January
1st, 2016 if the Directors approved the contract. Eric

Farrington, Information Technology (IT) Program Manager,
replied that he is 85% positive that the deadline will be met.
Director Deadwyler expressed her frustration at the
fragmentation of the process. She wondered why the $1.9
million budget transfer request approved recently by the
Directors could not be bundled up with the current request.
Eric Farrington replied that when staff requested the budget
transfer the contracting portion had not been developed.
Heather Copp clarified that the current recommended action is
for a sole source agreement, not for funding. The budget
transfer was requested ahead of time to ensure availability of
funds when negotiating with the vendor. Dave Genova,
Interim General Manager, reiterated that the current
recommended action is for the approval of the contract.
Director Deadwyler said she was afraid of what staff would
request next month regarding this project. She asked staff to
streamline the process and request all the particulars for one
project at the same time.
Director Archuleta asked what the estimated installation time
for each printer would be and if it would affect services. Eric
Farrington replied that the estimated time is four (4) hours. He
added that installation would be done during off peak hours
without disrupting service.
Director Lasater agreed with Director Deadwyler in that the
request seemed confusing. He wondered if the current
request was on top of the $1.9 million budget transfer.
Heather Copp replied that the $2.7 million outlined in the
recommended action is the amount for all the elements of the
project, including $1.9 million for the actual cost of the
printers. Director Lasater noted that it would be helpful to
clearly note that the $1.9 million was embedded in the $2.7
million contract amount as it is difficult to study such large
amounts of information line by line.
Director Solano asked staff to explain the timeframe as it
seemed confusing. Heather Copp replied that the $1.9 million
budget transfer approved in April was to transfer the amount
from the Certificates of Participation (COPs) from the mall
shuttle to the thermal printers. The mall shuttle line item was
chosen since the procurement for the buses was delayed due
to a lack of vendor. The plan is to ask the Board to issue
additional COPs in July, 2015 in order to replenish the amount

transferred. Director Solano said he had further questions he
would take offline.
Director Anderson asked staff to confirm that the current
recommended action is to issue the contract. The recent
budget transfer was meant to borrow money as the mall
shuttle line item will be refilled when staff comes back to the
Board to issue more COPs. Heather Copp affirmed that was
correct.
Regarding the completion of the project, Committee Vice Chair
Menten asked what factors contributed to the 15% chance of
not completing the project on time. Eric Farrington replied that
the possible factors are timing of manufacturing, delivery, and
installation. He added that he personally has a higher
percentage for completion but would not like to overpromise.
Committee Vice Chair Menten asked if there was anything in
the contract to ensure delivery of product. Eric Farrington
answered that there are no financial penalties; however, the
contractor is very motivated to do a good job so they continue
to have RTD as a reference.

AYES: Anderson, Archuleta, Bagley, Deadwyler, Hoy, James, Lasater,
Menten, Sisk, Solano, Walker
ABSENT:

Committee Vice Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

• Approval of Contract for External Audit Services
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager to execute all
documents necessary to award a contract to RubinBrown, LLP to perform
RTD’s annual external audit services. The contract is awarded for audit
services for calendar years 2015, 2016 and 2017 in the amount of
$333,500. There is an option to extend the contract for two additional one
year periods, at RTD’s discretion, in the amount of $239,500.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the June 16, 2015
Board meeting.
Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer, noted that staff
received five (5) responses from the Request for Proposal
(RFP) process. The evaluation committee recommends
RubinBrown, the current auditors, for calendar years 2015,
2016, and 2017 with the option for an additional two year
extension.
Committee Vice Chair Menten asked staff to elaborate on the
value of auditors having a fresh view versus someone that has
been looking at our system for years. Heather Copp replied
that RubinBrown has a practice of rotating auditors. Staff
feels confident that RubinBrown, as a company, has the
expertise we need to do an objective job.
Committee Vice Chair Menten said she will be voting yes on
the recommended action; however, she emphasized that staff
ask RubinBrown to provide the audit documents electronically
ahead of the presentation in order for the Directors to study
the documents and be prepared for a robust discussion.

• Approval of 2015 Amended Budget
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2015 to amend
and appropriate funds for the proposed 2015 Amended Budget, to increase
the appropriation by $134.670 million to $1,520.186 million as detailed
below in the overview of the 2015 Amended Budget, and to decrease the
appropriation of Capital Carryforward (previously approved capital funds) by
$315.917 million to $987.198 million.
This action item meets policy requirements and the General Manager’s goals
of Fiscal Sustainability/Financial Plan by effecting current budgeting in a
timely manner.
The 2015 Amended Budget appropriation includes the amounts in the
Amended Budget column below (in thousands), which is a summary of
relevant data from Exhibit I.

C. Updates

• 2016-2021 Strategic Budget Plan Update
Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager for Budget and Financial Analysis,
reviewed the 2016-2021 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) presentation included
in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet for June
9, 2015. The presentation included SBP variables, revenue assumptions,
expenditure assumptions, reduced/eliminated/deferred projects, cash flow
summary for Base System Capital and Operations, 2016 sources of funds,
2016 uses of funds, opportunities and challenges, and next steps.
She noted that all projects are measured against RTD’s mission statement in
order to decide which projects will be reduced, eliminated, or deferred.
Using this methodology the gap was reduced from $26 million to $12
million.
Director Lasater asked for clarification on how $14 million was reduced from
the gap. Jannette Scarpino replied that $8.5 million was reduced from
deferred projects, $3.5 million from duplicative projects when compared to
the FasTracks Annual Performance Evaluation, and $2 million in project
reductions.

Chair Sisk thanked Jannette Scarpino for her presentation. He asked when
staff would pull the trigger on the 2016 diesel prices. Dave Genova, Interim
General Manager, replied that there is an ongoing conversation regarding
diesel prices between himself, Procurement, and Finance. He said the team
is advising to wait a little longer to lock the price. Chair Sisk stated that we
currently do not lock regular gas prices. Dave Genova affirmed the
statement saying that the diesel is the main fuel used; regular gas is used on
the RTD vehicle fleet. Chair Sisk asked to see an analysis of regular gas
uses.
Director Anderson asked for the Sources of Other Income making up 8.3%
on the 2016 Base Sources of Funds pie chart included in the presentation.
She asked if the source was advertising. Jannette Scarpino replied that
advertising was part of it. Other sources include rentals, joint ventures,
Intergovernmental Agreements, etc. Director Anderson shared that she was
contacted by a constituent who was offended by one of the advertisements.
She noted that in the overall picture advertisement revenue does not seem
to be a great source, but it would be a significant amount if we had to find
more revenue to fill that gap. She appreciated staff’s work on balancing the
budget.
Director Bagley asked regarding the process for the 2015 projects deferred
to 2016 and if any of them have been deferred from 2016 to 2017.
Jannette Scarpino replied that she did not remember of the top of her head.
Director Bagley said that he would get the details of those projects offline.
Committee Vice Chair Menten asked regarding the Passenger Fares
percentage on the 2016 Base Sources of Funds pie chart included in the
presentation. She wondered if the figure, which is represented at 17.5%,
was adjusted since it is usually in the low 20’s. Jannette Scarpino replied
that the low 20’s figure is based on a different calculation which includes
passenger fares, Sales and Use Tax revenue and grant revenue. The pie
chart in the presentation is total sources not limited to operating revenue,
making the fare revenue a bit smaller.

• April 2015 Monthly Financials
Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer, noted that the Monthly Financial
report includes a new column which shows the actual versus budget
numbers both for the month and year to date. She said that feedback on
the new format is welcomed.
Doug MacLeod, Controller, reviewed the April 2015 Monthly Financial
Status as included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
agenda packet for June 9, 2015. He pointed out that all the items showed
an increase except for ridership and fare revenue within the April 2015
actual versus budget and Year-to-Date 2015 actual versus budget.

Director Anderson noted that it seems ridership is lower due to lower gas
prices. She observed that this seems to be a trend over the years. Doug
MacLeod noted that year to date ridership is up and the lower than budgeted
ridership for 2015 is not a significant drop, indicating it is hard to tell what
drives ridership.
Director Walker pointed out that the report’s new format is very helpful. He
asked staff if it was helpful to them. Doug MacLeod acknowledged that
putting the report together takes a little more work; however, the outcome
of a more user friendly, quick snapshot format is what staff is striving for.
Director Bagley commended staff on the new methodology of the report as
it gives a simple and comprehensive at-a-glance look at what’s going on.
Committee Vice Chair Menten thanked staff for the new version of the
report. She noted that no information was eliminated and that it sounds like
everyone is happy with the improvements.

• Smart Media Technology (SMT) and Day Pass Printer Status
Kim Heldman, Senior Manager for Information Technology, reviewed the
Smart Media Technology (SMT) and Day Pass Printer Status update as
included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet
for June 9, 2015.
She said that the January 1, 2016 Stored Value soft launch will include the
following features:
 Stored Value available for purchase at RTD sales outlets only
 Changes to the web portal that focus on Customer Care functionality
 Changes to the SMT System to accommodate the new fare structure
 Day Pass Printers installed and functioning on RTD fixed route buses
The soft launch involves efforts from several departments within RTD in
order to achieve the following goals:
 Technology changes
 Card distribution and logistics
 Merchant arrangements
 Training
 Marketing campaigns
 Updates to the ticket vending machines and platform validators
 Changes to financial systems to accommodate fare changes
 Other related activities
Additional phases of the SMT project will go live by June 30, 2016
including:
 Stored value available for purchase at retail outlets




Period passes (i.e. monthly passes)
Customer facing web portal changes

Kim Heldman noted that the total project had a budget of $26,440,705.57
with an actual expenditure of $16,873,867.26, leaving a remaining budget
of $9,556,838.31. She noted that the contract with Xerox is for
$21,889,000.53. The amount paid to Xerox so far is $13,892,213.61 with
a remaining budget of $7,996,786.92. She added that Xerox is paid when
milestones in the project are reached.
Kim Heldman mentioned that the following elements of the project have a
green status:
 Stabilization and Enhancement of Current Operating Pass
System(ECO, College, and Neighborhood)
 New Fare Structure
 Card Provisions and Distributions
 Stored Value Public Facing Portal Enhancements
 RTD Retail Point of Sales (RPOS)
 External Hosting
 Cybersecurity
 Friends and Family Proof of Concept Operational Test
 ADA Reviews
She pointed out the following elements having a yellow status:
 Stored Value
 Stored Value Internal Portal/Back-Office Enhancements
 Merchant RPOS
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, introduced Kevin
Boland, Director of Operations for Fare Collection USA for Xerox
Transportation Solutions, and Jenn Masak, Denver based Project Manager
for Transportation, Central and Local Government for Xerox Transportation
Solutions.
Bruce Abel addressed the question posed at past meetings of a fallback plan
if Stored Value is not available on January 1st. He stated that part of the
implementation strategy and not so much as fallback is to still have available
the 10 ride ticket books and paper transfers during the soft launch and until
a robust network is in place for customers. He added that the printers are
critical in order to implement the Day Pass.
Director Archuleta asked what the sale price will be for the Stored Value
card. Bruce Abel replied that initially it will be free of charge to help people
shift from paper and cash media. Staff anticipates charging for the card
later as an incentive to reuse and reload the card. Currently there is no
recommendation on how long the free period would last. He added that the

card itself costs about a dollar to manufacture. Director Archuleta asked if
retailers would receive a percentage of the card sales. Bruce Abel replied
that staff is currently involved in that conversation.
Chair Sisk thanked staff for the progress made on the SmartCard project.
He shared how perplexed he is at how long the project has taken since
SmartCards are not a new product on the market. He mentioned that during
his time in London he used the Oyster Travelcard very effectively. He added
that RTD needs to have such technology available soon. Bruce Abel noted
that staff has been very deliberate in rolling out the Stored Value card. He
said that RTD went live with the current operating pass system on January
1, 2013. The system was not prepared to deal with the annual renewals
due to volume and capacity constraints. Staff wanted to address the
capacity issue before moving forward in order to get it right when
interfacing with tens of thousands of customers.
Director Lasater referred to the elements of Stored Value and Stored Value
Internal Portal/Back-Office Enhancements, both with a yellow status, in part
due to potential timing of availability of Xerox personnel. He said that he
found it highly substandard that Xerox personnel would not be available due
to European’s vacation schedules. He finds it atrocious that an organization
the size of Xerox does not build personnel vacations into their programming
schedule. He added that in his personal business he deals internationally
writing technology, and his company is more responsive to customers.
Bruce Abel noted that RTD staff factors personnel availability into the work
as a large amount of personnel is based in France and follows the local
vacation custom. He added that this factor does not have a long term
impact on the project. Director Lasater said that it does have a long term
impact on the project because a majority of the personnel is not available for
a month. Kevin Boland affirmed that the majority of Xerox’s personnel
based in France takes the month of August off. Xerox has been proactive in
moving jobs to other countries in order to account for that. Director Lasater
asked how long Xerox has had this contract. Bruce Abel replied that RTD
has been working with Xerox on this project since mid-2010. Director
Lasater wondered if the project would be closer to completion if the
personnel gap would have been addressed earlier. Bruce Abel answered that
he did not think so due to the capacity constraints encountered. Director
Lasater asked if the capacity constraint was a flaw on Xerox’s part or RTD’s
part. Bruce Abel replied that the relationship with Xerox is a partnership
thus the responsibility is shared. Director Lasater found it hard to believe
Xerox did not anticipate the capacity constraint since they have experience
with Stored Value cards.
Director Hoy encouraged staff to be selective of whom the friends and
family are for the proof of concept operational test. He noted that they

could serve as ambassadors for the program if they have a positive
experience.
Director Walker thanked staff for continuing the 10-ride ticket books and
paper transfers during the transition period. He noted that people like
options and suspects that most will gravitate towards the new media. He
added that having both available makes him feel better about the transition.
Director Anderson thanked staff for ensuring that every customer that will
interface with the SmartCard will be taken care of by working on the volume
capacity. She asked staff to provide the potential volume projections at a
later date.
Committee Vice Chair Menten noted that merchants, such as King Soopers,
will receive a financial hit on the credit card processing fee for Stored Value
Card transactions. She wondered if processing fees posed a challenge when
working with smaller selling outlets. Kim Heldman replied that staff is in the
process of discussing compensation for absorbing the processing fee costs.
Heather Copp added that King Soopers would not disclose what the
processing fee is. Staff can estimate it to be between 1%-4%.
Committee Vice Chair Menten wondered about Xerox experience with ADA
compliance and how the variations between countries would affect that
process. Bruce Abel replied that Xerox will have to meet RTD’s ADA
standards. Committee Vice Chair Menten wondered how a sight impaired
person would be able to distinguish the SmartCard from other cards. Bruce
Abel said he did not know how they would be able to do so. Committee
Vice Chair Menten thanked staff for meeting with her earlier to answer her
other questions about the SmartCard project.
Director Solano asked what the process would be to recover the value
stored in a lost card. Kim Heldman replied that the fully functional web
portal would allow for customers to register their card in order for cards and
values to be reissued. Director Solano wondered if the process to reissue a
Stored Value card would be similar to reissuing a credit card. Kim Heldman
said that was correct.

Search public feedback form is available through the RTD website.
