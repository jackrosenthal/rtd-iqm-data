Per the federal regulations codified as 49 CFR Part 26, as a condition for receiving and accepting planning,
capital and/or operating assistance from FTA in a federal fiscal year that exceeds $250,000, RTD is required to

objectives and responsibilities for its implementation. On September 20, 2019 a current RTD DBE Program
Policy Statement was emailed to all RTD Board members.
