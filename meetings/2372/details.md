#### 1. 2016 FasTracks Public Information Consultant Contract Award

It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO to approve the fourth one-year option to the Virtegic Group, Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period of performance through 2016, the final year of the contract. The scope of work is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment is for an amount not to exceed $745,411.52 for the year 2016. Funds for the award are contained in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.

Motion:              Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, explained that this is the continuation of a contract that augments the RTD public information staff through Virtegic.  He noted that with five corridors opening up it is essential this contract is extended so there is enough staffing.

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, expressed that RTD has had good service from Virtegic in the past and gone through a lot of learning together.  He noted that with all five openings it is critical for RTD to have the Virtegic team in place, especially since they are familiar with RTD’s process, services, etc.  He stated that the Board has been very clear in the expectations of communications, public outreach, etc. as part of the openings and Virtegic will be a key element to those efforts.

Scott Reed said that RTD began working with Virtegic when a Request for Proposals were issued in 2011.  He explained that the incumbent contractor at the time submitted a bid that was almost double the price of Virtegic.  He commented that staff loved working with the previous contractor but, given the procurement process and that RTD is a public agency, Virtegic was awarded the contract.  He stated that staff has not been sorry of the decision to work with Virtegic.  He pointed out that Virtegic has been great working with other departments within RTD, which is so important since the openings will be a team effort.  He reiterated that staff has been very pleased with Virtegic’s work but recognized that there are some Board members who have a different opinion.  He stated that Virtegic has delivered what has been expected of them and provides a great value to RTD.

Scott Reed noted that this will be the final year that staff requests the extension of the Virtegic contract as the FasTracks projects are winding down.

Director Tobiassen thanked Virtegic for their support over the past several years on the I-225 Line.  They have, in his opinion, gone above and beyond by working nights, weekends, short notice, etc. to try and keep the public informed.  He feels they are very responsive and professional.  He stated that with 2016 coming RTD needs all hands on deck to make our openings successful.  Director Tobiassen looks forward to working with RTD staff and Virtegic as one team.  He stated he will be voting for this recommendation.

Director Francone noted an increase of approximately $59K from 2015 to 2016.  She asked for further information as to what this increase would cover.  Scott Reed explained that one of the elements embedded in the contract is an option to add additional resources.  He said this contract is negotiated annually to ensure the proper resources are allocated.  With all of the openings in 2016 Scott Reed said that two additionall people would be added through Virtegic to work with RTD.

Director Francone stated that her inclination is to vote no.  She said her short experience with Virtegic has been one of inconsistent quality.  There have been some wildly successful, beautifully managed events and some not so good events.  Scott Reed noted that he and Director Francone did have a discussion about her concerns offline.  He appreciates her candor and the discussion they had.  He acknowledged that there is a shared responsibility in making sure the Virtegic team is headed in the proper direction and takes responsibility for any time they might have been directed the wrong way.

Director Deadwyler thanked Scott Reed for the beautiful statement of support for Virtegic; however, she does not feel that way.  She expressed that often Directors hear about events, meetings, etc. at the last minute.  She stated that, contrary to what Scott Reed said about them working well with other departments, she has heard Virtegic is a detriment.  She thinks that many of the people brought on by Virtegic have no clue about what we do at RTD.  She does not feel the expertise that RTD was seeking is there.  Director Deadwyler believes Virtegic is just a pair of hands and not doing the work they were hired for.  She does not like the idea that Virtegic will be getting a $60K increase.  She said she does not think RTD needs Virtegic just because of the openings.  Director Deadwyler stated that our marketing department does a great job and that RTD staff does a better job than what she has seen from Virtegic.  Scott Reed reiterated that while there is a contract increase of $59K it is because Virtegic will be providing two additional employees.

Director Lubow shared that she would also be voting no, which she finds extremely difficult because she does like the people she has worked with from Virtegic; however, she is not voting no due to the quality of Virtegic’s work.  She noted that the contract keeps going up at a time when RTD has raised fares for people who cannot afford to pay more.  She commented that she has been asking herself what RTD can do.  She said that the Board is always told that RTD can either raise fares or lower service but Director Lubow thinks there is a third way.  That third way is the possibility of really tightening RTD’s belt and finding additional funding.  She thinks that increasing the contract for Virtegic while many Board members are expressing concerns with the work being done sends the wrong message to the community.

Director Anderson stated that she will be supporting this recommendation.  She stressed that with five new lines opening the RTD staff is going to be extremely busy.  She feels $59K for two extra people is reasonable and is really a drop in the bucket for helping with fares.

Director Walker expressed that he too would be supporting the recommendation.  He said his experience with Virtegic has been great.  He cannot tell who is RTD staff and who is an augmentation when working with public information.  Director Walker has not heard anything negative about their work from staff.  He stated that there is no way he can support putting RTD’s staff in that kind of bind with five new lines opening.

Chair Sisk said he supports this recommendation with great vigor.  He thinks Virtegic has intertwined themselves very well with the RTD staff.  He shared that he has been spoiled with first class treatment from Virtegic.  He asked the Board to keep in mind that RTD wants to do a first class opening for our five lines.

Director Solano said he too would be supporting the recommendation.  He thinks Virtegic has done extraordinary work.  He shared that every time he has an event to attend or a speaking presentation they provide him with all the information he needs.  He also sees them at many community events.

Director Folska expressed she has similar concerns as those of Director Francone that Virtegic’s work is inconsistent, at best.  She said she is glad to know there are Board members that have had flawless experiences but she has been consistently disappointed.  She shared that last year she was provided incorrect information for her telephone town hall and this year she received her information very late.  Additionally, the night of her town hall she was approached by a new Virtegic employee who asked Director Folska to be patient because the employee said they did not know anything about RTD.

Director Folska stated that when RTD pays $745K for an expert contractor she expects those employees to be on their game.  She really feels, in light of Director Lubow’s comments that it is time for RTD to tighten our belt, that this contract is irresponsible.  She recognized that the opening of five new lines is a huge undertaken but noted that three are being opened by Denver Transit Operators, so RTD is not alone.  Director Folska shared that she specifically reached out to RTD staff because she did not want to put them in an untenable position and the response she received was that Virtegic was not necessary.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED.

#### 2. Approval of Contract Amendment to Jacobs Engineering for FasTracks Program Support Consulting Services

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO to approve a contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in an amount not to exceed $22,579,180, for Program Support Services Consulting for FasTracks through June 30, 2017.  Funding in the amount of $16,934,180 for the 2016 work program is included in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.  Funding for the balance of the contract through June 30, 2017 is included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation for 2017, and will be appropriated in the specific projects in the 2017 capital budget.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Folska asked for clarification as to why the Board was being asked to approve the contract through 2017 but there was only funding for the contract through 2016.  Committee Chair Hoy explained that the contract amount for 2016 had been included in the 2016 Requested Budget.  He said that the funds for 2017 are included in the Annual Program Evaluation but noted that the 2017 Requested Budget has not yet been created.

Henry Stopplecamp noted that this is the end of a 12 year contract.  He said that staff was hoping to receive Board authorization for the contract through mid-2017 so they did not have to come back to the Board for approval of a very short term extension.  He explained that RTD only pays for services provided so often the total dollar value is under the not-to-exceed value.

Henry Stopplecamp stated that as far as the work done by Jacobs they really function as an extension of RTD staff.  He said it is very difficult to tell who is a Jacobs’ employee and who works directly for RTD.  He recognized that a good portion of the FasTracks staff are consultants that have integrated within RTD staff over the years.  He shared that the goal is to ramp down the contractors over the next several years as the corridors wrap up construction.

Committee Chair Hoy asked if his understanding is correct that the idea behind this contract is that when the work is done the contractors will go away.  He noted that it is hard to get rid of someone that is hired as a full-time RTD employee.  He thinks this is a simple way to reduce the workforce efficiently.  Henry Stopplecamp stated that was correct.  He explained that Jacobs had people with specialized areas of expertise that RTD could not bring in-house on a full time basis as many of these people are needed only part-time.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED.

#### 3. Approval of 2016 – 2017 Contract Amendment to Delcan for FasTracks Quality Management Consultant Services

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO to approve the 2016 – 2017 Contract Amendment for Delcan in the amount of $2,669,575 for FasTracks Quality Management Consulting Services. The term of this Contract Amendment covers the period of January 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017 when the Contract ends. The cost breakdown for 2016 and 2017 are $1,662,900 and $1,006,675 respectively. Funds for the amendment are contained in the 2016 RTD FasTracks Budget.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Kevin Diviness, Director of Quality Assurance, noted that one subtle difference between this contract and the Jacobs contract is that for this contract the funding for both 2016 and 2017 are included in the 2016 Requested Budget.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED.

#### 4. Station Names for Eagle P3 Project

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors accept and approve the proposed station name for the Eagle P3 Project “Gateway Station” as follows.

East Corridor:

61st & Peña

Prior to the Board having the opportunity to move the recommended action made by staff, Committee Chair Hoy made a motion to approve a substitute main motion.  He explained that the goal of his substitute motion was to keep this station name in conjunction with our typical naming convention, as outlined by RTD’s Station Naming Policy.

Motion to

Approve

Substitute

Main

Motion:              Committee Chair Hoy made the substitute main motion to read as follows:

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors accept and approve the proposed station name for the Eagle P2 Project “Gateway Station” as follows:

East Corridor:

Pena at 61st

Chair Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Bagley asked Interim General Manager Genova’s insights as to what staff thinks about this substitute main motion.  Interim General Manager Genova commented that the City of Denver preferred to have the station name be just Pena; however, he said he too noticed that this station name did not follow policy when presented to him by staff.  He thinks the change is appropriate and said that staff supports it.

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, suggested a slight modification.  He pointed out that other stations along the corridor have an ampersand rather than at.  He suggested the name read: Pena & 61st.  Committee Chair Hoy and Chair Sisk agreed with the recommendation.

Committee Chair Hoy explained that the real reason to include a cross street is that Pena Boulevard and the rail tracks run parallel for about five miles.

Director Deadwyler expressed her support of the substitute main motion.  She thinks a lot of people from Commerce City will use the station and it will be helpful for them to know the intersection.

Director Walker asked if he was correct that the substitute main motion was to have Pena listed first and then the street that included a number.  He commented that other stations in the system have the numbered street first.  He asked if it would be possible to switch the order.  Committee Chair Hoy explained that the order he proposed is more acceptable to the City of Denver.  He said the information he received from staff was that there was no policy outlining what cross street needed to come first.

Director Bagley called for the question.  Director Folska had wanted to speak but Director Hoy called for the vote.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the substitute main motion PASSED.

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors accept and approve the proposed station name for the Eagle P3 Project “Gateway Station” as follows.

East Corridor:

61st & Peña

### C. Other Matters

Director Folska said she wanted to explain her no vote related to the naming of the station at Pena Boulevard and 61st Avenue.  She explained that what Director Walker mentioned was about being consistent with standards that have been set-up with planning design and wayfinding in mind.  She shared that one of the problems that really dogs people with disabilities is random inconsistency at the whim of an individual, city, municipality, etc.  She thinks it is a tragic mistake that the name was approved this evening as Pena & 61st.  She recognized that this might not be a big deal to those who can see but it is a very big deal when you are blind and trying to find your way around.

Scott Reed introduced the newest member of the communications department, Nate Currey, who will be assuming the role of Senior Manager of Public Information and Public Relations.  He said that Nate come to RTD from DRCOG.  He shared that Nate worked with the communications department previously during the Stand Up for Transportation Day and they were blown away by his efforts.  Scott Reed stated that Nate brings a wealth of knowledge and collaborative spirit that will be a great asset to the department.

Henry Stopplecamp noted that there had been some concern from the Board about the Sable and Alameda closure being resolved before Thanksgiving.  He said he was happy to report that if all works out well, Sable and Alameda will be open this Thursday.  He stated that as soon as it is confirmed staff will issue a press release.

### E. Adjourn

Committee Chair Hoy adjourned the meeting at 6:12 p.m.
