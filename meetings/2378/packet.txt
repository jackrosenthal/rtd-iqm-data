• 2016 FasTracks Public Information Consultant Contract Award
It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO to
approve the fourth one-year option to the Virtegic Group, Incorporated as
the FasTracks Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach
Consultant, extending the period of performance through 2016, the final
year of the contract. The scope of work is negotiated annually between RTD
and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD Board
of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment is for an
amount not to exceed $745,411.52 for the year 2016. Funds for the
award are contained in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks
program.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager for
Capital Programs, explained that this is the continuation of a
contract that augments the RTD public information staff
through Virtegic. He noted that with five corridors opening up
it is essential this contract is extended so there is enough
staffing.

Scott Reed said that RTD began working with Virtegic when a
Request for Proposals were issued in 2011. He explained that
the incumbent contractor at the time submitted a bid that was
almost double the price of Virtegic. He commented that staff
loved working with the previous contractor but, given the
procurement process and that RTD is a public agency, Virtegic
was awarded the contract. He stated that staff has not been
sorry of the decision to work with Virtegic. He pointed out
that Virtegic has been great working with other departments
within RTD, which is so important since the openings will be a
team effort. He reiterated that staff has been very pleased
with Virtegic’s work but recognized that there are some Board
members who have a different opinion. He stated that
Virtegic has delivered what has been expected of them and
provides a great value to RTD.
Scott Reed noted that this will be the final year that staff
requests the extension of the Virtegic contract as the
FasTracks projects are winding down.
Director Tobiassen thanked Virtegic for their support over the
past several years on the I-225 Line. They have, in his
opinion, gone above and beyond by working nights,
weekends, short notice, etc. to try and keep the public
informed. He feels they are very responsive and professional.
He stated that with 2016 coming RTD needs all hands on deck
to make our openings successful. Director Tobiassen looks
forward to working with RTD staff and Virtegic as one team.
He stated he will be voting for this recommendation.
Director Francone noted an increase of approximately $59K
from 2015 to 2016. She asked for further information as to
what this increase would cover. Scott Reed explained that
one of the elements embedded in the contract is an option to
add additional resources. He said this contract is negotiated

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 3, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications,
expressed that RTD has had good service from Virtegic in the
past and gone through a lot of learning together. He noted
that with all five openings it is critical for RTD to have the
Virtegic team in place, especially since they are familiar with
RTD’s process, services, etc. He stated that the Board has
been very clear in the expectations of communications, public
outreach, etc. as part of the openings and Virtegic will be a
key element to those efforts.

6.A

Director Francone stated that her inclination is to vote no.
She said her short experience with Virtegic has been one of
inconsistent quality. There have been some wildly successful,
beautifully managed events and some not so good events.
Scott Reed noted that he and Director Francone did have a
discussion about her concerns offline. He appreciates her
candor and the discussion they had. He acknowledged that
there is a shared responsibility in making sure the Virtegic
team is headed in the proper direction and takes responsibility
for any time they might have been directed the wrong way.
Director Deadwyler thanked Scott Reed for the beautiful
statement of support for Virtegic; however, she does not feel
that way. She expressed that often Directors hear about
events, meetings, etc. at the last minute. She stated that,
contrary to what Scott Reed said about them working well
with other departments, she has heard Virtegic is a detriment.
She thinks that many of the people brought on by Virtegic
have no clue about what we do at RTD. She does not feel the
expertise that RTD was seeking is there. Director Deadwyler
believes Virtegic is just a pair of hands and not doing the work
they were hired for. She does not like the idea that Virtegic
will be getting a $60K increase. She said she does not think
RTD needs Virtegic just because of the openings. Director
Deadwyler stated that our marketing department does a great
job and that RTD staff does a better job than what she has
seen from Virtegic. Scott Reed reiterated that while there is a
contract increase of $59K it is because Virtegic will be
providing two additional employees.
Director Lubow shared that she would also be voting no,
which she finds extremely difficult because she does like the
people she has worked with from Virtegic; however, she is not
voting no due to the quality of Virtegic’s work. She noted
that the contract keeps going up at a time when RTD has
raised fares for people who cannot afford to pay more. She
commented that she has been asking herself what RTD can
do. She said that the Board is always told that RTD can either
raise fares or lower service but Director Lubow thinks there is
a third way. That third way is the possibility of really
tightening RTD’s belt and finding additional funding. She

annually to ensure the proper resources are allocated. With all
of the openings in 2016 Scott Reed said that two additionall
people would be added through Virtegic to work with RTD.

6.A

thinks that increasing the contract for Virtegic while many
Board members are expressing concerns with the work being
done sends the wrong message to the community.

Director Walker expressed that he too would be supporting the
recommendation. He said his experience with Virtegic has
been great. He cannot tell who is RTD staff and who is an
augmentation when working with public information. Director
Walker has not heard anything negative about their work from
staff. He stated that there is no way he can support putting
RTD’s staff in that kind of bind with five new lines opening.
Chair Sisk said he supports this recommendation with great
vigor. He thinks Virtegic has intertwined themselves very well
with the RTD staff. He shared that he has been spoiled with
first class treatment from Virtegic. He asked the Board to
keep in mind that RTD wants to do a first class opening for
our five lines.
Director Solano said he too would be supporting the
recommendation. He thinks Virtegic has done extraordinary
work. He shared that every time he has an event to attend or
a speaking presentation they provide him with all the
information he needs. He also sees them at many community
events.
Director Folska expressed she has similar concerns as those of
Director Francone that Virtegic’s work is inconsistent, at best.
She said she is glad to know there are Board members that
have had flawless experiences but she has been consistently
disappointed. She shared that last year she was provided
incorrect information for her telephone town hall and this year
she received her information very late. Additionally, the night
of her town hall she was approached by a new Virtegic
employee who asked Director Folska to be patient because the
employee said they did not know anything about RTD.
Director Folska stated that when RTD pays $745K for an
expert contractor she expects those employees to be on their

Director Anderson stated that she will be supporting this
recommendation. She stressed that with five new lines
opening the RTD staff is going to be extremely busy. She
feels $59K for two extra people is reasonable and is really a
drop in the bucket for helping with fares.

• Approval of Contract Amendment to Jacobs Engineering for FasTracks
Program Support Consulting Services
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract
amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in an amount not to exceed
$22,579,180, for Program Support Services Consulting for FasTracks
through June 30, 2017. Funding in the amount of $16,934,180 for the
2016 work program is included in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the
FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where PSC support
would be utilized. Funding for the balance of the contract through June
30, 2017 is included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation for 2017,
and will be appropriated in the specific projects in the 2017 capital
budget.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Folska asked for clarification as to why the Board was
being asked to approve the contract through 2017 but there
was only funding for the contract through 2016. Committee
Chair Hoy explained that the contract amount for 2016 had
been included in the 2016 Requested Budget. He said that the
funds for 2017 are included in the Annual Program Evaluation

game. She really feels, in light of Director Lubow’s comments
that it is time for RTD to tighten our belt, that this contract is
irresponsible. She recognized that the opening of five new
lines is a huge undertaken but noted that three are being
opened by Denver Transit Operators, so RTD is not alone.
Director Folska shared that she specifically reached out to RTD
staff because she did not want to put them in an untenable
position and the response she received was that Virtegic was
not necessary.

but noted that the 2017 Requested Budget has not yet been
created.

Henry Stopplecamp stated that as far as the work done by
Jacobs they really function as an extension of RTD staff. He
said it is very difficult to tell who is a Jacobs’ employee and
who works directly for RTD. He recognized that a good
portion of the FasTracks staff are consultants that have
integrated within RTD staff over the years. He shared that the
goal is to ramp down the contractors over the next several
years as the corridors wrap up construction.
Committee Chair Hoy asked if his understanding is correct that
the idea behind this contract is that when the work is done the
contractors will go away. He noted that it is hard to get rid of
someone that is hired as a full-time RTD employee. He thinks
this is a simple way to reduce the workforce efficiently. Henry
Stopplecamp stated that was correct. He explained that
Jacobs had people with specialized areas of expertise that
RTD could not bring in-house on a full time basis as many of
these people are needed only part-time.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 3, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Henry Stopplecamp noted that this is the end of a 12 year
contract. He said that staff was hoping to receive Board
authorization for the contract through mid-2017 so they did
not have to come back to the Board for approval of a very
short term extension. He explained that RTD only pays for
services provided so often the total dollar value is under the
not-to-exceed value.

FasTracks Quality Management Consulting Services. The term of this
Contract Amendment covers the period of January 1, 2016 through July 31,
2017 when the Contract ends. The cost breakdown for 2016 and 2017 are
$1,662,900 and $1,006,675 respectively. Funds for the amendment are
contained in the 2016 RTD FasTracks Budget.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015
Board meeting.

Discussion:

Kevin Diviness, Director of Quality Assurance, noted that one
subtle difference between this contract and the Jacobs
contract is that for this contract the funding for both 2016
and 2017 are included in the 2016 Requested Budget.

• Station Names for Eagle P3 Project
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors accept and approve the proposed station name for the Eagle P3
Project “Gateway Station” as follows.
East Corridor:
Peña & 61st
Prior to the Board having the opportunity to move the recommended action
made by staff, Committee Chair Hoy made a motion to approve a substitute
main motion. He explained that the goal of his substitute motion was to
keep this station name in conjunction with our typical naming convention, as
outlined by RTD’s Station Naming Policy.

Motion to
Approve
Substitute
Main
Motion:

Committee Chair Hoy made the substitute main
motion to read as follows:

East Corridor:
Pena at 61st
Chair Sisk seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Director Bagley asked Interim General Manager Genova’s
insights as to what staff thinks about this substitute main
motion. Interim General Manager Genova commented that the
City of Denver preferred to have the station name be just
Pena; however, he said he too noticed that this station name
did not follow policy when presented to him by staff. He
thinks the change is appropriate and said that staff supports it.
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning,
suggested a slight modification. He pointed out that other
stations along the corridor have an ampersand rather than at.
He suggested the name read: Pena & 61st. Committee Chair
Hoy and Chair Sisk agreed with the recommendation.
Committee Chair Hoy explained that the real reason to include
a cross street is that Pena Boulevard and the rail tracks run
parallel for about five miles.
Director Deadwyler expressed her support of the substitute
main motion. She thinks a lot of people from Commerce City
will use the station and it will be helpful for them to know the
intersection.
Director Walker asked if he was correct that the substitute
main motion was to have Pena listed first and then the street
that included a number. He commented that other stations in
the system have the numbered street first. He asked if it
would be possible to switch the order. Committee Chair Hoy

C. Other Matters
Director Folska said she wanted to explain her no vote related to the naming of the
station at Pena Boulevard and 61st Avenue. She explained that what Director
Walker mentioned was about being consistent with standards that have been set-up
with planning design and wayfinding in mind. She shared that one of the problems
that really dogs people with disabilities is random inconsistency at the whim of an
individual, city, municipality, etc. She thinks it is a tragic mistake that the name
was approved this evening as Pena & 61st. She recognized that this might not be a
big deal to those who can see but it is a very big deal when you are blind and trying
to find your way around.
Scott Reed introduced the newest member of the communications department,
Nate Currey, who will be assuming the role of Senior Manager of Public Information
and Public Relations. He said that Nate come to RTD from DRCOG. He shared that
Nate worked with the communications department previously during the Stand Up
for Transportation Day and they were blown away by his efforts. Scott Reed
stated that Nate brings a wealth of knowledge and collaborative spirit that will be a
great asset to the department.
Henry Stopplecamp noted that there had been some concern from the Board about
the Sable and Alameda closure being resolved before Thanksgiving. He said he was
happy to report that if all works out well, Sable and Alameda will be open this
Thursday. He stated that as soon as it is confirmed staff will issue a press release.

B. Recommended Actions

• Local Government Liaison Services
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board
of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to enter
into an agreement for Local Government Liaison services with CRL
Associates, Inc. (CRL) to exercise the fourth option year (January 1, 2016
through December 31, 2016) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a cost
of $122,496. Funding for this contract is included in the annual FasTracks
budget.
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the November 17, 2015 Board
meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Roger Sherman from CRL Associates noted that Committee
Chair Folska and Director Francone requested he sent to the
Directors a summary of CRL Associates’ work on behalf of
RTD. A copy of the document is available at the Board Office.
He acknowledged that Maria Garcia Berry, Chief Executive
Officer for CRL Associates, was in attendance at the meeting

• Local Government Update - CRL Associates
Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, thanked the Directors for the vote of
confidence in moving to the full Board unanimously the renewal of the local
government liaison services contract.
He noted that the municipal elections results would start to be tallied that
evening. He added that he would be happy to make any contacts with
newly elected officials, set up meetings, write congratulatory letters, and
any other outreach the Directors may want.
Roger Sherman pointed out that the Metro Area County Commissioners
(MACC) meeting was held on Friday, October 30th. The agenda included a
discussion on transportation value capture and tax increment financing for
transportation. Unfortunately this item was eclipsed by a discussion on
hospital fees, pushing the transportation discussion until January, 2016.
He added that CRL Associates has been working with the Citizen’s Advisory
Committee. The committee will present to the Directors a draft
recommendation on the direction they would like to see the committee take
as the FasTracks projects wind down. Roger Sherman does not anticipate
any red flags on their proposal.

• State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs
Jenifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry~McKenna, noted that during the last
Transportation Legislative Review Committee (TLRC) meeting Bill Van Meter,
Assistant General Manager for Planning, and Lacy Bell, Manger for Planning
Projects, presented an update on the fares. Director Francone was in
attendance. She pointed out that the TLRC is composed by many of metro
area mayors who were very interested in the presentation. Jenifer
Brandeberry said that the TLRC presented 5 bills, none of which have any
direct impact on RTD.
She informed the Directors that Governor Hickenlooper will present his
budget to the Joint Budget Committee (JBC) next week. Jenifer

Brandeberry noted that it is a weird time in Colorado because the revenue is
doing well yet there are some constitutional restraints as to how funds are
used. These restraints guarantee that a lot of energy from the Congressional
session will be spent on the budget. She added that the exact outcome of
the budget will be known in March, 2016.

Jennifer Brandeberry thanked the staff and Board who were present during
the Legislative Audit Committee performance audit of RTD’s Bus and Light
Rail Train Operator Safety Practices.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Mike Dino from Squire Patton Boggs noted that the House of
Representatives had chosen a new Speaker.
He added that the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee
marked up its multi-year reauthorization legislation on October 22nd. The
House voted to extend the surface transportation programs for 3 weeks until
November 20th. The extension included a 3 year delay in the deadline for
Positive Train Control (PTC) implementation. Mike Dino noted that the
House pushed 29 amendments on the transportation authorization bill in
order to send it to the Senate by Thursday, November 5th, and have
something before the President by Thanksgiving. This meant pushing the
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) amendment until later. Mike Dino pointed out that
the BRT amendment may not happen as it is not lining up politically. He
noted that Squire Patton Boggs will keep the Board updated on any changes.
Committee Chair Folska asked how RTD was looking in order to receive the
$92 million Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA). Mike Dino replied that
RTD seems to be in a good place. He noted that both Congressman Shuster
and Congressman Defazio do not intend to undermine Transit, New Starts,
or Small Starts.
Director Lubow asked if there has been any movement redefining BRT. Mike
Dino replied that not at this time.
Committee Chair Folska reminded the Directors that Squire Patton Boggs will
present their annual report during the December 1st Government Relations
Committee meeting.

B. Updates

• Draft Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of Excess Property
Kate Iverson, Manager for Transit Oriented Development (TOD), reminded
the Directors that staff presented a general outline in June and further
details in August. The plan is to present the full draft today, reach out to
the Board members individually in the next few weeks, and come back to
the Board with a recommended action in December.
She explained that the Draft Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of
Excess Property included in the Planning and Development Committee
agenda packet for November 3, 2015 does not address acquisition or
management of property. The policy is meant to provide clarity and
transparency by outlining the purpose, definition, and process for disposing
of excess property.
She highlighted item III.3., which details that the policy does not preclude
the GM from seeking a separate delegation of authority from the Board for
specific projects or circumstances and does not modify any prior delegations
by the Board. She added that the GM/CEO shall provide an annual report to
the Board as well as following Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
requirements for properties with a federal interest.
Committee Chair James suggested to change the wording under III.3.a.i.,
which reads, “all access and utility easements across and benefitting RTD
property,” to “all access and utility easements encumbering and benefitting
RTD property.”

Director Bagley said he would be interested in knowing which RTD
properties have a federal interest. Kate Iverson replied that RTD properties
with federal interest are any property purchased with financial FTA
assistance. She mentioned that a vast majority of RTD property is
purchased with FTA assistance even if the project as a whole is not a
recipient of FTA funding. Director Bagley asked if he should direct his
questions on how the Southwest rail expansion property was purchased to
the TOD staff as he is not sure how the properties were purchased. Marla
Lien answered that yes, that would be the appropriate department to receive
those types of questions. Kate Iverson added that the TOD department
would then work internally with other departments to formalize an answer.
Susan Altes, Senior Manager for Property, added that federal interest does
not depend just on how the property was acquired, but also on the use of
federal funding for construction and any improvements. Director Bagley
noted there have been no improvements on the Southwest extension
properties. Susan Altes replied that grading is an improvement. Committee
Chair James requested that any similar questions be taken offline.

• Draft Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property
Kate Iverson, Manager for Transit Oriented Development, reminded the
Directors that just like the Draft Policy for Joint Development and
Disposition of Excess Property, the Draft for Unsolicited Proposal Policy for
Real property was presented to the Directors as a general outline in June
and further details in August. The plan is to present the full draft today,
reach out to the Board members individually in the next few weeks, and
come back to the Board with a recommended action in December. She
added that no changes have been made since the August update.
Kate Iverson referred the Directors to the Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real
Property flowchart as included in Exhibit A of the Planning and Development
Committee agenda packet for November 3, 2015. She explained that the
flowchart outlines the process on how to evaluate the best interest of the
District when reviewing an unsolicited proposal.
Director Francone pointed out a correction that needed to be made under
Notice of Receipt of Joint Development Proposal. She noted that the
section being referred to is Section III.B.3 and not III.B.4.
Packet Pg. 27

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 3, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow had a question under the Delegation of Authority section.
She wondered if any of these things could blow up to a larger magnitude
before the Board needing to be notified or if the situations described are so
de minimis that no one would really care. Marla Lien, General Counsel,
replied that staff really tries to be de minimis with the items under this
category. She noted that the Board has already given the General Manager
authority for similar contracts and even more authority for properties that are
part of projects.

Chair Sisk stressed the need for transparency when dealing with unsolicited
proposals. He would like to make it clear that RTD does not have any inside
deals. He added that unsolicited proposals give him heart burn as it
concerns him that someone would have information that the general public
would not have. He said that he does not think that the current draft
outlines steps RTD will take to dispose of property. Kate Iverson
appreciated Chair Sisk’s remarks. She explained that the intent of the policy
is to make the circumstances for sole source very narrow. She noted that
staff has reached out to the development community asking where to post
sale opportunities. The general reply is the Colorado Real Estate Journal.
Chair Sisk added that he would like RTD to cast as wide a net as possible.
Kate Iverson added that staff will post a notice with adequate periods of
time as to provide opportunities for responses.
Committee Chair James said that he appreciates Chair Sisk’s transparency
concerns. He wondered if the policy could include an obligation to maintain
RTD’s list of real property, updating it to also contain the status of each
property, and make it public. Kate Iverson replied that this idea would
require more thought as the Federal Transit Agency (FTA) requires that a list
be kept of excess federally funded property but joint development is
complex. Committee Chair James invited staff to think this through in the
context of Chair Sisk’s remarks.
Director Lubow echoed Chair Sisk’s concerns. She added that she likes
transparency and competition as much as possible. She asked if her
understanding of III.B.3.a. was correct in that RTD could have direct
negotiations with a proposer if they own land contiguous to an RTD
property. Kate Iverson explained that the intent of this section is to maintain
the ability to negotiate, for example, a small remnant property that is not
valuable to anyone but the contiguous property owner and/or if the adjacent
owner’s property was so vast that no one else would be able to leverage
development. Director Lubow noted that the policy as written does not
explain these items. She said that the policy should be as precise as
possible in order to not give any appearance of impropriety.
Director Lubow wondered what the notification requirements are and asked
staff to look into what the Federal and State governments do for
notifications. She noted that her research showed that the average notice
was one day in The Denver Post, which to her was not enough. Kate
Iverson replied that she will research what is done at the State and Federal
level as well as the current RTD practices. She acknowledged the tension
between moving quickly through the process while making sure there is
enough time for interested parties to know what is going on and respond.

Director Walker told staff he understood what the policy is saying and found
it well written. He added that he gets the transparency aspect while also
still wanting a small fishing net to catch the specific developer who would
maximize the use of the property.

Committee Chair James thanked Kate Iverson for her work. He noted that
this policy would enhance RTD’s image with the communities we work with.
He added that he is comfortable with the policy the way it is and finds the
level of transparency adequate. He wondered if the draft has been
compared to other peer agencies. Kate Iverson answered that staff studied
similar policies from Seatle, Nevada, Bay Area Rapid Transit, Washington
Metropolitan Authority, among others. She noted that the policies run the
gamut and that she would be happy to provide context for comparison.
Committee Chair James replied that he does not need the context for
comparison; he was satisfied with knowing that the work had been done.
Committee James asked for clarification on item III.A.1.b. regarding the Real
Property and TOD Committee. He asked staff to confirm that this
committee is an internal committee of staff. Kate Iverson said that was
correct. She added that in order to identify the needs of the agency, each
Assistant General Manager had appointed someone from their department to
represent them in the committee in order to ensure understanding before
moving forward. Committee Chair James suggested that maybe the name
of the committee should be Transit Oriented Communities (TOC). He added
that he looks forward to finalizing the policy.

C. Other Matters
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, briefed the Board on a
slight modification to an existing local government program. He noted that the
program bequests $300,000 from the budget to make funds available to local
governments for improvements directly related to transit. Local jurisdictions submit
their projects and RTD awards the funds as merited. Bill Van Meter noted that the
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the Federal Transit Authority
(FTA) had similar programs; however, they have eliminated those programs partly
due to funds coming directly to RTD. He added that staff plans on increasing
RTD’s program funding to $350,000 to make up for lost opportunity to the local
governments. This amount is included in the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and the
budget that will be brought to the Directors later this month.

Director Anderson noted that there are industry standards for these types of
notifications. She recalled from her experience in City Councils how
expensive publishing notices really is. She said that RTD needs to be
prudent making the proper notifications but not wasting money. She added
that real estate professionals know where to find these types of
notifications.

6.C

Committee Chair James suggested that staff also send the notice to the Board as
the Directors could promote the program through their local contacts. Bill Van
Meter replied that staff will contact all jurisdictions and will reach out to the
Directors as well.
Director Lubow noted that this is the type of program she really likes as it is a
benefit for the public good. Due to her quest for finding a third way to not raise
fares, she said that she had some questions regarding the program. She asked
staff how much it would cost to administer the program. Bill Van Meter replied
that the administrative burden is relatively small as solicitations happen once a year
and are reviewed by the Planning and Capital Programs departments.
Director Lubow asked if the amount of $50,000 was equivalent to the funds that
CDOT and the FTA eliminated. Bill Van Meter replied that he speculates CDOT and
FTA’s funding was higher. He added that RTD wanted to make this program a bit
more robust while ensuring that other budget responsibilities were met.
Director Tobiassen wondered if the type of projects that could be submitted to this
program included improvements of ramps and streets for accessibility to ADA
riders. Bill Van Meter replied that these were the types of improvements RTD
would seek. Director Tobiassen said that this program could potentially save RTD
money by making fixed routes more accessible instead of riders having to use
Access-a-Ride.
Committee Chair James encouraged staff to share this program with local
Transportation Management Organizations (TMOs) and Transportation Management
Associations (TMAs). Bill Van Meter said that only local government jurisdictions
could apply; however, TMOs and TMAs could funnel projects through their local
jurisdictions.
Chair Sisk asked staff to provide the Board with the 2015 allocations for this
program. Bill Van Meter said that he would provide this information to the Board.
He noted that not all $300,000 have been disbursed to date. Any remnant funding
will return to the budget.

Packet Pg. 30

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 3, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Due to the increase in the funds, Bill Van Meter pointed out that RTD will be
tightening the rules for the types of projects that can apply for this assistance. The
minimum will be $10,000 and the maximum $50,000, with the possibility of a
higher amount if multiple jurisdictions apply jointly. RTD will require a 20% local
match in order to ensure the local jurisdiction’s engagement and to stretch the
funds. He added that projects shall have an emphasis on safety, accessibility to
transit, and an impact to transit operations/improvements. Staff will be notifying
the local governments about the changes to the program and inviting them to
submit projects.

B. Recommended Actions

• University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail 2016 Service Changes
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the University of Colorado A Line and R Line
Bus and Rail Service Plan package as summarized in Attachment A resulting
in an annualized cost of approximately $16,948,000, exclusive of University
of Colorado A Line Operating and Maintenance costs, and further, to
authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO or his designee to execute
contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations,
introduced Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and
Scheduling, Jeff Dunning, Senior Service Planner/Scheduler –
East Team, and Michael Washington, Title VI Manager. He
explained that as has been RTD’s standard practice, whenever
a rail line is opened the bus service is redesigned in order to
feed the rail stations while at the same time maintaining bus
service to meet local service needs. He stated this is done by
redeploying RTD’s existing resources to provide access to an
integrated system that provides service to many more
destinations in the metro area. He shared that this had been
done for all of RTD’s prior openings.
Packet Pg. 36

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 10, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson participated via phone.

Bruce Abel reminded the Board that the University of Colorado
A Line (A Line) would be opening April 22, 2016. As a result
of this opening, the normal runboard that would normally take
place in May of 2016 will be moved to April 22, 2016. He
explained that as a result of this accelerated date, everything
in the normal service change process would be accelerated by
one month as well. He said that normally staff would present
their initial service change recommendations in January with
request for final approval in February. Due to the accelerated
schedule staff will present the initial service change
recommendations in December with a request for approval in
January. He stated that because the service changes
associated with opening new rail lines can be overwhelming
and daunting, staff is presenting these to the Board separate
from the normal runboard changes. He noted that there is a
great deal of behind the scenes work for staff and approving
the service plan for the A and R Lines now will allow for the
time necessary to complete those changes.
Bruce Abel recognized that there has been a great deal of
conversation from the Montbello Organizing Committee
regarding the perspective service plan for their community. He
knows that the Board received a letter from the Montbello
Organizing Committee requesting there be a 6 month delay
before any changes are recommended; however, it is not
staff’s intent to recommend a delay. Staff is requesting
approval of the A and R Line service plan for implementation
of the A Line changes on April 22, 2016.
Bruce Abel asked Jessie Carter to walk through the process
staff had gone through to get to this point because it has been
quite a process. He said he would also like Jeff Dunning to
highlight the proposed service changes. He stated that
despite some assertions made by the Montbello Organizing
Committee, staff firmly believes that the recommended service
plan offers improvements to service in Montbello and Green
Valley Ranch.
Jessie Carter reminded the Board that the preliminary service
plan for the A and R Lines was developed in July of 2015. He
shared that stakeholder meetings were held between July and
August. At the August 11, 2015 Operations and Customer
Service Committee staff presented the service plan to the
Board before taking it out for public comment. He said
between September and October there were eight public

6.E

Jeff Dunning commented that some of the changes to the
service plan since it was first presented to the Board are
noticeable. These changes include retention of Route 28
through the Whittier, North City Park and North Park Hill
neighborhoods; the integration of Route 47 in Northern
Montbello into Route 121, which will save many passengers a
transfer; increases to Route 483 to have 30 minute peak
period frequency; and revisions to Route 42 and 45 in Green
Valley Ranch for better neighborhood coverage.
Jeff Dunning stated that the largest changes in the service
plan involve the Montbello and Green Valley Ranch
neighborhoods. He noted that the Montbello Organizing
Committee has been questioning how the new service will
work. He said that an explanation was provided to the
Montbello Organizing Committee earlier in the day. He
explained that currently Montbello had 4 local routes running
east/west that are spaced about ¼ and ½ mile apart. He said
that even in a dense urban area staff does not like to have
routes any closer than ½ mile and in most suburban areas 1
mile apart. He shared that what staff has found in Montbello
is that the very southerly and very northerly routes do very
well (Route 43 and 153); however, the two middle routes
(Routes 44 and 45) are too close and are cannibalizing each
other. He shared that even without the changes for the A Line
staff would probably propose discontinuing some of the
service anyway.
Jeff Dunning explained that staff’s recommendation is to
reduce the number of routes from 4 to 3. In this proposal no
one would be further than 1/3 mile from a route, which is a
generally accepted industry walking distance standard. He
said that by combining the two middle routes staff can justify
a higher frequency of service as well as expanded service
hours. He stated that Montbello will have a level of service
that is provided in only a handful of neighborhoods in the rest
of the District.
Michael Washington reminded the Board that any time there is
a major service change, especially the opening of new fixed
guideways, transit agencies are required to evaluate the
Packet Pg. 38

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 10, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

hearings. He noted that there was also a great deal of written
feedback. He explained that those meetings and feedback
have been incorporated into the final service plan before the
Board today.

6.E

Director Francone inquired if this service plan includes the
November 3, 2015 request from Douglas County to increase
service on Route 483 to every half hour. Jessie Carter stated
that the service plan had been updated to include 30 minute
service frequencies on Route 483 during peak periods, which
is consistent with their request. Director Francone asked if
ridership figures support this level of service. Jessie Carter
said that ridership figures support the level of service currently
provided on that route, which is the service level that Douglas
County is requesting RTD maintain.
Director Lubow shared how much respect she has for the staff
that worked on this and Director Deadwyler for her
involvement. She said it seems like an enormous amount of
time and effort went into creating increased transit and really
good service levels in this area. Nonetheless, she expressed
how upsetting it is to receive letters from people feeling
aggrieved.
Director Lubow remembers eliminating bus service as part of
the W Line service plan and then having to reinstate some of
that service due to public pressure. She imagines that staff
can distinguish this service plan from what happened on the W
Line. She asked staff to explain how the two are different.
Bruce Abel explained that the first difference came from
lessons learned from the W Line opening. He said the changes
during the W Line were a classic example of textbook
planning. When a rail line is open textbook planning says that
parallel bus service should be eliminated; however, in using
that method of thinking staff did not see the disparity of fares
that was created. When that was brought to staff’s attention,
staff made the recommendation to the Board to resume a
higher level of bus service. One of the lessons learned was
that staff does not just look at the parallel service but also the
impact on fares.
Packet Pg. 39

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 10, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

changes for equity impacts. He explained that the best way
to evaluate equity is to look at the average number of local
trips in the area and the minority and low income populations
in that area. He said that Montbello and Green Valley Ranch
have a higher minority and low income population compared
with the rest of the District. He stated that as far as Title VI
is concerned the proposed service plan is considered to be a
proportionate impact and benefit to minority and low income
populations.

6.E

Bruce Abel pointed out that one of the issues staff has heard
in the conversations with Montbello is the focus on going from
4 routes to 3. He said the simple math tells the community
that they are losing a route; however, the real issue is that
there are too many routes in the area and therefore they are
not getting a high level of service frequency on those routes
because ridership does not support it. He stated that by
consolidating two of the routes RTD can provide service at a
high frequency with a longer service day.
Jessie Carter noted that if the Board remembers back to 2012
RTD had to make a very large service cut, which was the
same time staff was planning for the W Line. He said that
because of this, staff was very frugal in the bus service they
were willing to invest in. He believes RTD is in a different
spot now. He pointed out the Route AT and 169L, which do
provide duplicative service but staff recommended keeping
those routes when the trip time was considered. He said if
this was 2012 staff would not be making those
recommendations.
Director Tobiassen expressed his appreciation for all the work
done by staff and the public outreach. He also appreciates
staff’s recommendation to maintain the Route AT and 169L.
He believes there were good lessons learned during the W Line
opening and is glad to see them implemented. He shared that
he met with the Heather Gardens Association last Thursday.
He said there was some grumbling about elimination of the
130H but believes it is generally being accepted. He stated
that he is very excited about the changes to Route 157. He
noted he met with Buckley Airforce Base and the security
group is very happy to no longer have a bus coming through
the 6th Avenue Gate. Jessie Carter stated that he would meet
with Director Tobiassen offline regarding the gate staff would
like to use as staff thinks 6th Avenue may still be the better
Gate. Director Tobiassen noted Buckley Airforce Base would
not be happy so it would be important to have a conversation
to determine how to best meet everyone’s needs.
Packet Pg. 40

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 10, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Bruce Abel shared that another aspect of this service plan is
that staff tried to err on the side of conservatism. If there
were bus routes that were staff thought might not perform
well but were borderline, staff left those routes in the plan.
He said that if ridership does not materialize those routes will
be eliminated at some point in the future but there would be
actual ridership data to support the elimination.

6.E

Director Lasater thanked Director Francone for paying
attention to Route 483. He believes this is a huge step
forward for Aurora and Parker. He shared that he recently had
a conversation with Bryce Matthews, Parker Comprehensive
Planning Manager, about how pleased Parker is with the
change. He shared that Mr. Matthews also spoke very highly
of the RTD staff. Director Lasater acknowledged that Parker
understands they need to bring awareness to this continued
service. He believes there is a huge opportunity for Parker to
bring awareness to the people in Aurora of the work
opportunities there are in Parker. He hopes that over time this
Route will mature and grow.
Director Solano said he received a letter from Commerce City
Councilman Steve Douglas regarding a safety concern related
to Route 104X and asked if staff had received it. Jessie
Carter stated that he had been contacted about the last Route
104X trip being cancelled but was not aware of a safety
concern. Director Solano indicated there was concern about
moving a concrete bus pad. Jessie Carter said he would look
into it.
Director Anderson stated that she would be supporting the
service plan. She thinks staff has done an excellent job in
balancing the old service with the new. She believes staff is
also flexible enough to make changes after the opening if they
are needed. She said it is imperative that the Board approve
the service plan as April 22 is very soon.
Committee Vice-Chair Deadwyler noted that both Montbello
and Green Valley Ranch are in her District. She thinks she has
given the staff more headaches than anyone. She asked a lot
of questions and said she is totally satisfied that the service
plan should move forward. She recognized that people do not
like change because change is hard. She said she does not
expect everything to roll out smoothly; however, she knows
that any issues will get worked out quickly. She believes it
would be wrong to delay anything. Committee Vice-Chair
Deadwyler shared that she has talked to many people who are
so excited about the service plan because they can now catch
the bus late at night. She does not think the complaint of

Director Tobiassen commented that the Route 483 frequency
is a big plus for Aurora and Parker. He thinks this is a very
positive plan and looks forward to it moving forward.

6.E

combining two routes is actually as big of an issue within the
community as what the Board is hearing it is. She thanked
staff for being not only patient with the community but with
her as well.

Committee Vice-Chair Deadwyler declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

• Authorization to purchase additional software maintenance and new
software licenses for eFORCE
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager and
CEO or his designee to amend an existing contract with IntelliChoice
(Contract 10DH020) exercise up to two additional option years for
software maintenance and to purchase new software licenses for the
eFORCE Transit Fare Enforcement Software and Records Management
Software.
The software maintenance is essential to maintain the
existing software. The new software licenses are needed to operate the
software on a new hardware device. This will increase the authorized
amount by $600,000 from the current contract value of $884,300 to a
total authorized amount of $1,484,300.
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the November 17, 2015 Board
Meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bob Grado, Acting Transit Police Chief, explained that eFORCE
is essentially the Air Traffic Control for all things security. It is
the current Records Management Software (RMS) with over
30K case reports being entered into the system annually. The
system is also used to report our statistics and information to
other agencies. He said that another component of the
eFORCE system is the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system
which is used for security officers, emergency medical
services, etc. Finally, the eFORCE system is integrated into
the handheld mobile citation devices.
Bob Grado explained that since RTD will be purchasing new
citation devices, staff is requesting to increase the eFORCE

Director Folska asked for clarification if this software would
integrate fare enforcement with our Smart Card technology.
Eric Farrington, IT Program Manager, reiterated that this would
be for software for the new handheld fare enforcement
devices as the current devices are no longer available. The
new devices will be an iPhone platform that will allow both the
Xerox and eFORCE software to be on the device. Director
Folska asked if there would be an interface for these two
softwares to communicate. Eric Farrington stated that they do
not interface today and will not in the future. Having both
pieces of software on the device allows for security officers to
do the Xerox scan and then if someone is violating the officer
can more over to eFORCE to write them a ticket. Director
Folska asked if staff anticipates requesting more money in the
future to develop an interface. Eric Farrington stated that is
already budgeted for under another contract.
Director Menten shared that in talking with some of the
security officers she has heard that they are extremely
frustrated with the current system. She wonders if there is a
guestimate for how many people have not been issued a ticket
for evading fare because of the difficulties with the system.
Bob Grado noted that was part of the reason we are moving to
the new devices. He explained that generally if there is a
problem with the current handheld devices the evader will be
issued a paper summons that is later entered into the system
manually. Director Menten asked if staff had surveyed the
current security officers as to what they think is needed in the
new system. Bob Grado said that staff is very motivated to
solve the security officers issues. He shared that the new
devices are being used at other agencies and staff thinks it will
be a much more stable platform.
Director Francone asked for clarification as to the cost of the
request. She pointed out that in the recommended action
language there is a request for $600K while in the financial
impact section there is a funding amount of about $290K.
Eric Farrington explained that the $290K was for the software
Packet Pg. 43

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 10, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

contract by $600K to purchase new software for the new
devices as well as for ongoing software maintenance. He
stated that funding for this request has already been included
in the 2015 and 2016 budget. Additionally, another benefit is
that the mobile citation devices will integrate between eFORCE
and the Xerox fare enforcement software.

maintenance. The additional funding beyond that is for the
software licenses for the new iPhone handheld devices.

Director Hoy wondered if our security officers were currently
supplied with RTD issued cell phones. He explained that he
was asking because he was assuming the new iPhone
handheld devices would be functional iPhones. Eric Farrington
explained that they would not be functional for phone call,
only for data. The security officers would still be using their
public safety radios.

Bruce Abel said he would like to take the opportunity to introduce Gina Callahan to
the Board. He acknowledged that many of the Board already knew her as she was
currently the General Superintendent of Street Operations. He shared that with
Mike Gil’s retirement Gina has agreed to be the Acting Deputy Assistant General
Manager of Bus Operations. He thanked Gina for her willingness to act in that
capacity. He believes Mr. Gil will continue to share his experience with RTD on a
part time or adjunct basis over the next several weeks. He recognized Mr. Gil for
his service to RTD for many years and expressed that he certainly deserved his
retirement.

B. Recommended Actions

• 2016 Salaried Benefit Plans
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approves the 2016 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan
and authorizes the Interim General Manager and CEO or his designee to
enter into agreements with the Insurance Carriers.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015
Board meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager for Finance and
Administration and Chief Financial Officer, reviewed the
changes for the Medical plans for 2016. She explained that
Cigna administers two self-funded plans: Preferred Provider
Organization (PPO) and High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP),
which will see a 7.7% administrative cost increase in 2016.
Kaiser Permanente provides 2 plan options: Deductible Health
Maintenance Organization (DHMO) and HDHP, with a blended
increase of 5%. She added that employees will contribute
10% to the PPO and DHMO plans and 5% to the HDHP plans.
She pointed out that the industry standard increase is
anywhere from 7% to 10%.
Heather Copp noted that the administrative rates for the dental
and vision plans are locked through 2016. Negotiations will
begin early next year for the 2017 rates. She pointed out that
Packet Pg. 47

Director Anderson was absent.

6.F

She referred the Directors to the chart on page 44 of the
Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet
for November 10, 2015. The chart compares the total
premium, employee contribution, and RTD contribution for
2015 and 2016 highlighting the dollar amount and percentage
of the rate of increase.
Director Lasater asked that the recommended action language
read “Interim General Manager” for all recommended actions in
an effort to be consistent.
Director Hoy wondered if staff has considered utilizing one
provider in order to save in costs. Heather Copp replied that
the single provider option is considered every year; however,
she noted that the costs for both Cigna and Kaiser Permanente
to RTD and the employees are manageable enough to provide
the options. She added that from past experience in different
work settings there are pros and cons to a single provider
system.
Committee Chair Tobiassen asked how might employees
utilizing the family plans with a child at an out-of-state college
be affected if RTD ever assumed a single provider system.
Heather Copp replied that providers have out of network
options for those instances. Committee Chair Tobiassen noted
that a transitioning to a single provider system is more
complex than it seems.

the Basic Life Insurance/AD&D, Voluntary Life/AD&D, and
Long and Short Term Disability plans are under a multi-year
rate guarantee as well; however, staff anticipates a 3%
increase in these plans as they are based on salary dollars for
2016.

• Approval of 2016 Contribution for the Salaried Employee's Retirement Plans

Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015
Board meeting.
Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager for Finance and
Administration and Chief Financial Officer, explained that the
DB plan was closed in 2007. Employees hired as of January
1, 2008 are on the DC Plan. The 2016 Actuary recommended
contribution for the DB Plan is $6 million. Staff considers that
amount too costly, thus are recommending a $4.1 million
annual contribution. This contribution would project the plan
to be fully funded by 2036. The $4.1 million is included in the
2016 budget. Heather Copp reminded the Directors that for
the DC plan the Board sets the contribution rate between 7%
to 9% of salaries per year for participants. Since its inception,
the DC Plan has been funded at 9%. She referred the
Directors to the chart include in the Financial Administration
and Audit Committee agenda packet for November 10, 2015.
The chart includes the percentage of salaries (if applicable),
the 2016 projected contribution, the 2015 projected
contribution and the projected contribution difference.
Director Archuleta wondered if staff would come back next
year and request a different contribution to the DB plan.
Heather Copp explained that the contribution relies on
actuarial variation and further changes cannot really be
predicted. She added that the current amount is based on
current earnings and salary projections. She pointed out that
the biggest unknown of the DB plan is the life expectancy of
those participating in the program.
Director Folska asked for clarification on the 9% contribution
for the DC plan. Heather Copp replied that Board policy calls
Packet Pg. 49

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 10, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2016 contribution of $4.1 million to
RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”),
which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement.
It is also
recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2016 contribution of
9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’
Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified
amount to the plan for each year of employment.

6.F

Director Lubow wondered if interest rates went up for the DB
plan then the actuary recommended contribution would be less
than $6 million. Heather Copp replied that that was correct
and if that happened, it would be a decision for the Board to
make in the future as to the contribution. Director Lubow
asked if RTD has a legal obligation to fulfill the DB plan
payments. Heather Copp replied that she would argue that
RTD is required to fulfill the benefit offered to those
employees. Rolf Asphaug, Deputy General Counsel, noted
that he does not know the legal answer to the question but
would agree with Heather Copp in fulfilling the benefits
offered.
Committee Chair Tobiassen said that RTD is very fortunate
that the DB plan is closed since he knows of too many
organizations going bankrupt over their pension funds.

• Proposed 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approves and adopts the 2016 Fiscal Policy
Statement.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015
Board meeting.
Director Walker seconded the motion.
Packet Pg. 50

for a contribution of 7% to 9% of employee’s salaries.
Director Folska wondered what the standard is for agencies
similar to RTD, such as Colorado Department of Transportation
and the State of Colorado. Heather Copp said that the
percentage varies by employer and budget; however, it is
typically between 7% to 9%. She added it is difficult to
compare because the amount of DB plan changes depending
on actuary recommendations.

Discussion:

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager for Budget and Financial
Analysis, reminded the Directors that towards the end of the
year staff brings to the Board the fiscal policy for approval.
She noted that the changes presented were mostly for
clarifications. These changes were summarized in the Board
report for the recommended action. A redlined copy is
included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
agenda meeting packet for November 10, 2015. She noted
that Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager for Finance and
Administration and Chief Financial Officer, would be
presenting some proposed language changes based on
concerns from Director Menten and Lasater.
Heather Copp referred the Directors to item #2 under Debt
Policies. She noted the addition of the phrase “or a maximum
of 40 years.” She explained that State statutes do not allow
the financing of bonds, Certificates of Participation (COPs) or
other financial obligations in excess of 40 years. Staff found
it prudent to be clear as per State statute.
Heather Copp added that after a conversation with Director
Menten, staff would like to suggest a change of wording on
the same item (Debt Policies, #2) from “…shall be financed for
a period not to exceed the expected useful life of the asset…”
to “not to exceed the lesser of the expected useful life of the
asset or a maximum of 40 years.” She noted that some
assets have useful life in excess of 40 years and staff intent is
to keep more guard rails on assets that may be utilized for
these types of financing.
Director Bagley suggested reviewing item #6 under Revenue
Policies to read “On an annual basis, staff will identify
underutilized or unutilized property and equipment…” Dave
Genova, Interim General Manager and CEO, and Henry
Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager for Capital
Programs, had no objection to these additions.
Director Menten agreed with Director Bagley’s suggestion.
Rolf Asphaug, Deputy General Counsel, suggested that
modifications that were not supported by the full Board be
voted on separately.
Director Lubow wondered why staff crossed out “maintaining
or increasing ridership and fare revenue” in item #1 under
Packet Pg. 51

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 10, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

6.F

Revenue Policies. Heather Copp explained that the bullet
points in item #1 were changed to reflect consistency with the
recently adopted fare policy. She noted that it was up to the
Directors to decide on the final wording. Director Lubow said
she understood where staff is coming from with those
changes; however, she likes the idea of keeping that phrase
in. She noted that item #2 under Revenue Policies eliminated
the distinction of riders and included them all under the phrase
“all transit dependent patrons.” Director Lubow pointed out
that not everyone using transit is transit dependent. She
wondered if staff used a wider brush than needed on the
changes suggested.
Director Lubow asked as to why item #7 under Revenue
Policies, which refers to a third party to provide sales and use
tax forecasting, was added when this is already occurring.
Heather Copp replied that it was added as this item was a
recommended action from the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force
and a current practice. Director Lubow said that she is
concerned about the items she mentioned and is inclined to
vote no on the 2016 Proposed Fiscal Policy Statement.
Chair Sisk wondered if item #2 under Debt Policies could read
“the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40
years, whichever is less.” Rolf Asphaug replied that Heather
Copp’s suggestion, “not to exceed the lesser of the expected
useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years,” worked
well. Chair Sisk deferred to the Deputy General Counsel’s
expertise and withdrew his recommendation.
Motion
to Amend:





Director Menten moved to amend the following
items in the Proposed 2016 Fiscal Policy
Statement:
Item #6 under Revenue Policies, “On an annual basis, staff
will identify under or unutilized property or equipment, and
will make an ongoing attempt to sell such property and
equipment to enhance cash flow.”
Item #2 under Debt Policies, “Capital projects funded
through the issuance of bonds, Certificates of Participation
(COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a
period not to exceed the lesser of the expected useful life
of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.”
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015
Board meeting.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager for Budget and Financial
Analysis, reminded the Directors that the Strategic Budget
Plan (SBP) was originally presented in April and approved in
August, 2015. The FasTracks Annual Project Evaluation (APE)
was presented in July and approved in August. During the
September Financial Administration and Audit Committee
meeting, staff presented an overview of the 2016
Recommended Budget. The Board studied the 2016
Recommended Budget during the September Study Session.
A budget update was presented during the October Financial
Administration and Audit Committee meeting. Staff’s intent
tonight is to move the 2016 Recommended Budget to the full
Board meeting on November 17, 2015.
Jannette Scarpino highlighted the following items:
 The District-wide revenue is projected to increase by
$141 million including a $39 million increase in Sales &
Use Tax.

Director Lubow noted that Sales and Use Tax and Fare Box
Revenue are projected to be higher in 2016. She pointed out
the projected diesel and gas savings as well. She wondered if
those funds could be used to fund the low income fare
program. Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager for
Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, replied
that the Board always has the choice to use the funds
however they chose. In that case, the Board would have to
direct staff where to make adjustments to maintain a balanced
budget: reduce proposed projects, not make approved
allocations, adjust operations, etc., as there is always a
tradeoff. Director Lubow said that she understood. She
wondered what would happen if the Board had a different
priority and chose differently. She said that she would
personally prefer to use the increase in revenue to fund low
income fares; however, she would not know which items to
adjust.
Director Solano pointed out that RTD needs to tighten our
belts and come up with some money to help the needy.
Jannette Scarpino pointed out that the revenue will be
absorbed in the expense increases for both FasTracks and
base operations.
Director Francone noted that she generally agrees with the
budget; however, she will be voting no tonight as she still has
a few more questions and wants to ensure a conversation
during the Board meeting.
Director Bagley reminded the Board to take the estimates in
revenue enhancements with a grain of salt. He noted that
currently RTD is not meeting our budget requirements for
2015. He added that later in the meeting staff will review the
2015 September monthly status which will spell out in more
detail the current situation.

• Electronic Content Management (ECM) Contract
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO, or
his designee, to execute a contract with IQBG for ECM Owners
Representative Services. The initial contract period will extend through
February 28, 2017, with two additional one-year options, and the initial
contract amount will be $653,230. Funding for the initial contract period is
included in the 2015 Amended Budget and the 2016 Recommended Budget.
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the November 17, 2015 Board
meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager for Finance and
Administration and Chief Financial Officer, reviewed the
Enterprise Content Management (ECM) Owners Representative
Contract Approval presentation as included in the Financial
Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet for
November 10, 2015. The presentation included the ECM
Project Overview, ECM Owners Representative Overview of
Scope, Procurement Process, Contract Structure, Project Cost,
Cost of not doing the ECM Project, and Project Schedule.
She highlighted that an ECM system would aid significantly in
complying with Colorado Open Records Act (CORA) requests.
Director Folska noted that ECM is really important as IT and
security needs to be a priority. She shared that recently she
has been thinking of what RTD does as a technology company
Packet Pg. 60

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 10, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Tobiassen pointed out that this is a very
complex budget. He encouraged the Directors to reach out to
staff with any questions. He thanked staff for the annual
Herculean task of putting the budget together.

6.F

Director Folska asked Heather Copp to confirm that as the
Assistant General Manager for Finance and Administration she
is responsible for Human Resources. Heather Copp confirmed
that she is responsible for Human Resources. Director Folska
wondered how an ECM would aid in investigations when
dealing with Equal Employment Opportunity, audits, etc.
Heather Copp replied that an ECM mechanism would make
investigations faster and easier while adding extra protection
for confidential documents. She noted that an ECM
mechanism would aid in the ability to comply with all Federal
and State laws.
Director Menten said that she is a bit uncomfortable with the
plan as there are not many specifics. She wondered if a task
force was set up with representatives from different divisions.
She also wondered if property records and the just approved
eForce software would be included in the proposed ECM
system. She added that the contract seems to be for a lot of
money when there is not a document that spells out what
exactly they will be doing. Heather Copp explained that the
contract will not be written until the Board approves moving
forward. Staff summarized the scope of work in the
presentation as this is now public information. She noted that
RTD has two staff members that work on record management.
The agency does not have the expertise in house to evaluate
the full needs for the contract, thus the recommendation to
hire an Owners Representative. She added that staff put
together a Steering Committee comprised of the Senior
Leadership Team and a Technical Committee with
representatives from each department of RTD.
Director Menten asked if ECM would interface with eForce
recordings of bus and light rail for safety. Heather Copp
replied that the ECM will categorize the information and
pinpoint where it resides and who the owner is. The ECM will
not replace eForce or any other software functionality.
Director Menten wondered if ECM would also cover property
records. Heather Copp said that property records would be
Packet Pg. 61

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 10, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

which utilizes buses and trains as its main mode of
technology. She asked staff when ECM will be completely
implemented. Heather Copp replied that the plan is for full
implementation of the recommendations provided by mid2019. She said that the actual date will depend on the actual
recommendations, phases of the project, if we decide to
convert past data, etc.

6.F

Director Lubow said she understood the clear need for fully
accessible information; however, she had trouble wrapping her
head around the cost: $600,000 for the first year and a total
of $11 million in the next years. Heather Copp replied that the
cost is estimated as RTD has not done this kind of project
before. She added that staff looked at the cost of not doing
anything, which could cost about $20 million. She reminded
the Directors that the recommended action is to move forward
with the creation of the contract. The contract will be brought
to the Directors for approval. Director Lubow asked what
made the cost so high. Heather Copp explained that any IT
implementation is expensive. She added that doing nothing
regarding record management will soon catch up with the
agency. She noted that staff has been lucky to be able to
respond to CORA requests. She pointed out that a CORA
requests usually means staff dropping everything they are
working on in order to research these documents within the 3
day time frame. Director Lubow wondered what the cost
would be to hire full time employees to deal with these types
of research and requests. Heather Copp explained that even
with employees specifically working on these types of
research they would still need a system to identify the proper
documents. Director Lubow apologized for belaboring her
point. She found it important to discuss due to the large
amount of money requested for the contract.
Director Francone requested a copy of the RFP for this
contract. Heather Copp replied that she would send the copy
to the full Board.
Director Francone asked staff to explain the $653,230 request
when the budget for the project is $1.8 million. Heather Copp
explained that the $653,230 is the initial contract amount and
included in the $1.8 million. The $1.8 million includes hiring
two full time employees and a few other items. Heather Copp
said she can provide the details.
Director Solano expressed his confusion on this project. He
feels like it is taking a step backwards to spend money not
knowing the results. He wondered if a study had been done.
Packet Pg. 62

searchable under the ECM. Dave Genova, Interim General
Manager and CEO, explained that the goal is for every record
in the agency to be covered under the ECM umbrella. Director
Menten requested a copy of the Request for Proposal (RFP) for
this project.

6.F

Director Walker shared that the company he works at started
cataloging all of its holdings, assets, easements, and other
documentation 3 years ago and the project is still going. He
noted that it is a very expensive and labor intensive
undertaking. The benefit will be finding the information when
needed. He alluded to Heather Copp’s explanation of the time
associated with researching and retrieving documents. He
said that he has been there and spent too much time doing
that kind of research. He noted that he would be supporting
the recommended action because the result is worthwhile.
Director Bagley reminded the Directors that in the past Owners
Representatives have been hired. He used hiring Trammell
Crow as the Owners Representative for the Denver Union
Station (DUS) project as an example. At the time, RTD did not
have the capacity to fulfill all the real estate functions, which
is what Trammell Crow was hired to do. He noted that this is
the same conversation for the ECM system. The $11 million
figure will be spent over the next 5 years. He noted that the
Board trusted Trammell Crow to manage the process and the
end result is DUS as the hub of the FasTracks program.
Director Bagley asked staff how many CORA requests RTD
gets in a month and who requests them. Dave Genova replied
that there are anywhere from six to twelve a month. He said
that the requestors come from all over the board: media,
individuals, response to accidents/incidents, etc. Rolf
Asphaug, Deputy General Counsel, noted that it could be a
few more than that depending on the time frame. Some
requests are really large. He added that an ECM system will
provide a guarantee of consistent information. He pointed out
that the General Counsel supports this initiative.
Committee Chair Tobiassen recalled when the Board used to
get the Board packets delivered by courier on Friday
afternoons. He said that he would save them in case he
needed to reference them. Due to the stacks of documents he
Packet Pg. 63

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 10, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Heather Copp reminded the Directors that in 2014 RTD
engaged Ciber to conduct an assessment of ECM at RTD.
Ciber found enough issues in RTD’s ECM that the
assessment’s final recommendation was to go out to hire an
Owners Representative for the project. She said that she
would get the Board a copy of the Ciber report. Director
Solano had other questions that he would take offline with
staff.

knows he would never be able to find anything. He noted that
even with the current electronic system, he still needs to
remember the date in order to search for a specific document.
He added that an ECM would help in the search as it would
use keywords, topics, contractors, and other information as
needed.

Director Lasater explained that the ECM is kind of like a
jukebox: you push the items you want to grab and it retrieves
it for you. He added that audio and video files are huge and
knowing where they are at is a great asset. He noted that the
current record system is dysfunctional. He added that to use
a cloud based system would be really expensive for the
amount of files that RTD stores. Heather Copp added that the
ECM system would eliminate the need for duplication of
documents, thus freeing up more space.
Director Folska called for the question.

C. Updates

• Third Quarter 2015 Investment Report
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager for Debt and Investments, noted that not
much has changed since the last quarter. He pointed out that the Liquidity
Tier and the Enhanced Cash Tier are in line, if not outperforming, the
benchmarks.
Director Hoy recalled the process of refinancing bonds that was done several
years ago. He wondered if it would make sense to refinance bonds again.
Brenden Morgan explained that in 2013 RTD did three refinancings of
outstanding debt in order to create some repayment capacity for the North

Metro line. He added that staff always looks at the outstanding debt
portfolio in order to find all the opportunities available when going to the
market. At this time staff is not recommending any refinancing. Director
Hoy pointed out that there is no way of predicting the need for refinancing
as it is a money market situation. Brenden Morgan agreed saying that was a
big portion of it. He added that particular bonds need to wait until a
particular date in order to be refinanced.

Heather Copp Assistant General Manager for Finance and Administration and
Chief Financial Officer, informed the Directors that the internal testing has
gone very well. She noted that we are on target for the January 1, 2016
Stored Value public pilot to go live. She reviewed the following changes to
the SmartCard project elements:
 External Hosting of SMT environment – changed to yellow from
green due to Xerox needing to update the Java based web application
development program in order to conform to security requirements.
 ADA Reviews – changed to yellow from green due to delays in
testing because of a web portal issue.
Heather Copp added that the next assessment will be presented to the
Assistant General Managers on Friday November 20th. After that meeting
staff will have a much better feel about the success of a January
implementation. She added that staff will continue the monthly updates
through the public pilot phase.
Director Lubow noted we are only going live with the public pilot in January.
She asked when it would be available to the full public. Heather Copp
replied that the public pilot is a public phasing as participants will be using
their own money. Staff would like to see how SmartCard usage goes
beyond staff and Directors, since we are more familiar with using public
transit than the general public. This would allow staff to address any issues
that may emerge. Currently staff does not have a good date for full public
implementation; staff would like to see how the public pilot goes before
deciding on a public roll out date.
Chair Sisk expressed his dissatisfaction with the update. He noted that if
we are not ready for implementation by January 1st, like he was expecting,
that we go ahead and say it.

• September 2015 Monthly Financial Status Report
Heather Copp Assistant General Manager for Finance and Administration and
Chief Financial Officer, recalled Director Bagley’s comments during the 2016
Recommended Budget discussion. She noted that between Fare Box
Revenue and Sales and Use Tax, we are $5 million to $6 million under

budget. She added that numbers have been slightly better, ironically, from
new and used car sales.
Doug MacLeod, Controller, reviewed the September 2015 Monthly Financial
Status. He noted that most items are in red, alluding to Director Bagley’s
comments during the 2016 Recommended Budget discussion, adding that in
order to keep the budget balanced adjustments need to be made to
expenses accordingly.

Director Lubow wondered how worrisome is the September 2015 Monthly
Financial Status. Heather Copp replied that the last couple of months have
been close to expectations. She noted that the decreases have been
leveling off and staff is able to cover those shortfalls by monitoring
expenditures. She added that staff is still cautious of 2016. The University
of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business is expecting an increase in Sales and
Use Tax. Staff will continue to monitor on a monthly basis and see how the
fare increases and the openings of the lines affect the bottom line. She
mentioned that staff will continue to be diligent in reporting to the Directors
the forecasts as well as bringing to the Board’s attention any trends that
staff may see.

D. Other Matters
Dave Genova, Interim General Manager and CEO, updated the Directors on the
North Metro Project. RTD has the option with the Regional Rail Partners (RRP) to
execute a design/build for North Metro to end of line until December 31, 2015.
Staff has been working with the RRP to get pricing for a contract extension until
December 31, 2016. Staff has just received the numbers. They will be shared at
the North Metro Elected Officials meeting on November 12, 2015. He added that
staff wanted to share the information with the Directors before going public.
Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs,
informed the Directors that the cost to exercise a continuation until December 31,
2016 from 124th Avenue to 168th Avenue/HWY 7 is $263 million. This breaks
down to $153 million to RRP and $110 million in costs to RTD, for items such as
right of way and other expenditures. The price to exercise a continuation from
124th Avenue to 144th Avenue is $181 million.
Director Hoy asked for the breakdown of the $181 million to 144th Avenue. Henry
Stopplecamp replied that the cost would be $91 million to RRP and $90 million in
costs to RTD. He added that the $90 million covers new vehicles, stations, and
other details that he could give offline. Director Hoy asked what the cost would be
to exercise the continuation to HWY 7 today. Henry Stopplecamp replied that the
cost to exercise the continuation today is $79 million. Dave Genova added that the
$79 million is the RRP number; there would still be RTD costs.
Packet Pg. 66

Heather Copp pointed out that staff continues to monitor expenditures.

6.F

Director Bagley asked for the difference in RRP costs. Henry Stopplecamp replied
that the cost for 2015 is $79 million and the cost for 2016 is $153 million, almost
doubling RRP’s cost. Director Bagley noted that the $74 million difference is a big
number.

Director James said that he recently had the privilege of meeting with Don Hunt,
former Executive Director for the Colorado Department of Transportation, Kelly
Brough, President and CEO of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, Chair Sisk
and Dave Genova. He notified the Directors that the Denver Metro Chamber of
Commerce is in the beginning stages of something they are calling “Choice
Mobility”. The project will look at ways to integrating transit options within the
region and with other organizations.
Director Folska asked Dave Genova to give the Directors a date for the launch of
the safety campaign. Dave Genova replied that there is no firm date as staff is still
working with authorities regarding the most recent light rail accident. Director
Folska asked how the safety campaign and the light rail accident are related. Dave
Genova replied that staff is not sure if there will be charges filed until Douglas
County is done with their investigation. Director Folska noted that the safety
campaign is geared towards children’s safety around transit and in conjunction with
the new openings. Dave Genova pointed out that the subject matter in the
campaign may seem somewhat insensitive due to the recent fatality. He added
that the safety campaign is a stand-alone campaign around multi modal transit that
will engage many different audiences. Director Folska wondered if December 1st is
a possible date. Dave Genova replied that December 1st is a possibility.
Committee Chair Tobiassen thanked Veteran’s for their service and acknowledged
the luncheon RTD held today for Veterans that work at the agency.

November Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Sisk moved briskly through the agenda. He noted that Michael Gil will be retiring.
IGM Genova commented that Mike has served this agency well and will be coming back
on an adjunct basis to help out during the transition. Gina Callahan will be acting. They
are trying to encourage Mike to come to the Board meeting to receive his plaque. Chair
Sisk asked what do we normally give to retirees. IGM Genova indicated that depending on
the number of service years, they get a plaque and a retirement gift (watch) plus a going
away party if desired. Director Hoy noted that Mike Gil was the first RTD employee he
had met since he has worked the Bronco Ride for years and Mike Gil would be hustling
during these events. Mike Gil was his face for the agency
Chair Sisk noted there will be an update on the General Manager Executive Search

Discussion:

Chair Sisk reviewed the items on the agenda and stated
that Heather Copp is a breath of fresh air in how she
delivers information to the Board.
There were no questions under unanimous consent so
the committee discussed some of the recommended
action items. On item F, 2016 FasTracks Public
Information Consultant Contract, Chair Sisk noted how
appalling it was how the Board treated staff on this
issue. He stated he went out to apologize to Virtegic
and noted some of the team members were in tears.
These are really good people and he believes we can
vote on an item without taking people to task in a
public setting. Director Bagley commented that our
public decorum is atrocious and this is why he wants
our meetings to be televised. Director Walker
concurred and stated he did not understand the
discussion. The discussion did not appear to be on
failure in the scope of work but more personal in
nature. It is really up to the Board members to convince
other Board members to vote a certain way and it is out
of line for the Board to speak to staff and our
contractors in such a manner. Director Tobiassen
stated that he agrees and had personally apologized as
well.
Item I, Station Name for Eagle P3 Project—Director Hoy
asked Director Folska about her comments and if she
had an intention of bringing an amendment on this item
in the meeting. Director Folska stated she did not at
this time but did note that from a policy consistency
perspective as well as way finding, and navigation, this
should be consistent. Director Walker indicated he
plans to talk to Anthony Graves with the city to better
understand the city’s position on the order of the name.
IGM Genova indicated that staff had reviewed this and
discovered that most have the number to appear first;
Director Hoy stated that some do and some do not.
Director Bagley stated that in his district, neither the
Littleton/Downtown or the Mineral Station have a

IGM Genova indicated they had a good and productive meeting with the North
Metro elected officials today. They shared the information on the cost to extend
the option for 2016. There were candid conversations and they got into a lot of
details. He believes the stakeholders appreciated the candor. He noted newly
elected Longmont council member, Joan Peck was in attendance. Director Hoy
indicated he thought it was good conversation and the stakeholders are beginning
to talk around “what can we do” to make this a more financially feasible option.
They appear willing to take a look at a number of demands such as improved roads,
etc. to see how that impacts this discussion. Director Hoy expressed he thinks the
tenor of the conversation is changing. Chair Sisk added he is happy that the staff
informed the Board prior to the meeting.
IGM Genova shared we had received invitations to the Alameda Station ribbon
cutting for Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. He will forward the invitation to the full Board.
Chair Sisk stated the invitation to speak had been forwarded to him and in keeping
with our protocols for the District, he has asked Director James to speak at this
event. This is one of our pilot events.
Chair Sisk indicated that the Grand Illumination at DUS will be this Thanksgiving
holiday and Director Archuleta will be lighting the lights.
Director Bagley had several comments:
o He, Directors Walker and James attended the Rail~Volution. He will have
more to talk about in the December meeting.
o He participated in the Boulder Junction ULI-this was an outstanding event.
o On November 2, staff and the Chair attended a meeting with the SW
corridor where they discussed the $125M expenditure needed and the $25M
already expended. This group is looking for ways to come up with the
money but do not have it yet. There were representatives from Douglas
County Commissioners and Highlands Ranch present for this meeting.
o They are looking at station master plans for downtown Littleton. He will be
participating in these meetings.
o He has met with Street Blog and will continue to push for increased
transparency for Board meetings using some form of video technology. It
may be the Chevrolet model initially but he believes we should come up to
par with all other city agencies on videotaping of their meetings. Chair Sisk
stated his regrets that he was not at the meeting to help promote a positive
vote for this service.

Chair Sisk referenced the win by Joan Peck for the Longmont City Council. She ran
on a platform that Longmont was not getting what they have been promised in
FasTracks. He expects this to be a strong message from Longmont and the
community. He noted the Longmont City Council had taken on RTD around the
building of the $17M station and noted there are not bathroom facilities. It is all
about communications and having open and continuous conversation with our
communities and stakeholders.

Airport. She shared that earlier in the day she attended a panel where U.S.
Transportation Secretary Foxx talked about the importance of connecting different
modes of transportation together to have a robust network. She noted that in
District 11 the 61st and Pena TOD station is not yet operational. Additionally,

operation of the A-Line will not begin until April 22, 2016. She asked the Board to
postpone the decision related to the changes in the bus routes in Montbello and
Green Valley Ranch until at least the A-Line is open. Delaying the changes would
allow for a full evaluation with all data to work together to make a good decision
for the community.
Anne Garcia, Chief Financial Officer at Rose Community Foundation and Mile High
Connects Steering Committee Member, thought it was great to see some of RTD’s
wonderful employees being recognized. She said she was here this evening to talk
about RTD’s low income riders. Mile High Connects has been part of the affordable
fares task force, which is comprised of agencies that believe in the importance of
fare affordability for low income riders throughout the District. She noted that
recently the Affordable Fares Task Force had been very focused on a proposed
50% discounted bus pass for low income riders at 150% of the federal poverty
level. The Affordable Fares Task Force recognizes that there are many ways to get
to provide affordability. She noted that the Affordable Fares Task Force has made
recommendations for the nonprofit agency reduced fare program. She said they are
very pleased to see that this feedback has made it into the recommendation and
encouraged the Board to approve the changes; however, this program currently
serves only 8.6% of RTD’s lowest income riders. Even with the expansion it will
only meet a fraction of the needs of the community. She stated that the Affordable
Fares Task Force calls on RTD to make a 50% low income pass available to all who
need it. She said that Mile High Connects and its partners are actively fundraising
to support a match for a low income pass but it is very difficult since RTD has not
allocated any funds to this program in the 2016 Budget. She asked the Board to
make sure there was a commitment from RTD in 2017 for a low income fare
program.
Yolanda Begay, 9 to 5, read the words to America the Beautiful as written by
Katharine Lee Bates during a trip to Pikes Peak. She said it is not surprising that
the Denver Metro area has become one of the most desired places to live in 2015
but there has been tremendous growth in a very short period of time. She pointed
out that RTD had recognized this by expanding service and stations throughout the
metro area. She commented that many beautiful neighborhoods are being
reconstructed with new and expensive high rises, but because of gentrification,
many people are being displaced from these neighborhoods. She said these are
hardworking people making only $8.23 per hour or around $17K per year before
taxes. In Colorado rent on average for a two bedroom apartment costs $1,718 or
around $21K per year. She asked how someone making $8.23 per hour can afford
to live in the Denver Metro Area. She also wonders how RTD expects people
making $8.23 to be able to afford to ride if RTD keeps raising fares. She stated
that if RTD continues to raise fares without considering an affordable, income
based pass then RTD is suppressing a group of people which is a form of violence.

Julie Bennett, 9 to 5, said that she is currently staying in a homeless shelter but
will have her own place soon. She thanked RTD for at least considering working
with nonprofit agencies but also asks that RTD work with the people that cannot
get to a nonprofit agency to access affordable fares. She hopes RTD will create an
income based pass for them as well. She shared that her sister works for Denver
Public Schools and indicated that there have been an increase in absenteeism
because parents cannot afford the bus fare to take their kids to school. She urged
the Board to work with these families and individuals that need help.
Andrea Chiriboga-Flor, 9 to 5, said that her organization and many others are happy
to see there are recommendations for changes to the nonprofit agency reduced fare
program but reiterated that affordable transportation cannot stop there. RTD needs
to have a more extensive reach for people who need a discount through an income
based pass program.
She said that she was also here this evening to stand in solidarity with Green Valley
Ranch and Montbello in asking for a delay in changes to the bus routes in those
communities. She expressed that many people did not feel their input was heard
during RTD’s service change public meetings. She noted that at public hearings for
service changes, an RTD staff member takes notes of the comments. She believes
that if RTD is not willing to record these meetings or have a professional note taker
then RTD is clearly demonstrating that these meetings are not being taken
seriously. She asked for a six month impact report from when the A-Line opens
before any changes in service are made for this community.
Andrea Chiriboga-Flor said she was also here to share the story of one of 9 to 5’s
members who could not attend. This member relies on public transportation but
with prices going up it would be hard for her to even maintain a job. To save
money this member rides her bike to work when the weather is nice and takes the
bus home. This member is a single mom who lives in public housing. She has a
BSA but it is difficult to find a job due to arranging childcare. Currently this
member works 16 hours per week but it is a temporary job. If this member
purchased a day pass every day for $5.20 it would end up costing $104, which is
the equivalent of one week’s pay. This member thinks that nonprofit agencies are
already providing services to the community but are forced to buy nonprofit passes.
This member expressed that these nonprofits are not a bus service, RTD is. This
member does not think that providing affordable fares should be the responsibility
of nonprofits.
Veronica Marshall, Denver, is a student at Florence Crittenton High School and a
teen mom. She said she takes the bus to school and work. She lives in a shelter
and does not have a lot of money. She is trying to save to provide a future for her
and her daughter but it is difficult. She often works late shifts and spends most of
her money on cabs. She stated that she needs a 50% discount. There are many

more people than just her trying to survive with children and perhaps with RTD’s
help they can begin to build a better future for their families.
Adam Dempsey, Windsor Gardens, asked the Board to postpone the proposed
service change for Route 3 at the Alameda and Havana Park-n-Ride. He asked how
anyone could be opposed to a four minute deviation but said there is more than
what meets the eye at that Park-n-Ride. He stated that when the Route 3 service
was reduced during service changes about four years ago and service was reduced
going to Havana and Mississippi, staff told the riders to use the prevailing bus
stops. Adam Dempsey shared that the community came to the Board meeting at
that time and pointed out a safety issue was raised by having seniors with walkers
cross out of the Alameda and Havana Park-n-Ride across eight lanes of traffic to
get to the Route 105 going southbound; as a result RTD put a bus stop on the
south side of Alameda, thereby removing the safety issue. He explained that
changes posed today will create the same safety issue but in the opposite direction.
People who are exiting the Route 105 northbound will have to cross those same
eight lanes of Havana to access the Route 3. He hopes the Board will delay this
change until they can get a better look at the safety issues it creates. He believes
that the four minutes savings created from this change can be found elsewhere
along Route 3.
Angela Cobian, Community Organizer for Together Colorado, said she was here
supporting the efforts of the Affordable Fares Task Force and Mile High Connects.
She hopes that the points made by Veronica Marshall really illustrated the trials and
tribulations she faces every day as a young woman and mother. She stated that
she supports the recommended changes to the nonprofit agency reduced fare
program but it does not go nearly far enough given that wages have been stagnant
for the last 40 years. She believes that RTD needs to catch up to its peer in
Seattle in terms of offering an income based discounted fare program. She also
hopes RTD will consider offering free public transportation to the My Denver card.
She reiterated that she applauds the steps RTD is taking but they do not go far
enough.
Steve Albers, Gunbarrel, wanted to follow-up on some of the comments he made
about Route J. This service was started about 25 years ago at the requested of
the Department of Commerce to serve the Department of Commerce, National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Gunbarrel and Longmont. He noted that
the population of Gunbarrel is growing which bodes well for the overall health of
the Route J. He noted that the proposal would terminate Route J sooner on the
southbound service, right at the CU campus. He believes the bus would proceed
anyway on Broadway after the proposed termination; therefore it would be of little
impact to retain one or more stops southbound on Broadway. Similarly, he thinks
the evening northbound routes could consider staging at Baseline and Broadway.
Both of these recommendations would mitigate some of the shortening of the

Route J. He noted that ridership is better during the school year and recommended
only discontinuing the 6:03 p.m. northbound trip during the summer. He said these
also reflect the comments of a number of his colleagues, which he does not believe
are reflected in the information that was provided to the Board.
Doug Gragg, Denver, commented that he rides Routes 10, 0, 15, and 20 and often
chats with many of his fellow riders. He shared that everyone he speak with thinks
it is criminal extortion to raise the already very high bus rates. He said that he was
at a recent RTD Board of Directors Committee meeting at which there was
discussion of moving the 16th Street Mall Shuttle to 15th and 17th Street. He highly
encouraged the Board to not give into the City of Denver as getting between 15th
and 17th can be quite burdensome. He said it is so tiresome he is more likely to just
stay home.
Daniela Villarreal, Community Organizer for Rights for all People, said that her
organizations is also in support of an income based pass. She explained that her
organization had collected 400 pledge cards from community members that support
an income based pass. These are real people who would benefit from, and qualify
for, an income based pass. She encouraged the Board to continue thinking of ways
that an income based pass can be done through the RTD budget. She recognized
Director Folska for her idea of setting aside marijuana taxes for an income based
pass. She acknowledged that RTD has a lot going on but she knows it can be
done.
Stephanie Noll shared that she works for Mi Casa Resource Center. Mi Casa works
with low income families who are trying to advance their educational opportunities
and economic success. Mi Casa offers a variety of training programs including job
training, ESL, computer classes, etc. She stated that last year Mi Casa served
1000s of people; however, despite participating in RTD’s nonprofit agency reduced
fare program they were only able to distribute 12 passes and less than 50 tickets
per month. She expressed that Mi Casa supports the proposed changes to the
program but believes more work needs to be done for affordability. She asked RTD
to make a 50% discount fare available to all low income residents.
Mayra Gonzales, Community Organizer with Montbello, encouraged the Board to
find a real solution to the fare crisis that has been created. She thinks the nonprofit
agency reduced fare program is a good start but does not go far enough. She
stated that it is cheaper for her to buy a car, gas and insurance as opposed to
buying a bus pass. She said she can only imagine how much more this will cost for
entire families. She expressed that without access to affordable fares families
cannot get to school, work, doctors’ appointments, etc.
Mayra Gonzales shared that after speaking with the riders at a Park-n-Ride in
Montbello it was clear that they were unaware of the proposed service changes
that will negatively impact them and are still confused about the fare changes. She
stated that RTD is pricing Montbello out and cutting much needed service. She

asked RTD to refrain from making any service changes in the community until a six
month impact study was conducted.
Margaret Gomes, 9 to 5, has been working in this community for seven years. She
echoed what others had said that the nonprofit agency reduced fare program was
not enough. She stated that she was here this evening for the same reason she
was last month and will be next month which is that the community needs
affordable transportation and they will not leave until they get it. She said that
there are many people being forced to work for poverty level wages while are
experiencing rampant displacement from places they have called home for
generations. She wants to make sure their lifeline, which is public transportation, is
actually adequate for their needs. She expressed that the community keeps hearing
about affordability but they have not heard anything related to a timeline for an
income based pass. She stated that the community needs answers and they need
them now.
Candace Johnson, Jobs with Justice, said she also participates in the Affordable
Fares Task Force. She is glad to see an expansion of the nonprofit agency reduced
fare program but it still will not be sufficient to accommodate a significant portion
of the riders that need public transportation. She stated that nonprofit agencies are
already overburdened. She believes that RTD should do all it can to provide a
public good, which is the public good that RTD was meant to provide; RTD should
do everything it can to accommodate and prioritize low income riders, not pass it
off to nonprofit agencies. RTD needs to continue to explore options for an income
based pass. She said the community is committed to working with RTD but are
looking towards the Board’s leadership. She stated that RTD needs to do better.
Brittany Ott, Praxis, said she was here to ask the Board not to raise fares. She is
from a low income family and speaks on behalf of two homeless organizations.
The homeless need to be able to afford to get to classes and various support
organizations.
Karen Worminghaus, eGo CarShare, thanked RTD for listening to the feedback
received from the Affordable Fares Task Force. She thinks the administrative
simplification for the nonprofit agency reduced fare program is a move in the right
direction. She said her message is to keep the momentum going. She noted that
there seems to be a lot of concern from the Board that RTD remain fiscally
sustainable; however, the 18% increase for the program represents a nominal
impact to RTD’s budget. This is an opportunity for RTD to make a meaningful
change in the lives of our neighbors who need the service most. She suggests not
putting a cap on the program but allowing staff to change it as needed and if there
is funding available. She asked RTD to continue to work on a more comprehensive
low income pass program.
Caitlyn Lowell, 9 to 5, stated that the need for a low income pass is urgent. She
shared that just last week she spoke with a single mother who had been priced out

noted that there was also an audit of RTD that was released by the State on Tuesday,
October 20, 2015. He said this is something RTD is digesting and taking very seriously.
He expressed that no one at RTD liked the results but RTD is committed to getting better.
He stated that there was no desire to push this under the rug; this needs to be brought
forward so RTD can show we are responding in a positive way.
Director Folska shared that on October 3rd she took a group of Girl Scouts to Denver Union
Station for a blindfolded tour in conjunction with WTS, an organization that mentors young
girls interested in transportation. She said this is a great tradition that was started three
years ago with just 9 Girl Scouts. This year there was a group of 45 with a waiting list.
Director Folska informed the Board that she recently took 30 of her constituents to the
Elati Light Rail facility which was very well received. She said her community really
enjoyed meeting the staff. She expressed that she cannot thank staff enough for their
warm hospitality. Director Folska believes tours like these really make it easier for people
to understand everything that goes into providing Light Rail service.
Director Folska shared that she recently hosted a group from Kazakhstan who was very
impressed with what RTD has done.
Chair Sisk said he cannot emphasize enough the time Directors spend outside of Board
meetings. He stated that if he does not mention something in his report it is not because
it is not important but just because there are so many activities going on.
Director Anderson asked if this was the appropriate time for Directors to report on their
activities. Chair Sisk said he thinks New Business would be the proper time.

January 2016 Service Plan

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the January 2016 Service Change package as revised and summarized
in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $870,350 and, further,
to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as
necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

Free Rides for Members of the Military

It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free rides on
RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should be extended from the
presently approved date of December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Utilization has
been minimal to date and this extension will have minimal impact on RTD.

Recommended Changes to the Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that RTD staff be
authorized to make changes to the RTD Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program as
detailed in Attachment A of this action to be implemented by January 1, 2016.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to approve the
recommended changes to the non-profit agency
reduced fare program.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Anderson stated that she would be supporting
the recommendation; however, she wanted it on the
record that RTD’s mission is to provide transportation.
RTD does not do low income housing or a lot of other
things. She said that much of the public comment this
evening had to do with social welfare issues. She
realizes there are some things that RTD can do but RTD
cannot solve all of these problems. She reiterated that
she would be supporting this recommendation even
though she thought very seriously about changing her
vote because RTD cannot seem to give enough.
Everyone expects RTD to keep doing more. She hopes
that staff and the Affordable Fares Task Force come to
the table with a plan that does not impact RTD’s
service.
Director Hoy expressed that he shares some of Director
Anderson’s concerns. He said he can support most of
this program but he does have a problem with the fiscal
impact. He stated that at the committee meeting staff
clearly outlined that if these changes had been
deployed in 2014 it would have resulted in $400K less
in revenue. That is $400K that RTD struggles with all

B.

the time. He pointed out that RTD’s focus is to get
people from A to B in a safe, efficient manner. He
noted that there was testimony this evening that bus
passes are expensive and he agrees. They are
expensive because it costs a lot of money to run buses.
If RTD does not have income, RTD cannot run buses.
He commented that there were also requests to not
eliminate service in certain areas. Buses run on dollars.
Buses do not run because RTD gives discounts.
Director Hoy stated that he was sympathetic to people
that do not make enough money. He shared that in his
family there have been individuals that needed help;
however, he does not believe that RTD is a social
agency. RTD is responsible for transportation, not an
individual household’s financial dilemma. He said for all
those reasons he will not be supporting the
recommendation this evening.
Director Francone echoed Director Hoy’s comments.
She wondered, in the event that this recommendation
does pass, who will monitor compliance with the
elimination of the quarterly and annual reports and
what the sanctions might be for non-compliance. She
said she cannot support this motion for many of the
reasons expressed by Director Hoy. She is not
unsympathetic to low income struggles as she herself
has been in that situation. She expressed that the
community’s pleas do not fall on deaf ears but RTD’s
mission is to provide transportation and that costs
money. She noted that RTD already subsidizes a good
portion of the cost of providing transportation.
Director Lubow said she felt the need to express a
different point of view. She thinks the audience and
RTD’s riders need to know that there are a variety of
views on the Board about providing affordable fares.
She feels more strongly than ever that RTD has a great
responsibility to help the constituents be able to use
RTD’s services. She believes RTD should look at every
place we can get money to do that. She thinks that is

Director Solano concurred with Director Lubow’s
comments. He believes it is important that RTD try to
put everyone on the bus. No one should be left out.
He wondered if people cannot get on the bus what are
their options. He stated that raising rates just makes
congestion worse.
Director Tobiassen believes RTD needs to be fair to as
many people as possible. He noted that this particular
program is for a small group of people who receive a
discount similar to the discounts afforded to other pass
programs. He thinks if the Board was to look at the
nuts and bolts the savings could be justified as it is for
other programs.
Director Folska believes this is a public service for the
public good. She said that she will be supporting this
because she believes that RTD can do well when RTD
does good.
Chair Sisk noted that this was a recommendation he
supported and continues to support, but in terms of
being intimidated or threatened that will not go
anywhere with him. He said that people have the right
to come and speak but it should be a matter of having
a civil dialogue. He believes that a lot more can get
done when everyone works together. He stated that
he is a big supporter but he can easily be dissuaded by
tactics. He thinks that common ground can be found.
He shared that this is the first time he has been scolded
for making a recommendation that people agreed with.
He said that does not sit well with him.
Director Archuleta reminded the Board that RTD is a
public entity to serve the public.

Board Protocols for Community Engagement and Events

It is recommended by the Executive Committee that the Board of Directors adopt these
guidelines for planning RTD public hearings, public meetings and special events to
coordinate with RTD Board members’ schedules, and for informing Board members and
senior leadership of relevant third-party meetings and events.
Motion to
Amend:

Director Lasater made the motion to amend the Board
Protocols as it relates to RTD Board Member Speaking
Events to indicate that if an event was held in a
Director’s District they would be the primary designee,
not the Chair of the Board.

“During some RTD events and meetings, it may be appropriate to include
RTD Board members or staff in the speaking program. RTD staff will engage
Board members and staff as appropriate to participate in a meeting or special
event program. The Board member where an event or meeting will occur
will be the designated participant on the Board’s behalf. If an event is a
global event than the Board Chair will determine which Director(s) speak.

Director Solano seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Director Lasater believes that if an event is specific to a
Director’s District than that Director should be the
primary designate. If it is a global event then the Board
Chair should have priority.
Director Hoy stated he will vote no for the amendment.
He expressed concern that this is a last minute change
that may not match with the rest of the protocols. He
said its intention is that this is something that should be
addressed in the future. Director Hoy indicated that he
would also vote no for the action. He does not think a
Board meeting is where the details of something like
this should be worked out.
Director Anderson said she would be voting against the
amendment. She believes Director Lubow did a good
job with her recommended changes. She stated that
she does not think the protocols needed fixing yet. She
believes the Board should see how the protocols as
initially recommended work first.

Vote on
Amendment:

The motion failed with 5 in favor (Archuleta,
Deadwyler, Lasater, Lubow, Solano) and 6 opposed

Packet Pg. 103

12.A

DISCUSSION
The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2016 Recommended Budget (combined
Base and FasTracks) is $2,537.0 million. This includes an operating expense budget of $635.4
million, interest expense of $117.3 million, capitalized interest of $33.0 million, new capital
expenditures of $484.9 million, debt payments of $61.7 million, FasTracks contingency reserve
of $15.9 million, FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $23.5 million, Board appropriated fund
of $35.0 million, capital replacement fund of $27.3 million, and estimated unrestricted fund
balance of $15.8 million. The previously approved capital (capital carry forward) is $1,087.2
million. The sum of the budget appropriation and capital carry forward is $2,537.0 million.
Overview of the 2016 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $1,121.7 million on a combined basis are expected to increase $141.1 million
(14.4%) in 2016 from the 2015 Amended Budget. The increase is due to 1) an increase in fare
revenue of $34.7 million, 2) an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $39.1 million, and 3) an
increase in grant revenue of $69.6 million, and 4) an increase in other income of $0.7 million,
offset by a decrease in investment income of $3.1 million.







Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenues of $158.1 million are budgeted
to increase 28.1% over the 2015 Amended Budget. On the Base System, fare revenue is
budgeted to increase 10% in alignment with the new fare structure in 2016; however,
ridership growth is expected to be flat to minimal. For FasTracks, farebox revenue is
budgeted to increase $22.8 million over the 2015 Amended Budget to $26.8 million due
to the opening of five new service lines (I-225, US36 BRT, East, Gold, and Northwest Rail
electrified segment). The FasTracks estimate is per the Annual Program Evaluation.
Sales and use tax revenues of $590.5 million in 2015 are expected to increase 8.0% over
the 2015 projected level according to the most recent September quarterly forecast by
the CU-Leeds School of Business.
Total Base System grants are projected to increase $8.5 million over the 2015 Amended
Budget, including new and carry forward amounts. Base System grants are estimated to
total $115.2 million in 2016; of that amount, $87.2 million is new grants while projected
carryforward grant funding is $28.0 million. FasTracks grants are budgeted to increase
$61.1 million from the 2015 Amended Budget due primarily to an estimated $58.2 million
New Starts grant for the Southeast Rail extension, as well as increases in CMAQ-Eagle
and US36 FASTER grants.
Investment income is budgeted to decrease $3.1 million from continued low short term
interest rates coupled with deployment of invested funds. Other income will remain
largely flat, increasing at the CPI or as identified.

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $635.4 million on a combined basis in 2016 (excluding
depreciation), which is $79.9 million higher compared to the 2015 Amended Budget. The
increase is due to: 1) budgeting for the DTO service payment of $57.1 million for the first time in
2016, 2) one-time costs of approximately $4.3 million for the Grand Opening activities for the
new FasTracks service lines, 3) cost allocation for the new service lines in 2016, 4) increased
contributions totaling $2.5 million to the salaried and union pension and benefit plans, 5)
additional operator shift differential pay and pay for split shifts totaling approximately $3.3
million, and 6) the expense project carryforward totaling $51.7 million. The expense project
carryforward to 2016 is $15.9 million for Base System operations and $35.9 million for

Packet Pg. 104

12.A

FasTracks. It should be noted that substantial reductions were made to departmental operating
budgets to align them with the SBP target, which offset the above increases over 2015.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at the lock price of $2.23 per gallon, compared to a price of $2.95 per
gallon in the 2015 Amended Budget, for savings of $7.5 million. Gasoline is budgeted at
$3.00/gallon, down from the 2015 per gallon budget price of $3.40, for savings of $630,000.
The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to the posted
Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the Requested
Budget consist of the expense projects carry-forward.
Interest expense in 2016 is budgeted at $117.3 million on a combined basis, an increase of
$21.9 million over the 2015 Amended Budget. The increase is due to the issuance of COP debt
in 2015 and anticipated debt issuances in 2016. Of total interest expense, $27.3 million is
budgeted for Base System and $90.0 million is budgeted for FasTracks. Capitalized interest
(combined) is budgeted at $33.0 million, the majority of which will occur in FasTracks Project.
Capitalized interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for interest payments in 2016.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $61.7 million on a combined basis, which is $2.8
million higher than the 2015 Amended Budget. Base System principal payments of $51.9 million
are $1.9 million higher due to scheduled amortization of the COPs issued for fleet purchases (bus
and rail). FasTracks principal payments of $9.8 million are $0.8 million higher due to issuance of
COPs and scheduled principal amortization on current debt. Financing proceeds from the
issuance of new debt is budgeted at $150.0 million in new bond funds for capital program
construction for FasTracks (mainly the Southeast Rail extension). No debt issuances are planned
for the Base System. Such financing proceeds are budgeted to be $179.1 million lower from the
2015 Amended Budget because both entities will supplement debt issuance by drawing from
previously issued debt to fund major capital purchases and construction in 2016.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2015 (previously
approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2016. The
capital carry-forward will be $1,087.2 million made up of $178.0 million on the Base System
and $909.2 million on FasTracks.
New capital spending on a combined basis of $484.9 million will decrease $169.9 million from
the 2015 Amended Budget due mainly to project completion in FasTracks. New capital spending
for FasTracks will decrease $174.3 million to $373.3 million in 2016 due to on-going project
completion on the East Line, US36 BRT, and Northwest Rail, offset by increases to the
Southeast Extension and I-225. For the Base System, new capital spending will increase $4.4
million to $111.6 million. Of this amount, the Base system will spend $0.1 million more on Parkn-Rides, and $39.4 million more on fleet modernization/expansion (bus and rail). These increases
will be offset by $4.1 million less on facilities construction and maintenance (primarily Civic
Center), $0.5 million less on bus infrastructure (local government requests), $16.5 million less in
capital support projects (primarily IT support for the District), and $13.8 million less on Rail
transit (project completion). The Base System new capital was approved as part of the Strategic
Budget Plan in August 2015.
New capital expenditures for 2016 and the change in new capital in the 2016 Recommended
Budget over the previous 2015 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget Plan are shown in
Attachment B. The capital carry-forward expenditures for 2016 and the change in the capital

Packet Pg. 105

12.A

carry-forward in the 2016 Recommended Budget over the 2015 Amended Budget are shown in
Attachment C.
Notable designated fund balance changes include a decrease of $3.5 million in the Base System
year-end unrestricted fund balance from the 2015 Amended Budget to $6.5 million. This
projected fund balance is still $1.3 million higher than the SBP target of $5.2 million after
incorporating all revenue and expense adjustments. The actual amount realized, however, may
be lower than the projected $6.5 million due to possible slippage in fare revenue and sales tax
revenue in 2015 (this will become evident in the 2016 amended budget). Also on the Base
System, the Board-appropriated fund is projected to increase by $3.0 million to $25.2 million,
and the capital replacement fund is projected to increase by $3.0 million to $18.0 million.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to decrease $0.2 million from
the 2015 Amended Budget to $15.8 million. The $3.5 million decrease in the Base System’s
unrestricted fund balance is offset by an increase of $3.3 million on FasTracks. On a Districtwide basis, the Board-appropriated fund and the capital replacement fund are projected to
increase by $13.1 million in total. These increases are in minimum accordance with fiscal
policies for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks Projects, and FasTracks
Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.
The FasTracks Construction Reserve at $81.3 million is split between the Construction Reserve
at $56.3 million and a Start-up Operations Reserve at $25.0 million. The Start-up Operations
Reserve was established in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation for the years 2015-2016 in
order to meet the 1.2x debt service coverage if needed. These balances reflect draws totaling
$18.7 million for FasTracks continuing construction.
The FasTracks Contingency Reserve will be maintained at a balance of $15.9 million in the 2016
Budget, net of a drawdown of $14.1 million for North Metro construction.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2016 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado
General Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA
farebox revenues divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures
and expenditures incurred for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure)
exceeds the annual target of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.
Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2016 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated
fund, a capital replacement fund, and an undesignated working capital fund (the remaining
unrestricted year-end fund balance) for both the Base System and FasTracks. The objective is
for the total of these three funds to equal approximately three months of operating expenses
excluding depreciation for the Base System and two months of same for FasTracks. The 2016
budget reflects continued maintenance of the FasTracks contingency reserve at a level deemed
sufficient to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule.
The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2016 on a District-wide basis is projected at
$78.1 million, comprised of 1) the Board appropriated fund of $35.0 million, 2) the capital
replacement fund of $27.3 million, and 3) an undesignated working capital fund or remaining

fund balance of $15.8 million. The Base System portion of the three fund balances for 2016 is
projected to total $49.7 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two
exceptions:





Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.
Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.
Attachments

As noted above, please refer to the attached Fiscal Year 2016 Recommended Budget and Fiscal
Year 2016 Recommended Budget-Fund Balance (Exhibit I) which shows the operating/nonoperating sources, debt and reserves, and capital sources as well as operating uses, capital
expenditures, and fund balances of the District, and a reconciliation of net assets. Also attached
is the Program Capital Summary including previously approved capital, an Operating Budget
Changes Since Posted Budget summary (Attachment A), a New Capital Projects summary
(Attachment B), and Capital Carryforward Expenditures (Attachment C).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2016 Recommended Budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Revise the 2016 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed revisions.
3. Do not adopt the 2016 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended since the District
will not be in compliance with State regulations that require the District to adopt a budget by
December 31, 2015. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2015, State
statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations and
maintenance purposes and objects is deemed reappropriated."

Subject:

Local Government Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
Interim General Manager and CEO or his designee to enter into an agreement for Local Government
Liaison services with CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) to exercise the fourth option year (January 1, 2016
through December 31, 2016) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a cost of $122,496. Funding for
this contract is included in the annual FasTracks budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Local Government Liaison services was issued on October 20, 2011.
Eight responsive proposals were received for evaluation. Three of the teams were interviewed by a
procurement panel, and a recommendation was subsequently referred to the Executive Committee on
December 15, 2011. The Executive Committee unanimously approved the recommendation that CRL
Associates, Inc. be offered a contract which provided for a one-year base price with four (4) one-year
option periods. The referenced extension covers the fourth and final option period from January 1,
2016 to December 31, 2016. CRL will continue to provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison
services.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the elected officials and
staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and
economic development organizations. This team has a broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns,
as well as an extensive network of relationships with local governments, elected officials, and
stakeholders along the Front Range.
As part of the Local Government Liaison services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and the
Chairman of the Board to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and
county levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular
outreach to the business community and economic development organizations in the Metro area to
develop partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues of concern.
CRL will represent RTD at meetings at the local level of government and provide professional advice,
counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local government activities as they relate to RTD. CRL will also
provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the fourth option year ($122,496) are included in the annual budget for the FasTracks
program.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to exercise the fourth option
year (January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a
cost of $122,496.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager to
enter into an agreement to exercise the fourth option year on the contract for the Local
Government Liaison services. A new Request for Proposals could be sent to interested
parties, and a new Local Government Liaison firm could be retained. This action is not
recommended because CRL Associates, Inc. has been very effective in assisting RTD with
local government matters in the past, and this group is very familiar with RTD’s issues and
policies.

University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus
and Rail 2016 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plan package as summarized
in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $17,078,000, exclusive of University
of Colorado A Line Operating and Maintenance costs, and further, to authorize the Interim General
Manager and CEO or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators
whose service is impacted by these changes.
BACKGROUND
As part of the overall FasTracks program to enhance rail service in the Denver region, the upcoming East
and I-225 rail lines also known as the University of Colorado A Line and R Line respectively will
represent significant milestones in achieving improved connectivity and travel times for RTD customers.
The University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plan (East and I-225 Corridor Service
Plan) contains recommendations for developing a restructured bus network capable of meeting the
demand and mobility needs generated by the expansion of commuter rail and light rail services.
Recommendations in this proposal were formulated based on a comprehensive assessment of existing
conditions, service area demographics, transit market research, route performance and analysis, and
stakeholder input.
The study area of this proposal is defined by 104th Avenue to the north, Tower Road and DIA to the
east, Hampden Avenue to the south, and downtown Denver to the west. The study area includes the
cities of Aurora and Denver.
The University of Colorado A Line is a new 22.8-mile electrified commuter rail line that will operate
between Denver Union Station (DUS) and Denver International Airport (DIA) with connections to
adjacent employment centers, neighborhoods, and development areas in the City of Denver and Aurora.
The University of Colorado A Line will serve seven stations, including Denver Union Station, 38th/Blake,
40th/Colorado, Central Park, Peoria, 40th Ave & Airport Blvd/Gateway Park, 62nd/Pena Boulevard, and
DIA. Total travel time between Denver Union Station and DIA is projected to be approximately 37
minutes. The University of Colorado A Line, by the nature of its alignment and planned services will
replace SkyRide Routes AF, AS and the downtown Express Route 47X.
The R Line is a new 10.5-mile light rail line extension within the City of Aurora that will provide key
regional connections to the existing East and Southeast Rail Lines with stops serving major activity
centers including the Aurora City Center, Anschutz/Fitzsimons Medical Center and DIA, the latter
through a transfer at Peoria to the University of Colorado A Line. The R Line extension will serve nine
new stations along the I-225 corridor, including Peoria, Fitzsimons, Colfax, 13th Avenue, 2nd & Abilene,
Aurora City Center, Florida, and Iliff Avenue, along with current stations at Nine Mile, Dayton, Bellview,
Orchard, Arapahoe, Dry Creek, County Line and Lincoln. Total travel time between Nine Mile and Peoria

Packet Pg. 135

13.C

is projected to be 32 minutes, while the travel time of the entire R-Line from Peoria to Lincoln is
projected to be 57 minutes. The R-Line light rail alignment will connect the existing Nine Mile Station
with the new Peoria Station and University of Colorado A Line commuter rail service. Existing light rail
service in the I-225 Corridor is currently provided on the H Line from Nine Mile Station to the
18th/California Station in downtown Denver operating on a 15 minute all-day frequency. Under the
proposed operating scenario, the H Line would be extended beyond the Nine Mile Station to serve the
two future R Line stations at Iliff and Florida. Service on the R Line in its entirety will operate between
Peoria Station and Lincoln Station on the Southeast Corridor. The new R Line is 22 miles long in its
entirety (Lincoln to Peoria) and travel time from Peoria to Lincoln is estimated to be 57 minutes.
DISCUSSION
The critical goal for the University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is to build a
simple, easy-to-use network that is comprised of a family of bus and rail services, all focusing on
delivering the overall network experience desired by existing and potential customers.
Significant investments have been made in new rail alignments to improve regional mobility. The East
Corridor offers new fast regional train service between downtown Denver and Denver International
Airport (DIA) and provides new network opportunities. The I-225 Corridor Rail completes the connection
between the East and the Southeast Corridors and also opens new network opportunities for both rail
and bus transit. As a result, the adjacent or intersecting bus routes have been considered for
realignment to serve the new rail stations, resources of duplicative bus service reallocated, and bus route
alignment changes made to refocus network coverage. Through these actions, an integrated transit
network is proposed that will attract riders, reduce operating costs, and strengthen regional and
community mobility.
The following route design strategies were used in the development of this proposal, which focus not
only maintaining high operating efficiency, but providing an improved customer experience that will
attract more riders and operating revenue:
Route Streamlining
The East and I-225 Corridor Service Plan calls for limiting deviations to areas that can justify the
additional travel time and costs by high ridership on the deviation – areas such as rail stations,
transit hubs, and major destinations in order make individual routes, as well as the transit
network, more productive and attractive to riders. In cases where the deviation was providing
needed lifeline coverage, alternative service was proposed while also proposing streamlined
corridor bus transit.
Short-Lining
Routes often vary in terms of ridership and performance along the length of their alignments.
Generally, areas with higher population and employment densities generate more ridership than
areas with lower densities. Providing higher levels of service along segments of the route, short
of the entire length of the route efficiently directs resources to areas with higher demand along a
route.
Corridor Segment Consolidation
In some instances where multiple routes serve the same corridor at different points, it is more
intuitive for the customer to have one streamlined route that serves the corridor continuously. If
general travel patterns on the corridor show a higher degree of through travel relative to local
mobility, routes that link complimentary origins and destinations together were consolidated to

Packet Pg. 136

13.C

increase rider convenience by eliminating or reducing transfers required to complete their trip
along a natural transit corridor.
Route Segmentation
In contrast to the segment consolidation strategy, where routes exhibited a very high proportion
of rider transfer activity at a single point, the benefits of separating those routes into two distinct
routes at that point to improve schedule adherence or scheduling efficiency was evaluated. This
was primarily due to the low number of riders remaining on the bus and traveling through the
point in question. These actions also results in routes with more balanced service levels on either
side of this midpoint based on demand.
Low Performing Service Replacement
If a route or route segment performed poorly and the potential to improve performance appeared
to be limited within the existing configuration, then alternatives to fixed route service were
considered.
The University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is slated to be implemented with
the beginning of the April 24, 2016 run-board, after the opening of the University of Colorado A Line on
April 22, 2016. The R-Line is currently expected to open later in the Fall-Winter of 2016. The East and I225 Rail Corridors Preliminary Service Plan was completed on July 1, 2015. Stakeholder meetings to
review the preliminary plan were held between July 8 and August 10, 2015. A review of the preliminary
plan was presented in the August 11, 2015 RTD Board Operations and Customer Services Committee
meeting, resulting in revisions to the preliminary plan prior to the public meeting process. Public
comments were taken up to October 9, 2015, along with subsequent meetings with municipal and
community organizations leading to an update to the RTD Operations Committee, provided on October
20, 2015.
The Final University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is proposed herein is as
result of an extensive study of the area conducted by RTD Staff and consultants; ongoing interactions
within RTD (Board Members and staff), and with community and municipal organizations and individuals.
This proposal can be viewed as a starting point for a continued effort to improve overall transportation
mobility and increase transit market share in the Eastern Metro area, through a multi-modal integrated
transit network.
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Eight public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended between September
21st and October 9th of this year. There were over 100 in attendance at the public meetings and more
than 81 comments heard through RTD’s service change website. Letters from the municipal, civic and
community organizations were also received both in support and showing concern for the proposal.
Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment B of this
report. Letters received are contained in Attachment C.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the
University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail service change:

Route 157 – Aurora Metro Center/CCA/Buckley AFB: Buckley AFB service adjusted
Route 169L – Buckley Tower DIA Limited: – retained
Route 483 – Lincoln/Parker/Nine Mile: rerouted in Parker and increased peak frequency
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The base system cost impact of the University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus Service Plan is
estimated to be $478,000 annualized exclusive of the University of Colorado A Line Operating and
Maintenance (O&M) costs and the R-Line O&M costs. The operating and maintenance costs of the
University of Colorado A Line are a part of the Eagle P3 availability payments funded by FasTracks and
are difficult to disaggregate. The cost impact of the R Line (and H Line extension) are also FasTracks
budget items and are projected to cost an estimated $16.6M annualized.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed University of Colorado A Line and R
Line Bus and Rail Service Plan service changes do not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by
minority or low-income populations.

Route Recommendations
Route 3L – East Alameda Limited – Implement January 2017
 Service east of Aurora Metro Center Station (Centrepoint & Sable) to Ohio/Buckley
will be discontinued. Ridership east of Sable Blvd. averages 34 passengers/day, or
5 passengers/trip. Excellent service is available via Route 133 with 15 minute peak
frequency and 30 minute frequency at all other times of the day, and provides
convenient connection opportunities at Aurora Metro Center Station.
 This change will be implemented with the opening of the R-Line in late 2016.
Route 6 – East 6th Avenue SPLIT
 Route 6 is proposed to be split into two routes, Route 6-East 6th Avenue and Route
19-North Pecos: Route 6 will terminate at 12th/Larimer at the Auraria Campus.
Route 6 routing will otherwise remain unchanged.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
 It is proposed to discontinue Route 10 service east of the Community College of
Aurora to Buckley Air Force Base. Route 10 service to Buckley will be replaced by
proposed new Route 157. The new eastern terminal location for Route 10 will be
the Community College of Aurora – CentreTech Campus.

Potomac, 2nd Avenue, Abilene Street, 4th Avenue, and Billings Street.

Route 21 – Evans Avenue
 Sunday/holiday frequency will be improved from every 60 to every 30 minutes.

-Request for service along Arapahoe Road east of Arapahoe Crossing as far as Grandview
H.S.
-The elimination of the Route 169L and the change in fare to DIA were also concerns
voiced by attendee.

Blake Administration Downtown Denver
12:00 noon
The meeting began at 12:00pm with12 members of the public present and 6 RTD staff
members. After a description of the purpose of the meeting, comments concerning the
service change were heard. Most of the comments were in the nature of questions going
after specifics on the service changes as follows:
- a current customer who often takes very early flights from DIA – often around 6:00 am
and was concerned whether the new rail would be operating early enough to get him to
these flights on time.
-concerns about how the changes to Route 10 would affect service on routes 10, 40, 43
& 73
-a person who works as a transportation coordinator for the Aurora Public Schools is
concerned about the accessibility for students to many of their education facilities if the
Route 10 is cut back. The additional service proposed for routes 157 and 169 were
explained to her, but we will be in further contact to work out as many details as need be
and resources can provide.
-a customer who lives in a Senior Citizens High Rise near 26th & Newton was concerned
that our proposed changes to the route 28 would cut her service on the west side.
-a customer who has recently moved to the Park Hill neighborhood, partly because of the
availability of bus service, is concerned about the discontinuance of this route in this
neighborhood. He lives in-between the route 20 and the route 43. He said that he could
use the route 20, but often has found that he’s had to wait past a “bus or two” because
these buses being overloaded with, what he presumed to be students going to East High
School. He wanted to know that RTD’s “philosophy” was regarding getting people from
their cars: whether RTD wants to provide bus service that would be accessed from their
homes or whether RTD wants them to drive to PnR locations.

RTD Director Ton Tobiassen
I am sending you my thoughts regarding the schedule change on the 130H. I am a
resident at Heather Gardens, visually handicapped, retired; and work part time
and like myself, there are others at HG who depend on public transportation on a
daily basis. In order to ride the 130 it would require a walk of up to one mile which
would be difficult for some seniors and riskyespecially during inclement weather.
I would also point out that cancelling route 130H will not add ridership, but will
drop those passengers using the service through heather Gardens on Marina Drive.
Putting the bus out on Yale for one mile to Peoria accomplishes nothing as this line
is already served by the 130 and 131. Please reconsider the proposed change.
Thank you for your consideration

The Stapleton Foundation for Sustainable Urban Communities, in partnership with residents, Denver
Health, and several local community organizations, as part of an Racial and Ethnic Approaches to
Community Health (REACH) grant award from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) hosted several
Community forums and Stakeholder meetings with community members from Northeast Park Hill,
Greater Park Hill, Stapleton, Northwest Aurora and Montbello neighborhoods in the Spring of 2015. The
most recent Stakeholder group (17 people) meeting brought together community residents and
members of RTD staff to discuss the proposed service plans for the new Commuter Rail line. During this
meeting the following was discussed:

Transit users expressed concerns with the proposed discontinuation of the Route #28 East of
Downtown in the Northeast Park Hill neighborhood. Although the ridership may be low, there
are frequent users during peak times. Many students use the Route #28 to get to better schools
outside of their neighborhood and if it is discontinued it will place an undue burden on the
community. Also, one transit user rode the #28 to the meeting catching it from downtown at
5:30 pm and noted that the bus had 30 passengers on the trip. The majority of these riders are
commuters traveling home from work. Although there is a proposal to expand services along
MLK, Stakeholders expressed concern for the older demographic that utilize transit not being
able to walk the additional distance to access this route. Stakeholders would like to see the
route revisited to identify ways to maintain the route for students, seniors and weekday
commuters. Would like to connect RTD with DPS regarding concern about student transit users.
When RTD starts public meeting process a number will be provided for public comment.
Residents have also inquired about accessibility to bike paths and B-Cycle expansion to cover the
new A-line commuter rail stations.
Residents of Montbello expressed concern over the consolidation of routes in the Montbello
neighborhood. The proposed changes will have a large negative impact on the community and
greatly increase the walking distance between routes. Consider that while decisions are made
based on ridership. If only, 4% this low percent could impact 12,000 people.
Montbello Residents also needed clarity around the proposed closure and relocation of the 40th
and Albrook Park-n-Ride to the Commuter Rail station at Smith Road and Peoria. There is a lot
of confusion around the Park-n-Ride is closing. Be careful about how communicating. It is
important to communicate that the Park part is closing but there will still be bus ride service at
that location. Although the bus service will still service the 40th and Albrook location, residents
are concerned about the safety of moving all bus boarding to Albrook. An alternative put forth
is to maintain the off-street turn around for the busses while moving the parking to the
Commuter Rail station. Residents are also willing to discuss additional alternatives that will
make boarding the bus at 40th and Albrook safe for all.
Residents requested that information be communicated better to the public about fare zones.
Stapleton residents charged RTD to look for more affordable solutions for bus passes (i.e.
income based bus passes) so one would not have to go through Department of Human Services
or some community agency.

City/County of Denver Comments on RTD Preliminary Service Plans
East and I-225 Corridors, Gold and Northwest Corridors
1. Station Area Plans - In the Relevant Studies section, it would be helpful to add all CCD station
area plans. CCD stations with completed station area plans relevant to these service plans
include 41st and Fox (Gold), 38th and Blake, Elyria-Swansea Neighborhood, and 61st and Pena (all
East). Many of these plans include bus service other transit related recommendations. Has RTD
reviewed these documents and considered any of the recommendations?
2. The plan and associated maps do not clearly explain what is happening to existing services
within the plan area. It would help if all routes not affected by any proposed changes are
identified in the document. Two examples noted include:
a. Route 48 – This route serves Elyria-Swansea and the Brighton Blvd corridor and it’s
omitted from the service plan. This route currently serves a key portion of Swansea that
should maintain service. Map 9 may show the route, but it is not marked, and map 10
appears to omit the route and others identified on map 9 that are not identified as
discontinued on that map.
b. Route 38 – This route on 38th Avenue is not mentioned in the Gold/NW plan document.
3. Pena Blvd Station (61st and Pena):
a. Please include in all plan maps
b. As the A line begins operations, it might be useful for RTD to monitor utilization patterns
of commuters for both the Pena Blvd and 40th and Airport stations. Potential demand
from residents in Commerce City (Reunion) and Green Valley Ranch may justify service
to the Pena Blvd Station via Tower Road in the near future.
4. All figures showing access to stations do not include bicycles. Several stations, such as 38th and
Blake and 41st and Fox may have a significant amount of access by bike. If data is available,
please include bicycle access in these figures. If bicycle access was not modeled, the plan should
note that omission and discuss how RTD is currently planning to provide bicycle parking at the
stations and willingness to monitor the need to calibrate bicycle parking at stations moving
forward.
5. Are there plans for improved wayfinding for riders to access the rail stations? Example is Route
34 is approximately 2 blocks from the 38th and Blake station but turns south on Downing. Riders
wishing to access DUS from Route 34 could alight at the Bruce Randolph/Downing stop and walk
to the 38th and Blake station if given notice of that opportunity.
6. Call-n-ride service is mentioned multiple times as a way to close gaps in the service area. It
would be beneficial if the plan details RTD’s current and future ability to provide enough
shuttles to meet this service demand (either through RTD or third party providers)
7. The first/last mile connection topic is gaining momentum in regional conversations. While RTD
has policy and funding limits on what can be implemented for the first/last mile connections for
other modes of travel in station/stop areas, it would be helpful to add in a general statement to
the service plans, in addition to alternative transit for first/last mile section, about what RTD is
able to implement to contribute those connections for other modes (bicycle, pedestrian, etc.),

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: November 4, 2015

From:

John Tarbert, Acting AGM, Safety, Security
and Facilities

GM

Date:

November 4, 2015

Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2015

Subject:

Authorization to purchase additional software
maintenance and new software licenses for
eFORCE

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO or his designee to amend an existing contract with
IntelliChoice (Contract 10DH020) exercise up to two additional option years for software
maintenance and to purchase new software licenses for the eFORCE Transit Fare Enforcement
Software and Records Management Software. The software maintenance is essential to maintain
the existing software. The new software licenses are needed to operate the software on a new
hardware device. This will increase the authorized amount by $600,000 from the current contract
value of $884,300 to a total authorized amount of $1,484,300.
BACKGROUND:
eFORCE is the current Citation and Records Management Software (RMS) for the Transit Police in the
Security Command Center (SCC). It is a webhosted solution that does not have central software or
records management at RTD facilities. This software has been successfully in use for the past four
years and contains RTD’s associated historic citation records. The eFORCE mobile (handheld) software
integrates with the eFORCE hosted software. The mobile handhelds provide the officers with immediate
access to a rider’s prior citations and allows an automated mobile process for citation issuance. The
eFORCE hosted software provides data warehousing and reporting capabilities.
The software
maintenance contract for this software expires on December 6, 2015 and needs to be renewed. There
are two option years for software maintenance in the existing contract.
RTD currently uses Motorola MC75 handheld units as handheld smart media readers (HSMRs). The
MC75 units are loaded with Xerox fare validation software, which enables RTD personnel to validate
fares and eFORCE citation software provides for, issuing of citations, if passengers are traveling without
valid fare. These handheld units are obsolete and it is nearly impossible for RTD to get replacement
units or repair parts. Another consideration is these units frequently freeze in the field when RTD
personnel try to switch between the Xerox and eFORCE software.
DISSCUSSION:
RTD plans to procure new HSMR devices to replace the obsolete Motorola handheld units. Additional
HSMRs will be procured to address fare enforcement for FasTrack expansion. Windows CE Embedded is
the operating system for the current software. It is no longer fully supported. Therefore, updated fare
validation and citation software will be needed for the new HSMR devices from both IntelliChoice and
Xerox.

Packet Pg. 173

13.D

Based on an assessment of RTD’s needs, peer agency review and a market review of potential devices,
RTD has identified Apple iOS based devices as the future corporate standard for HSMR devices. The
unit cost for each iPhone with peripherals is about $1000 less than the initial cost of the Motorola
handheld units. Because we plan to purchase 175 units, this is $175,000 in savings. For other
agencies the vendor, eFORCE has also developed an iOS based fare enforcement software application
and RTD is planning to procure and implement this on the new HSMR devices.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding of $290,640 for the two years of software maintenance options is included in the 2015 and
2016 expense budgets for Safety, Security and Facilities. Funding for the new eFORCE software
licenses is included in the 2016 SBP.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to amend the contract with
IntelliChoice (Contract 10DH020) to exercise up to additional two option years for eFORCE
software maintenance and purchase new software licenses for the eFORCE iOS Transit Fare
Enforcement Software. This action grants authority to amend the contract in an amount not
to exceed $1,484,300. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to amend the contract with
IntelliChoice (Contract 10DH020) to exercise up to additional two option years for eFORCE
software maintenance and purchase new software licenses for the eFORCE iOS Transit Fare
Enforcement Software. This is not recommended because RTD Transit Police would be
unable to provide automated fare violation citations or records management for fare violators.
RTD’s historical citation records with IntelliChoice would need to be obtained and archived for
records management.

2016 Salaried Benefit Plans

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the 2016 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the Interim General Manager and CEO
or his designee to enter into agreements with the Insurance Carriers.
BACKGROUND
Annually the staff brings the proposed Salaried Employee Benefits plan for approval to the Board of
Directors. Approval of the plan by the Board establishes the rates for Open Enrollment and provides
costs for the 2016 Budget. The Open Enrollment period for salaried staff begins November 15 through
November 29, 2015.
DISCUSSION
The goals for the 2016 plan year are: 1) Achieve the 2016 budget goals, 2) Continued focus on
containing cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism, 3) Maintain market
competitiveness, and 4) Insure compliance with PPACA – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Health Care Reform provisions as applicable to RTD).
Following is a summary of the modest changes for the 2016 plan year.
Medical
- Cigna administers two self-funded plans on behalf of RTD. Both the PPO Plan and the HDHP (High
Deductible Health Plan) Plan have a specific individual $150,000 stop-loss ceiling in 2016. The
administrative cost will increase by 7.7% in 2016. The Cigna Plans are estimated to have
approximately 506 employees enrolled. 2015 claims are running at expected claims YTD and 2016
claims are currently projected to be slightly higher than 2015 levels.
-

Kaiser provides 2 Plan Options: a DHMO (HMO Plan with deductibles), and a HDHP. The Kaiser
plans are estimated to have approximately 209 employees enrolled. This plan has proposed a 5%
blended increase over 2015.

-

The employee cost share for 2016 will be 10% for the Cigna PPO and Kaiser DHMO plans and 5%
for the Cigna HDHP and Kaiser HDHP plans.

-

Cigna has agreed to provide $15,000 to our wellness program in 2016.

Dental
- No carrier/plan changes and a 0% renewal rate increase, we are currently in an Administrative rate
guarantee through 2016. Claims have held steady this year so we anticipate this will continue in

Packet Pg. 175

13.E

2016.
Life & Disability
-

Basic Life Insurance/AD&D, Voluntary Life/AD&D, Long and Short Term Disability are under a multiyear rate guarantee; however we have anticipated a 3% increase in these plans based on increase in
salary dollars for 2016. Life Insurance and LTD premiums are salary based.

Vision/Business Travel Accident
- Vision Plan is currently a fully insured plan with Anthem Blue Cross – Blue Shield. A rate guarantee
is in effect through 2016 so there will be no increase in premium.
-

We are currently in the renewal stage for the organization’s Business Travel Accident insurance; I do
not expect an increase in premium as there have been no claims on the insurance in 2015.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2016 planned Salaried Employee Insured Benefit budget is projected to be a 5% increase over 2015
projected benefit costs. RTD’s current utilization and projections are below the medical trend of 8.6%.
With the additional costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, the overall benefit budget increase is
projected to be 5% over 2015.
The major cost impacts in 2016 are due to Cigna Plan increases of 7.7%. The net additional benefit
costs anticipated in 2016 are essentially flat. Reduction in the Transitional Reinsurance fees and rate
guarantees are responsible for results of an approximate overall 5% increase over last year. This is the
sixth year we have achieved strong cost containment as a result of our shift in carriers, plan offerings,
plan design and funding models.
The 2016 estimate of the Salaried Employee Insured Benefits is $10,783,499. The projected increase
of 5% results in an increase of a projected $547,768 in 2016. The increase meets the projected costs in
the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). Statewide, average healthcare insurance is expected to increase seven
percent in 2016.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the 2016 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorize the General Manager
or his designee to enter into agreements with the Insurance Carriers.
2. Further modify the salaried employee benefit plans to be offered in 2016. This is not
recommended since it would require additional negotiations with benefit providers and delay
the employee enrollment period.
3. Do not approve the recommended salaried employee benefit plans. This is not recommended, as
this will result in the Agency being unable to provide competitive and cost effective benefit
plans to the salaried employees.

2016 FasTracks Public Information Consultant
Contract Award

Discussion

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the Interim General Manager and CEO to approve the fourth one-year option to the Virtegic Group,
Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach Consultant,
extending the period of performance through 2016, the final year of the contract. The scope of work
is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD
Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment is for an amount not to exceed
$745,411.52 for the year 2016. Funds for the award are contained in the 2016 Recommended
Budget for the FasTracks program.
BACKGROUND
Utilizing a Public Information Consultant team to extend the staffing needs of the FasTracks Public
Information Program contributes to the agency’s Board adopted goal to Advance/Complete
FasTracks.
In October 2011, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for a Public Information, Communications and
Public Outreach Consultant to serve as an extension of staff in the implementation of the FasTracks
Public Information Program. Following a comprehensive evaluation process, Virtegic Group,
Incorporated, a certified SBE firm, was selected for this contract award, at a rate that was
approximately half that of the previous Public Information Consultant.
The procurement was set up as a one-year contract award with four one-year options, negotiated
annually by RTD and Consultant Staff and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors. This gives
RTD the opportunity to assess and address the public information and outreach needs of the
FasTracks program on an annual basis as the program evolves. The services needed through this
contract may be reduced or increased from year to year depending on the future financial situation
and changing needs of the FasTracks program.
Virtegic began its work in January 2012 and the RTD Board approved th ree previous option years
through 2015. In the three years of working as the FasTracks public information consultant so far,
the Virtegic team members have satisfactorily performed their work assignments and have remained
flexible in meeting the needs of the public information program during several key staff transitions.
They are also playing a key role in augmenting RTD Public Relations outreach, as FasTracks projects
begin transitioning into base system operational services.
DISCUSSION
The initial contract to Virtegic for 2012 was in the amount of $451,459.20. The first one-year
option for 2013 was $485,167.20. The second one-year option for 2014 was $487,308.80. The
third one-year option for 2015 was $686,009.60. The fourth one-year option for 2016 is not to
exceed $745,411.52 bringing the total on this contract to $2,855,356.32. The option to provide

additional staffing to assist with specific corridor public information project outreach as well as
preparation for the FasTracks project openings in 2016 is being exercised. It is crucial that proper
amounts of staff who have direct experience with RTD’s programs, procedures and policies be in
place to provide adequate resources for the unprecedented five rapid transit line openings in 2016,
something with which no other transit agency has ever been tasked.
The FasTracks Public Information Program is implemented through six functional areas: Internal
Relations, Government Relations, Media Relations, Public Involvement, Public Outreach, and Crisis
Communications. The 2016 PIC scope of work is divided into the PI Program’s functional areas.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for this fourth and final one-year option are included in the 2016 Recommended Budget for

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the fourth and final

14.F

one-year option to the Virtegic Group, Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information,
Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period of performance through
2016. The scope of work is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant staff, and
awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment
is for an amount not to exceed $745,411.52 for the year 2016, the final year of the contract.
Funds for the award are contained in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the Public Information Consultant approach.
This is not recommended as RTD doesn’t currently have the staff to provide a sufficient level of
resources to meet the public information, communications and public outreach needs of the
FasTracks program and specific FasTracks design and construction projects, especially given the
fact that RTD is opening an unprecedented five major transit lines in 2016. This alternative would
delay and negatively impact the effective implementation of the FasTracks Public Information
Program.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
fourth and final one-year option to Virtegic Group, Incorporated. Issue another Request for
Proposals for professional services for Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach
for the FasTracks Program and award a contract to another consulting team. This is not
recommended as the Virtegic team is satisfactorily performing its work and has been flexible in
meeting the changing communication needs of the FasTracks program. Also, this alternative will
delay and negatively impact the successful implementation of the various strategies and activities
associated with a comprehensive and multi-layered communications effort, especially given the
fact that RTD is opening an unprecedented five major transit lines in 2016.

Subject:

Approval of Contract Amendment to Jacobs
Engineering for FasTracks Program Support
Consulting Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the Interim General Manager and CEO to approve a contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in an
amount not to exceed $22,579,180, for Program Support Services Consulting for FasTracks through
June 30, 2017. Funding in the amount of $16,934,180 for the 2016 work program is included in
the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where
PSC support would be utilized. Funding for the balance of the contract through June 30, 2017 is
included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation for 2017, and will be appropriated in the specific
projects in the 2017 capital budget.
BACKGROUND
On May 24, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to CarterBurgess (later purchased by Jacobs Engineering) for Program Support Consulting Services at an initial
2005 Contract amount of $2,360,000, and a Notice to Proceed of July 5, 2005. The RTD Board has
approved subsequent contract amendments that have brought the current Contract Not-to-Exceed price
up to $168,844,156.
The Contract Not-to-Exceed price through the end of 2016 with this contract amendment would be
$185,778,336. The total contract not-to-exceed value through June 30, 2017, which is the contract
end date, would be $191,423,336.
The PSC team provides program management support and specialized technical staff support to augment
RTD FasTracks Team staff. Key PSC staff members are co-located with RTD Staff at the RTD FasTracks
offices. The PSC functions as an extension of RTD staff. This approach adds value, cost-effectively, by
allowing RTD to tap the PSC’s specialized resources in planning, environmental, design, engineering,
construction management support, program control, and related disciplines on an as-needed, often parttime, basis.
Further, as the focus of the FasTracks program has shifted from planning and design to construction and
start up, the staff resources required for support of the program shift similarly. The PSC role has
changed, and will continue to change, to meet the evolving needs of the FasTracks program. This
flexibility allows RTD to retain the core staff required for implementation of the FasTracks program,
without having to continually (and inefficiently) staff up and then staff down in the planning, design, and
construction management disciplines.
Some of the key deliverables and assistance, in process or received, from the Jacobs/PSC team in 2015
included:

Supported ROW design, survey, and property acquisition for all projects.

DISCUSSION
The Program Support Services Contract was specified for a term of six years with a six-year option, to
be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work tasks. The purpose of the annual re-negotiation of
the contract is to ensure that specific tasks and deliverables respond to the evolving needs of the
FasTracks Program.
The PSC serves as an extension of RTD staff. RTD staff provides overall management and control of
the FasTracks program and administration of this contract. The PSC provides key personnel to a number
of tasks. These assignments are based on focusing the PSC effort to:


Areas of specialized expertise or experience.



Part-time assignments.



Shorter duration efforts.



Positions that are difficult for RTD to fill.

Each position in the FasTracks organization is evaluated individually to determine whether that position
falls within the above criteria for using a consultant. In addition, before a consultant is actually brought
into the FasTracks program, an assessment is made as to whether the position is still needed, and an
interview is conducted with the appropriate RTD manager(s).
The major program activities in 2016 include the following:


Testing and start-up of the Eagle P3 project.



Construction, testing and start-up of I-225 Project.



Final design and construction of the North Metro Line.

During 2016, the PSC contract identifies the following specific tasks in support of FasTracks:

RTD expects the PSC effort to be reduced substantially in 2017. The Eagle and I-225 projects are
scheduled to open in 2016, leaving a reduced need for project support through closeout. In addition, the
contract term only extends through the first six months of the year. Therefore, the estimated maximum
contract cost for 2017 is approximately one-third of the cost for 2016. The specific work scope for
2017 would be established in late 2016.
RTD has established a 7% DBE goal for this Contract. The latest DBE report indicates that the PSC’s
actual cumulative DBE percentage has been 20.2%. For 2016, the PSC has committed to 19% DBE
participation, well in excess of the 7% goal. Additionally, while not in their contract, the PSC has
committed to continuing their participation in the WIN program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the PSC contract from 2005 through 2017, would be
$191,423,336 with this amendment. Funding in the amount of $16,934,180 for the 2016 work
program is included in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific
projects where PSC support would be utilized. Funding for the balance of the contract through June 30,
2017 is included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation for 2017, and will be appropriated in the
specific projects in the 2017 capital budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to
Jacobs Engineering, in an amount not to exceed $22,579,180, for Program Support Services
Consulting for FasTracks through June 30, 2017. Funding in the amount of $16,934,180 for the
2016 work program is included in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program
in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized. Funding for the balance of the contract
through June 30, 2017 is included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation for 2017, and will be
appropriated in the specific projects in the 2017 capital budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
eighth year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering. Rather, perform all the work in-house with
RTD staff. This is not recommended as RTD does not have the staff to provide a sufficient level of
expertise in a cost-effective approach to manage the FasTracks Program (As described in the
Background section, the PSC team can provide the technical specialties on an as needed basis).
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Re-solicit this work to another consulting team. This is not
recommended as the PSC is satisfactorily performing its work assignments and providing valuable
technical and project management assistance to the RTD team.
Selection of alternatives two or three would delay the implementation of the FasTracks Program as there
would be a major loss of continuity on the program.

Approval of 2016 – 2017 Contract
Amendment to Delcan for FasTracks Quality
Management Consultant Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the Interim General Manager and CEO to approve the 2016 – 2017 Contract Amendment for Delcan in
the amount of $2,669,575 for FasTracks Quality Management Consulting Services. The term of this
Contract Amendment covers the period of January 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017 when the Contract
ends. The cost breakdown for 2016 and 2017 are $1,662,900 and $1,006,675 respectively. Funds for
the amendment are contained in the 2016 RTD FasTracks Budget.
BACKGROUND
On June 28, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to Delcan for
Quality Management Consulting Services at an initial 2005 contract price of $418,539, and a Notice to
Proceed of August 1, 2005. This contract was set up to run for an initial six-year term, re-negotiated
and amended annually, based on the needs of the program. The contract also included provisions for a
six-year option.
On December 13, 2005, the RTD Board approved a second year contract amendment for 2006 in the
amount of $1,100,000.
On November 14, 2006, the RTD Board approved a third year contract amendment for 2007 in the

On November 17, 2009, the RTD Board approved a sixth year contract amendment for 2010. The
actual cost proposal for the 2010 workscope was $1,400,000; but because of cumulative budget
underruns from previous years, the total Contract Not-to-Exceed price only needed to be increased by
$600,000 in order to deliver the 2010 work.
On November 23, 2010, the Board approved a seventh year contract amendment for 2011 in the
amount of $1,550,000, and authorized the six-year option included in the original contract.
On November 22, 2011, the Board approved an eighth year contract amendm ent for 2012 in the
amount of $1,645,422.
On November 20, 2012, the Board approved a ninth year contract amendment for 2013 in the

re-negotiation of the contract was to ensure that specific tasks and deliverables responded to the needs
of the FasTracks program. Because 2017 is only a partial year and the scope will be largely the same as
2016, the work is being incorporated into what is expected to be a final Contract Amendment. For 2016
- 2017, related RTD work includes design-build of the Eagle Project, I225 Corridor, North Metro Rail
Line, and Southeast Rail Extension. The following tasks/substasks highlight the assistance to be

date has been 8.5%. For the 2016 – 2017 term, Delcan has committed to 7.3% DBE participation,
exceeding the established goal as they have every year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for this contract amendment are included in the 2016 RTD FasTracks budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1.

Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the 2016 - 2017 contract
amendment to Delcan in the amount of $2,669,575. Funds for the award are contained in the
2016 FasTracks budget.

2.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
2016 - 2017 contract amendment to Delcan. Rather, perform all of the work in-house with RTD
staff. This is not recommended, as RTD doesn’t have certain skills required to fully develop the
Quality Management program.

3.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
2016 - 2017 contract amendment to Delcan. Rather, re-solicit and award this work to another
consulting team. This is not recommended, as Delcan is satisfactorily performing its work
assignments and providing valuable quality management assistance to the RTD team.

Station Names for Eagle P3 Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors accept and
approve the proposed station name for the Eagle P3 Project “Gateway Station” as follows.
East Corridor:
61st & Peña
BACKGROUND:
Station names for the East Corridor were originally assigned during the East Corridor Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) completed in 2009. At the time the East Corridor EIS was completed, there were
no plans to include a station along Peña Boulevard between the 40th Ave. & Airport Blvd. • Gateway
Park Station and the Denver Airport Station. However, included in the Intergovernmental Agreement
between RTD and Denver International Airport is a provision that up to two “Gateway Stations” may be
added to the East Corridor along Peña Boulevard. At the time of IGA execution the potential station
locations were understood to be in the general vicinity of 72nd and Dunkirk and 62nd and Peña Boulevard.
In 2014, RTD and DIA concluded negotiations to include one of the potential stations to the East
Corridor at the 62nd and Peña Boulevard location. Since the station was added after the East Corridor
EIS was completed, there was no previous name associated with this station although “Peña Blvd” has
been shown on plans, fact sheets and the website. Through discussions with Denver Transit Partners,
the concessionaire on the Eagle P3 Project, it was determined that a deadline of Dec. 01, 2015 for the
official station name would allow sufficient time to integrate the name into the signage design package,
systems packages for LED and LCD monitor displays, and audio announcements; and operations
documents.
The Board previously approved the station names for the Eagle P3 Project in the December 17, 2013
Board Meeting. Since the negotiations for the addition of the “Gateway Station” were ongoing at the
time, an official station name for the “Gateway Station” was not included for approval in the December
17, 2013 Board Meeting.
After the incorporation of the “Gateway Station” into the Eagle P3 Project, Eagle Project staff and DIA
staff coordinated to develop the recommended station name included in this report. Following that
discussion, the staff recommended the following name: Peña Boulevard
In Mid-October 2015, the Eagle Design Team issued an official letter to Denver International Airport to
advise them of the proposed station name and provide them with the opportunity to request an alternate
station name, if deemed appropriate and conforming to all the requirements of the RTD Station Naming
Policy. Denver International Airport also would have to submit a completed RTD Station Naming Form.
The goal was to avoid a later request from the stakeholder after DTP’s incorporation of the name into
the Eagle P3 Project.

Packet Pg. 191

14.I

DISCUSSION:
After RTD notified Denver International Airport of the RTD recommended station name, RTD received
confirmation that the RTD staff proposed change was acceptable. Subsequently, at the November 3,
2015 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meeting, the RTD Board Committee considered and approved a
modified recommendation as depicted in this Board Report to name the station 61st & Peña. This name
is consistent with RTD’s Station Naming Policy that facilities “should usually be named for the nearest
street intersections, major cross streets, or the name of the geographic location of the area.” This
Station Naming Policy was established in November 2003 and reconfirmed in May 2011.
Staff Recommendation: Adopt Peña Boulevard
Staff recommends the acceptance of the name Peña Boulevard for the additional “Gateway Station”.
This name is consistent with current RTD policy and is identified with the geographic location of the
area. This proposed name has been discussed to some length between RTD and DIA staff and the
parties are in agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no negative financial impact to the project at this time. DTP is requiring RTD confirmation of the
official Station Name prior to Dec. 01, 2015, in order to avoid costs that would be incurred with
changing station name after DTP commences with station signage and systems packages. RTD sought
local government input now in order to avoid redesign costs later. Any station name changes after Dec.
01, 2015, could have cost implications to either RTD or stakeholders.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the Board of Directors accept and approve the proposed station name for the additional
“Gateway Station” as follows:
a. 61st & Peña
2. Do not accept the recommended action. Instead propose an alternative name that is consistent
with the current RTD policy for station names. This is not recommended as it would not be
responsive to previous discussions with a key stakeholder. In addition, it would potentially impact
DTP’ ability to incorporate the station name into the Eagle Project without additional costs to
RTD.

Approval of 2016 Contribution for the Salaried
Employee's Retirement Plans

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopt a 2016 contribution of $4.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust
(the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2016 contribution of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount
to the plan for each year of employment.
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9% of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION
DB Plan
In 2012, the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan
would be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a
result of the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the
DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a
“fully funded” status for the plan in the future.
The actuaries have updated the DB Plan projections to reflect the final 1/1/2015 valuation assumptions
for the DB Plan. The 2016 Actuary recommended contribution is $6 million. The $6 million contribution
would continue through 2020 decreasing to $5.1 million in 2021 and then $3.1 million thereafter until
100% funding is reached in 2034. This option has been deemed too costly to fund at this time.
The recommendation is to increase the annual fixed contribution by $1 million to $4.1 million. If this is
done for 2016 and beyond, it is projected that the plan would be 100% funded by 2036.
If the existing $3.1 million contribution is maintained, the plan is not expected to reach 100% funding
until long after 2036 which is outside of the 20 year goal to have the plan 100% funded.

Packet Pg. 193

14.J

DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2015.

Directors adopts a 2016 contribution of $4.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined
Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is
also recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2016 contribution of 9% of each
participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC

amounts have been included in the 2016 Recommended Budget.
2. The RTD Board of Directors could certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust or the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution
Plan at amounts other than $4.1 million and 9%, respectively.
3. Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plans. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

Proposed 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves and adopts the 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement.
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the
proposed Policy for the upcoming fiscal year for approval to the Board of Directors as an initial step
in development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and Recommended Budget.
The most recent modification to the Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in October 2014
for the 2015 fiscal year. Those changes primarily related to clarifying that 1) the fund balance is
maintained to meet not only unanticipated expenditures and increases in costs, but also to mitigate
service disruptions as a result of economic downturns affecting revenue, and 2) the budget is
prepared using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles excluding the non-cash portion of long-term
unfunded pension accruals. The Policy Statement was also updated with the most recent rating
agency credit ratings at the time.
DISCUSSION
For 2016, the following major changes are proposed.
Revenue Policies #1 is amended to add the following in accordance with the objectives of the revised
fare schedule in 2016: “As part of this process, staff will review potential fare adjustments to
establish a fare structure to ensure that it: is understandable, is implementable, is equitable,
achieves revenue levels established in the Strategic Budget Plan, and facilitates the integration of the
2016 rail and BRT projects.” (amendment in italics)
Revenue Policies #7 is added as follows: “RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide
sales and use tax forecasting containing projections for the short-term (one year by quarter),
medium-term (six year SBP period) and long-term (30-year APE period). The purpose is to provide
RTD with expert economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using sophisticated financial
modeling techniques not available internally.”
Expenditure Policies #5 is amended to add the following: “RTD will invest in a safety outreach
programs and personnel to communicate safety messages.” (amendment in italics)

Packet Pg. 198

14.K

Capital Improvement Policies #1 last bullet point is amended to add the following: “RTD mission
statement elements, Board strategic goals, and other relevant criteria.” (amendment in italics)
Debt Policies #2 is amended as follows: “Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds,
Certificates of Participation (COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to
exceed the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.” (amendment in italics)
Debt Policies #4 is amended as follows: “Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service
on total annual expenditures and the net revenue coverage ratio will be analyzed.” (amendment in
italics)
Budget Policies #2 is deleted; the relevance of budgeting on a program/project basis has diminished.
The Policy Statement is updated with the most recent rating agency credit ratings in effect at this
date.
All other proposed changes to the Policy Statement are primarily wording clarification and are
reflected in the attachment.
Please see the attachment for the full proposed document with changes indicated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Fiscal Policy Statement as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2016
Recommended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended changes to RTD’s 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement. Staff supports
this alternative because the Policy Statement documents the policies to be adhered to in 2016
and provides clarification of certain practices.
2. Board further modifies the recommended changes. Staff reviewed the fiscal policies and
welcomes any suggestions for modifications requested by the Board of Directors.
3. Do not adopt the RTD 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not recommended because
RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current language, would not adhere to
best practices, and would not best facilitate the needs of RTD’s financial operations.

REVENUE POLICIES
1. Staff will plan fare adjustments every 3 years in the mid and long-term budgets to
adjust for inflation. The Board of Directors may consider potential fare adjustments
annually at the time of the development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). As
part of this process, staff will review potential fare adjustments to establish a fare
structure to ensure that it:
 is understandable
 is implementable
 is equitable
 achieves revenue levels established in the Strategic Budget Plan, and
 facilitates the integration of the 2016 rail and BRT projects.
2. Fare policies will take into account the special needs of all transit dependent
patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.
6. On an annual basis, staff will identify under- or un-utilized property and equipment,
and will make an ongoing attempt to sell such property and equipment to enhance
cash flow.

and minimizes future maintenance and replacement costs.
4. RTD maintains a risk management program which will provide protection against
loss and mitigate exposure to liability.
5. A safety program will be maintained to minimize RTD's exposure to liability and
thereby reduce the number of claims against RTD. RTD will invest in safety
outreach programs and personnel to communicate safety messages.
6. RTD will develop service changes that are needed to respond to budget shortfalls
using the system-wide and route-specific productivity measures that have been

1. On an annual basis, RTD will prepare and update a six-year Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP) including projected capital construction and improvements, service levels,
operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Capital
projects to be included in the SBP will be evaluated using the following criteria:
 total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
 source of funding;
 operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the SBP period;
 benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited
to the effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and
ridership;
 consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); consequences of not
funding; and
 RTD mission statement elements, Board strategic goals, and other relevant
criteria.
2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks financial plan (see #7 below).
3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted SBP as the basis for
the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If
the cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be
brought to the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future
technological changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the
public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance
with the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks financial plan incorporating the
actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital
improvement costs, service levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the
FasTracks capital and operating programs.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT POLICIES

Packet Pg. 203

14.K.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective November 17, 2015

1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and in the FasTracks
operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring
nature, to meet unexpected increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as
a result of economic downturns affecting revenue. This unrestricted fund balance
will be comprised of a Board appropriated fund, a capital replacement fund and an
undesignated working capital fund as described below. For the Base System, the
total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount approximately equal
to three months of Base System operating expenses excluding depreciation. For
FasTracks, the total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount
approximately equal to two months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding
depreciation. RTD will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund
balance replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses
are an especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as economic downturns. With Board
approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the
need for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond
rating. The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and will take
place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for
scheduled major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases. The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and will take place in a prompt manner.
4. RTD will designate excess and undesignated working capital that may accrue at
each year-end to be placed in an unrestricted fund to be used to respond to
unanticipated events.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado
Constitution.

Attachment: Fiscal Policy Statement Final (2574 : Proposed 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement)

FUND BALANCE POLICIES

6. The Board shall establish three reserves for future construction under the
FasTracks plan:
 The FasTracks Contingency Reserve will be appropriated at a sufficient level
each year to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule, relating
4



to logistics or cost savings opportunities that might arise after the annual
budget is adopted, and will not be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base
System capital or operating activity.
The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding
for future FasTracks projects that are currently unfunded. Expenditures from
the FISA will be subject to Board approval with the staff recommended project
goals identified in the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Funding of the FISA will be
provided from the sources identified in the Board approved RAM and other
sources approved by the Board.
All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a
reserve for future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be
used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System expenditures.

DEBT POLICIES
1. Debt financing will not be issued to support operating expenditures.
2. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, Certificates of Participation
(COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to exceed
the lesser of the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.
3. Effective communication with credit rating agencies will be maintained, and a
policy of full disclosure on every financial report and official statement will be
followed.
4. Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures and the net revenue coverage ratio will be analyzed.

5. It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's credit ratings at the highest reasonably attainable
level in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to
receive lower interest rates and lower debt insurance premiums than would be
possible with lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

6. RTD will maintain a minimum gross sales tax revenue bond coverage ratio for the
Base System (annual non-FasTracks sales and use tax revenue to annual sales and
use tax debt service for senior non-FasTracks debt) of four times for debt backed
by the 0.6% sales and use tax. RTD will maintain a minimum gross sales tax
revenue bond coverage ratio for FasTracks (annual FasTracks sales and use tax
revenue to annual FasTracks sales and use tax debt service) of two times for debt
backed by the 0.4% FasTracks sales and use tax.
7. RTD will maintain a minimum net revenue coverage ratio (all annual revenues
remaining after operating and maintenance expenses to annual debt service
requirements net of excess appropriations required for variable rate debt) of 1.2
times annual debt service.

BUDGET POLICIES
1. RTD shall comply with all requirements of the Colorado Local Government Budget
Law.

2. As part of the budget development process, the Board will review the current
goals, objectives, and performance indicators for use in preparing the budget for
the following year. The Board will adopt the final performance indicators before
the adoption of the annual budget.
3. The Board will review the adopted fiscal policies annually or on an as-needed basis
to consider any changes that may be necessary.
4. There shall be a budgetary monitoring system that charges expenditures against
approved budget appropriations.

operations guide, and policy document.
8. Quarterly performance reports will be presented to the Board of Directors to assess
RTD's performance on the adopted performance indicators.
9. A balanced budget in which beginning reserves plus total anticipated revenues is
greater than or equal to expenditures will be prepared.
10. Budgetary procedures that postpone the funding of necessary expenditures, such
as preventive maintenance or replacement of equipment, will be avoided.
11. RTD will provide conservative revenue estimates that take into consideration
recent experience and reflect reasonable future growth.
12. RTD will monitor revenue sources regularly and amend the budget, as necessary,

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO, or his designee, to execute a contract with IQBG for
ECM Owners Representative Services. The initial contract period will extend through February 28,
2017, with two additional one-year options, and the initial contract amount will be $653,230. Funding
for the initial contract period is included in the 2015 Amended Budget and the 2016 Recommended
Budget.
BACKGROUND
In July 2014, RTD engaged Ciber to conduct an assessment of enterprise content management (ECM) at
RTD. This assessment, which was completed in November 2014, assessed the current state of ECM at
RTD, identified the top needs for ECM at RTD, and presented RTD with a path forward to meet those
needs. The Ciber assessment identified 65 different systems that were being used for content
management at RTD, which led to a lack of consistency in content management across the different
areas of the District. The top four needs identified by Ciber were:





Integrated ECM platforms
Organization wide uniform taxonomy (data classification and naming conventions)
Easy and robust search
Single source of “truth”

Ciber also recommended an information governance structure for RTD and proposed an implementation
plan to reach a coordinated ECM solution. RTD implemented the recommended governance structure by
the start of 2015. Through this structure, it was determined that RTD did not have the in-house
resources and technical expertise to implement an ECM solution. Therefore, staff decided to bring on an
owners representative to provide this specialized expertise in order to implement a successful ECM
program at RTD.
DISCUSSION
RTD issued a Request for Proposals for ECM Owners Representative Services on July 1, 2015. The RFP
was a best value procurement based on the following six evaluation criteria:






Understanding of technical, institutional, logistical, operational issues and solutions
Cost
Experience and commitment of project manager
Experience of the firms
Experience and commitment of key staff

Project plan

On August 4, 2015 RTD received proposals from three firms:




IQBG
Ciber
Triunity Engineering and Management

An evaluation committee consisting of representatives from different departments evaluated the
proposals, and determined that the IQBG proposal represented the best value to RTD. The IQBG team,
including the project manager and key staff, presented the strongest technical expertise in the areas of
content and records management. IQBG has extensive prior experience with similar projects in the
public sector, and staff received favorable references from previous clients. IQBG’s proposal also
showed the best understanding of the issues, and the most comprehensive project plan. Finally, the
IQBG proposal was the lowest cost of the three proposals received. IQBG also met the SBE goal of 8%
established by the Small Business Opportunity Office.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the initial contract amount of $653,230 is included in the 2015 Amended Budget and the
2016 Recommended Budget. Funding for potential option years is programmed in the 2016-2021
Strategic Budget Plan as a part of the ECM implementation project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute
a contract with IQBG for ECM Owners Representative Services. The initial contract period will
extend through February 28, 2017, with two additional one-year options, and the initial contract
amount will be $653,230. Funding for the initial contract period is included in the 2015
Amended Budget and the 2016 Recommended Budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead, use in-house staff to perform all necessary
work to implement an ECM solution. This is not recommended because RTD staff does not have
the specialized technical expertise to perform this work to the level needed to ensure successful
implementation of an ECM solution.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not proceed with implementation of a District-wide
ECM solution.
Instead, continue with the current piecemeal implementation of content
management at the District. This is not recommended because the current implementations are
inefficient, and ultimately will cost the District more funds and staff time than a comprehensive
ECM solution.
