Retiree Awards
Dave Genova, Interim General Manager and CEO, mentioned that Mike Gil, Deputy
Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, was not able to attend the meeting. He
noted that he does not know what RTD would have done without Mike Gil’s years of
service and commitment. He was aware of everything going on in Bus Operations and
even Rail Operations. IGM Genova added that Mike Gil will serve in an adjunct capacity
during the transition period as new leaders are developed. He said that Mike Gil is a
fixture at RTD and he will be greatly missed.
IGM Genova reminded the Directors that Gina Callahan will serve as the Acting Deputy
Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations.
Michael J. Gil – Deputy Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations – 33 years

Public Participation




Terry Liggins, Denver, spoke in appreciation of RTD staff and the Board for the new
adjustments to the Montbello proposed routes which now provides access to the
only grocery store in the neighborhood. She added that she still has concerns
about the Montbello Park-n-Ride going away; however, she understands the
reasoning behind this as the A line opens. She noted that there needs to be more
discussion on the distance between the routes.
Khadija Haynes, Denver, thanked the Directors for reaching out and having
conversations with the Montbello community. She said she appreciated the effort
in making the changes presented that evening. She noted that RTD may think that
it has been communicating with the community, yet the majority of riders are not







aware of the upcoming changes. The Montbello Organizing Committee stepped in
to help communicate the changes. She said the Montbello Organizing Committee is
interested in working with RTD to aid in the communication piece with the
community.
Mayra Gonzales, Denver, spoke on behalf of the Montbello Organizing Committee.
Over the past 6 months she has been gathering community input on transit in the
neighborhood. She said she quickly found out that people do not know what is
going on. She acknowledged the proposed changes in order to improve access to
the grocery store; however, these changes do not address Park-n-Ride concerns.
She noted that the Peoria Street and Albrook Drive intersection is a heavily
trafficked area and unsafe as the sidewalks are not accessible to those with
mobility devices. She asked RTD to work with the City and County of Denver to
address these issues.
Angelle Fouther, Denver, shared that her husband, Rev. James Fouther, is the
pastor of the United Church of Montbello and that they live in the church’s home.
She serves as the Interim Chair of the Montbello Organizing Committee, which she
helped organized. She thanked the Directors for the opportunity to speak to them.
She also thanked the Directors and Staff for listening, taking the time to go through
the neighborhood and making changes. She underscored the issue of
communication as many people in her community do not know what is going on
when it comes to transit changes. She noted that in a community that is transit
dependent, this lack of communication could be detrimental as people could lose
jobs. She offered the Montbello Organizing Committee as a channel to
communicate changes, processes, and impact.
Mary Yoakaum, Denver, spoke in favor of keeping Route 28 in service. She
understood that ridership is not what it should be and that service may have to be
scaled back. She shared that she has Turner Syndrome, which makes her very
sensitive to cold weather. She noted that one of the reasons why she bought her
house was because it was in front of a bus stop, thus limiting her exposure to the
cold.
Jaime Lewis, Denver, mentioned that he works for the Colorado Cross Disability
Coalition (CCDC). He has worked with Dace West from Mile High Connects in the
past year on the income based fares. He shared that he has received a lot of
feedback from the residents of Montbello due to the proposed changes. He stated
that CCDC concurs with many of the concerns brought forth by the residents of
Montbello, City Councilwoman Stacy Gilmore, Walmart store manager Shelly
Trujillo, and other concerned citizens. He noted that many Montbello residents use
buses for education, employment, access to the grocery store, and maintaining
independence. He recognized that RTD staff has made attempts to communicate
the proposed changes with the community. Jaime Lewis said that CCDC requests
that the changes be postponed until additional outreach, a 6 month impact study,



and a sidewalk audit are performed. He mentioned the unique qualities of the
Montbello community: only one major food provider, no regular high schools, and
disabled people having to walk over half a mile to reach the proposed bus stops.
He noticed Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, addressing a
group of Montbello residents, in which there were as many questions as there were
answers.
Hinton Roberson, Denver, shared that he is a bus operator for RTD and used to
drive Route 153. He said that he liked the revised proposal presented to the
Montbello community before the meeting. He noted that there are still some needs
to be addressed, like riders’ security in the area, the Montbello Park-n-Ride, and
ADA accessibility. He said that he would like to continue attending Board meetings
to learn about what is going on at RTD and would be willing to drive a bus with
members of the Montbello community to the meetings so they would be informed
as well. He added that he is an ex-police officer from Baltimore and he has been
featured on the Denver Post, 5280, and Travel Channel for his work with RTD.
Chair Sisk thanked Hinton Roberson for his service to RTD and for coming out to
speak to the Directors.
Reverend James Fouther, Denver, noted that his wife spoke very well on both of
their behalf. He mentioned that the Montbello Organizing Committee has done a
great job laying out and advocating for the issues. He added that they are grateful
for the changes presented.
Damion Hughes, Denver, spoke in favor of keeping Route 28. He understands that
the revised changes call for weekday service and no weekend service instead of
cancelling the route all together. He thanked RTD for that decision. He noted that
many vulnerable people depend on Route 28. He added that there are opportunities
for ridership as new development is in the works. He pointed out this would be a
great opportunity to reach out to people transitioning in to the neighborhood, such
as people that perhaps may have a negative connotation on transit, and share the
convenience of using Route 28 in light of parking downtown.
Doug Gragg, Denver, complimented RTD on one of the agency’s employees. Doug
Gragg said that he had a conversation with this employee while people watching at
Union Station. It was clear from the conversation that the employee was very well
educated, knew what he was talking about, and had the interest of the agency at
heart. He gave the employee’s business card to Gina Callahan, Acting Deputy
Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, and suggested that the employee
receive a commendation. Doug Gragg noted that for the past three (3) Sundays
with Broncos games, the validating machines were not working at Union Station,
causing a revenue loss. He said that this problem creates greater confusion on
already jammed packed days. He asked staff to fix this.
Shanta Farrington, Aurora, spoke on behalf of FRESC Good Jobs Strong
Community. She noted that Westminster has two major developments in process:







the light rail and the new shopping mall. FRESC has been reaching out to the
community, faith leaders, and business owners. Small business owners have
expressed concerns on the fare hike without an income based structure in place.
She added that due to the rising costs of health care and just the unknowns of life,
business owners are worried about how employees will get to and from work. She
encouraged the Board to reconsider how to incorporate a low fare program into the
current budget in order to allow an equitable factor in the decision making process.
Andrea Chiriboga-Flor, Denver, thanked the Board members who voted for the
implementation of the non-profit program: Tobiassen, Solano, Sisk, Lasater, Folska,
Lubow, Deadwyler, Archuleta, and Anderson. She thanked Directors Archuleta,
Folska, Lubow, Solano, and Tobiassen for their outspoken support. She said that
she is speaking tonight because she sees no firm commitment from RTD to an
income based program. She asked RTD to make a firm commitment because she
feels advocates for this type of program are being pushed back. As a 9to5
Community Organizer, she has had no progress to report to the community. She
shared her happiness over the changes to the Montbello service. She stressed that
the Montbello Park-n-Ride is an important community hub. She encouraged the
Directors to take more time to listen to the community and to not make rash
decisions.
Brad Martin, Aurora, spoke on the light rail construction at Aurora Town Center.
He lives on the north end of the construction and finds it difficult zig zagging
through all the traffic. Due to his disability, it is painful for him to drive through it.
He noted that businesses along Exposition have been impacted, including the
Walmart, which has taken a $4 million hit. The construction is also tearing into the
parking area of various apartment complexes, affecting the neighborhood as well.
Dana Nobles, Denver, recognized that the Board is taking small steps to address the
human cost that the changes in fare and routes incur. She congratulated the Board
members who voted in favor of expanding the non-profit program and encouraged
the Directors to keep moving in that direction. She echoed the sentiment of having
transparent community impact statements for new changes. She pointed out that
the non-profit program will not reach the 68% of low income riders impacted by
the fare increase and the reduction of bus lines. She said she was happy to hear
some of those reductions were being mitigated. She pointed out that as a city and
a community we can do better. She pointed out that prioritizing an income
program, like Seattle did, starts mitigating the human cost. She mentioned that the
majority of riders are low income, and as constituents they deserve to be invested
in. Dana Nobles shared that the ripple effects of an income based programs on
people making strides towards economic security and self-sufficiency are
monumental. She noted that the Board has heard for the past three (3) years that
the community has been asking for a program that addresses the needs of those
who depend on public transit. She said that she is not going away until RTD gives

its best, which means more than listening. It means action and prioritizing human
beings, communities, and their needs.
 Bryce Matthews, Parker, spoke to the letter from the Mayor of the Town of Parker
(Parker) included in the Board meeting agenda packet. He noted that he is the
Comprehensive Planning Manager for Parker. He pointed out that Parker is
appreciative of RTD’s consideration of the town’s connection to the District’s
system. Parker supports the proposed Route 483, which will replace Routes 410
and 153. This route speaks to the town’s desire of full day service and
connectivity to the 9 Mile Station. However, he mentioned that the proposed
schedule will lose local bus service from 20 Mile Road to the Pinery Park-n-Ride.
This loss will have an impact on those depending on Access-a-Ride as well as the
projected growth. Parker would encourage RTD to seek ways to maintain services
to the Pinery Park-n-Ride as well as increasing the frequency of the north leg of
Route 483 to 30 minutes. He said that this change could happen after the opening
of the R Line since many people will be dependent on that line for commuting.
Parker would also encourage RTD to continue the conversation to expand service to
the weekends. He thanked RTD and Director Lasater for all their work and asked
the Board to approve Route 483 with the requested improvements.
 Elizabeth Murphy, Commerce City, spoke to the 3 upcoming FasTracks stations in
South Adams County. She said the community is excited about the possibilities;
however, if they cannot access the stations they will not be able to benefit from
the new development. She thanked the Directors who supported the non-profit
program and asked for further steps towards affordable transit. She added that the
fare increases in 2016 will create further barriers in areas where people already
have barriers to transit. She asked RTD to create a plan of how to incorporate
income based passes into the budget.
Chair Sisk thanked all the public participants for their remarks.

Director James told the Directors that he will be speaking at the ribbon cutting for the

Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to approve the 2016
Recommended Budget.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Lubow shared that although she appreciates
the work that goes into preparing the budget, she will
be voting no because she would like to stress the need
to prioritize money for a low income fare given the
reduced cost of fuel and other items.
Director Folska echoed Director Lubow’s thoughts. She
would like to see a line item for the low income fare,
even if that would require the Board to balance the
budget. She said the Directors would have to find
money from somewhere, like $5 million from marketing,
to support the low income fare program.
Director Solano said that he will be voting no because
he thinks there needs to be an allocation for the needy.
He acknowledged that this may make the process
longer; however, as a public entity RTD needs to do so.

XIV. Recommended Action
C.

University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail 2016 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plan
package as summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of approximately
$16,948,000, exclusive of University of Colorado A Line Operating and Maintenance
costs, and further, to authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO or his designee to
execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.
Prior to the Board having the opportunity to move the recommended action made by staff,
Chair Sisk called on Director Deadwyler. Director Deadwyler made an amendment to the
main motion.
Motion to
Amend the
Main Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to amend the
recommended action concerning the University of
Colorado A and R Line and Rail 2016 Service Changes
Plan, replacing the Montbello Service Plan contained in
the recommended action with the Montbello Final
Recommendation and map dated November 17, 2015.
This revised plan contains modifications to Routes 45
and 121 allowing better access to existing points of
interest in the neighborhood, especially improving
access to area grocery store.
Director Menten seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus
Operations, thanked the Directors for the opportunity to
present the rationale to the service changes in the
Montbello neighborhood. After the committee
meetings, staff continued conversations and analysis
with the community and Director Deadwyler. The
primary issue was access to the Walmart Neighborhood
Grocery at Chambers and Gateway, which is the main
grocery facility in the neighborhood. This
recommendation basically flips the east legs of Routes
45 and 121 as originally presented to the Directors.
These changes will improve access from all directions

to the Walmart Neighborhood Grocery via Routes 121
and 45. Route 45 will also provide access to the Super
Walmart at Tower and Salida and the King Soopers at
Tower and Green Valley Ranch Boulevard. Route 42
will also provide access to the Super Walmart.
Director Folska thanked staff for their responsiveness
and commitment to the constituents. She also thanked
Director Deadwyler for ensuring her constituents were
heard. She wondered what the cost of implementing
these changes would be. Bruce Abel replied that staff
estimates that these changes would require an extra
bus for a cost of $150,000 to $160,000 annualized.
Director Menten asked what funding could be used to
cover this cost. Bruce Abel replied that the 2016
budget includes a line item for system maintenance.
Director Menten thanked Bruce Abel, Jessie Carter,
Manager for Service Planning and Scheduling, Jeff
Dunning, Senior Service Planner/Scheduler for the East
Team, and Director Deadwyler for their work on these
changes. She recalled the challenges of the service
changes during the opening of the West rail line.
Director Anderson acknowledged that many of the
complaints from the community during public
participation are not RTD related. She encouraged the
community to work with the City and County of Denver
(Denver) for sidewalks and lighting improvements. She
noted that the community has Councilwoman Gilmore
on their side. Bruce Abel shared that staff has met
with Councilwoman Gilmore on this subject.
Director Deadwyler agreed with Director Anderson.
She encouraged the citizens of Montbello to work with
Denver for further neighborhood improvements. She
acknowledged that RTD staff would help initiate those
conversations; however, RTD has no authority or
funding for those matters. She thanked staff for all
their hard work, noting that the hardest person they
had to get through was her.

Discussion:

Vote on

Director Lasater echoed Bryce Matthew’s comments on
behalf of the Town of Parker. He appreciates Jessie
Carter and Jeff Dunning for evaluating the current
Route 410 and recommending the same peak period
frequencies on Route 483 as this will be important for
connectivity even for potential employees that will
work in Parker. He encouraged the Board to discuss at
a later date service from 9 Mile to Parker and service
requests for the weekends. He admonished Parker to
get ahead of the curve and start marketing the Call-nRide service to the potential areas of employment to
get riders to match a potential increased service
request.
