BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Road to Recovery

Committee Meeting Date:
April 27, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20-minute presentation followed by discussion
BACKGROUND
Since mid-March 2020, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) – like the rest of the world – has
faced significant impacts due to the pandemic. The agency has suffered major reductions in fare and
sales tax revenues, which are the agency’s largest sources of revenue; additionally, RTD has
experienced a significant decrease in ridership.
RTD continues to carry approximately 40% of its pre-pandemic ridership and is operating at just over
60% of pre-pandemic service levels. The $232 million in funding received through the Coronavirus Aid,
Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act allowed the agency to maintain staffing levels throughout
2020. RTD implemented a reduction in workforce in January 2021. Upon learning the agency would
have access to $203.4 million through the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental
Appropriations Act (CRRSAA), RTD rescinded layoffs of its represented workforce. The CRRSAA funding
will allow RTD to maintain staffing levels and support transit operations through 2021 and 2022.
The agency learned March 29, 2021 it will have access to an additional $338.4 million apportioned
through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) by September 2024 to budget service changes in the
future as the public returns to transit. Due to the uncertainty of how ridership will recover, this federal
funding provides the agency flexibility and predictability to ensure that service will be available as
customers return to using RTD services.
RTD has worked diligently to optimize service delivery to better address the needs of customers who are
most reliant on RTD service and will continue to do so with future service adjustments.
DISCUSSION
In an effort to develop a Ridership Growth Action Plan it is paramount to garner input from the Board of
Directors through a collective discussion regarding understanding customers’ pain points, identifying the
problem(s) to be solved and then ideating.
The General Manager and CEO will utilize the Design Thinking Process to lead the strategic work session
with the Board. Design Thinking is a design methodology that provides a solution-based approach to
solving problems with focus on the following:
▪ Tackling complex problems that are ill-defined or unknown
▪ Understanding the human needs involved by re-framing the problem in human-centric ways
▪ Creating many ideas in brainstorming sessions
▪ Adopting a hands-on approach in prototyping and testing

Packet Pg. 2

1.B.1

There are five stages of Design Thinking:
▪ Empathize – Understanding the human needs involved
▪ Define (the problem) – Re-framing and defining the problem to be solved in human-centric ways
▪ Ideate – Creating many ideas in ideation sessions
▪ Prototype – Adopting a hands-on approach in prototyping
▪ Test – Developing a prototype/solution to the problem
The General Manager/CEO will guide an interactive discussion with the Board working through the first
three stages of the Design Thinking process. Staff will then take those ideas and concepts, flesh them
out and return to the Board with options and a recommendation for next steps to chart the agency’s
“Road to Recovery” plan.
