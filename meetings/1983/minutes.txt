North Metro.
Jay Corbett, Aurora, read a letter advocating for a ban on smoking on all rail
platforms in the state. A copy of the letter is available in the Board Minutes file in

Doug Gragg, Denver, suggested it was the working class who are the biggest
offenders on smoking and asked if we could just lay off. His specific issue was
about the fare study. He stated the fare study was not in touch with the working
class of riders who simply cannot afford the fare. We need to get rid of the zones.
They are too confusing, arbitrary and discriminatory.
