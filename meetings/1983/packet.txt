B. Recommended Actions

• Budget Transfer for I-25 North Express Lanes Extension and Express Bus
Project
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $375,000 from the Drivers Kiosk
Replacement Project to fund the 2014 payment for the IGA for the I-25
North Express Lanes Extension and Express Bus Project. Funding for the
2015 payment will be provided in the 2015 Recommended Budget.
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the November 25, 2014 Board
meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs,
noted that funding for the I-25 North Express Lanes Extension
and Express Bus Project funding for 2014 would be provided
through this budget transfer. He said that funding for the
2015 payment will be provided in the 2015 Recommended
Budget. Once the project is open, RTD would expect to see
operating and maintenance cost savings of between $64,000
and $282,000 per year depending on the revised schedules
and resulting run cutting process.
Director Lubow asked for clarification on the Drivers Kiosk
Replacement Project fund since she had never heard of it. She
wanted to know why there were funds available as well as

Director Daly wanted to make sure the operators would not be
left high and dry. Rick Clarke reaffirmed the Directors that the
Drivers Kiosk Replacement Project fund is important and
incorporated into the 2015 SBP.
Director Folska noted that she talked to Bruce Abel, Assistant
General Manager for Bus Operations, about adding a Drivers
Kiosk at the W. Bowles Ave. and S. Wadsworth Blvd.
intersection. She said that operators currently use the Chili’s
restaurant as a relief station. Rick Clarke mentioned that staff
is in the process of relocating the Southwest Plaza bus stop.
The relocation includes the addition of a Drivers Kiosk. He
said that staff is waiting on Southwest Plaza to confirm the
new stop location. Director Folska asked staff to keep the
visually impaired community in the conversation of the bus
stop relocation.

C. Updates

• Strategic Plan Update
Brian Welch, Senior Manager for Technical Services, reviewed the RTD 2015
Strategic Plan presentation as included in the Planning & Development
Committee Meeting Packet for November 11, 2014. The presentation
included:
 Strategic Plan Schedule
 Proposed Plan Name (Move, Connect, Transform)
 Proposed Vision Statement (Transforming Regional Mobility and
Quality of Life Through Innovation and Collaboration)
Packet Pg. 11

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 11, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

what would need to happen in order to replace the funds if
needed. Rick Clarke answered that the Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP) includes a line item for construction, replacement, and
improvement of the Drivers Kiosks. The 2014 line item still
has funds available. These funds are not anticipated to be
used during the remainder of the year. Rick Clarke added that
the 2015 SBP includes a line item for Driver Kiosks, so the line
item will be funded then.

Committee Chair James pointed out that he likes the structure/organization
of the process. He said that he had a positive reaction to the proposed plan
name and proposed vision statement as they are concise and tell a story.
He reiterated to the Directors that the Board revisiting the plan frequently is
an important part of the process.
Director Folska pointed out that the Planning and Development Committee
Meeting packet was not ADA accessible. Since she was not able to read it,
she said that she had no information on the matter and could not make a
comment.
Director Lubow thanked staff for their work. She reiterated her position that
the Board needs to give more direction. She said that she does not relate to
the proposed plan name or vision statement and that she had no input on
the matter. Director Lubow said that this does not mean the proposed plan
name and vision statement are wrong. She said that she would like to see
some areas represented in the name and vision statement: FasTracks
completion, fare equity, and increasing transit for constituents who paid
taxes but get little transit. She added that she was not sure where all those
components would fit in.
Director Walker said that he liked the name as it stated a what, a why, and
a how. He mentioned that the vision statement seemed fine. He noted that
the strategic plan will be a long term plan. Director Walker said that he
looks forward to the next ideas staff will bring to the Directors for feedback.
Director Solano said that he is getting tied up in the words and semantics of
the proposed plan name and proposed vision statement. He mentioned that
he was confused as to what the next step is. He noted that the Fare Task
Force had no Board members nor Citizen Advisory Committee members. He
wondered why the Board is included in some areas but not others. Director
Solano said that this was confusing.
Director Bagley asked staff if their intention was to have the Board approve
of the proposed plan name and vision statement by vote. Bill Van Meter,
Assistant General Manager for Planning, said that staff was looking for
enough head nods to move forward. The next step would require more
involvement from the Directors. Bill Van Meter said that a vote would be at

the discretion of the Board. Director Bagley said that he did not think staff
had enough head nods to move forward.
Committee Chair James respectfully disagreed with Director Bagley. He said
that in the absence of negatives staff had the discretion to move forward.

Director Folska added that dialogue is part of the process. She said that if
she knew what the proposed vision statement was she could ask staff the
meaning of every word. She stated that the reason she is passionate about
public transit is because it enables everyone to reach their full potential.
Director Menten said that she was fine with what was presented. She
compared the discussion to painting a wall white or egg shell white. She
said that naming something was not of great importance to her.
Director Bagley stated that he did not hear the head nod from the Directors.
He added that the name and vision statement are not as critical as the
strategy. Brian Welch said that staff was not anticipating direction on
strategy during the current meeting, just the name and vision statement.
Bill Van Meter apologized for the packet not being ADA accessible. He read
the proposed name and proposed vision statement.
Committee Chair James asked staff if they had enough feedback to move
forward. Bill Van Meter said that staff did have enough to move forward.
He noted that from the discussion it seemed that staff is moving in the right
direction but needs to fine tune the vision statement in order to gather
enough head nods to move forward. Bill Van Meter noted that staff is
looking forward to the strategic discussion with the Board.
Committee Chair James asked the Directors to contact Bill Van Meter or
Brian Welch with any questions and suggestions. He asked staff to contact
the Directors with any questions.

• CDOT FASTER Grants
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, reviewed the CDOT
FASTER Grants Set-Aside Project List presentation as included in the
Planning & Development Committee Meeting Packet for November 11,
2014. The presentation included a background on the grants funding

Chair Sisk said that he appreciated staff’s work. He noted that he supports
the proposed plan name. He said that he was having difficulty with the
proposed vision statement. He stated that “quality of life” has different
meanings for different people. He said that the proposed vision statement is
not capturing what it needs to capture.

process, the new 2016-17 process, and a list of the set-aside projects for
the next couple of years.

Director Lubow asked why the $4 to $5 million past funding was reduced to
$3 million. Bill Van Meter said that the past process was a competitive
process. The new process sets aside money for RTD projects. RTD
communicated receptivity to the new process as it eliminated the
competitive factor.
Director Menten asked if the pool of funding for FASTER is the CDOT fee
funding that was not taken to the voters. Marla Lien, General Counsel, said
that Director Menten was correct in that the fee funding was not taken to
the voters. Marla Lien added that she did not remember if that is the only
source of funding for FASTER grants. Bill Van Meter added that he did not
recall if there are other sources of funding. Director Menten asked staff to
assist her in finding out the status of the bridges that were supposed to be
repaired with what she called the “illegal tax hike” by CDOT to voters. Bill
Van Meter said that CDOT has been transparent with their plans and
funding, so he should be able to access that information.
Director Menten mentioned that she did a walk-through with a sight-impaired
gentleman through the West corridor to note what could be improved in the
future. She said a million dollars seems like a lot of money to replace and/or
repair the yellow tactile strips. She asked staff to explain to her offline what
replacing the tactile strips entails. She noted that Ms. Jacquez, who has
participated in Board meetings’ public participation and accompanied them
on the walk through, stated that someone in the planning department in the
northern area of the State is familiar with tactile strips’ technological
improvements. She asked staff to connect with this planning department to
see if this is something that could benefit RTD.

D. Other Matters
Chair Sisk congratulated the newly elected Board members and the re-elected Board
members on their election. He thanked them for being willing to take the time and
effort to. He added that there will be an appropriate time in the near future to say
goodbye and thank you to Director Daly and Director Rivera-Malpiede.

B. Recommended Actions

• Local Government Liaison Services
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into an
agreement for Local Government Liaison services with CRL Associates, Inc.
(CRL) to exercise the third option year (January 1, 2015 through December
31, 2015) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a cost of $122,496.
Funding for this contract is included in the annual FasTracks budget.
Committee Chair Folska noted that the cost for the Recommended Action
that was included in the packet was incorrect. The total cost should be
$122,496 as opposed to the $96,000 amount originally presented. Sherry
Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, explained that since the original
contract was approved with CRL Associates, additional responsibilities were
added as an amendment. She said the $122,496 cost reflects these
additional responsibilities of providing the liaison services for the Citizens
Advisory Committee (CAC).
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 25, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Solano believes that CRL is a great company that has
done great work on behalf of RTD and the Board. He strongly
recommends a ‘yes’ vote.

Directors Anderson, Hoy and Rivera-Malpiede were absent.

6.B

Director Lasater expressed concern about extending this
contract for a full year due to the possibility of Roger Sherman
leaving CRL pending the results of the upcoming Denver City
Council elections. He noted that Mr. Sherman is really the
only person from CRL that he has worked with since joining
the RTD Board. Director Lasater stated that he worries about
extending a contract for a year when the primary person that
works with RTD is potentially disappearing. He suggested
making this contract a month-to-month contract to be able to
evaluate the new dynamics at CRL should Mr. Sherman leave.
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications,
stated that any substitution or change in personnel will be
approved by RTD. If RTD is not comfortable with whoever is
assigned to our account, that would be a contractual issue
that would be addressed. Director Lasater asked if a decision
would come back to the Board; he feels that Scott Reed is
indicating staff would have the final say. Scott Reed said that
staff would discuss CRL’s personnel with the Board but there
would not be a new contract approval.
Roger Sherman commented that Director Lasater has asked a
very valid question. He explained that if he was elected he
would not take office until July. Roger Sherman reiterated
that despite him being the person that interfaces with the
Board at the Tuesday meetings, Maria Garcia Berry is very
involved in RTD’s issues, meetings, etc. Roger Sherman
shared that Jin Tsuchiya, who previously worked in RTD’s
Communications Department, will begin working with Mr.
Sherman in preparation for the potential transition.
Director James said that he has nothing but positive
comments for all of CRL’s staff; he has always had great
experiences working with them. He has every confidence that
even without Roger Sherman, CRL will serve RTD very well.

Packet Pg. 18

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 11, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Folska said she really enjoys working with
CRL. She thinks that Roger Sherman really does a fantastic
job in representing the Board and everyone in the District.

Committee Chair Folska declared the motion PASSED.

It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter
into a new agreement for Federal Liaison Services with Squire Patton Boggs
LLP for a 23-month contract at a cost of $494,500 ($21,500 per month—
the same rate as currently being paid) with three one-year options (option
year one at $264,000; option year two at $270,000; option year three at
$276,000). The total amount of $1,304,500 was below staff’s internal
cost estimate, and funding for this contract is included in the annual
budgets.
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item
forward to the full Board at the November 25,
2014 Board meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Menten noted that there were 10 proposals that were
reviewed by the evaluation committee. Several weeks ago
she requested to review the proposals but at the time they
were confidential. Director Menten wonders if those proposals
are now public so she can review the information. Scott Reed
indicated that the financial information in the proposals is
considered proprietary information until a contract is executed;
however, he did not did not see an issue in providing her with
a list of proposers. Bob Brown, Contract Negotiator, said he
would be happy to review that information with Director
Menten.
Director Lasater commented that Squire Patton Boggs LLP is
not the same organization that RTD has worked with
previously; this company is the result of a merger of two
companies. He said that while the people interfacing with,
and working on behalf of, RTD may be the same people, it is
still an unknown variable. Director Lasater shared that
whenever the Parker Town Council had a major contract
dealing with liaison services the top two or three candidates
Packet Pg. 19

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 11, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

• Federal Liaison Services

were always brought in for an official presentation to the
Council. He stated that is not happening with this
recommendation, which he thinks needs to be done. He feels
that while Patton Boggs has done a good job in the past, there
might be another agency that might do a better job but the
Board has not been given the opportunity to hear from the top
contenders. Director Lasater thinks that RTD’s federal liaison
services is one of the primary areas that the Board should
focus on; getting a good organization that helps bring federal
funds to RTD so we can build as much as we can, as fast as
we can is extremely important. He asked that the Board not
approve this recommendation and wait until the top
contenders can make a presentation.
Sherry Ellebracht introduced Kevin O’Neill from Squire Patton
Boggs. She asked him to address the merger. Committee
Chair Folska asked that Mr. O’Neill also speak to the
difference between an acquisition and a merger. Kevin O’Neill
said he would like to begin by addressing Director Lasater’s
concern about the team that would represent and work with
RTD. He stated that the team that has served RTD for the
better part of 15 years will be the team that continues to
serve under the proposed contract: Mike Dino, Anne Miano,
Jared Fleischer and Kevin O’Neill. He shared that there would
also be an addition to the team, Patricia Doersch, who was the
Senior Legislative Representative for APTA. Prior to that she
served as Counsel for the House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee and the Highways and Transit
Subcommittee and served as an attorney at the Federal
Highway Administration. Kevin O’Neill stated that she is
ideally situated and well qualified to be of assistance to RTD.
He informed the Board that Ms. Doersch would be at the
December Government Relations Committee meeting.
Kevin O’Neill shared that Patton Boggs’ strategic plan has had
the goal of merging with another firm to expand their presence
internationally for quite some time. He noted that without a
merger it would be difficult to build an internationally presence
from scratch. He said that while Patton Boggs initially began
conversations with a number of firms, Squire Sanders was the
most diligent. Patton Boggs began talking with Squire Sanders
almost exclusively at the beginning of 2014 with a merger
being finalized in Spring. Kevin O’Neill said that Squire Patton
Boggs now has over 1,500 lawyers in every major capitol of
the world. He reminded the Board that at the Denver Union
Station P3 Roundtable several team members from Squire
Packet Pg. 20

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 11, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

6.B

6.B

Sanders were in attendance. He stated that the public
infrastructure team and expertise gained by Patton Boggs was
really a driving factor in the decision to merge.

Kevin O’Neill explained that Squire Sanders wanted to merge
with Patton Boggs due to their lack of footprint in the
government relations world. He reiterated that prior to the
merger Patton Boggs had more top rated lobbyists in D.C. than
any other firm in the world; after the merger Squire Patton
Boggs now has more top rated lobbyists in D.C. than any
other firm in the world.
Director Lubow said she appreciates the additional information
but agrees with Director Lasater. She thinks that in the
interest of full transparency and full accountability the Board
should have a presentation by the major contenders. She
believes the Board owes it to themselves to see these
presentations as the lobbying contract is so important in
moving RTD forward as an agency.
Director Solano reiterated that he thinks Patton Boggs has
done an excellent job. He noted that they are able to translate
what is happening at the Federal Level to something that is
understandable for everyone. He stated that while there may
be other companies that can compete, Patton Boggs has a
track record that is proven. He reiterated his support for this
recommended action.
Director Daly commented that as a member of the evaluation
committee he can say that this is not a decision they came to
lightly. The evaluation committee received ten very complex
and large proposals without the financial information that had
to be reviewed. He said the committee members got together
and meticulously scored each proposal based on its technical
factors; after these scores were calculated the committee was
provided with the financial information for review. Director
Daly believes this is a very thorough process. He feels that
having teams come in from all over the country at a very high
expense is a sad waste of money.
Packet Pg. 21

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 11, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Kevin O’Neill said that in reference to this being a merger
versus an acquisition, the agreement reached between Patton
Boggs and Squire Sanders was really a merger of equals: the
CEOs from each company are now Co-CEOs, the partners
remain partners, each board now has seats on a combined
board, etc.

Chair Sisk stated that he wholeheartedly supports approving
Squire Patton Boggs for RTD’s Federal Liaison Services. He
pointed out their ability to adapt and react by working with
Directors to establish a much bigger presence during the APTA
Legislative Conference in March as compared with previous
years. He believes that RTD has a proven track record with
the Patton Boggs team. Chair Sisk commented that having
such a strong local presence in Mike Dino is also vitally
important to him. He thinks this is a tremendous opportunity
for RTD to continue a long-term working relationship that can
be parlayed into continued success for RTD.
Director Deadwyler remembers that at the last Government
Relations Committee meeting Committee Chair Folska
announced that the evaluation committee was recommending
Squire Patton Boggs for our Federal Liaison Services; however,
Director Deadwyler wonders why the Board was not given an
option at that time to hear presentations from the top
contenders. She wonders if this is something that Committee
Chair Folska or Director Daly thought about during the
evaluation committee’s process. Committee Chair Folska
noted that it was a very intense process with a great deal of
material to review and evaluate. She said that she spoke with
Chair Sisk about how it would be appropriate to have the top
two contenders make a presentation in an Executive Session,
and he agreed. She stated that unfortunately she was
overruled by the other four evaluation committee members.
She encouraged anyone that wants to hear from the top
contenders to make a motion. Committee Chair Folska
commented that in response to Director Daly’s concern about
the cost, the Board could invite the top contenders and those
contenders can chose if they wish to come.
Director James stated that after watching the Patton Boggs
team work he continues to be impressed. He believes that
they will only be going from great to excellent with the
addition of Squire Sanders. He said that he trust in the
selection process, combined with his own experiences, so he
will be voting yes.
Director Lasater stated that in response to Director Daly’s
comments, asking the top contenders to present to the Board
is simply the cost of doing business. He said that he does not
question staff other than when they get into a comfort zone
and begin going with “business as usual” recommendations.

Scott Reed reminded the Board that the procurement process
was established before the Request for Proposal (RFP) was
issued. The established process included the option for the
evaluation committee to bring the finalists in for an interview;
however, because of the strengths of the Squire Patton Boggs
proposal and the large point differential between them and the
next proposer, the committee thought it did not make sense to
have the interviews. He would caution the Board in doing
something that is outside of the previously established
procurement process as being a potentially dangerous
decision. Committee Chair Folska reiterated that she thought
it would be appropriate for the Board to hear from the top
contenders and Chair Sisk agreed. She wonders what is
dangerous in having this presentation.
After much discussion about the appropriateness of having the
top contenders make a presentation, Director Bagley called for
the question. Director Solano seconded. The vote to end
debate passed and the vote on the original motion by staff
was conducted.

C. Updates

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Kevin O’Neill said that Squire Patton Boggs will be presenting in December
to preview the 114th Congress; tonight’s comments will be just to focus on
the high level impact of the election. He reminded the Board that they
should have received a copy of Squire Patton Boggs’ post-election analysis,
which included several pages about transportation.
Kevin O’Neill noted that this is the biggest set of Republican elected officials
to take office in January in 86 years; this election saw more members of the
President’s party thrown out of office from the Senate in any off-year
election since 1956. He said that in the House of Representatives the
Packet Pg. 23

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 11, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

He believes that is it the fiduciary responsibility of the Board to
have an opportunity to meet with the top contenders.

6.B

Republicans have never had more than 249 seats; as of today they have
244. He noted that these Republicans are more moderate and pragmatic
than those elected in 2010. This will give the Speaker of the House
Boehner more cushion in making deals to get legislation passed.

Kevin O’Neill said that his team is expecting a very tame lame duck session;
the only wildcard will be immigration. He pointed out that the Marketplace
Freedom Act, requiring online sellers to collect sales tax, may be considered
in the House or Senate this fall, which could have a positive impact for RTD.
He stated that the most important decision for RTD will be the
appropriations process. There is a continuing resolution that extends
through mid-December, at which point Congress will need to decide if they
pass a short term funding bill or something longer.
Director Bagley commented that with so many inexperienced members in the
House and Senate it is so important for RTD to have a Federal Liaison that
not only knows RTD but also knows so many of the old and new Congress
members. He congratulated Squire Patton Boggs on their contract passing
the Committee this evening.
Committee Chair Folska inquired how their new global presence might be
able to benefit RTD as it relates to P3s. Kevin O’Neill stated that the people
from the P3 team would be delighted to have meetings, phone calls, etc.
with the Board. He has been working closely with this team on a daily
basis.
Director Solano wonders if making the internet a utility is related to the
Marketplace Freedom Act. Kevin O’Neill explained that those are two
separate issues. He said that unfortunately he is not an expert on net
neutrality but it will be a very complex fight.

• State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna
Jenifer Brandeberry said that as everyone knows the elections were held last
week. She noted there were several races that are not yet final but would
be soon. She stated that for the first time in 10 years the Colorado
Republican Party will control the Senate; the House Democrats have a two
vote majority.
Jenifer Brandeberry shared that the Senate Republicans had held their
leadership elections. Bill Cadman (Colorado Springs) will serve as President,
Packet Pg. 24

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 11, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mike Dino stated that one of the very good things about Squire Patton
Boggs is that they are very bipartisan. Kevin O’Neill commented that
Congress is an extraordinarily inexperienced Congress. This can mean that
it will take longer to build relationships with them and bring them up-tospeed.

6.B

Jenifer Brandeberry said that the House Democrats had also not held their
elections. The House Republicans elected Representative Brian DelGrosso
(Loveland) as Minority Leader, Representative Libby Szabo (Arvada) as
Assistant Minority Leader, Representative Polly Lawrence (Roxborough) as
Caucus Whip and Representative Lois Landgraf (Fountain) as Caucus
Chairwoman.
Jenifer Brandeberry stated that the biggest change for RTD would be the
make-up of the Joint Budget Committee. There are only two members that
remain the same which can lead to very different dynamics. She noted also
that there will be a lot of changeover in the Governor’s Staff.
Committee Chair Folska thanked Brandeberry-McKenna for all their hard
work. She believes 2015 will be an exciting year with all of the changes
that are taking place.

• Local Government Update - CRL Associates
Roger Sherman thanked the Board for their support in extending CRL’s
option. He congratulated the current Directors that were re-elected; he
looks forward to continuing to work with the entire Board. Roger Sherman
shared that he has reached out to the two newly elected Directors and had
the opportunity to speak with one.
Roger Sherman stated that in the elections there were two new mayors
elected, two new Adams County Commissioners, and several various city
council members. He said that there was also a new Clerk and Recorder
elected for Jefferson County.
Roger Sherman pointed out that the Aurora Transportation Tax Initiative
failed by fairly significant numbers. He shared that the Colorado
Transportation Coalition will meeting shortly to discuss a path forward to
more funding for transportation and transit within the State. He said he
would keep the Board updated on those conversations.

the committee was made up of Directors Folska and Daly in addition to three staff
members; however, she also heard that Chair Sisk had some input. She wondered
what staff members were part of the committee. Committee Chair Folska stated
that the three staff members were Scott Reed, Sherry Ellebracht and Doug
MacLeod.

Kevin Diviness, Director of Quality Assurance, told the
Directors that the Delcan contract runs parallel to the Jacobs
Engineering contract. Delcan has exceeded the DBE
contractual goal of 5%, averaging 8.3%. He said that Delcan
has committed to a 12.3% DBE goal for 2015. He recognized
Tim Stokes, Senior Project Manager at Delcan, among those in

Director Bagley expressed his excitement over approving
contracts for Jacob Engineering, Delcan, and Kumar and
Associates, Inc. He said RTD has great review of records and
account monitoring under these companies. He is convinced
that the auditing is done appropriately. He thanked all three
companies.
Director Menten asked if Delcan’s quality control oversight
included the oversight of the Jersey bridge. Kevin Diviness
explained that the quality control lies on the contractors as
they are responsible for checking their own work. Delcan and
other firms give RTD the tools for review and oversight. Rick
Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, added
that staff will give an Eagle P3 project update to the Board in
December. This update will include the Jersey bridge.

Director Tobiassen said that I-225 is his highest priority as it is
in the peak of construction. He works very closely with the
Virtegic team. He was surprised to find out some of the
contractors were not RTD employees. He said the Virtegic are
great folks working on a great, incredibly complex project.
Director Deadwyler said that her experience with Virtegic is
different from that of Director Tobiassen. She mentioned that
Virtegic has limited access to people. She noted that she is
not happy with some of the decisions or the mistakes that
have been made. She added that she could not vote to award
another $500,000 plus to this organization.
Director Solano said that his experience with Virtegic has
always been positive. They have always been available to
explain the projects. He noted they are always present at
meetings. He said that he would vote yes.
Chair Sisk noted that he read through the contract and is very
satisfied. He considers the Virtegic working seamlessly with
the RTD staff a great strategy. He said his questions have

D. Updates

• Aurora Line / I-225 Rail Construction Update

Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, mentioned that
FasTracks has a tremendous safety record exceeding the industry averages
by a wide margin. FasTracks insurance has issued rebates due to the safety
record. He also pointed out that Chris Hinton is an example of opportunities
given to people on FasTracks. Rick Clarke said that Chris Hinton started as
a T-REX Construction Engineer, worked on the West Corridor, was an Eagle
Project Quality Manager, and now is the I-225 Deputy Project Manager for
Construction.
Rick Clarke made reference to Director Tobiassen’s previous comments on
the complexity of the I-225 project. He said that there have been many
challenges, both contractual and those that come with building infrastructure
in urban areas. He noted that Aurora Water is planning on betterments to
their system while construction is ongoing. This, Rick Clarke said, is good
for the community though it does present complications to RTD’s project.
Staff still predicts opening the I-225 Rail line in the second half of 2016.
Director Deadwyler thanked staff for the safety video. She said that she
appreciates the construction crew’s work under inclement weather. She
encourages her constituents to honk and say hi to the construction workers
thanking them for their work.
Director Deadwyler told staff about the difficulty she experienced due to the
closings at E. Exposition Ave. and S. Sable Blvd. She said that the signage
and the detours were not clearly marked when she was trying to access the
Kaiser Permanente facility. She noted that signage was better last week.
However, she found it frustrating because she could not find any alerts
regarding the closings. She asked staff to give better communications about
closings in the future, especially when it involves high traffic areas such as a
medical facility. Rick Clarke replied that he would look into the released
communication pertaining to that closing.
Director Tobiassen commended the RTD staff and Kiewit for their work on
such a complex project. He also commended the City of Aurora and their

staff for their partnership with RTD. He stated that the City of Aurora does
not have additional staff or resources yet they are doing a lot to connect
with RTD work. He specifically thanked Aurora Public Works, Aurora Parks
and Open Spaces, Aurora Water, Channel 8, and the residents and HOAs.
He also thanked RTD and City of Aurora staff for reaching out and
communicating with local business. Rick Clarke confirmed staff
communicates with the City of Aurora and/or the heads of the different
public entities on a daily basis.

Director Bagley asked Dave Genova, Assistant General Manager for Safety,
Security and Facilities, who was acting for General Manager Phil Washington, to
provide the Board at a later time with an update of the Real Property Pilot Program.
Director Bagley told the Directors he did a Denver Union Station (DUS) presentation
at the Denver Country Club. The presentation was well received. Of the ninety

B. Recommended Actions

• Purchase twelve (12) Light Rail Vehicles
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to enter into a negotiations with Siemens to purchase twelve (12) Light Rail
Vehicles at a total price not to exceed $48 million, and to enter into the
resulting contract with Siemens.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 25, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager for Rail Operations,
explained that these new vehicles will supplement the existing
fleet with the I-225 and Southeast extension corridors
openings. He noted that Light Rail service is popular, thus
needing more vehicles on the streets.
Director Bagley said that he had chatted with Austin Jenkins
during the LEED® Green Building Certification Award Ceremony
at Denver Union Station (DUS). He noted that he had a couple
of questions that he wanted to have on the record.

Director Folska participated via phone.

6.D

Director Bagley asked Austin Jenkins regarding bicycle
accommodations in the new vehicles. Austin Jenkins replied
that accommodating bicycles is a challenge. He noted that
the cars are the same size as the current cars. In order to
accommodate bicycles, seats would have to be given up. The
feedback from riders is to not give up seats. Austin Jenkins
noted that most morning trains from the Southeast lines are
maxed out at four cars and standing room. Austin Jenkins
added that seating will be knee to back on the new fleet.
Director Tobiassen said that his first question was regarding
seating and that it had been answered. He wondered if the
new fleet would have a ripple effect on RTD’s ability to store
vehicles. Austin Jenkins stated that the Board action earlier in
the year to store vehicles along the I-225 corridor will pay
dividends; there will be no problem storing the cars.
Director Daly said his question was also regarding seating and
that it had been addressed.
Director Lubow pointed out that bikes are important. She
asked staff to further discuss room for bicycles on Light Rail
vehicles. Austin Jenkins informed the Directors that he wrote
a paper on this subject and led the conversion of the fleet
while he worked in San Jose, CA. He reiterated that in order
to gain something, in this case bicycle space, something must
be given up, seats. He noted that the current fleet allows for
four (4) bikes on each train car except behind the operator.
On a full four (4) car train this amounts to fourteen (14) bikes.
RTD cars do not have the space in the middle section to put
hangers in place like other agencies with longer cars have
done. Director Lubow said that fourteen (14) bikes is not bad.
Director Deadwyler wondered why RTD has not considered
switching to longer buses or trains like other agencies, for
example, Indianapolis. Austin Jenkins replied that a uniform
fleet through the same manufacturer saves the agency a lot of
money. He said that RTD’s current vehicle is a good vehicle.
Packet Pg. 37

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 18, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley asked about the external appearance of the 12
new vehicles. Austin Jenkins said that the new vehicles are
an upgraded version of the same series as the existing fleet.
He noted that the new vehicles feature advances in design,
structure, and technology.

He added that the current scenario is the best situation for
what the agency has.

Austin Jenkins expressed his thanks to the Board for working together
through the past years. He was not sure if and when he would address the
Board again before his transition from RTD.

• Budget Transfer for Contracted Fixed-Route Services
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize a budget transfer from the purchased
transportation service and fuel line items of the “Group 20” budget to the
service line item of the “Group 23” budget to cover the variation in costs
incurred as a result of adjustments to service levels associated with
runboard service changes in 2014. The total dollar amount of the budget
transfer is $760,000.
Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the November 25,
2014 Board meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations,

loud to match the one on the Board Report as $760,000.

Director Solano wondered if ridership was growing since
purchasing twelve (12) vehicles would allow for room to grow.

opening of the W Rail Line. He also noted the increase
ridership during Bronco game days.

Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the November 25, 2014 Board
meeting.

Discussion:

Richard Rost, Manager for Facilities Engineering, explained to
the Directors that the project is 90% complete. The remaining
work requiring the amendment includes:
 A permanent ground water filtration system
 Emergency generator
 Removal of unforeseen railroad ties
 Upgrades to interior finishes
 Security system
 Building automation system
 Data lines
 Automatic elevator recall feature
Richard Rost also noted that the project funding is available
from a remaining CMAQ grant amount of approximately
$1,200,000 and local match that is within the project budget.
He said that the team is aiming at an August, 2015 move in
date.
Director Bagley asked why the items listed were not originally
considered. He also noted that this project has been going on
for four (4) to five (5) years. Richard Rost answered that the
project has been going on for longer than that. He said that
the original scope was a Park-n-Ride surface lot. He added
that the listed items are necessary as the project moves
towards a Transit Oriented Development (TOD) with a parking
structure. Director Bagley expressed his satisfaction with
Richard Rost’s answer.
Director Solano asked regarding the removal of unforeseen
railroad ties. He said that this makes him imagine there is
some sort of excavation projected for the project. Richard
Rost answered in the affirmative. He said that this would
account for any unforeseen work in that area.
Director Menten asked for clarification on the completion of
the project. Richard Rost said that the project is 90%
complete.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 18, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Director Menten said that when the project originally was
approved, the figure was $7.145 million. She pointed out that
the $1.4 million requested adds considerably to the total
amount of the project. She asked if this was the final number
or if the Board should expect another increase. Richard Rost
replied that the project is so close to the end that staff does
not anticipate any further increases. He noted that there is a
contingency built within the $1.4 million requested. Phil
Washington, General Manager, said that the project could
potentially come under the $1.4 million. Dave Genova,
Assistant General Manager for Safety, Security, and Facilities,
added that funding is available through a CMAQ grant of $1.2
million dollars. In order to secure the funding, the agency
needs to move ahead with the project.
Director Hoy said that the discussion may have answered his
question. He wondered where the remaining funding will
come from. He said that it sounded like the remaining $1.2
million is covered under the CMAQ grant. Richard Rost replied
that the amounts are in the existing budget and that this is
under the General Manager’s authority increase. Dave Genova
clarified that the request is a contract amendment, not asking
for extra money. Director Hoy wanted to clarify that he heard
Phil Washington and Dave Genova say that RTD may not need
to use the requested amount. Dave Genova told Director Hoy
that he was correct.
Director Folska mentioned that she hopes the accessibility
issues that surfaced at Denver Union Station do not happen at
this station.
Director Menten asked for clarification on the permanent
ground water filtration. Richard Rost said the property is at a
high water table. Since the bus station is below the water
line, water would need to be pumped at all times.

C. Updates

• Updated RTD System Map/Line Colors and Letters

Kate Wilson distributed the revised FasTracks Line Map to the Directors.
Scott Reed said the map includes the letter and color designation for the
lines. He reminded the Directors that the extension process started in 2000.
Letters were used as identifiers as this was consistent with the Regional bus
system. He said that the colors are for map purposes only.
Kate Wilson told the Directors that the current project started this past
summer. Staff looked at project and system planning and followed any
precedents set. The new lines are designated as below:
 A – Airport/East line. This letter has been historically reserved for
this line.
 B – Northwest line/Boulder. This letter has been historically reserved
for this line.
 G – Gold line
 L – Central rail extension as it will loop through Downtown Denver
 N – North metro line
 R – I-225. This letters alliterates with Aurora.
Kate Wilson reiterated that the colors are for map purposes only and not for
line identification. She said that staff took careful considerations when
choosing colors as to ease confusion at intersections.
Director Lasater mentioned that for the past year and a half he had been told
that the eventual Ridge Gate/I-225 line was called the “Z” line. He
wondered where the “R” came from. Kate Wilson said that for planning and
internal document purposes the line was referred as “Z” line. Scott Reed
added that the “R” was for the alliteration with Aurora as the “A” line had
been historically reserved for the airport line. Director Lasater pointed out
that half the line is not in Aurora. Scott Reed said that the City of Aurora is
doing marketing to rebrand around the rail line.
Director Tobiassen said that he supports naming the I-225 line as the “R”
line.

• Fare Study Task Force Update
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, explained that
the update discusses alternatives identified, initial screenings, and the
alternatives that have passed for further evaluation. Staff is not making any
recommendations at this time.

Director Tobiassen noted that the presentation did not reference the benefit
of free parking at light rail stations. Bruce Abel said that parking is a
specific item CH2M HILL will address during the process.
Director Tobiassen asked if the study addressed discount passes, such as
Senior discount and students. Bruce Abel said that staff has taken discount
passes into consideration during the process.
Director Bagley noted that the Littleton public meeting is scheduled for
December 11, the same date as the Board dinner and the Highlands Ranch
Transportation Advisory Task Force meeting. He asked staff to consider
finding another time so he and other Directors could attend. Bruce Abel said
that he would ask the outreach team and see what could be done.
Director Walker asked if customers would pay extra for different types of
services, i.e. bus and rail. He mentioned that he may have missed this
during the presentation. Lacy Bell answered that that is one of the pieces
being looked at and no decision has been made.
Director James asked regarding the plans for EcoPass and other similar
products. Bruce Abel replied that these will part of the third phase as these
products are impacted by pricing and structure.
Director Deadwyler mentioned that she was disheartened because some of
the Directors and constituents have asked to participate in the Fare Task
Force and have not been included. She said the presentation seemed to be
more of the same in terms of fare. She noted that fares need to be
accessible for those that are less fortunate as they are the ones who utilize
and need public transportation the most. Director Deadwyler pointed out
that since public meetings are not well attended, the feedback gathered is
not a fair assessment of what is going on in the market place. She
encouraged staff to reconsider adding a couple of board members and
constituents that use services daily to make sure all the bases are covered.

Lacy Bell, Planning Project Manager, reviewed the presentation as included
in the Operations and Customer Service Committee meeting packet for
November 18, 2014. Bruce Abel added that the first phase of the study
looked at the structure. The analysis is related to price. Staff and CH2M
HILL, the consultants, are looking at alternative structures to achieve
revenue neutrality. He said that the next stage is pricing alternatives as it
relates to sustainability; third stage as it relates to programs. He said that
staff’s timeline is to make a recommendation by January, 2015, go to public
meetings, finalize fare level and pricing by May or June, 2015, and wrap up
the process by September, 2015 in order to implement by January 2016.

6.D

Bruce Abel replied that staff has incorporated all feedback received and will
continue to do that.
Director Solano noted that there are no public meetings in Commerce City,
one of the locations with many low income people who utilize the services
the most. He wondered why there would be a meeting in Littleton but not
in Commerce City.

Director Hoy addressed the concept of “fair fare”. He said that it is fairness
that everybody pays for the service they receive: type of bus, length of trip,
etc. Bruce Abel said that staff will continue to review this for RTD. He
noted that other smaller agencies have gone to flat fare.
Chair Sisk said that RTD needs to expand its footprint in reaching people.
He noted that public meetings are poorly attended. He wondered if maybe
inviting the Citizens Advisory Committee would be helpful in gathering
feedback. He said he would like to see the agency utilizing local TV
channels as a way to communicate with the constituents. Bruce Abel
replied that staff has used customer panels in the early stages and
anticipates to use them as the process unfolds. Lacy Bell noted that there
will be a web presence to gather feedback. She said she would look into
local channel opportunities.
Director Menten remembers that the past discounted passes were only valid
during off peak hours, but that Director Daly shared it made things very
difficult for the drivers. She wonders when the program changed. Bruce
Able said that the original thinking was that the passes would help shift
some of the travel demand away from peak hours; however, it was
determined that there was no impact and caused a great deal of confusion
and many confrontations. He stated that the Board approved the discounted
passes being valid at all times in 2002.
Director Anderson said that she seconded Chair Sisk’s proposal of utilizing
local TV channels. She said that the audience could have an interactive
participation by calling in or going to the website for comments.
Director Folska asked if the Fare Task Force included members from the
Finance department. Bruce Abel said that Terry Howerter, Chief Financial
Officer, and Doug MacLeod, Manager for Financial Reporting, are part of the
Fare Task Force.
Director Folska said that it is important to understand the actual cost of
operating each line. She asked staff for the operational cost allocation for

each line. Bruce Abel said that staff does have that information but he did
not have it available with him at the meeting.

Director Folska agreed with Director Tobiassen on his parking thoughts. She
added that it is important to help people that struggle to pay for
transportation.
Director Solano said that as a government agency, RTD should run
efficiently. He said this is more important than revenue neutrality.
Director Lubow thanked staff for their work on this complex matter. She
said that she has talked to some constituents about how the fare study will
simplify the structure. She said that she was deflated to find out that one of
the options is to remain the same. Lacy Bell said that the current structure
is included as a baseline. Neither one of the options presented is a
recommendation to the Board. Director Lubow mentioned that she thought
the options presented were the two best options. Bruce Abel replied that
the benefits of no change could be perceived as another option. Director
Lubow said that some people may be disappointed if there is no change.
Director Lubow mentioned that one of the feedbacks from the public
meetings was accessibility to discounted fares. Bruce Abel said that this
will be part of the third phase. Lacy Bell added that CH2M HILL will have
some preliminary findings soon.
Director Lubow asked if there will be email outreach in order to gain
feedback since people do not attend the public meetings as much. Lacy Bell
answered that those that replied to the first email outreach will be included
in the next phase. She said her team would ask marketing about using other
list serves.

• Access-a-Ride/Cab 3rd Quarter Update
Bruce Abel introduced Dan McKeehan, new General Manager at First Transit,
Denver.
Bruce Abel noted that the next four items on the agenda would also be
covered during the updates of the Financial Administration & Audit
Committee meeting. He told the Directors that if they had any questions at
the moment staff could address them. He invited the Directors to wait until

Director Folska added to the communication piece that Chair Sisk and
Director Anderson mentioned. She said that she would love to see a
communication campaign with the constituents. She encouraged staff to
use the hold message on the phone line as a tool to encourage people to
have their voices heard. She suggested driving people to the website and
other different venues.

the Financial Administration & Audit Committee meeting updates as that
discussion may answer some of questions.
This update was postponed for discussion during the Financial
Administration and Audit committee.

• Special Services 2014 3rd Quarter Report
Director Bagley encouraged staff to use the best lessons learned from the
Call-n-Rides on those with less performance.

• Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 3rd Quarter 2014
This update was postponed for discussion during the Financial
Administration and Audit committee.

• 3rd Quarter Customer Complaint Analysis
This update was postponed for discussion during the Financial
Administration and Audit committee.

• 3rd Quarter 2014 Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
John Tarbert, Transit Police Chief, referred the Directors to the report
included in the Operations and Customers Service Committee meeting
packet for November 18, 2014.
Director Menten noted that a few months back there was a news clip from
the Lakewood Police Department regarding a notice that the city of
Lakewood had received a grant to be used towards supplying the officers
with additional Tasers. This made it sound like there is a crime problem.
She has not heard of this from her constituents using the W line. She asked
Chief Tarbert if there had been a spurt in crime in Lakewood. She said that
she had reached out to the City of Lakewood but has not heard back. She
asked Chief Tarbert for assistance in following up with the City of
Lakewood. Chief Tarbert replied that he would call the City of Lakewood in
the morning.
Director Tobiassen noted that the report from the City of Aurora is that they
really appreciate all the work from RTD and contracted security officers.
Director Tobiassen mentioned that the City of Lakewood has adopted a no
smoking ordinance. He asked if RTD had contracted Lakewood police on
duty as they do in Denver. Chief Tarbert replied that yes, there are
Lakewood police officers that are contracted by RTD in their off hours. RTD
security has to follow State law. In Lakewood, they could enforce the city
ordinance if they wanted, but that is not an RTD policy.

Chair Sisk noted the increase in patrons checked during the third quarter.
Chief Tarbert replied that the increase had to do with the Broncos ridership
during games.

Director Folska asked for clarification on where the highest fare evasion
happened: bus or rail. She also inquired about the percentage of fare
evasion. Chief Tarbert said that most fare evasion happens on rail. The
percentage for July was 3.4%. The percentages for August and September
were 4.3%. Director Folska mentioned that the feedback she gets from her
constituents makes it seem that we have an out of control fare evasion
problem. They get very upset when someone does not pay. She wondered
how to correct that public perception.

D. Other Matters
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, updated the Directors
on the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition (CCDC) agreement. Under the
agreement, RTD retained an ADA expert to ensure that the agency complies and
enforces the policy issues agreed upon: mainly access to the securement area. The
initial report has been submitted. The primary issue raised was that the agreement
did not include a transition period, which RTD incorporated. The ADA expert found
that the agreement did imply a transition plan. The report does not identify
deficiencies; therefore RTD will not complete a remediation plan. Staff will provide
the Board with a copy of the report once finalized.
Director Solano said that he received calls from constituents saying that riders were
being evicted from Denver Union Station (DUS) when the temperatures dropped
below freezing in the past week. Chief Tarbert said that this was the first time he
had heard of this and that he would look into it. Director Solano hoped that these
events had not happened as tax payers paid in part for DUS.
Director Deadwyler said that she had heard that DUS staff was asking the
homeless to leave during the drop in temperature as well. She said that an article
on the Denver Post quoted an RTD representative as saying, “we are not
responsible for hosting these people – they are loitering.” Director Deadwyler
wondered if RTD had a policy for extreme weather. She said that if there was not
one in place it should be created. She noted that if one was in place maybe it
needed to be changed. Director Deadwyler added that the libraries were open
offering a warm place. In her opinion DUS should be open as well as it is
Packet Pg. 47

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 18, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Hoy noted the number of fare evasions on buses. He wondered
how this happened since the bus operator should collect fares. Chief
Tarbert said that plain clothes police officers watch interactions between
patrons and customer. If nothing happens, then they make contact for fare
evasion. Chief Tarbert added that the high number of arrests are because
initial contact is made for fare evasion but the patron ends up having an
arrest warrant.

considered the living room of the community. Scott Reed, Assistant Manager for
Communications, said that the quote was attributed to him. He was asked by the
reporter if RTD had facilities to house the homeless. The flipped reference was
published. He said that he did point out that RTD facilities are transit oriented. If
people are in an RTD property and not using transit it could be considered loitering.
Director Deadwyler expressed her disappointment on the flipped reference. She
pointed out that the article included a picture of a security officer escorting people
out. She added that when the temperature drops below zero we should leave the
homeless alone. Phil Washington, General Manager, mentioned that this was the
first time he had heard about it and that staff will look into it.

B. Recommended Actions

• Resolution No.

, Series of 2014 Related to the Modification of Call
Provisions on FasTracks Sales Tax Bonds, Series 2007A
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the
“Resolution”), authorizing the modification of call provisions associated with
certain of the currently outstanding Regional Transportation District,
Colorado Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series
2007A.
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the November 25, 2014 Board
meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, stated that he was
very pleased to bring this recommendation forward to the
Board. He recognized Mike Newman from First Southwest
and Sally Tasker from Butler Snow, who were a great help in
putting this modification together. He explained that this is a

Packet Pg. 50

Director Folska participated via phone. Director Angie Rivera-Malpiede left before the start

6.E

Brenden Morgan explained that RTD has been approached by
CitiBank N.A. (Citi), who owns approximately $220,825,000
of these bonds, to move the call date from 2017 to 2024; if
RTD was to modify the call date then Citi would pay RTD a
one-time payment of $15 million. He noted that staff had to
really question if this was a good dollar amount. He said that
he evaluated the opportunity as if it was a refunding of Bonds.
The RTD policy requires a return of 3% while this payment of
$15 million works out to be about 6.88%. He commented
that this figure puts this modification in very comfortable
territory. Brenden Morgan stated that another key
consideration in staff’s recommendation to move forward with
the modification is that the transaction would not impact
RTD’s FasTracks TABOR Debt Capacity in any manner.
Director Lubow noted that, not being a financial person, she
has questions that may have obvious answers but they were
not obvious to her. She wonders why Citi was bringing this
offer to RTD now. She also wonders if it is possible for RTD
to negotiate a better amount. Brenden Morgan said he
wondered the same thing. He stated that currently Citi is in a
unique situation where they hold a large number of these
Bonds. He explained that Citi buys bonds for a portfolio and
then enters into swap agreements to hedge against these
bonds; Citi has indicated to RTD that the swaps do not
properly align with the average call date of Bonds in the
portfolio so they are trying to fix this. Brenden Morgan said
that in terms of a better deal, there is only one entity that RTD
can negotiate with, but staff is in negotiation conversations.
Terry Howerter pointed out that Citi does have additional
options besides asking RTD to change the call date. He thinks
RTD is in an excellent position to receive $15 million with no
impact on TABOR and no change in RTD’s future payments.
Director Menten shared that she views this transaction in a
similar manner that she would view a home mortgage; if she
was to give advice to someone she would recommended a 15year term and that they should try to pay it off more quickly,
therefore saving a lot of money. She expressed concern that
Packet Pg. 51

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 18, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

resolution to extend the call date on the 2007A Series Bonds
(Bonds) from a call date of November, 2017 to November,
2024. He introduced Brenden Morgan, Manager of Debt and
Investments, to discuss the key points of the
recommendation.

6.E

Director Bagley wonders if he is correct in saying that when
Citi looks at their entire portfolio, they need to look at it from a
balance standpoint; this is just an attempt by Citi to rebalance
their entire portfolio and RTD’s bonds are just a piece of that
portfolio. Terry Howerter commented that he could not say it
was a small piece, but it is a piece of their portfolio. He noted
that Citi had mentioned in conversations that they have done
several of these recently, which makes it very easy for them
to work with RTD.
Director James inquired if the request to extend the call date is
something that happens from time to time or if this is a total
anomaly. Terry Howerter believes this is a fairly unique
position for Citi to be in, as he does not know of any other
organizations that have done the same thing. He believes this
is a great benefit for RTD.
Chair Sisk stated that he supports this recommendation
because no one can predict what the interest rates will be in
2017; this action results in RTD receiving about $13.458
million after associated costs and buys some certainty, which
he likes. Chair Sisk asked if these funds would go back into
the FasTracks budget for the unfunded corridors. Brenden
Morgan stated that the funds must be spent on a FasTracks
project but there are no other restrictions.
Director Hoy wonders if it would be fair to assume that the
funds would go into the FasTracks Internal Savings Account
(FISA). He pointed out that there is some precedence of funds
from refinancings going into the FISA. General Manager
Washington said that staff would need to come back to the
Board for a discussion on how the funds would be used. He
explained that staff has not yet had internal discussions about
using the funds as they have been concentrating on getting
the deal done.
Director Folska inquired if this recommendation will have any
impact on RTD’s credit ratings. Brenden Morgan shared that
Packet Pg. 52

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 18, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

while RTD is receiving a one-time payment of $15 million, we
will also be paying more interest since we are extending the
time. Terry Howerter explained that the bond maturity date,
payment schedule, etc. will not be changing; this action is
only related to extending the call date for the Citi owned
Bonds.

6.E

he has been in contact with the three agencies; staff
anticipates there will be no impact and RTD is not required to
get new ratings as a result of the transaction.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED.

• Investment Policy
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”),
attached.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 25, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter pointed out that Section 10 of the Investment
Policy Statement (Policy) states that the CFO should conduct a
review of the Policy on an annual basis and present any
changes to the Board for approval. He said the Policy has
been reviewed by staff as well as RTD’s investment advisors
and bond council. He noted there was a red-lined copy of the
Policy included in the November 18, 2014 Financial
Administration and Audit Committee Agenda packet.
Director Lubow expressed concern about the Policy because it
appeared there were many red-line changes. She said she got
the impression that the underlying driver behind the changes
was due to some statutory changes by the State, but she felt
they were not really analyzed. Director Lubow stated that she
is uncomfortable approving something that has not been
explained to her. She feels she did not get the kind of
information that makes her feel secure in approving the
changes.

Director Anderson shared that it was her impression that these
changes provide staff with more options for investments while
maintaining safety and compliance according to State law.
Brenden Morgan said that was correct. General Manager
Washington expressed that staff is trying to be conservative
while still maintaining a profit.
Director Solano feels the Investment Policy Statement and
accompanying Board Report are very confusing. He has a
problem when the Board Report just refers to it as the
“Policy”. He expressed concern with it being too general and
not clear. He stated that he needs to have more information
before he can even vote on this recommendation.
Director James asked if staff could expand the Discussion
section of the Board Report to provide a brief summary of the
rationale behind the suggested changes. Brenden Morgan said
that he would provide that to the Board.
Director Folska echoed Director Lubow and James’s
suggestions of having the changes in a summary format. She
believes that would be very helpful.
Motion to
Postpone
to a Time
Certain:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to
postpone the vote on the Adoption of the
Investment Policy Statement to the December 9,
2014 Financial Administration and Audit
Committee.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director James asked if there would be any consequences for
RTD if the vote was delayed. Brenden Morgan stated that he
did not see any particularly negative consequences, problems
or risks for RTD by waiting until the next meeting.
Packet Pg. 54

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 18, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Walker thinks that over the next week the
Board should review the Policy in detail and formulate some
specific questions for staff. Terry Howerter invited the Board
to contact him and Brenden Morgan for any questions or if
they would like to review the Policy further. Director Lubow
reiterated her request for a summary of the changes.

At this time Director Solano called for the question. Director
Lasater seconded. The vote to end debate passed with
Director Daly voting no. The vote on the motion to postpone
to a time certain was conducted.

Administration and Audit Committee PASSED. He encouraged other Board
members to meet with staff to review the Policy.
This item was removed from the November Board Meeting agenda.

• Approval of 2015 Recommended Budget
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2014 for the
adoption of the 2015 Budget, Resolution No. ___, Series of 2014 for the
2015 Budget Appropriation and Resolution No. ___, Series of 2014 for the

Motion:

376,930

Director Tobiassen made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the November 25,
2014 Board meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter introduced Jannette Scarpino, Manager of
Budget and Financial Analysis, and Susan Cohen, Manager of
FasTracks Program Control, and asked them to review the key
Budget elements with the Board.
Jannette Scarpino reminded the Board that the process began
in April when staff presented the Annual Program Evaluation
(APE) which was subsequently adopted in May with an
updated APE approved in July to include the Southeast Rail
Extension. She stated the first draft of the Requested Budget
was presented in September followed by an update in
October. She said that tonight staff is asking the Board to
approve that the final 2015 Recommended Budget be moved
to the Board meeting for adoption. Jannette Scarpino
provided the following overview of the budget:
 Total District revenue is projected to be down 1.2% or
$12.2 million from the 2014 Amended Budget due
primarily to a:

decrease in fare revenue for the West Line of $1.6
million
o decrease in grant revenue of $34.3 million
o decrease in other income of $9.7 million,
This is offset by an:
o increase in sales and use tax revenue of $31.7
million
o increase in investment income of $1.9 million
Operating expenditures on a combined basis in 2015 are
budgeted $24.7 million lower compared to the 2014
Amended Budget due to:
o completion of FasTracks expense projects, primarily
the US36/CDOT managed lanes carryforward
project
o higher capitalization of FasTracks project salaries
o decline in contract maintenance in FasTracks due to
project completion, carry forward, or
expense/capital transfers
This is offset by:
o a $1.2 million increase in FasTracks Operations
allocated costs for Denver Union Station and the
Free Metro Ride
o expense projects carryforward from 2014 totaling
$33 million
Diesel fuel is locked at $2.95 per gallon compared to a
price of $312 gallon in the 2014 Amended Budget while
gas is budgeted at $3.40 per gallon versus $3.54 in the
2014 Amended Budget
Interest expense and debt payments are essentially flat
over the 2014 Amended Budget
New capital spending on a combined basis will decrease
$318.6 million from the 2014 Amended Budget due mainly
to project completion in FasTracks
Fund balances for 2015 on a District-wide basis is
projected at $58.3 million, comprised of:
o The Board appropriated fund of $26.4 million
o The capital replacement fund on $19.2 million
o An undesignated working capital fund of $12.7
million

next step in the process is adoption of the Budget at the
November 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Bagley asked why there was a decrease in the
FasTracks Board Appropriated, Capital Replacement and
Unrestricted funds. Susan Cohen stated that the Board policy
requires there to be two months of operating expenses among
the three funds. She explained that since the operating
expenses are projected to decrease in 2015, the require fund
balances will decrease as well.
Director James pointed out that there has been a dramatic
drop in fuel and oil prices over the last few months. He
wonders if it will be possible to buy fuel at prices lower than
those we have locked in. He said that the lock prices stated
are higher than the price he pays for gas today. General
Manager Washington clarified that the lock prices are for
diesel fuel, which currently sells for $3.40 per gallon at the
pump. Additionally, he said it is very important to consider
that when diesel and gas prices are determined, staff is not
looking at the price of gas today but are looking out over a 12
month period.

• 2015 Proposed Internal Audit Plan
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approves the proposed plan of internal audits to be
performed in 2015.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 18, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley noted that the FasTracks contingency reserve
continues to remain at $30 million. He wonders if those funds
would go into the FISA as FasTracks projects get completed.
Susan Cohen explained that in the FasTracks financial plan the
$30 million reserve will remain until all FasTracks projects are
completed; at that time it would go back into the FasTracks
fund balance and eventually pay for operations.

Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the November 25,
2014 Board meeting.

Discussion:

Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager of Internal Audit, shared
that staff has put together an audit plan of 20 projects that
they would like to complete in 2015 to include the following:
 Annual Audit Plan 2016
 Denver Transit Partners – DIA
 FasTracks Staffing
 HR – Position Changes
 HR – Salary Increases
 Investments
 IT Audit
 IT Staffing
 Kiewit Infrastructure Company – 1-225
 Marketing Audit
 Out of District Parking Fees
 Purchasing Card – FasTracks
 Purchasing Card – Finance Division
 Purchasing Card – Human Resources Division
 Review of HR Policies and Procedures
 Risk Assessment
 RTD Budget Process
 Smart Card Stored Value Development Process
 The WIN Program
 Update Internal Audit Policies and Procedures
She noted that the Board was given the opportunity to provide
feedback/suggestions and asked if there were any questions.
Director Menten recognized that many government agencies
have Purchasing Cards (PCards). She said it has been shown
that employees can buy certain gift cards like for a grocery or
supply store. She wonders if this is allowed for RTD PCards.
Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop explained that Internal Audit decided
to do the PCard audits because it is an area that has a high
risk of fraud. She stated that RTD PCards can only be used to
buy items that will be used for RTD purposes. She said that
Internal Audit has found that PCard purchases are scrutinizes

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

6.E

by procurement on a regular basis and they have seen no
instances of gift card purchases.

Director Menten inquired if it would be possible for someone
to make a purchase on a PCard that appears legitimate but
then is returned and the money is returned in a method other
than a credit to the PCard. She wonders what protections
RTD has from that happening. Scott Reed, Assistant General
Manager of Communications, pointed out that every PCard
purchase must go through multiple approval steps; so, if
someone buys an item for RTD and returns it, it is likely that
someone within the department will notice that it never
arrived. General Manager Washington noted that when PCard
transactions are purchased the original receipt is required
which helps prevents this as well.
Director Tobiassen said he was happy to see the IT audit
included as he had made that request. He asked if Internal
Audit would be working with Sheri Le, Cyber Security
Manager, to determine the scope of the audit. Ann Marie
Isaac-Heslop said that she would be meeting with Sheri Le
regarding the audit.
Director Lubow wonders if, in light of a recent allegation of
wrongdoing, the audit process could be used proactively to
avoid potential problems/allegations in the future. General
Manager Washington stated that the audit process would not
be used to look at the alleged incident referenced by Director
Lubow and that it was not an appropriate setting to discuss
the matter; however, if a potential problem reveals itself
through the normal audit process, the Internal Audit team will
expand the audit scope as needed. He said additionally, if
there was an area of concern for management, they could
request an audit as well, as had been done with this Internal
Audit Plan.
Director Deadwyler stated that she was not aware that the
Board could suggest audits. She believes that several
departments within Civil Rights need to be audited, especially
Packet Pg. 63

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 18, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten asked if the PCard audit would review every
transaction or would be done via a spot check. Ann Marie
Isaac-Heslop noted that due to the extremely large number of
PCard transactions, Internal Audit would request every PCard
statement and then select a random sample.

6.E

Director Solano shared with the Board that he thinks an
organization is only as strong as the weakest link. He believes
that right now RTD has a weak link but we do not know if it is
truly a weak link or just an allegation. This needs to be looked
at microscopically.
Committee Chair Walker stated that RTD has many checks
and balances and when something is found that can be
improved upon, RTD deals with it; however, anyone can raise
an allegation and he thinks the Board needs to move on from
the issue. Director Solano expressed an objection.

EEOC and SBO. She said that she has never been asked about
what she would like to see in an audit. She would like to see
the Civil Rights area be audited. General Manager Washington
said that would be possible and noted that the WIN Program
was included in the 2015 Internal Audit Plan. He stated that a
request was sent to the Board asking for their audit
recommendations or suggestions, as is done every year. Paula
Perdue confirmed that the request was sent to the Directors.

• Third Quarter 2014 Performance Measures

Director Lubow feels that she really has no basis of comparison to know if
RTD is actually doing well. She wonders if perhaps the Board can be given
information on other agencies for comparison. General Manager Washington
stated that this is something that transit agencies have tried in the past;
however, it becomes very difficult to make comparisons when considering
service area, types of service, population, etc. He explained this is why
staff brings goals to the Board for approval. Terry Howerter commented
that is also very helpful to look at performance trends. He said if he notices
something is getting worse he can look for reasons. General Manager
Washington stated that one of the goals of the performance measures is for
staff to see areas of concern and then campaign the issue.
Director Tobiassen stated that he has been on the Board for 6 years. He
shared that in that time he has seen the most important performance
measure for him improve considerably, which is the number of complaints he
receives. He believes this is an indication of the great work by staff and
that the performance measures are working.
Director Folska commented that she has really seen an increase in
complaints related to marijuana. She wonders if that will become its own
category. General Manager Washington said that it would continue to fall
under customer complaints; he does not see a new performance measure
being created as it relates to marijuana. Director Folska inquired if certain
performance measures are weighted heavier than others, i.e. drunk driving,
texting while driving, etc. She feels that is more important than on-time
performance. General Manager Washington stated that the performance
measures are not weighted. He explained that this was an update; if the
Board wants new performance measures the time to do so will be when
staff brings the performance measures to the Board for approval in June or
July.

• Third Quarter Investment Report

Pertaining to the 2015 proposed internal audit
plan, Chair Sisk expressed it was inappropriate
to request an audit of Civil Rights; we will
continue to be vigilant regardless; As Directors,
we were provided the opportunity to provide
input. We should not highlight Civil Rights any
more than any other area. We need to rely on
our professional staff.
Director Bagley added that the comment that we
should have been proactive is bogus and not
appropriate. Chair Sisk agreed.
Vote on the Motion:

The motion passed with the full commitment in
favor.
Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED.

A. Approval of 2015 Recommended Budget

Other Matters

Director Bagley shared that he will be on vacation next week and will not be at the
meeting. He asked Chair Sisk if he wanted Director Anderson to provide an update
from the GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee in his stead. He
went on to provide this update: The Committee had met last Tuesday and
approved the ratings for the 10 core and task goals. Seven of the goals were rated
as exceed expectations and three were rated as achieved goal. Directors Walker,
Tobiassen and Folska had also participated. A discussion was held on the
Discretionary Performance Payout as provided in the GM’s contract. Last year he
had received 8-1/2%; this year the recommended percent is 7% or about $20K.
There will be an Executive Session at the December 16 meeting where the full
Board can weigh in on the General Manager’s performance. Any dissenting report
can also be made at that time.
Chair Sisk commended Director Bagley for the fine job he is doing with this GM
Oversight and Performance Management Committee. He noted that while unanimity
may not have been achieved, it is important that we operate with civility. Director
Bagley responded it is his honor to serve. Directors Hoy and Tobiassen echoed
their sentiments that Director Bagley is doing a great job. Director Tobiassen
reflected on the past history as to why it is important that we follow a structured
process. Chair Sisk stated that no report will be necessary for the December 16
meeting.
Paula Perdue shared that in planning for the 2015 Board calendar, she has noticed
a particular conflict between the week that we have scheduled the joint board-staff
advance (March 7) and the start of the APTA Legislative conference. She asked
how did theywant to resolve this. After some discussion, it was tentatively
decided to move the joint strategic advance to the weekend of March 21, 2015.

Paula Perdue shared that we have invited the grand winners of the Youth Art
Program to our December 16 meeting. We have also extended the invitation to the
superintendents of Aurora and Cherry Creek Schools as well as the principals and
Mayors for the area. We are awaiting confirmation from all but the response has
been very positive. We will present the schools with a framed copy of the artwork.
Chair Sisk indicated that Director Folska and Paula should be a part of that
presentation. Paula added that the Marketing Group has done an outstanding job in
moving this project ahead and in the actual coordination with the schools.
Director James shared that he had attended a symposium dealing with sustainable
community initiative which had about 70-80 city planners and others in attendance.
There was lots of conversation about FasTracks and the city planning efforts. He
also shared that at another event, Denver Association of Business Economists,
Miller Hudson had shared information on the I-70 project with Maglev. He will
email a copy of the survey to the Board members for some interesting read.
Director Walker shared that he had attended a candidate forum in his district for the
City Council. He had asked them what were the top issues evolving and they stated
that transit was the number 1 concern.
Director James shared that at the Symposium, the “Last mile, first mile” discussion
was prominent. Cities are including this in their thinking.
Director Hoy emphasized that he would like to see the net proceeds from the
Citibank bonds to go to the FISA account. He stated we have precedence for this.
Director James added it is important that we get the most possible PR from our
efforts. The decision making process will be just as important as where and how
the money is spent.
Chair Sisk shared he was on his way to the Transportation Matters Summit where
Bill Van Meter was presenting. He heard this was a sold-out event of about 450
people.
Chair Sisk threw a ball in the air and shared his desire to have a dinner or event to
invite all former Board members to the table. This would be a social event with a
chance to thank them. Some of the other members thought it was a good idea.
AGM Genova spoke about the opening at Rio Court and the plaque dedication.
Director James added this is a good story of how we can assess our own inventory
for acquisition properties that could be re-used or work for us. This is all part of
asset management and state of good repair
Chair Sisk encouraged the Board members to attend the CMRF event.

members which provided more information. He indicated that Directors Folska and
Tobiassen planned to attend their state convention in Lone Tree starting October
30-Nov 2. Gary indicated that the blind community are regular users of public
transit and rely heavily on our fixed route services. He encouraged RTD to keep
growing and building up our fixed route services.
Nghia Nguyen, representing the Ironworkers in Commerce City, commented they
are concerned about RTD’s investigation of fraud in the DBE/SBE program. He
perceives RTD acts as a pass-through but they fail to do a thorough investigation of
claims that are brought to their attention. He cited one contractor whose
certification was revoked by the City of Denver. However, by the time of the
revocation, they had already been paid an excessive amount of money which RTD
indicated they could not reclaim. He also referenced the RMR dispute and alleged
that RTD kept extending the time needed for the investigation pass the 90 days and
then indicated they could do nothing until the City if Denver completes their
certification investigation. He stated RTD needs to take more personal
responsibility for its contractors.
Elizabeth Murphy who represented the Community Enterprise in Commerce City,
spoke about the need for accessible and affordable transportation for everyone.
She believes the fare structure study needs to look at those barriers to the
community for affordable transportation.
Joseph Stukes spoke as a private citizen of Aurora. He shared his background as
retired from the Rocky Mountain Arsenal where he was an electrical engineer
among other functions. He grew up in the New York area and has lots of familiarity
with trains (i.e. trolleys, heavy rail, subways, etc). He has noticed a couple of
things about our light rail vehicles. He said he sees no photovoltaic panels on RTD
land or auxiliary generators. Mr. Stukes explained that contrary to what Excel has
said regarding RTD never being without power, if the primary power supply goes
down then RTD has no source of power. He sees a need for auxiliary power. The
train could be stuck in the middle of the intersection due to a loss of power, which
will happen more and more frequently since the electrical grid is as crowded as it
can be.

is one of the finalists. The school has gone all out with banners and
postings on the wall. Her daughter shared that one of the greater benefits is
how this art program has motivated difficult to teach students and has
generated an interest from these students. She wanted to recognize the
efforts of Director Claudia Folska and Paula Perdue for pushing this program
forward.
Director Lubow agreed with Director Deadwyler and stated this little pilot
has gone viral on a bigger scale than we could have anticipated. She also
wanted to congratulate Director Folska and Paula Perdue for how hard they
worked to trump up support and to meet with schools, elected officials and
community leaders. This has been a valuable experience.

General Manager's Report
General Manager Washington provided these comments:
 Role of APTA Chair—He is honored and humbled to have been selected as Chair of
the American Public Transportation Association for the year 2015. He thanks this
Board and others for their confidence in him to help forge policy and advocate on
behalf of the membership of APTA. At the conference and EXPO itself, there were
approximately 13,000 attendees. At his general session he spoke of five
megatrends that his platform will address:
1. Sustainable long term transportation funding bill. He is calling for a National
Day of Action in April 2015 to bring attention to the seriousness of this
issue.
2. Workforce and lifestyle changes
3. Demographic Shifts—changes to the urban core and effect of minority
becoming majority
4. Accelerating Technological Innovations
5. Safety and security challenges
General Manager Washington stated that he believe the value of him in this position will
allow him to shape the national policy right here from 1600 Blake Street.
General Manager Washington shared that a second priority on his platform is the building
of a career pathway for people in the transit industry, especially those difficult to fill
positions. General Manager Washington reminded the Board that approximately two years
ago, he had come to the Board for approval to seek the role of the APTA Chair and had
received their head nods. He is grateful for their support and feels this will be a highly
visible and strategic advantage for RTD. He does not plan to allow this role to distract
from his role as CEO of RTD. If it does, he will be the first to retreat. APTA will be
paying for all travel associated with his role as the APTA Chair. He is looking forward to
helping to shape national policy as evident already by the emulations of other agencies
around the country on the MAX program and PPP.



Jersey Cutoff Bridge—General Manager Washington acknowledge the media
coverage and questions that have arisen around the Jersey Cutoff Bridge. He
stated this is one of 35 bridges that is a part of the Eagle P3. He reminded the
Board that the P3 includes delivery options with steep penalties for
nonperformance. Since this is a build-design-operate, it is to the advantage of the
concessionaire to make sure the bridge is as solid as possible. The concessionaire
will operate for 28 years and would not want to be subjected to penalties. This is a
good story for the P3 delivery model. This is a transference of risk to the
concessionaire.
The concessionaire made the determination to redo the bridge at no cost to RTD or
impact to schedule. We are very supportive of the relationship we have forged
with our concessionaire and that they were willing to step up to the plate on this
issue.



Bronco Service Last week—General Manager Washington reported that the rail
operations supported two Broncos games last week. He is happy to report that we
carried in excess of 20,000 people without incident. This is a significant
accomplishment and he wanted to acknowledge AGM Jenkins and the rail team for
their work.

Comments from Board members:
Director Bagley stated he was 1 of those 20000 passengers to the Bronco game.
He was amazed at how quickly they were able to move him on the train within 15
minutes from when he arrived at the platform.

Ranch and Douglas County. He also thanked the Douglas

Director Lasater agreed with Director Bagley’s comments and
also expressed his appreciation to Eugene and the Douglas
County Commissioners. He shared how difficult it is to get
people to come to a town hall meeting but when you get 47
people there, not including the people who sent emails in
support, as it did happen, that shows a level of commitment
from the citizens of Parker. This issue had strong community
support.

BACKGROUND
In accordance with State law, the District submitted its proposed budget to the governing body by
October 15, 2014. By legal notice, the governing body presented the proposed 2015 Requested
Budget for public review on October 12, 2014. A public hearing to solicit formal public comment is
scheduled for the November 25, 2014 regular meeting of the Board of Directors.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 100

12.A

The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2015 Recommended Budget (combined Base
and FasTracks) is $1,385.5 million. This includes an operating expense budget of $518.5 million,
interest expense of $97.5 million, capitalized interest of $45.0 million, new capital expenditures of
$555.4 million, debt payments of $62.5 million, FasTracks contingency reserve of $30.0 million,
FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $18.4 million, Board appropriated fund of $26.4 million,
capital replacement fund of $19.2 million, and estimated unrestricted fund balance of $12.7 million.
The previously approved capital (capital carry forward) is $1,303.1 million. The sum of the budget
appropriation and capital carry forward is $2,688.6 million.
Overview of the 2015 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $963.9 million on a combined basis are expected to decrease $12.2 million (1.2%) in
2015 from the 2014 Amended Budget. The decline is composed primarily of a decrease in fare
revenue for West Line of $1.6 million, a decrease in grant revenue of $34.3 million, and a decrease
in other income of $9.7 million, offset by an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $31.7 million and
an increase in investment income of $1.9 million.
Combined farebox revenues are budgeted to decrease $1.6 million or 1.3% based on a decline in
West Line farebox revenues in 2015 per the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation. Total Base
System grants are projected to increase $2.5 million over the 2014 Amended Budget, including new
and carry forward amounts. Drawdowns on Base System grants are estimated to total $85.7 million
in 2014 while new and carryforward grant funding of $119.6 million is projected for 2015.
FasTracks grants are budgeted to decrease $36.7 million from the 2014 Amended Budget due to
decreases primarily in West Corridor New Starts grants and CMAQ grants on Eagle and US36. Other
income will decrease $9.7 million due to the non-recurrence of DUS property sales in 2014. Sales
and use tax revenues of $535.1 million in 2015 are expected to increase 5.9% over the 2014
projected level according to the most recent September quarterly forecast by the CU-Leeds School of
Business. Investment income is budgeted to increase $1.9 million from higher investable balances.
Operating expenditures on a combined basis in 2015 are budgeted $24.7 million lower compared to the
2014 Amended Budget. The decrease is due to: 1) completion of FasTracks expense projects, primarily
the US-36/CDOT managed lanes carryforward project, 2) higher capitalization of FasTracks project
salaries, and 3) decline in contract maintenance in FasTracks due to project completion, carryforward, or
expense/capital transfers, offset by: 5) a $1.2 million increase in FasTracks Operations allocated costs
for Denver Union Station and the Free Metro Ride, and 6) expense projects carry-forward from 2014
totaling $33.0 million. The expense project carryforward to 2015 is $15.1 million for Base operations
and $17.9 million for FasTracks Project.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at the lock price of $2.95 per gallon, compared to a price of $3.12 per gallon in
the 2014 Amended Budget, for a savings of $1.7 million. Gasoline is budgeted at $3.40/gallon, for a
$239,000 savings from both the 2014 Amended Budget and first draft Requested Budget in which the
budgeted price was $3.54/gallon.
The major changes in operating expense comparing the Recommended Budget to the previous Requested
Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the Requested Budget are the
expense projects carry-forward.

Packet Pg. 101

12.A

Interest expense in 2015 is budgeted at $97.5 million on a combined basis, an increase of $1.9 million
over the 2014 Amended Budget and remaining essentially flat. Of total interest expense, $26.5 million
is budgeted for Base System and $71.0 million is budgeted for FasTracks. Capitalized interest
(combined) is budgeted at $45.0 million for FasTracks only, unchanged from the 2014 Amended Budget.
Capitalized interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for interest payments in 2015.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $62.5 million, essentially unchanged from the 2014
Amended Budget. Base System principal payments of $53.7 million are $5.0 higher due to issuance
of Base System COPs for fleet purchases. FasTracks principal payments of $8.7 million are $4.8
million lower due to lower actual debt issued than was anticipated in 2014. Financing proceeds from
the issuance of new debt is budgeted at $333.4 million, consisting of $59.6 million for Base System
for COPs and $273.8 million for FasTracks, the latter made up of $198.8 million for future FasTracks
construction and $75.0 million in TIFIA loan draws for the Eagle Project construction. Total debt
issued will be lower by $462.2 million from the 2014 Amended Budget primarily due to a decrease in
FasTracks debt issuance.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2014 (previously approved
capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2015. The capital carry-forward
will be $1,303.1 million made up of $237.7 million on the Base System and $1,065.4 million on
FasTracks.
New capital spending on a combined basis will decrease $318.6 million from the 2014 Amended Budget
due mainly to project completion in FasTracks. New capital spending for FasTracks will decrease
$283.6 million to $460.9 million in 2015 due to on-going project completion on the East Line, US 36
BRT, North Metro and Northwest Rail, offset by increases to the Gold Line and the I-225 Corridor. For
the Base System, new capital spending will decrease $35.0 million to $94.5 million. Of this amount,
the Base system will spend $6.5 million less in park-n-Rides (primarily Stapleton) and $62.3 million less
on bus fleet modernization/expansion. These reductions will be offset by $11.7 million more on facilities
construction and maintenance (primarily Civic Center), $11.7 million more in capital support projects
(primarily IT support for the District), and $9.9 million more on LRT Transit (primarily rail cars). The Base
System new capital was approved as part of the Strategic Budget Plan in July 2014 with certain
adjustments brought forward and disclosed in the previous Requested Budget.
New capital expenditures for 2015 and the change in new capital in the 2015 Recommended Budget
over the previous 2015 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget Plan are shown in Attachment B. The
capital carry-forward expenditures for 2015 and the change in the capital carry-forward in the 2015
Recommended Budget over the 2014 Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.
Notable designated reserve fund changes include an increase over the 2014 Amended Budget in the
Base System year-end unrestricted fund balance, which is projected to increase $4.7 million to $8.5
million due to projected savings in diesel fuel and gasoline and an increase in carryforward grants. Also
on the Base System, the Board-appropriated fund is projected to increase by $3.0 million to $22.2
million, and the capital replacement fund is projected to increase by $3.0 million to $15.0 million.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to increase $3.4 million over the
2014 Amended Budget to $12.7 million. The $4.7 million increase in the Base System’s unrestricted
fund balance is offset by a decrease of $1.4 million on FasTracks. On a District-wide basis, both the
Board-appropriated fund and the capital replacement fund are projected to increase by $1.6 million each.

Packet Pg. 102

12.A

These increases are in minimum accordance with fiscal policies for each of the District entities (Base
System, FasTracks Projects, and FasTracks Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.
The FasTracks Construction Reserve at $100 million is split between the Construction Reserve at $60
million and a Start-up Operations Reserve at $40 million. The Start-up Operations Reserve was
established in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation for the years 2015-2016 in order to meet the
1.2x debt service coverage if needed. The 2015 budget reflects continued maintenance of the
FasTracks contingency reserve at a balance of $30 million.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2015 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly.
Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2015 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated fund, a
capital replacement fund, and an undesignated working capital fund (the remaining unrestricted year-end
fund balance) for both the Base System and FasTracks. The objective is for the total of these three
funds to equal approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for the Base
System and two months of same for FasTracks. The 2015 budget reflects continued maintenance of
the FasTracks contingency reserve at a balance of $30 million. This reserve has been carried at $30
million since 2010.
The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2015 on a District-wide basis is projected at $58.3
million, comprised of 1) the Board appropriated fund of $26.4 million, 2) the capital replacement fund of
$19.2 million, and 3) an undesignated working capital fund or remaining fund balance of $12.7 million.
The Base System portion of the three fund balances for 2015 is projected to total $45.7 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two
exceptions:


Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
 Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
 The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.
 Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2015 Recommended Budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Revise the 2015 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed revisions.

December 31, 2014. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2014, State
statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations and
maintenance purposes and objects is deemed reappropriated."

Subject:

Budget Transfer for I-25 North Express Lanes
Extension and Express Bus Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the transfer of $375,000 from the Drivers Kiosk Replacement Project to fund the 2014 payment for the
IGA for the I-25 North Express Lanes Extension and Express Bus Project. Funding for the 2015 payment
will be provided in the 2015 Recommended Budget.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the 2014 goal of innovative and fiscally sustainable service delivery and the 2015
goal of improving service delivery.
In March 2012, the Board of Directors approved a commitment of $750,000 toward the local match for
CDOT’s I-25 North Express Lanes Extension Project. At the time, CDOT was in the process of
submitting a TIGER IV grant submission to fund this project, and requested that RTD contribute a portion
of the local match if CDOT were to receive the grant. RTD agreed to contribute $750,000 toward the
local match based on future operating cost savings on the bus routes currently operating on I-25
between US 36 and 120th Avenue, which would save travel time by using the express lanes. CDOT
received the TIGER grant in 2012, and the IGA obligating RTD for its contribution to the project is
effective November 22, 2014.
DISCUSSION
The I-25 North Express Lanes Extension Project will make efficient use of the existing highway
pavement by adding one additional express lane in each direction on I-25 between 120th Avenue on the
north to U.S. 36 on the south and would then connect to the existing managed lanes at U.S. 36 going
south into Denver. No additional right-of-way will be needed to implement this project. This project
represents a collaborative effort among CDOT, RTD, the Denver Regional Council of Governments,
several local jurisdictions and associated agencies in developing a cost-effective, near-term solution to
address the congestion on I-25.
The IGA is between RTD and the Colorado High Performance Transportation Enterprise (HPTE), a division
of CDOT. Like the previously signed US 36 IGA, the North I-25 IGA guarantees RTD travel times on the
managed lanes and commits that tolls during the peak hours will not be lower than corresponding RTD
fares.
CDOT started work on this project in October 2013, and expects the project to be completed in October
2015. Once this work is completed, several existing routes along the north I-25 corridor will benefit
from travel time savings by using the new express lanes. These routes include the 40X, 120X and
122X express routes, and the LNX and LSX branches of the regional route L.

Packet Pg. 133

13.B

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the 2014 payment would be provided through this budget transfer. Funding for the 2015
payment will be provided in the 2015 Recommended Budget. Once the project is open, RTD would
expect to see operating and maintenance cost savings of between $64,000 and $282,000 per year
depending on the revised schedules and resulting run cutting process.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $375,000 from the Drivers Kiosk Replacement
Project to fund the 2014 payment for the IGA for the I-25 North Express Lanes Extension and
Express Bus Project. Funding for the 2015 payment will be provided in the 2015 Recommended
Budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the transfer of funds. This is not
recommended because the IGA was executed per Board action. RTD would be in default to CDOT if
the transfer were not approved because RTD would not be able to pay the invoice due in 2014.

Approval of Eleventh Year (2015) Contract
Amendment to Jacobs Engineering for
FasTracks
Program
Support
Consulting
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the eleventh year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in the
amount of $17,861,430 for Program Support Services Consulting for FasTracks for the year 2015.
Funds for the award are contained in the 2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital
program in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the 2015 goal of advancing and completing the FasTracks program.
On May 24, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to CarterBurgess (later purchased by Jacobs Engineering) for Program Support Consulting Services at an
initial 2005 Contract amount of $2,360,000, and a Notice to Proceed of July 5, 2005. The RTD
Board has approved subsequent contract amendments that have brought the current Contract Not to-Exceed price up to $150,982,726. The Contract Not-to-Exceed price through the end of 2015
with this contract amendment would be $168,844,156.
The PSC team provides program management support and specialized technical staff support to
augment RTD FasTracks Team staff. Key PSC staff members are co-located with RTD Staff at the
RTD FasTracks offices. The PSC functions as an extension of RTD staff. This approach adds value,
cost-effectively, by allowing RTD to tap the PSC’s specialized resources in planning, environmental,
design, engineering, construction management support, program control, and related disciplines on
an as-needed, often part-time, basis.
Further, as the focus of the FasTracks program has shifted from planning and design to construction,
the staff resources required for support of the program shift similarly. The PSC role has changed,
and will continue to change, to meet the evolving needs of the FasTracks program. This flexibility
allows RTD to retain the core staff required for implementation of the FasTracks program, without
having to continually (and inefficiently) staff up and then staff down in the planning, design, and
construction management disciplines.
Some of the key deliverables and assistance, in process or received, from the Jacobs/PSC team in
2014 included:



Participation in the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) that resulted in the revised financial plan
that was adopted by the Board in May 2014.
Provided key construction management support for the DUS and Eagle Projects.

application for the Central Corridor Extension.
Maintained the programwide project controls functions including cost, schedule, estimating,
change management, and document control.
Supported ROW design, survey, and acquisition of all projects.
Provided contract closeout support for the West Rail Line.

DISCUSSION
The Program Support Services Contract was specified for a term of six years with a six-year option,
to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work tasks. The six year option was approved by
the RTD Board in November 2010.The purpose of the annual re-negotiation of the contract is to
ensure that specific tasks and deliverables respond to the evolving needs of the FasTracks Program.
The PSC serves as an extension of RTD staff. RTD staff provides overall management and control of
the FasTracks program and administration of this contract. The PSC provides key personnel to a
number of tasks. These assignments are based on focusing the PSC effort to:





Areas of specialized expertise or experience.
Part-time assignments.
Shorter duration efforts.
Positions that are difficult for RTD to fill.

Each position in the FasTracks organization is evaluated individually to determine whether that
position falls within the above criteria for using a consultant. In addition, before a consultant is
actually brought into the FasTracks program, an assessment is made as to whether the position is
still needed, and an interview is conducted with the appropriate RTD manager(s).
The major program activities in 2015 include the following:





Construction and start of testing of the Eagle P3 project.
Construction of I-225 Project.
Final design and construction of the North Metro Line.
Prepare RFP documents and application for a Full Funding Grant Agreement for the Southeast Rail
Extension.

During 2015, the PSC contract identifies the following specific tasks in support of FasTracks:
Program Management
 Provide the full-time support of a Project Controls Manager for the FasTracks Senior management
Team.
 Provide the support of specific project controls positions in schedule, cost control, and document
control. Provide tracking and monthly schedule and cost updates to each project manager.

RTD has established a 7% DBE goal for this Contract. The latest DBE report indicates that the PSC’s
actual cumulative DBE percentage has been 19.46%. For 2015, the PSC has committed to 27.1% DBE
participation, well in excess of the 7% goal. Additionally, while not in their contract, the PSC has
committed to continuing their participation in the WIN program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the PSC contract from 2005 through 2015 would be
$168,844,156 with this amendment. Funds for the 2015 contract award in the amount of
$17,861,430 are included in the 2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in
the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the eighth year
contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in the amount of $17,861,430 for Program Support
Services Consulting for FasTracks for the year 2015. Funds for the award are contained in the
2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where PSC
support would be utilized.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
eighth year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering. Rather, perform all the work in -house
with RTD staff. This is not recommended as RTD does not have the staff to provide a sufficient
level of expertise in a cost-effective approach to manage the FasTracks Program (As described in
the Background section, the PSC team can provide the technical specialties on an as needed
basis).
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Re-solicit this work to another consulting team. This is
not recommended as the PSC is satisfactorily performing its work assignments and providing
valuable technical and project management assistance to the RTD team.
Selection of alternatives two or three would delay the implementation of the FasTracks Program as
there would be a major loss of continuity on the program.

Approval of Eleventh Year (2015) Contract
Amendment to Delcan for FasTracks Quality
Management Consultant Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the Eleventh year Contract Amendment for Delcan in the amount of
$1,700,000 for Quality Management Consulting Services for FasTracks for the year 2015. Funds for
the amendment are contained in the 2015 RTD FasTracks Budget.
BACKGROUND
This action supports the General Manager’s first task goal for 2015 – Advancing/Completing FasTracks.
On June 28, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to Delcan for
Quality Management Consulting Services at an initial 2005 contract price of $418,539, and a Notice to
Proceed of August 1, 2005. This contract was set up to run for an initial six-year term, re-negotiated
and amended annually, based on the needs of the program. The contract also included provisions for a
six-year option.

RTD has established a 5% DBE Goal for this Contract. Delcan’s actual cumulative DBE percentage has
been 8.3%. For 2015, Delcan has committed to 12.3% DBE participation, exceeding the established
goal as they have every year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for this contract amendment are included in the 2015 RTD FasTracks budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the Eleventh year Contract
Amendment for Delcan in the amount of $1,700,000 for Quality Management Consulting Services
for FasTracks for the year 2015. Funds for the amendment are contained in the 2015 RTD
FasTracks Budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
eleventh year contract amendment to Delcan. Rather, perform all of the work in-house with RTD
staff. This is not recommended, as RTD doesn’t have certain skills required to fully develop the
Quality Management program.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
eleventh year contract amendment to Delcan. Rather, re-solicit and award this work to another
consulting team. This is not recommended, as Delcan is satisfactorily performing its work
assignments and providing valuable quality management assistance to the RTD team.
4. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to award the
eleventh year contract to Delcan. Rather, transfer this work scope to the Program Support
Consultant. This is not recommended, as the Quality Management Consultant was originally
established separately from the Program Support Consultant to provide a level of independence.

Approval of 2015 Contract Amendment to
Kumar and Associates, Inc. for the RTD
Construction Materials Testing and Inspection
Services Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the 2015 Contract Amendment for Kumar and Associates, thereby
exercising the second of five (5) one-year options and extending the contract term through December
31, 2015.
BACKGROUND
This action supports the General Manager’s first task goal for 2015 – Advancing/Completing FasTracks.
On July 15, 2008, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to Kumar and
Associates at a Not-to-Exceed price of $5,000,000 and a Notice to Proceed of August 1, 2008. The
initial Period of Performance ran through December 31, 2013, with the provision of five option years to
be exercised at RTD’s discretion. This contract is re-negotiated and amended annually, based on the
needs of the program.
On November 26, 2013, the RTD Board approved the first option year, extending the contract Period of
Performance through December 31, 2014. There was no change to the contract Not-to-Exceed price.
This action would extend the Period of Performance through December 31, 2015.
Exceed price shall remain at $5,000,000.

ALTERNATIVES

that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the 2015 Contract
Amendment for Kumar and Associates, thereby exercising the second of five (5) one-year options
and extending the contract term through December 31, 2015.
2.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to exercise the
contract option and approve the 2015 contract amendment to Kumar and Associates. Rather,
perform all of the work in-house with RTD staff. This is not recommended, as RTD doesn’t have
the facilities or technical skills required to operate a certified materials testing laboratory.

3.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to exercise the
contract option and approve the 2015 contract amendment to Kumar and Associates. Rather, resolicit and award this work to another consulting team. This is not recommended, as Kumar and
Associates is satisfactorily performing its work assignments and providing valuable quality
management assistance to the RTD team. Also, Kumar and Associates has avoided seeking work
with RTD’s project contractors, in an effort to avoid conflicts of interest.

Subject:

Purchase twelve (12) Light Rail Vehicles

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a negotiations with Siemens to purchase
twelve (12) Light Rail Vehicles at a total price not to exceed $48 million, and to enter into the resulting
contract with Siemens.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Rail Operations needs to purchase twelve (12)
expansion Light Rail Vehicles in order to continue to provide the proper level of service. In addition,
adding these cars will provide a conservative number of spare cars needed to provide maintenance on
the existing fleet as it ages.
DISCUSSION
We need to begin negotiations with Siemens. It generally takes two (2) years from the time a notice to
proceed is issued before we see the first light rail car delivered. In addition, Siemens has historically
required thirty percent (30%) payment when the notice to proceed is issued, and an additional thirty
percent (30%) within the next ninety (90) days. Rail Operations staff has recently been in contact with
Siemens, and they have verbally agreed to delay the second thirty percent (30%) payment until 2016.
This will be a sole-source contract, and fits within RTD’s capital budget plan.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This acquisition is part of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) that was recently approved by RTD Board of
Directors. Funds are included in the 2015, 2016 and 2017 Strategic Budget Plan and the requested
2015 RTD Budget. In recent correspondence with Siemens, RTD has obtained a $3.9 million price for
each vehicle; RTD will also need to assure that purchase-related expenses, including a “Buy-America”
audit and on-site factory inspection during the car construction are funded.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Siemens has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its
DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to begin negotiations with Siemens, and if these
negotiations are successful, authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute a
contract to purchase twelve (12) Light Rail vehicles in an amount not to exceed amount
programmed in the SBP. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not allow us to begin negotiations with Siemens for the purchase of twelve (12) Light Rail
vehicles. This will delay the procurement process and is not in the best interest of RTD.

Budget Transfer for Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service and fuel line items of the
“Group 20” budget to the service line item of the “Group 23” budget to cover the variation in costs
incurred as a result of adjustments to service levels associated with runboard service changes in
2014. The total dollar amount of the budget transfer is $760,000.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with two (2) different service providers, First Transit and Transdev Services
(formerly known as Veolia Transportation), to provide fixed-route transit services under four (4)
service contracts. The fixed-route services are packaged in “groups” that include a variety of bus
routes. The fixed-route services currently operated by private contractors are as follows: Group 21
(Transdev), Group 22 (First Transit Longmont), Group 23 (First Transit Denver), and Group 24 (First
Transit Commerce City). First Transit Commerce City was providing service under the Group 20
contract through August of this year. That service was re-bid in 2014 and was subsequently
awarded again to First Transit as the Group 24 service package.
DISCUSSION:
Effective with each of the runboard service changes in 2014, RTD Service Planning & Scheduling
made adjustments in the number of service hours in all of the private contract fixed-route service
contracts to best distribute the available resources. The adjustments that were made to the Group
20 and Group 23 contracts resulted in an unanticipated increase in service hours in the Group 23
contract and a reduction in the service hours in the Group 20 contract. At the present time, the
Group 23 service hours have been increased to a level higher than the hours used to estimate costs
for the 2014 budget and the contract will run short of budget funding by the end of the year.
Conversely, the Group 20 service hours have been reduced below the level used to estimate costs
for the 2014 budget. Therefore, it is recommended that the excess budget dollars in Group 20 be
transferred to Group 23 to provide the additional budget funding needed for this service contract for
2014.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no financial impact. The Group 20 service contract currently has budgeted dollars available
to be transferred into the Group 23 service contract.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Approve the recommended action item so that funds will be available to pay invoices for Group
23 service through the end of 2014.
2)
Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will require
staff to locate additional sources for budget funding to pay invoices for Group 23 service.

Budget Transfer for Contracted Access-a-Ride
Service

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service and fuel line items of the
Global Transportation and MV Transportation budgets to the service and fuel line items of the
Horizon Coach Lines budget to cover the variation in costs incurred as a result of the award of the
new Access-a-Ride service contract in 2014. The total dollar amount of the budget transfer is
$1,398,000.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with four (4) different service providers, Horizon Coach Lines, MV
Transportation, Via Mobility Services, and Transdev Services (formerly Veolia Transportation On
Demand), to provide Access-a-Ride paratransit services under four (4) service contracts. Three of
the service providers (Horizon, MV, and Via) use RTD-owned vehicles to provide “dedicated” service,
while the fourth provider (Transdev) uses Transdev-owned vehicles (taxi cabs) to provide “nondedicated” service. The current Access-a-Ride contracts were implemented in April of 2014
following the re-bid of the service in 2013. The current Access-a-Ride service model is a change
from the previous service model. Previously, the service had been provided by four (4) providers all
using RTD-provided vehicles and distributed as follows: MV Transportation—50% of revenue hours,
Global Transportation—16.6% of revenue hours, Horizon Coach Lines—16.6% of revenue hours and
Via Mobility Services—16.6% of revenue hours.
DISCUSSION:
At the time the 2014 budget was being prepared, the re-bid of the Access-a-Ride service was still in
the procurement process and no determination had been made on the service model or distribution of
service hours between providers. Consequently, the 2014 budgets were based on the existing 2013
service model as described above. The award/implementation of the new Access-a-Ride service
contracts in 2014 resulted in the following distribution of service: MV Transportation—50% of all
dedicated vehicle service hours, Horizon Coach Lines—25% of all dedicated vehicle service hours,
Via Mobility Services—25% of all dedicated vehicle service hours, and Transdev—100% of all nondedicated vehicle service (approximately 7% of the total Access-a-Ride service). The new Access-aRide service model resulted in an increase in revenue service hours for the Horizon and Via contracts
and a slight decrease in the service hours in the MV contract (over what had been used for budget
preparation). Global Transportation was not selected to continue providing service under the new
Access-a-Ride service model and contract. Therefore, the unused budgeted funds allocated to Global
in the 2014 budget were reallocated to the other providers.
Unfortunately, due to a
miscommunication, budget funding for Horizon was incorrectly allocated to MV. Therefore, those
funds now need to be transferred from MV to Horizon to cover the increased budget needs for
Horizon.
At the close of the Global Access-a-Ride contract, additional budget funds were released, which can

Packet Pg. 153

13.H

also be used to cover the budget funding shortfall for Horizon. Therefore, it is recommended that the
excess budget dollars from the Global budget and available budget dollars in the MV budget be
transferred to the Horizon budget to provide the additional budget funding needed for the increased
level service in the contract for 2014.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no financial impact. There are currently budgeted dollars available in the Global and MV
budgets to be transferred into the Horizon service contract.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Approve the recommended action item so that funds will be available to pay invoices for Horizon
service and fuel through the end of 2014.
2)
Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will require
staff to locate additional sources for budget funding to pay invoices for Horizon service and fuel.

Local Government Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Local Government Liaison services with
CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) to exercise the third option year (January 1, 2015 through December 31,
2015) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a cost of $122,496. Funding for this contract is included
in the annual FasTracks budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Local Government Liaison services was issued on October 20, 2011.
Eight responsive proposals were received for evaluation. Three of the teams were interviewed by a
procurement panel, and a recommendation was subsequently referred to the Executive Committee on
December 15, 2011. The Executive Committee unanimously approved the recommendation that CRL
Associates, Inc. be offered a contract which provided for a one-year base price with four (4) one-year
option periods. The referenced extension covers the third option period from January 1, 2015, to
December 31, 2015. CRL will continue to provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the elected officials and
staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and
economic development organizations. This team has a broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns,
as well as an extensive network of relationships with local governments, elected officials, and
stakeholders along the Front Range.
As part of the Local Government Liaison services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and the
Chairman of the Board to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and
county levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular
outreach to the business community and economic development organizations in the Metro area to
develop partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues of concern.
CRL will represent RTD at meetings at the local level of government and provide professional advice,
counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local government activities as they relate to RTD. CRL will also
provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the third option year ($122,496/year) are included in the annual budget for the FasTracks
program.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to exercise the third option year

(January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a cost of
$122,496.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to enter into
an agreement to exercise the third option year on the contract for the Local Government
Liaison services. A new Request for Proposals could be sent to interested parties, and a new
Local Government Liaison firm could be retained. This action is not recommended because
CRL Associates, Inc. has been very effective in assisting RTD with local government matters
in the past, and this group is very familiar with RTD’s issues and policies.

Federal Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to enter into a new agreement for Federal Liaison Services with
Squire Patton Boggs LLP for a 23-month contract at a cost of $494,500 ($21,500 per month—the same
rate as currently being paid) with three one-year options (option year one at $264,000; option year two
at $270,000; option year three at $276,000). The total amount of $1,304,500 was below staff’s
internal cost estimate, and funding for this contract is included in the annual budgets.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Federal Liaison Services was issued on August 12, 2014. This
solicitation was a Best Value Procurement where technical factors and cost were all considered. Ten
responsive proposals were received, and they were evaluated by a five-member evaluation committee
that recommended Squire Patton Boggs LLP. The recommendation of the evaluation committee was
subsequently referred to the Government Relations Committee on November 11, 2014. The
Government Relations Committee recommended that Squire Patton Boggs LLP be offered a new
contract for a five-year period. Squire Patton Boggs has been RTD’s federal lobbyist since 2000 and
has assisted in RTD’s receiving over $2.5 billion in federal grants and loans. In addition to constant
monitoring of Congressional and Government Relations Branch activities, status reports are issued
and special reports are prepared when required by the Board of Directors or the General Manager.
DISCUSSION
Constant monitoring of federal legislative activities that relate to RTD is required, and RTD’s interests
must be conveyed to appropriate members of Congress, including the Colorado delegation and other
key Congressional committee members. The Squire Patton Boggs team has excellent rapport and
respect from the Colorado delegation and serves as a resource for the delegation staff. When RTD
has a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) in place as it now does (Eagle P3 Project), the annual
appropriations process requires intense attention to committee hearings and to the status of the
Congressional budget process. In addition, RTD is seeking a Full Funding Grant Agreement for the
Southeast Rail Extension, which also entails extensive contacts with the Colorado Congressional
delegation. Significant lobbying efforts will be required to follow the steps to ensure being awarded
the annual appropriations in the current FFGA, as well as procuring the future FFGA.
The MAP-21 Continuing Resolution expires on May 31, 2015, so the federal lobbyists will play a key
role in representing RTD’s needs in the next reauthorization bill. With the build out of FasTracks, the
lobbyists will need to be especially attentive to the federal financing needs for the new corridors, and
they will monitor discussions and advocate for RTD’s best interests regarding new reauthorization
language. When the bill is enacted, Squire Patton Boggs will play a key role in advising RTD as to
the contents of the bill and monitoring the rule-making process.
In addition to helping with Congressional activities, assistance is also necessary with the Executive
Branch of the federal government, including the Department of Transportation (the Federal Transit

Packet Pg. 157

14.J

Administration and the Federal Railroad Administration). Squire Patton Boggs will provide guidance
and assistance in applying for and receiving federal funds from the Department of Transportation.
The Denver office of Squire Patton Boggs serves as important advisory role in RTD’s connection to
relevant national personnel and issues. In addition, annually, or as required, meetings with the Board
of Directors are also held.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Government Relations Committee’s Recommended Action to exercise a 23-month
contract at a cost of $494,500 ($21,500 per month—the same rate as currently being paid)
with three one-year options (option year one at $264,000; option year two at $270,000;
option year three at $276,000). The total amount of $1,304,500 was below staff’s internal
cost estimate, and funding for this contract is included in the annual budgets.
2. Continue the contract on a month-to-month basis, if amenable to the current Contractor
(Squire Patton Boggs LLP). This option is not recommended because continuity and stability
in liaison services is an important consideration.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and issue a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for
Federal Liaison Services. This option is not recommended because RTD’s RFP process was
properly utilized for this procurement, and all the proposals have been reviewed and subjected
to the evaluation criteria, resulting in a recommendation from the evaluation committee—
pursuant to RTD’s long-standing procurement procedures.

2015 FasTracks Public Information Consultant
Contract Award

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the third one-year option to the Virtegic Group Incorporated as the
FasTracks Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period
of performance through 2015. The scope of work is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic
Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This
contract amendment is for an amount not to exceed $686,009.60 for the year 2015. Funds for the
award are contained in the 2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
BACKGROUND
Utilizing a Public Information Consultant team to extend the staffin g needs of the FasTracks Public
Information Program contributes to the agency’s 2015 goal to Advance/Complete FasTracks.
In October 2011, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for a Public Information, Communications and
Public Outreach Consultant to serve as an extension of staff in the implementation of the FasTracks
Public Information Program. Following a comprehensive evaluation process, Virtegic Group
Incorporated, a certified SBE firm, was selected for this contract award.
The procurement was set up as a one-year contract award with four one-year options, negotiated
annually by RTD and Consultant Staff and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors. This gives
RTD the opportunity to assess and address the public information and outreach needs of the
FasTracks program on an annual basis as the program evolves. The services needed through this
contract may be reduced or embellished from year to year depending on the future financial situation
and changing needs of the FasTracks program.
Virtegic began its work effort in January 2012 and the RTD Board approved the first of four oneyear options for 2013 and the second one-year option for 2014. In the three years of working as the

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for this third one-year option are included in the 2015 Recommended Budget for the
FasTracks program.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the third one-year
option to the Virtegic Group Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information, Communications
and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period of performance through 2015 . The scope of
work is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually
by the RTD Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment is for an amount
not to exceed $686,009.60 for the year 2015. Funds for the award are contained in the 2015
Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the Public Information Consultant approach.
This is not recommended as RTD doesn’t currently have the staff to provide a sufficient level of
resources to meet the public information, communications and public outreach needs of the
FasTracks program. This alternative would delay and negatively impact the effective
implementation of the FasTracks Public Information Program.

Packet Pg. 161

3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
third one-year option to Virtegic Group. Issue another Request for Proposals for professional
services for Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach for the FasTracks Program
and award a contract to another consulting team. This is not recommended as the Virtegic team
is satisfactorily performing its work and has been flexible in meeting the changing communication
needs of the FasTracks program. Also, this alternative will delay and negatively impact the
successful implementation of the various strategies and activities associated with a
comprehensive and multi-layered communications effort.

Subject:

Boulder Transit Village – Contract Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to amend contract 10FH032 with Adolfson and Peterson for an additional
$1,450,900, increasing the new not-to-exceed contract amount to $9,389,905.
BACKGROUND
In September 2010, RTD released an RFP for design-build teams to build a bus transfer facility on RTD owned land near 30th and Pearl Streets in Boulder, with the option of incorporating joint development in
support of the City of Boulder’s plan for the area.
In September 2011, the RTD Board of Directors awarded the development of the Boulder Junction TOD
project to the team of Adolfson and Peterson for a mixed-use development that included:







6 bay, below grade bus transfer facility similar to Market Street Station;
New access road, Junction Place, that connects the RTD transit facility to Pearl Parkway;
5 story, 390 space parking garage with 90 RTD parking spaces;
Public plaza connecting the Project elements to each other and the surrounding community;
5 story, 140 room hotel with associated retail;
71 units of affordable rental housing.

DISCUSSION
Currently the project is 90% complete. There have been three amendments to date that have added the
following:




Enclosure of the patron waiting area
Requirement of an escrow agreement to back up letter of credit
Floor vapor barrier

The work remaining that requires a contract amendment includes:









A permanent ground water filtration system
Emergency generator
Removal of unforeseen railroad ties
Upgrades to interior finishes
Security system
Building automation system
Data lines
Automatic elevator recall feature

DBE PARTICIPATION

Packet Pg. 163

14.L

The RFP called for a DBE requirement of 16% of the construction contract. Adolfson and Peterson is
exceeding the DBE goals for the Project and is providing for 24.9% DBE participation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The current contact value through amendment 3 is $7,938,905. The contract amendment will raise the
not-to-exceed contract amount to $9,389,905. The project funding is available from a remaining CMAQ
grant amount of approximately $1,200,000 and local match that is within the project budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to amend contract
10FH032 with Adolfson and Peterson for an additional $1,450,900, increasing the new not-toexceed contract amount to $9,389,905.
2. Do not accept the recommended action. This is not recommended as RTD would lose
approximately $1,200,000 of remaining CMAQ grant funding that is available for the project; and
important elements of the project would not be built.

Board Meeting Date: November 25, 2014

Subject:

Resolution No.
, Series of 2014 Related to
the Modification of Call Provisions on
FasTracks Sales Tax Bonds, Series 2007A

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the modification of call
provisions associated with certain of the currently outstanding Regional Transportation District, Colorado
Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series 2007A.
BACKGROUND:

The Regional Transportation District (“RTD”) sold its Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project),
Series 2006A (the “Series 2006A Bonds) in a principal amount of $600,000,000 in 2006. In April,
2007 RTD issued its Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Project) Series 2007A (the “Series
2007A Bonds”), in a principal amount of $363,725,000, to advance refund a portion of the Series
2006A Bonds, the principal maturing from 2030 to 2036 in the amount of $364,265,000, to realize a
reduction in interest expense. The amortization of the Series 2007A Bonds was structured similar to the
refunded principal of the Series 2006A Bonds, with the majority of principal maturing from 2030 to
2036. The Series 2007A Bonds are subject to redemption at the option of RTD on or after November 1,
2017. Since the Series 2007A Bonds advance refunded the Series 2006A Bonds, the Series 2007A
Bonds can be (i) advance refunded on a taxable basis at any time, and (ii) currently refunded on a taxexempt basis no earlier than August 1, 2017.
This action item discusses the modification of the call provisions of a portion of the Series 2007A
Bonds in exchange for receiving a onetime payment from CitiBank N.A. (“Citi”).
DISCUSSION:

The Series 2007A Bonds are currently outstanding in the principal amount of $360,310,000. Citi
currently owns Series 2007A Bonds in an aggregate principal amount of $220,825,000, which
represents the majority of the principal outstanding in years 2030 to 2035, the details of which are set
forth in the following table:

Citi has approached RTD with an offer pursuant to which RTD would amend the call date of the Citi
owned Series 2007A Bonds from November 1, 2017 to November 1, 2024 against receipt of a one-time
cash payment from Citi. As of September 25, 2014, the payment from Citi to RTD was estimated at
approximately $15,000,000 assuming a closing date of November 20, 2014. The sale of the additional
call protection by RTD to Citi, with respect to the Series 2007A Bonds owned by Citi, can be analyzed
in the context of a partial refunding of the Series 2007A Bonds, with the savings of such “refunding”
realized in the form of an upfront-payment by Citi to RTD. If the proposal is accepted by RTD, the
Series 2007A Bonds owned by Citi would be subject to optional redemption by RTD as of November 1,
2024.
Copies of the Modification and Exchange Agreement and Second Supplemental Indenture of Trust are
available for review in the Board Office in substantially final form.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated payment by Citi of $15,000,000 represents 6.88% of the principal amount of Series
2007A Bonds owned by Citi. This is more than twice the (i) RTD threshold of 3.0% net present value
savings as a percent of refunded principal, and (ii) recommended threshold of 3.0% for execution of a
refunding by the Government Finance Officers Association.
RTD will need to make a one-time payment of approximately $1,400,000 to the IRS to satisfy RTD’s
arbitrage rebate liability relating to the 2007A bonds after this transaction is complete.
Costs of execution related to this transaction include fees for financial advisory, legal and other fees and
will be funded from the proceeds of this transaction.
Net funds received by RTD must be applied toward any FasTracks project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2014, authorizing the execution and delivery of a modification and exchange agreement and a
second supplemental indenture of trust relating to the districts Sales Tax Revenue Refunding
Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series 2007A, and other matters related thereto. This is the
recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series
of 2014, authorizing the execution and delivery of a modification and exchange agreement
and a second supplemental indenture of trust relating to the districts Sales Tax Revenue
Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series 2007A, and other matters related thereto. This

2015 Proposed Internal Audit Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the proposed plan of internal audits to be performed in 2015.
BACKGROUND
The annual internal audit plan has historically been approved by the General Manager. As a result of the
State of Colorado examination, it was agreed that the Board of Directors would also approve the internal
audit plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached plan includes the calculated number of days available for auditing, as well as the audit
plan, the title of the auditor assigned, and an estimate of the days allocated for each audit. A total of
twenty (20) audits are planned. Due to budget constraints, there are no outside audits scheduled for
this year.
The plan is based on estimates of the time required to complete the audits. As in past years, it utilizes
every available business day. If other audits arise during the year, we will request the input of the Board
as to which audits are to be eliminated to accommodate the added audit/audits.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
