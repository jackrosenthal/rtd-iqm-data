William C. Van Meter,

Date:

Subject:

Agreement with Denver at I-25 & Broadway
Station to Facilitate Denver’s Transportation
Project

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: May 19, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents, including
Intergovernmental Agreements, necessary to effectuate Denver’s transportation project, which includes
transit infrastructure improvements and the disposition and acquisition of real property at I-25 &
Broadway Station (the “Station”) to and from, respectively, the City and County of Denver (the “City” or
“Denver”).
This action addresses the following General Manager’s goals for 2020:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management: Oversees operating and FasTracks budgets, ensures
compliance with local, state, and federal reporting, and development of financing plans
for future projects.
Task Goal #1 – Strengthen Transparent Public Communication/Collaboration
BACKGROUND
For many years, the City and the Colorado Department of Transportation (“CDOT”) have planned to
alleviate congestion and improve safety on southbound Broadway by constructing a new on-ramp for I25 South. Rather than turning left and crossing northbound traffic to access the highway, drivers
heading south on Broadway will turn right just north of the highway, onto a ramp that will “wedge”
under the highway, between the existing off-ramp and southbound lanes, and over Broadway. The
wedge ramp (the “Project”) is part of a larger project called South Broadway Station Multimodal &
Safety Improvement Project (“SBSMSIP”). The purpose of SBSMSIP is to create a South Broadway
corridor that provides safe and efficient mobility for all modes (pedestrian, bicycle, transit, and
automobile). The goals of SBSMSIP include improving multimodal connections to I-25 & Broadway
Station, increasing safety at five high-crash intersections, and decreasing congestion and improving
operations for all modes of transportation.
The City has completed extensive community outreach for SBSMSIP and has received financial support
from the Denver Regional Council of Governments (“DRCOG”) and CDOT, including the use of Federal
funds. The City expects to complete the Project by 2025.
To execute the Project, which is just one component of SBSMSIP, the City requires land and other real
property rights owned by RTD at I-25 & Broadway Station. The Station is one of RTD’s busiest, with
significant bus and light rail service and more than 1,000 parking spaces, which are very highly utilized.

Packet Pg. 31

12.A

The three parcels of land that the City plans to acquire from RTD for the Project are shown in the Site
Map as “A,” “B,” and “C”. In exchange for the RTD real property interests, the City will transfer to RTD
the parcel of land it owns at the Station, which sits under the highway and is shown as Parcel D on the
site map. In addition, the City will construct approximately 200 parking spaces (the “Improvements”) on
the dirt lot in the RTD Park-n-Ride under I-25 (the “PnR”), where approximately 200 transit spaces are
currently located. The Improvements to the dirt lot will be a substantial benefit to RTD and its patrons,
and will meet RTD standards for paving, lighting, security, safety, and other RTD requirements. The City
will also provide RTD with approximately 200 temporary RTD parking spaces during construction at one
or more locations approved by RTD. The temporary parking will also meet RTD standards.
RTD will enter into a Common Use Agreement with the Colorado Department of Transportation, which
will accept and maintain the Wedge Ramp after it is constructed.
DISCUSSION
This action would give the General Manager and/or his designee the authority to negotiate and execute
all documents, including but not limited to, an intergovernmental agreement between RTD and Denver
incorporating the required conditions below and providing for the disposition and acquisition of real
property at I-25 & Broadway Station to and from, respectively, the City and County of Denver.
The execution of these documents will only be authorized to take place if the following conditions are
met:
•

Denver will provide RTD with a minimum of 200 parking spaces at locations acceptable to RTD,
both during construction and in the final condition of the Project, unless otherwise agreed to in
writing by both parties.

•

Denver will improve the PnR impacted by the Project. Such Improvements include, but are not
limited to, paving (concrete is expected), curb & gutter, traffic control devices, striping, lighting,
camera coverage, emergency telephones, pedestrian pathways, and ancillary improvements.

•

The value of the real property interests provided by RTD, and any expenditures on the Project by
RTD, shall be commensurate with the real property interests provided by Denver and the value of
the Improvements. RTD and Denver may consider maintenance, congestion mitigation, and air
quality improvements.

•

At all times during construction and in the final condition of the Project, RTD buses will have two
points of full movement access into and out of I25 & Broadway Station in locations approved by
RTD.

•

Denver must receive RTD approval for all phases of design of the portion of the Project that
impacts RTD Property or relates to transit safety, security, and operations (as determined by
RTD).

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Accepting the Recommended Action would have a minimal impact on RTD’s ongoing operations &
maintenance costs for the PnR. RTD would be gaining the asset improvement at a value to be
determined.

Date:

Subject:

Contract Option Award for the Purchase of 48
Cutaway Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of contract 25FK006 with
Master’s Transportation for the purchase of 48 Goshen cutaway buses to be used for the Access-a-Ride
and FlexRide services at a price not to exceed $3,616,009. Costs by sub-fleets are as follows:
Access-a-ride
Flexride

(37)
(11)

$74,957 ea
$76,600 ea

$2,773,409
$842,600

This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
On January 19, 2016 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 233 Goshen cutaway
buses. The procurement was the result of RTD Invitation for Bids (IFB25FK006) issued on October 19,
2015. Five bids were received on December 8, 2015 in response to this IFB. Master’s Transportation
was the responsive and responsible low bidder for the selected bus configurations. The IFB allowed RTD
to purchase additional cutaway buses for a five-year period with each successive year pricing to be
based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price adjustment set by the US Department of
Labor’s Producer Price Index (PPI).
Staff is requesting Board approval to exercise the option to Contract 25FK006 with Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of 48 additional Goshen cutaway buses. The new buses will replace 37
2014 model year Startrans buses used for Access-A-Ride service, seven 2013 model year Eldorado
buses used for the FlexRide service and provide four expansion buses for the Wagon Road (2) and the
Platte Valley (2) FlexRide service.
DISCUSSION
The 2013 and 2014 model year cutaway buses to be replaced have exceeded their Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) service life of 5 years or 150,000 miles. They are currently over 6 years old and
have accumulated an average of 180,000 miles and 230,000 miles respectively. They require intensive
maintenance to keep them in service.
The new cutaway buses will conform to the configuration that was developed in cooperation with the
disability community several years ago during the initial 2015/2016 procurement of ADA cutaway
buses. The buses will be equipped with an extended sized wheelchair lift to accommodate large sized
wheelchairs, two wheelchair access areas for the FlexRide buses and three wheelchair access areas for

Packet Pg. 38

12.B

the Access-a-Ride buses. These designs exceed ADA requirements. The buses will also be equipped
with a security camera system per the current standard on all new RTD buses.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for this contract amendment is included in the District’s 2020 Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Master’s Transportation selected bus manufacturer, Goshen, has
submitted a certificate attesting to FTA's approval of its DBE plan.

Broomfield CMAQ Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
an Agreement with the City and County of Broomfield to provide the expanded Broomfield FlexRide
service. This service will be funded through the grant and the local match. No RTD money is required.
This Agreement is for the period 2019 - 2023. Federal Funding years 2020-2023.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND:
In 2015, the City and County of Broomfield applied for a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for an expanded Broomfield FlexRide service. This grant was approved with funding available
2016-2019. The City and County of Broomfield contributed the entire local match.
In 2019, the City and County of Broomfield applied for a new CMAQ to keep the extended service and
possible expansion to the peaks and Saturday service. The extended service continued the operations of
the additional bus and expanded service area. The CMAQ approved account for $1,440,000 grant
funds and $360,000 in local funds. The City and County of Broomfield will contribute the entire local
match.
In the August 2019 service change package, the RTD Board approved continuing the service if the grant
was approved.
Considering the current operator shortage this additional service will not require the hiring of additional
employees as Via Mobility has been operating the expansion service and continues to operate it with
existing staff. Any additional vehicles during peaks will not be added if it requires an additional operator
during the operator shortage.
DISCUSSION:
Prior to the original grant, the Broomfield FlexRide did not cover the entire City and County. This grant
continues to provide additional coverage in the City and County of Broomfield.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Funds for the provision of the expanded Broomfield FlexRide were included in the 2020 budget. All
funds expended by the RTD will be reimbursed through the grant process.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. _____, SERIES OF 2020

WHEREAS, RTD’s Board of Directors consists of 15 elected members who serve their
constituents on a daily basis throughout the community, at committee meetings, study
sessions, and Board meetings, and at the legislature; and
WHEREAS, Each fiscal year moneys are allocated to Directors’ expense budgets to allow for
reimbursement of their individual local and travel expenses; and
WHEREAS, The COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on both farebox revenues and
sales and use tax revenues; and
WHEREAS, Though RTD has received a significant amount of funding through the federal
CARES Act, that amount is not enough to offset lost revenues, and further agency-wide
budget reductions for fiscal year 2020 are now warranted; and
WHEREAS, Social distancing requirements, broad travel restrictions, and event cancellations
both locally and nationwide have diminished Directors’ opportunities to travel within their
districts to conduct business and meet with constituents and to travel outside of the state
in the exercise of their duties; and
WHEREAS, At the same time, remote meetings have offered the Directors the ability to
conduct business from home, thus minimizing or eliminating the need to travel to and from
the Blake Street Offices to participate in, and formally vote during, Board and committee
meetings during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic; and
WHEREAS, Due to a projected revenue shortfall in 2020, the Board of Directors approved
Resolution 012, Series of 2019, which reduced the amounts allocated to the Directors for
fiscal year 2020.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that for fiscal year 2020 only, in light of ongoing
financial hardships impacting the agency, the Board hereby reduces the following budget
lines:
