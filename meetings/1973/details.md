## V. Public Participation

- Gary Van Horn spoke on behalf of the National Federation of the Blind-Mile Hi Chapter.  He stated that October is National Safety Month and his community has a number of events including “meet the blind.” He distributed a package to the Board members which provided more information.  He indicated that Directors Folska and Tobiassen planned to attend their state convention in Lone Tree starting October 30-Nov 2.  Gary indicated that the blind community are regular users of public transit and rely heavily on our fixed route services.  He encouraged RTD to keep growing and building up our fixed route services.

- Nghia Nguyen, representing the Ironworkers in Commerce City, commented they are concerned about RTD’s investigation of fraud in the DBE/SBE program.  He perceives RTD acts as a pass-through but they fail to do a thorough investigation of claims that are brought to their attention.  He cited one contractor whose certification was revoked by the City of Denver.  However, by the time of the revocation, they had already been paid an excessive amount of money which RTD indicated they could not reclaim.  He also referenced the RMR dispute and alleged that RTD kept extending the time needed for the investigation pass the 90 days and then indicated they could do nothing until the City if Denver completes their certification investigation.  He stated RTD needs to take more personal responsibility for its contractors.

- Elizabeth Murphy who represented the Community Enterprise in Commerce City, spoke about the need for accessible and affordable transportation for everyone.  She believes the fare structure study needs to look at those barriers to the community for affordable transportation.

- Joseph Stukes spoke as a private citizen of Aurora.  He shared his background as retired from the Rocky Mountain Arsenal where he was an electrical engineer among other functions.  He grew up in the New York area and has lots of familiarity with trains (i.e. trolleys, heavy rail, subways, etc).  He has noticed a couple of things about our light rail vehicles.  He said he sees no photovoltaic panels on RTD land or auxiliary generators.  Mr. Stukes explained that contrary to what Excel has said regarding RTD never being without power, if the primary power supply goes down then RTD has no source of power.  He sees a need for auxiliary power.  The train could be stuck in the middle of the intersection due to a loss of power, which will happen more and more frequently since the electrical grid is as crowded as it can be.

o        Director Lubow agreed with Director Deadwyler and stated this little pilot has gone viral on a bigger scale than we could have anticipated. She also wanted to congratulate Director Folska and Paula Perdue for how hard they worked to trump up support and to meet with schools, elected officials and community leaders.  This has been a valuable experience.

## X. General Manager's Report

General Manager Washington provided these comments:

- Role of APTA Chair—He is honored and humbled to have been selected as Chair of the American Public Transportation Association for the year 2015.  He thanks this Board and others for their confidence in him to help forge policy and advocate on behalf of the membership of APTA.  At the conference and EXPO itself, there were approximately 13,000 attendees.  At his general session he spoke of five megatrends that his platform will address:

1.       Sustainable long term transportation funding bill.  He is calling for a National Day of Action in April 2015 to bring attention to the seriousness of this issue.

2.       Workforce and lifestyle changes

3.       Demographic Shifts—changes to the urban core and effect of minority becoming majority

4.       Accelerating Technological Innovations

5.       Safety and security challenges

General Manager Washington stated that he believe the value of him in this position will allow him to shape the national policy right here from 1600 Blake Street.

General Manager Washington shared that a second priority on his platform is the building of a career pathway for people in the transit industry, especially those difficult to fill positions. General Manager Washington reminded the Board that approximately two years ago, he had come to the Board for approval to seek the role of the APTA Chair and had received their head nods.  He is grateful for their support and feels this will be a highly visible and strategic advantage for RTD.  He does not plan to allow this role to distract from his role as CEO of RTD.  If it does, he will be the first to retreat.  APTA will be paying for all travel associated with his role as the APTA Chair.  He is looking forward to helping to shape national policy as evident already by the emulations of other agencies around the country on the MAX program and PPP.

- Jersey Cutoff Bridge—General Manager Washington acknowledge the media coverage and questions that have arisen around the Jersey Cutoff Bridge.  He stated this is one of 35 bridges that is a part of the Eagle P3.  He reminded the Board that the P3 includes delivery options with steep penalties for nonperformance.  Since this is a build-design-operate, it is to the advantage of the concessionaire to make sure the bridge is as solid as possible.  The concessionaire will operate for 28 years and would not want to be subjected to penalties.  This is a good story for the P3 delivery model. This is a transference of risk to the concessionaire.

The concessionaire made the determination to redo the bridge at no cost to RTD or impact to schedule.  We are very supportive of the relationship we have forged with our concessionaire and that they were willing to step up to the plate on this issue.

- Bronco Service Last week—General Manager Washington reported that the rail operations supported two Broncos games last week.  He is happy to report that we carried in excess of 20,000 people without incident.  This is a significant accomplishment and he wanted to acknowledge AGM Jenkins and the rail team for their work.

Comments from Board members:

Director Bagley stated he was 1 of those 20000 passengers to the Bronco game.  He was amazed at how quickly they were able to move him on the train within 15 minutes from when he arrived at the platform.
