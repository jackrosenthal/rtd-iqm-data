2015 Requested Budget (Jannette Scarpino)
Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, thanked the Board for their time this evening to
review the first draft of the 2015 Requested Budget. He said that Jannette Scarpino,
Budget and Financial Analysis Manager, and Susan Cohen, FasTracks Program Control
Manager, were with him to answer any questions.
Jannette Scarpino reminded the Board that the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) was presented
previously along with assumptions and key elements of the 2015 Requested Budget. She
reiterated that the 2015 Requested Budget was just a first draft; staff is not asking for any
appropriations at this time. She shared that staff believes this budget is representative of
the General Manager’s goals.
Jannette Scarpino noted that any changes to the Base System and FasTracks Operating
budget will be minor; however, the FasTracks Capital budget is preliminary as the capital
carry forward was not included since it is based on a September 30th close.
Jannette Scarpino said the highlights of the sources for the budget on a combined basis
are:
 Fare revenue of $124.9 million in 2015 is budgeted to remain flat from 2015 due
to expected minimal growth in ridership and no fare rate increase.
 Staff is budgeting $535.1 million for sales and use tax which is 5.9% over 2014.
This figure is from the CU Leeds forecast.
 Grant revenue is budgeted to decline about $53.1 million from the 2014 Amended
Budget due to identified decreases primarily in West Corridor New Starts grants,
CMAQ grants on Eagle and US36, and carry forward grants for park-n-Rides, the
Free Metro Ride, and SmartCard.
 Investment income is projected to decrease $0.2 million due to continued low short
term rates and deployment of invested funds.
Jannette Scarpino pointed out that as more information becomes available and the capital
carry forward budget is finalized, capital grant revenue estimates will change accordingly
in the 2015 Recommended Budget.
Jannette Scarpino stated the highlights of the uses for the budget on a combined basis
are:
 Operating expenses are expected to decline $58.7 million from the 2014 Amended
Budget due to project completion, 2015 expense projects now scheduled in 2016
and beyond, and expense projects reclassified to capital.

Staff is budgeting principal payments for debt of $62.5 million which is essentially
unchanged from 2014.
Interest expense is essentially remaining flat at $97.35 million.
Base System new capital expenditures are budgeted at $94.5 million.
FasTracks new capital expenditures are estimated at $511.4 million.

Jannette Scarpino explained that at this time there is a small difference between the 2015
Requested Budget and the SBP that are outlined in the Board Report included in the
September 30, 2014 Study Session Agenda Packet as item (7)f; this will be covered in
part by staging the work in 2016 of certain capital expense projects as well as a savings
of about $1.7 from the 2015 diesel lock. She also reiterated that there is not capital carry
forwarded in the budget at this time.
Jannette Scarpino informed the Board that the next steps are:
 Publishing the 2015 Requested Budget for public review and comment on October
15, 2014
 Present updated 2015 Requested Budget to the Board at the October 21, 2014
Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting
 Present the final 2015 Recommended Budget to the Board at the November 18,
2014 Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting
 Request approval of the 2015 Adopted Budget on November 25, 2014
Jannette Scarpino shared that staff is available to meet with any Director one-on-one for
further review. She asked if there were any questions or comments.
Director Bagley inquired what staff believes is the biggest potential issue for the budget in
2015; he wonders what keeps them up at night. Jannette Scarpino explained that about
three weeks previously there were some difficulties balancing the budget which “upended”
her some. She said that her biggest concern is that RTD has limited resources and RTD
must operate within those constraints. Terry Howerter stated that he has a great staff so
he sleeps very well. He believes the policies that have been put in place by the Board are
very important. He shared that he used to worry about an economic downturn but said
the fund balance policy really gives him peace of mind.
Director Bagley noted that the fund balance policy is not something that RTD has always
had in place. He thinks it is critical to build it into the budget but to try not to rely on
those balances during difficult times.
Director Lubow asked for more information about the unexpected items that were
presented to staff after the SBP was approved. She recognized that there is contingency
money built into the budget but wonders if these unexpected costs were even more

Director Lubow noted that the fund balances are based on some federal standards but
wonders if the amount is really enough. Terry Howerter explained that the fund balances
were set based on Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) best practices of
having three months of operating expenses. He feels that based on the most recent
recession the fund balances the Board set are very good.
Director Folska asked Jannette Scarpino to read paragraph (7)f into the record which is:
(7) Operating expenses:
f. Certain items budgeted in the 2015 Requested Budget totaling $7.7 million
materialized after the SBP was approved, including RTD’s increased contribution
to the union benefit plans, a maintenance campaign in Rail Operations for a LRV
half-life overhaul program, and additional dollars for the Civic Center rehab
capital project. These items will be covered in part by staging the work in 2016
of certain capital and expense projects approved in the SBP for 2015 as
follows:
1) Track Maintenance Equipment for $1.0 million (capital)
2) Power Switching on Emergency Crossovers at SW, CPV, SE, CC for
$2.0 million (capital)
3) Grade Crossing Upgrade & Rail Replacement at Speer & Stout Street
for $0.352 million (capital)
4) Railway Worker Protection Early Warning System for $1.0 million
(capital)
5) 3 Lane Bus Wash Replacement for $1.4 million (expense)
Director Folska inquired what type of revenue was included in the other revenue totaling
about $9 million in the 2015 Requested Budget. Jannette Scarpino explained that is
miscellaneous revenue such as advertising, rental income, etc.
Director Solano expressed confusion about the Certificates of Participation (COPs)
budgeting. He asked if these were budgeted separately. Terry Howerter explained that
due to the different tax bases the COPs are separate for Base System and FasTracks.
Base System utilizes COPs for items like replacement of rolling stock. FasTracks has some
COPs for purchase of light rail vehicles as well as the recently issued COPs for North
Metro.

unexpected than the contingency accounted for. Jannette Scarpino referred to the
explanation of the unexpected items under (7)f of the Board Report that is in the
September 30, 2014 Study Session Agenda Packet. She explained that the contingency
money in the budget is the fund balances that staff has been hesitant to draw on.

6.A

Chair Sisk requested farebox recovery ratios for various agencies in the US. General
Manager Washington said that staff would provide that; however, it is important to keep
in mind the differences between the agencies and RTD.
Director Daly shared that ever since he has been on the Board the farebox recovery ratio
has always hovered around 21-22%. He stated that there is nothing radical about this
figure.
Director Rivera-Malpiede said at Rail~Volution there was a lot of comparison between
Minneapolis and Denver; however, the reality is that Denver is much larger in terms of
square footage. She thinks it would be beneficial to see the miles of rail and bus service
along with the farebox recovery ratio to understand the differences.
Director Walker agreed that during Rail~Volution people were trying to compare RTD to
other agencies but he found the size of our District fare outweighs that of many other
districts. He imagines that even though the farebox recovery ratio has remained steady
around 20% it must be hard to maintain as expenses increase but RTD’s fares have not.
Terry Howerter stated that Director Walker was correct. Fares have not increased since
2011 while operating expenses continue to grow but staff has managed to control it.
Director Walker asked if staff prepares a document that shows RTD’s unfunded budget or
wish list. Jannette Scarpino said that a list of deferred projects is included in the SBP but
there is not an official document that is distributed to staff.
Director James wonders why there is such attention on farebox recovery. It is simply a
ratio of two numbers, each of which can be high or low for a variety of reasons. He
pointed out that a lower farebox recovery ratio could mean the customer is riding for a
lower rate. He does not understand why a high farebox recovery ratio is automatically a
good thing. Terry Howerter stated that he would like to see operating revenue cover
operating expenses. If the operating revenues do not cover expenses then those
additional funds come out of the sales and use tax revenue which is volatile. General

Packet Pg. 10

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 30, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Sisk expressed concern that our fare recovery ratio is only at 22% currently. He
shared that in attending Rail~Volution in Minneapolis he hears of many other agencies
having a much higher fare recovery ratio. General Manager Washington stated that what
comes out of the Fare Study will be paramount in what RTD’s fare recovery ratio might
be. It is impacted by fares, ridership, service area, etc. General Manager Washington
expressed concern over expectation management of the fare study results. He reminded
the Board how important it is to not make assumptions that fares will go up or down. He
is also concerned that people expect that fares will go down but somehow service will go
up which does not compute mathematically.

6.A

Director Bagley commented that he often shares information on the subsidy per passenger
with people in his area; when people hear this information and learn that the Free Mall
Ride is the best performing route it really blows their mind. He said that often people tell
him that RTD is giving away service. Director Bagley noted that fares are also a political
issue.
Director Solano shared with the Board that he has conducted his own research on this
topic. He found that most agencies do not run a profit but they are efficient. He believes
that RTD cannot be compared to other agencies but needs to focus on how we can be
efficient.

III.

Other Matters
General Manager Washington announced that Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager
(AGM) of Rail Operations, submitted his resignation and will be leaving around December.
General Manager Washington will appoint an acting AGM and begin a national recruitment
for the position.
Director Anderson shared that she was recently in Memphis where they have a streetcar
system that is not running. She said their transit agency estimates it will take between $6
to $40 million to repair the vehicles. She thanked General Manager Washington and the
staff for their dedication to RTD’s State of Good Repair. This demonstrates where RTD
could be with the mall shuttle if staff did not manage our assets so well.
Director Lasater said he has been having some animated conversations in Douglas County
due to the potential elimination of Call-n-Rides in the area. He commended staff for their
ability to work with an interesting situation he brought to their attention. There are people
who use Call-n-Ride as their only form of transportation but were not able to attend the
public meetings due to the hours of the Call-n-Ride service. He stated that staff is
extending the hours of service on the days of the public meetings to riders can attend.
Director Lasater hopes the riders come to the meetings with recommendations from the
community to come to a resolution on the eliminated service.
Director Bagley stated that he had three comments:
 He had a meeting with Roger Partridge, Chair of the Douglas County
Commissioners, about the Call-n-Ride service in Highlands Ranch and Parker. He
believes that Douglas County will come forward with not just a program of putting

Packet Pg. 11

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 30, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Manager Washington believes that people put a lot of undue emphasis on the farebox
recovery ratio. He said that a 75% farebox recovery ratio probably means that
organization has very high fares. He reiterated several Directors statements that it is very
difficult to compare agencies because each one is unique.

money into something but really working with RTD. Director Bagley shared that he
informed Mr. Partridge that communication, cooperation and collaboration are very
important to RTD. He said that Mr. Partridge really picked up on that. Director
Bagley believes that there will be an attempt to make a model out of Douglas
County because there are two Call-n-Rides operating in that area.
40% of the Board attended the Rail~Volution Conference; in addition to himself
Chair Sisk and Directors Hoy, James, Rivera-Malpiede and Walker were in
attendance. He shared that he went on three tours. One focused on Transit
Oriented Development in extended communities, one was a Bus Rapid Transit tour
that really demonstrated what happens around BRT stations, and the last was a
tour of University of Minneapolis and their transportation.
8 Directors attended a recent tour of the hotel and train station at DIA. He feels
this is an outstanding demonstration of what RTD can do when we partner with
other entities.

Director Daly recognized Brian Matthews’ assistance in organizing the tour at DIA. He
thought that Kim Day gave a very nice introduction. He appreciated the tour and thanked
those involved.
Chair Sisk thanked Paula Perdue as she was instrumental in getting the DIA tour
scheduled. He also thanked the staff that represented RTD at Rail~Volution. He thought
that staff did a wonderful job showing what RTD does and the national presence we have.

a more robust, reliable operation on the current North Metro segment to
124th Avenue and facilitate the future construction of the remaining segment
to 162nd Avenue. Funding for the FasTracks Railroad Right of Way Budget is
included in the 2014 Amended Budget for the FasTracks capital program.
Motion:

Director Solano made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the October 28, 2014
Board meeting.

Discussion:

Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs,
reminded the Board that the North Metro Rail Line is largely a
single track railroad with passing sidings. Trains in opposite
directions meet on these sidings, pass, and then both reenter
the single track. He noted this works fine until something
goes wrong such as breakdowns, power problems, inclement
weather, etc. He explained that once a delay begins it can
become difficult to manage and create a ripple effect with too
much single track.
Ashland Vaughn, North Metro Project Manager, reiterated that
the North Metro currently is primarily single track with a series
of passing tracks. He explained that these additional sidings
will help the system recover from any problem so that they do
not compound and spiral out of control. He stated that this is
not just important for the reliability of the North Metro but
really the entire commuter rail system.
Committee Chair Hoy pointed out the schematic of the sidings
that was included in the October 7, 2014 FasTracks
Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet. He thought this was a
great illustration of the request. Ashland Vaughn noted that it
is much more financially feasible to integrate these track
sidings into the system now versus coming back later.
Rick Clarke reminded the Board that RTD has a very good
experience of moving forward with enabling works that benefit
the agency down the road. He stressed that once North Metro
is built to end-of-line these sidings would still need to be built
but at that time it would be at a much greater cost. He stated
that while RTD’s motto is to build as much as we can as fast
as we can we also need what we build to be done right. Rick
Clarke said that RTD does not want to open a line only to have
it be continually behind schedule because these sidings were
not approved. He commented that another important reason

Director Folska noted that the funding for this work would be
coming from the FasTracks Railroad Right of Way budget.
She wondered what the ramifications would be of using all the
funds from this budget. Rick Clarke stated that there would
no longer be any funding available if unforeseen expenses
arouse as it relates to BNSF and Union Pacific right of way;
however, the Eagle project was built almost entirely along
railroad right of way and any issues were successfully handled
within the Eagle project’s budget.
Director Solano thinks it is great that staff is looking forward
and being proactive in their recommendations. He thinks this
is a great recommendation.

D. Updates

• Central Rail Extension Mobility Study
Andy Mutz, Project Manager, reviewed a Power Point presentation with the
Board that is available in the October 7, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring
Committee Agenda Packet. He reminded the Board that the purpose of the
study is to determine the best way to provide a direct trip between the
38th/Blake Station and Downtown Denver while establishing a long-term
vision with the local community. The study elements include alignments,
vehicles and operational elements such as stations, ridership capacity, RTD
system integration, future expansion, etc.
Director Bagley inquired what the cost of the Central Rail Extension is
budgeted at in today’s dollars. Andy Mutz said it is roughly $65 million.
Director Rivera-Malpiede shared that she was overwhelmed and touched by
how many community members have participated in the study. She asked
how staff plans to keep them updated on the status of the project. Andy
Packet Pg. 16

to approve this action is that there is budget available. He
reiterated how important it is for this to be done now while
RTD has a contractor ready and service has not yet started.

6.B

Mutz stated that the process would be the same as it was at the start; there
will be an elected officials briefing followed by a task force meeting and then
a public meeting.

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, said that in some recent
conversations with Northwest Corridor stakeholders it became clear that not
everyone has an understanding of how this line will operate as part of RTD’s
contract with Denver Transit Partners (DTP). He explained that in the original
Request for Proposal (RFP), the operations plan was always defined as an express
service between the Westminster Station and Denver Union Station without
stopping at any intermediate stations, which are the 41st Avenue and Pecos Street
stations. He stated that per staff’s discussions with the stakeholders, including
DRCOG, Adams County, and Denver County, there is now a common
understanding. Bill Van Meter noted that this is also a great opportunity to test
express service as this has been requested on many of RTD’s existing lines.
Director Anderson pointed out that the Environmental Impact Statement for the
Gold Line indicated a concern that there be a way to transfer at the Pecos Street
station to the Northwest Rail Line. Bill Van Meter acknowledged that the
opportunity for transfer is recognized by staff; however, until the line goes further
north there is not a demand for transfer. He said this will be addressed as the
corridor gets built out further.
Committee Chair Hoy thanked Bill Van Meter for the update.

B. Recommended Actions

• Utility Easement for South Weld Metropolitan District for City of Dacono
and St. Vrain Sanitation District
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to
execute all documents necessary to convey a non-exclusive utility easement
over 3,769 square feet (0.086 acres, more or less) on the Boulder Branch
segment of the Boulder Industrial Lead in the SE¼ Section 14, Township 1
North, Range 68 West, City of Dacono, County of Weld, State of Colorado.
Motion:

Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the October
28, 2014 Board meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Susan Altes, Senior Manager of Property, explained that the
City of Dacono and the St. Vrain Sanitation District are
concerned with License Agreements that are revocable and
terminable. They initially sought a permanent easement in the
property to ensure the continued use and operation of the
pipelines. Due to time constraints of the subdivision
development, they agreed to execute the licenses to facilitate
the installations while continuing to pursue an easement.

Director Menten arrived late. Director Lubow and Chair Sisk were absent.

Under the easement, RTD shall retain all rights and usage of
the property as necessary to ensure RTD’s use for any future
mass transportation system purposes.

Director Folska asked if the request was a lease or a sale.
Susan Altes replied that it was a grant of property rights
through an easement. Director Folska asked if the $3,100
compensation was in perpetuity. Susan Altes said that it was
a one-time compensation because it is based on the real
property conveyance fee statement of value. Director Folska
asked if the easement went through a Request for Proposal
(RFP) or if it was an exclusive negotiation. Susan Altes
explained that it was an exclusive negotiation with the entity
that requested it.
Director Solano asked for the location of the City of Dacono
and the St. Vrain Sanitation District. He also asked if RTD
anticipated rail service in the area. Susan Altes said that it is
on the east side of I-25. Rick Clarke added that the purchase
agreement with Union Pacific did not allow for partial
purchases. RTD then bought the 32.7 mile corridor. The rest
of the corridor is being preserved for any future additions.
Director Solano asked if RTD could do licenses or any other
taxes in anticipation of rail lines. Marla Lien, General Counsel,
noted that there are hundreds of utility crossings throughout
the corridor. These crossings will not interfere with RTD
operations. She added that accepting the easement request
would allow the subdivision to provide water service.
Director Hoy asked if Joe Knopinski, Managing Principal at
Development Planning and Financial Group, was involved in
this process. Director Hoy also asked if Joe Knopinski was
committed to restoring the tracks. Susan Altes answered that
he was involved and committed.

Packet Pg. 20

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 7, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair James asked what would happen to the
utility lines if RTD decided to use the corridor. Susan Altes
replied that the lines are low enough to comply with RTD’s rail
system requirements. Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager
of Capital Programs, added that the utilities lines are subject to
modification or relocation to avoid conflict.

C. Updates
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, introduced Brian
Welch, Senior Manager of Planning Technical Services. Brian Welch
reviewed the RTD 2015 Strategic Plan Power Point included in the Planning
& Development Committee Meeting packet for October 7, 2014. The
presentation included context, structure, alternative names, alternative
vision statements and schedule for the Strategic Plan. He mentioned that
the ideas in the presentation were suggestions for the Board’s consideration.
Phil Washington, General Manager, noted the importance of this document
for the staff. He said that many people do not understand the distinction
between RTD and Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), a partner
in a couple of the projects. Phil Washington pointed out that this document
is visionary as it takes into consideration the 2016 openings and the
momentum the openings will generate in the region and the state of
Colorado. The Strategic Plan will guide the region and perhaps the State in
how to dream big.
Committee Chair James asked to confirm if the Strategic Plan would cover 6
years. Brian Welch confirmed that it is a 6 year Plan which references
actions for the next 20 years. Committee Chair James inquired about the
process for annual review and Board input. Brian Welch anticipates that the
Board will have an opportunity to review and provide feedback on the Plan
during the annual Board Advance. Phil Washington referred the Directors to
the third slide of the presentation. This slide explains the process to create
the Strategic Plan.
Director Folska agreed that what RTD is doing leading up to the 2016
openings will build momentum as well as create synergy for the region and
the state. She also mentioned that a 6 year Plan that bleeds into the next
20 years oversteps staff’s boundaries unless this refers to parameters on the
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). She mentioned that it is the Board’s duty as
representative of the constituents to do the dreaming and planning. Director
Folska recommended that staff research the academic discipline of

Packet Pg. 21

• Strategic Plan Update

6.C

“Futurism”. Phil Washington noted that the SBP is part of the strategic
nature of the Strategic Plan. He stated that Board direction is the starting
point of the Strategic Plan as it sets the priorities. The SBP ties back to the
goals set by the Directors during the Board Advance.

Director Tobiassen encouraged staff to collaborate and reach out to
who/what RTD thinks will become major activity and employment centers.
He mentioned the Anschutz campus as an example of working to effectively
serve what eventually became an active center. Director Tobiassen said that
he does not have the answers. He noted that reaching out to these parties
would help create a more comprehensive Strategic Plan for RTD.
Director Walker said that it is a great idea to extend the short term vision to
a longer term. He recalled helping CDOT put their plan together in 2000 in
collaboration with other local agencies. He mentioned he is excited to see
the outcome of this process.
Director Anderson agreed with Director Tobiassen. She said that since RTD
does not do land use planning the agency needs to keep working with all of
the partners as it has done for the past 20 years. She believes the outline is
a great way to move forward. She mentioned that the Plan gives direction
on how to complete it.
Director Rivera-Malpiede shared her excitement about the Plan. She likes
the ability for the Board to touch the plan and make adjustments each year.
She said that the region is building in such a magnitude that the Board needs
to broaden the macro perspective.
Director Hoy added that if the District does not plan for 20 years from now
it will go backwards. He said that the current plans were created 20 years
ago.
Committee Chair James agreed with Director Bagley in regard to the third
bullet of the Alternative Strategic Plan Vision Statements slide. He believes
that the Strategic Plan is a great idea. He said that the Plan is something
that RTD has been doing unconsciously. Committee Chair James supports
doing this kind of planning consciously. He added that coordinating with the
SBP is inevitable since it depicts how the Plan will be funded. He said he
Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 7, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley noted that people have asked him when RTD will move to
other projects beyond FasTracks. He noted that the third bullet point,
“Transforming Regional Mobility and Quality of Life Through Innovation and
Collaboration”, on the Alternative Strategic Plan Vision Statements
addressed this issue. He said that he is excited to participate in this process
and encouraged staff to move forward.

6.C

looks forward to the Board’s opportunity to be part of the process. He
thanked staff for making the Plan happen. Phil Washington added that staff
sees the Strategic Plan as a collaborative effort between Board and staff.
He said that the top block of the format is Board input. He mentioned that
the Plan will include a large amount of Asset Management and State of
Good Repair. He said this is needed so RTD does not end up like some
agencies that did not take care of their assets.

• TOC Update
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, introduced Bill Sirois,
Senior Manager for Transit Oriented Communities. Bill Sirois reviewed the
Moving Forward with Transit Oriented Communities presentation found in
the Planning and Development Committee Meeting Packet for October 7,
2014. The presentation included a brief history of Transit Oriented
Development (TOD) at RTD, the 2010 process, the change from TOD to
Transit Oriented Communities (TOC), and next steps for the TOC Division.
Committee Chair James believes the TOC terminology is great. He also
suggested Pedestrian Oriented Community as a terminology to use. The
latter term explains what the TOC staff is doing in expanding RTD’s role in
these types of projects. Committee Chair James pointed out that the City
and County of Denver (Denver) is becoming pro-active regarding the first
and last mile. He asked staff their perception of the other 30 odd
jurisdictions within the District regarding this topic. Bill Sirois replied that
the emphasis has grown in the last few years. He said that most
jurisdictions seem to be embracing this factor.
Committee Chair James emphasized that there are numerous dimensions
besides transportation and housing to make a community whole. Much of it
is beyond the scope of RTD. He said that RTD has the programs in place to
aid with the job creation aspect.
Director Bagley noted that six years ago, when he started on the Board
alongside Committee Chair James in 2008, TODs were a major concern. He
said that he is thrilled to see the development of the TOD concept. This
development demonstrates the direction of the General Manager and staff’s
ability to work with partners, collaborate, participate, and communicate with
other private and public entities. He mentioned he is very impressed with
what RTD has done in the past six years. He thanked staff for their
outstanding job.

Packet Pg. 23

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 7, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Solano said that a Strategic Plan, as growing documents, are great
for any organizations. He added that the Board of Directors needs to remain
the horse that pulls the cart.

6.C

Director Deadwyler says that it seems like RTD continues to leave out the
low income constituents without really addressing the issue. She said that
RTD needs to try to provide for them; low income and affordable housing
are two different things.
Director Tobiassen noted the degree of difficulty involved in creating a TOD.
He cautioned against RTD patting itself on the back. He noted that the
developer is a key partner in the process as they are the ones who put their
necks on the line through a proposal. He mentioned that some TODs, like
Denver Union Station (DUS), have great support and taxpayers input. He
also said that other developments do not have any other investments
beyond a light rail station. Director Tobiassen said that RTD needs to make
the TOD process predictable in order to set up the developers for success.
He pointed to the Alameda Station project as an example of working
together to achieve success.
Director Anderson noted that from her experience with the City of Arvada
she is very conscious of who does the land use planning and who sets out
the parameters on how developments take place. She thinks the biggest
thing RTD needs to do is collaboration. She recalled that it took a long time
to turn her neighborhood, which used to be a dumping ground, into the
diverse community it is today. She encouraged staff to remember that not
one size fits all when it comes to TOC. She also reminded staff to work
with the community to get projects accomplished.
Director Solano mentioned that his area is still a dumping ground that many
developers do not want to touch. He said there is an area off I-70 and
Colorado Boulevard that is still not annexed to Adams County. He is
concerned that the transportation will be built but the development will not
follow. He said that each area and challenge is unique.
Director Lasater said that he had the privilege of being a presenter during an
Urban Land Institute event. He introduced the TOC concept during his
Packet Pg. 24

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 7, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Rivera-Malpiede congratulated staff on their amazing work. She
recalled that in 2010, when the Board voted on TOD policy, RTD was
restricted to the transportation piece. Moving towards TOC, she said,
represents the respect from, and collaboration with, stakeholders while
opening up the possibilities for the future. She mentioned this process would
move the agency to the next level locally and nationally. She said that as
the Director of Northeast Transportation Connections, the first and last mile
is an exciting step. She asked staff to include the Director for each TOC in
the process. She also asked that the signs/communication in her District be
bilingual. She encouraged staff to address gentrification by including
affordable housing in the RFP.

6.C

presentation. He mentioned that the evolution to a community concept was
well received. He noted that the discussion included participation of 5
developers who had worked on 5 stops along the Southeast corridor.

Director Folska said she was very impressed with staff’s work in particular
the last two years. She asked about details regarding the bridge at the Dry
Creek light rail station. She asked for cost of the bridge and the amount of
parking spaces at the stop. Bill Sirois confirmed with Rick Clarke that the
cost of the bridge was about 4 million dollars. Rick Clarke mentioned that
RTD funded the basic bridge while the developer funded the two extensions.
Phil Washington said that there are about 300 to 400 parking spaces at that
station. He said he will get the exact figure to the Directors. Director
Folska mentioned that some people don’t like to use the bridge as it may
induce vertigo. Bill Sirois noted he had not heard about the possibility of
vertigo for users of the bridge. Director Folska said that even though the
development is so big it still struggles in the walkability and connectivity
aspects. She said she hopes the Alameda project achieves better.
Phil Washington, General Manager, noted that nobody mentioned the WIN
program when referring to the community aspect. RTD’s mindset is to help
people build their own communities. He said this mindset fits into the TOC
concept.
Phil Washington acknowledged the uniqueness of each TOD/C. He said that
collaboration is a given. DUS, for example, had 11 financing tools. He said
that RTD is preparing to do another assessment of TOC functions. He noted
that there needs to be a conversation regarding value capture versus
livability and walkability. This needs to be done on a case by case basis as
proposals are received. Phil Washington said that RTD is avoiding mistakes
made by other agencies when collaborating with developers. He noted RTD
is being diligent in requesting proposals at the right time and making the
right recommendations with regards to disposition of property.
Director Folska agreed with the value capture concept. She said that RTD
must find the nexus/sweet spot where they intersect.

Packet Pg. 25

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 7, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lasater mentioned that the DTC is nearly 50 years old and needs to
be redeveloped. He said the area needs that first and final mile connectivity.
He reiterated that collaboration is crucial and critical as there needs to be
sensitivity towards all the elements of the process. Bill Sirois mentioned
that for the past six years staff has had conversations with the Jones
University Development at Dry Creek regarding connectivity. Director
Lasater thanked staff for their work.

6.C

Committee Chair James recaptured the conversation by asking which is
more valuable: money or feeling good.

• Alameda Bus Barn Property Disposition Plan

Phil Washington, General Manager, added that staff would like to work on
an accelerated timeline for this RFP, making it available in 30 days. The
deadline for proposals would be 45-60 days from when made available.
RTD would like to bring several stakeholders, including Denver, to review the
proposals. He noted that one of the requisites for the RFP is connectivity
from the site to the Alameda station.
Marla Lien, General Counsel, added that the RFP is needed to keep the
agency safe while providing fairness to the developer community. She said
that RTD has developed trust and a great reputation with the business
community. RTD’s process allows for all developers to have the same
access to the available information.
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager of Transit Oriented Communities, mentioned that
throughout many competitive processes RTD has found unexpected results.
The Arvada station and DUS are examples of what the RFP process can
achieve. He said that D4 Urban’s proposal is great. He added that the fair
and prudent next step is to open up the process.
Committee Chair James asked Kate Iverson to describe the proposed land
use by D4 Urban as well as to name their partners. Kate Iverson said that
D4 Urban proposed a commercial used car dealership. Their partnership is
with Schomp, a MINI cooper dealership. The proposal includes an affordable
housing component with 150 units and office specifications for a second
stage. Committee Chair James asked for clarification on the time frame.
Phil Washington said that the RFP would be released in 30 days. The
proposers would have 60 days to reply.
Director Menten asked for clarification on the third kind of use on the D4
Urban proposal. She also asked for the zoning on the property and if dollar
amounts were included in the proposal. Kate Iverson clarified the third type
of use is office/industrial use. She said the property is zoned for suburban
mixed used, which provides the greatest flexibility under Denver zoning

Packet Pg. 26

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 7, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Kate Iverson, Manager of TOD, reviewed the Bus Barn Property Update
presentation included in the Planning and Development Committee Meeting
packet for October 7, 2014. She said that RTD received an unsolicited
proposal from D4 Urban, the developer working on the Alameda station
project. During the presentation she provided a brief historical background
of the property, including the different reiterations of the 2004 RFP. She
also presented the proposed RFP review criteria.

6.C

Director Menten asked if the Honorable Michael Hancock, Denver Mayor,
had signed the proposed inclusionary housing bill. Kate Iverson replied in the
affirmative. Director Menten followed up by asking the date it would become
effective. Phil Washington said that he was not sure but reminded the
Directors that Denver is one of the partners that will be asked for
participation and feedback.
Director Menten said that she would like to see the property as a job
creation parcel. She added that she would prefer the property to not be tied
to subsidies.
Director Bagley agreed with the comments made by Marla Lien and Phil
Washington about proprietary activity and transparency. He said that an
RFP process protects the agency. He added that if D4 Urban wins the
proposal then this project will be added to their partnership with RTD.
Director Bagley referred to other proposals for the Eagle P3 Project and how
financial amounts were not disclosed before the proposals were received.
He added that local governments are the ones who decide land use. He
ended his remarks by reiterating the importance of how RTD acts in the
public arena.
Director Deadwyler noted that she had heard rumors regarding this proposal.
Some people advocated for exclusive negotiations with D4 Urban. She does
not agree with this position but asked why staff had not made an exclusive
negotiation with D4 Urban since these type of negotiations have been done
in the past. Phil Washington answered that each proposal is different. RTD
happens to know there are other parties interested in developing the
property. He said that an exclusive negotiation would not make sense for
this property. Kate Iverson explained that there were previous exclusive
negotiations with D4 Urban for the Alameda Station project as they
controlled the private streets adjacent to the station. Director Deadwyler
thanked staff for the explanation. She added that for this and most projects
RFPs are a great idea. She said that she would hate to think RTD would do
exclusive negotiations on all properties. She also added that she can see
why exclusive negotiations would make sense for some projects.
Director Folska asked for the appraised value of the Bus Barn property. Bill
Sirois said that in 2004 the property was appraised at $3 million. Phil
Packet Pg. 27

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 7, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

code: from big box retailer to high density housing up to 12 stories. She
added that looking at the comps the best use for income is auto oriented.
Marla Lien said that the amounts included in the proposal at this point are
confidential. After the RFP process, all the amounts will become public.
Director Menten clarified that she just wanted to know if there were
amounts included in the proposal.

6.C

Washington added that the appraisal will be updated as part of the RFP
process.

Director Folska asked for clarification on the exclusive negotiation term and
process. She asked if, for example, 50 people respond to the RFP, then
RTD would enter into an exclusive negotiation with the winner. Kate
Iverson said that an exclusive negotiation involves RTD not putting a
property for sale so the developer that has made the proposal can move
forward knowing that their investment is in good faith. The RFP process
includes contractual negotiations. These are two distinct processes. Marla
Lien added that RTD negotiates with the winner of the RFP. If a contract
cannot be consummated, RTD would go out for proposals again. Director
Folska asked how many times RTD has gone into exclusive negotiations.
She asked specifically about the Big Mike Dealership in Aurora. Susan Altes
replied that the property Director Folska was inquiring about was part of the
real property pilot disposition program. The program suggested ways to sell
four different pieced of property. For the involving the Big Mike Dealership,
the Board recommended consulting the adjacent owners so the property did
not go through an RFP process.
Director Lasater said that he, like Director Anderson, has experience working
with municipal government development. He said that several projects have
resembled phasings or take outs. He noted that it sounded like something
similar happened in 2004 on the east and west rail lines. Kate Iverson
clarified that the RFP mentioned in the presentation for 2004 only included
the Bus Barn property. The RFP did undergo different reiterations.
Director Lasater added that there were many factors to be taken into
consideration. He said that phasing/take down of land ownership opens up
the possibility for a developer to have to come back at a later date for more
property.
Director Lasater pointed out that many properties have natural elements that
make the land not suited for development. He said that the Bus Barn has a
man-made element, the rail.

Director Folska asked if D4 Urban has employed WIN participants on the
Alameda project. Phil Washington said that they have employed WIN
participants. He said he was not sure of the percentage. Phil Washington
also added that RTD would expect the winner of the Bus Barn RFP to
participate in the WIN program. Director Folska asked how many WIN
participants were employed on the DUS project and the other TODs. Phil
Washington said that he did not have the figures for DUS. He mentioned
that the WIN program did not exist when some of the TODs were
constructed, for example, Dry Creek.

Director Lasater addressed the affordable housing issue brought up by
Director Deadwyler. He said that the average household income in Denver is
$59 thousand, making it about $3500/$3600 a month. It is not low end but
about double the minimum wage. Affordable housing requires occupants to
make no more than 60% of the average household income amount. He
mentioned he liked the idea of mixed housing in a project, but in order to
make housing affordable you need to keep land affordable. He said that
another way for the Board to look at the matter is to make it a balanced
community on the RFP process. He said all these points are important to
take into consideration when moving forward with the project as a whole
instead of fragments.
Marla Lien assured the Board that staff, alongside economic consultants, will
reduce any financial proposals to net present value (NPV) in order to give the
board an apples-to-apples comparison.
Director Tobiassen said that he liked what Director Lasater said. He also
agreed with Director Bagley in that RTD does not do land use planning. This
is the responsibility of our partners, in this case, Denver. Director Tobiassen
mentioned his phone conversation with Denver Councilmember Chris Nevitt.
Councilmember Nevitt said that Denver has an interest in affordable housing
when it is close to transit due to the gentrification Denver has seen in recent
years. RTD can influence the creation of affordable housing near stations,
but it is not a requirement from the agency. The partners, in this case
Denver, may request us to make affordable housing a high scoring factor. He
said that RTD needs to get Denver’s input on this project to make sure the
RFP are scored according to their interests. Phil Washington agreed with
Director Tobiassen regarding compatibility with Denver. He added that staff
is asking for a head nod from the Board on their recommendation to take the
unsolicited proposal to competition through an RFP process. Director
Tobiassen said that if this matter was up for a vote, he would recommend
RTD be in communication with Denver. Phil Washington said that staff has
done so.

Director Lasater noted that short and long term income opportunities should
be taken into consideration when looking into an RFP versus a stage 2 of a
project. The presentation indicated that the consultant said that it would be
a one-time money use with no residual income. Director Lasater believes
that RTD should be moving the opposite way: creating connectivity to the
development in order to increase ridership. This would follow the ULI model
of live, work, play, and shop in the community. He noted that the
walkability of the area is scary.

6.C

Director Hoy said that an unsolicited proposal had to go through the
unsolicited proposal policy. Phil Washington clarified that real estate does
not fall under the unsolicited proposal policy.
Director Hoy added that connectivity to the Alameda station should be
scored high for this project. By not asking specifically for a bridge, the RFP
would leave it open to developers’ creativity.

Director Walker said that during Rail-Volution one of the messages was that
highways destroyed neighborhoods and transit is putting them back
together. He noted the importance for the agency to get the best proposal.
Director Anderson told staff that she gives them her head nod to move
forward with the RFP process.
Director Rivera-Malpiede agreed to move forward with the RFP process. She
added that D4 Urban’s proposal is intriguing. She believes it is RTD’s due
diligence to move towards the RFP process. She considers the connectivity
portion important because the community needs it.
Director Daly stressed that a bridge is essential in the area as the Santa
Fe/Alameda neighborhood is not walkable.
Committee Chair James said that he has had the same conversations with
Councilmember Nevitt, who expressed his preference for a bridge and
affordable housing in the development. Committee Chair James recognized
the need to balance the revenue and affordable housing aspects. He said he
respects the idea of the RFP process as this is a different situation from
across the tracks.

D. Other Matters
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, informed the Board that
RTD has been awarded $5 million from the Federal Transit Agency’s (FTA) Ladders
of Opportunity program. The application was made in partnership with CDOT.
Denver and the City of Aurora supported the application. The grant is for near term
transit priority project improvements on Colfax between Broadway and Potomac.
He clarified that the grant is not part of Denver’s Colfax Corridor Connections
project. The grant will improve bus operations and station amenities along Colfax.
It will be complementary to Denver’s longer term improvements. Bill Van Meter
said that staff will provide a more comprehensive update at a future meeting.

Director Walker mentioned he is in favor of going forward with the RFP
process. He added that developers know what kind of projects they are
getting into when submitting proposals. He said that a key factor for this
RFP is working with Denver, recognizing the importance of this parcel.

6.C

Committee Chair James thanked staff for submitting the application. He said both
he and Director Deadwyler are happy to see this project happening.
Director Bagley reminded the Directors of the General Manager’s Performance
Survey sent over email. He said the survey is due on October 20th. The General
Manager’s Oversight and Performance Committee will meet on October 28th to
review the results.

Director Walker acknowledged the effectiveness of the bus stops improvements
along Broadway. He said the bus ride is becoming longer due to increased
ridership. He mentioned that walkability within the Denver City limits along
Broadway has improved. He invited staff to consult with him if they need advice
on other matters that are working almost right since he rides the bus every day.

• 2015 Salaried Benefit Plans (Howerter/Sprague)
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the 2015 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan
and authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into agreements
with the Insurance Carriers.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the October 28, 2014
Board Meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, noted that any
changes in benefits are brought to the Board for approval. This
allows staff to budget properly. He introduced Cherie
Sprague, Senior Manager for Human Resources. She
explained that there is a slight increase of approximately 10%
in the self-funded plan due to a number of large claims. Cherie
Sprague explained the details of the chart included in the
Financial Impact section on page 8 of the Financial
Administration and Audit Committee Meeting packet for

Director Folska asked where the project was timeline wise.
George Hovey said that currently staff is working on
technological and administrative functions. A testing
environment will be launched on November 1st. This
environment, he said, will test the anticipated volume. George
Hovey added that the final launch is still projected for summer
of 2016. Terry Howerter noted that more information will be
included in the quarterly update.

October 21, 2014. Terry Howerter also noted that there will
be an employee contribution increase of 10%.

Terry Howerter asked Cherie Sprague to address the Stop-Loss
coverage on the self-funded plans. Cherie Sprague explained
that one of the ways to protect the District is by purchasing
stop-loss insurance. This is a level of claim above which the
insurance will pay the remaining cost. The level on the
salaried contract is $150,000. The level on the represented
contract is $400,000.
Director Anderson asked if the represented employees have a
way to increase their wellness and health aside from the
insurance costs. Cherie Sprague answered that all RTD
employees have access to a very robust wellness program and
staff. She said that the represented workforce has a number
of opportunities through classes, safety tips, wellness
programs, sports programs, and in-house physical therapy (PT)
for anyone with a PT prescription. The in-house PT has
reduced the agency’s net claim costs. Cherie Sprague added
that next year the wellness department will launch onsite
health clinics which will provide additional benefits to both
salaried and represented employees.
Chair Sisk asked Cherie Sprague what the insurance increase
was for 2014. Cherie Sprague said it was a minimal increase
of 5%.
Chair Sisk asked Cherie Sprague what the plan is to avoid
such a high number of claims. Cherie Sprague said that the
plan is to provide more communication and education on
health clinics, proactive disease management, and clinics as
alternatives to the ER. She provided background on the current
plans provided by Cigna and Kaiser. She said staff does
regular Requests for Proposals (RFPs). RTD is interested in the
strongest network with the deepest discount as well as
customer service needs and management. Cherie Sprague
said that the plans chosen by RTD are very competitive. She
added that staff looks at utilization. She noted that on the
Packet Pg. 38

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 21, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Solano asked how the salaried plan differed from the
represented plan in both coverage and cost. Cherie Sprague
said the costs are different due to higher utilization on the
represented end. She said the design and co-pays of the plans
are pretty much identical.

6.E

Director Solano asked if the represented employees had a
higher contribution percentage due to the physicality of their
jobs. Committee Chair Walker reminded the Directors that the
motion in discussion regards insurance coverage for salaried
employees. He asked that the question and discussion remain
on this topic.
Director Hoy asked for the difference between self-funded and
self-insured. Cherie Sprague replied that even though the
terms are used interchangeably, they are different. Selffunded insurance is one end of the spectrum where the
employer pays all the premiums. Self-insured is the other end
of the spectrum where a third party pays the premiums.
Director Hoy asked if RTD had any way to control the benefits
the employee receives. He asked specifically about employee
behavior modification on claims. Cheri Sprague answered that
there were some modifications to the contract, including a
higher ER copay to encourage other options.
Director Deadwyler asked for clarification on alternatives to
the ER as this may force employees to go out of plan. Cherie
Sprague said that there are 24 hour health clinics within the
District for employees to use. Data shows that employees
have been using the ER instead of 24/7 health clinics. Cherie
Sprague said that within the Kaiser insurance employees are
expected to use Kaiser. She added that within Cigna there are
in-network and out-of-network options. Cherie Sprague
pointed out that within both insurance plans employees have
stayed within network, meaning that employees understand
their plan’s rules. She noted that the ER issue was prevalent
on the Cigna side.
Cheri Sprague explained the new fees under Affordable Care
Act (ACA) found on the Financial Impact section.
Director Deadwyler asked if the ACA fees were something
new for 2015. Cherie Sprague replied that there are new
requirements added on each year. These are the requirements

represented side most of the utilization was emergency room
(ER) visits. The diseases that most affect the represented
employees are diabetes and heart conditions. Cherie Sprague
said that the diseases that affect the salaried employees the
most are cancer and heart disease.

for 2015. Others will be added on 2016, 2017, and 2018.
She said that each of those instances will have an impact on
the Agency’s costs.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED.

• Certification of the 2015 contribution for the RTD Salaried Employees'
Retirement Plans (Howerter)
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors certifies a 2015 contribution to RTD’s Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”), which pays a
specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors certifies a 2015 contribution to the Salaried
Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan Trust (the “DC Plan”), which
contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment, at a
percent of each participant’s eligible compensation.
Motion:

Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the October
28, 2014 Board Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, explained that the RTD
Board of Directors closed the Defined Benefit Pension Trust
(DB Plan) to new employees with hired date of January 1,
2008. Employees hired on and after this date are under the
Defined Contribution Plan (DC). From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan have been
funded on a 9% of salaries basis.
Terry Howerter added that for the DB Plan the Board could
continue to approve a fixed contribution amount of $3.1
million and be fully funded in 2028 or fund it at the Actuary
Recommended Contribution amount of $5.7 million and be
fully funded in 2024.

• Proposed 2015 Fiscal Policy Statement (Howerter/Scarpino)
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
that the Board of Directors approves and adopts the 2015 Fiscal Policy
Statement.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the October 28, 2014
Board Meeting.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, introduced Jannette
Scarpino, Manager for Budget and Financial Analysis.
Jannette reviewed the redlined 2015 Fiscal Policy Statement
included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
Meeting Packet for October 21, 2014.
Jannette Scarpino pointed out the main two changes in the
document:
 On page 19, the phrase “or to mitigate service
disruptions as a result of economic downturns affecting
revenue” was added for clarity.
 On page 22, a new bullet point was added to the
Budget Policies, “exclusion of the non-cash portion of
long-term unfunded pension accruals.” This addition
will not impact the fund balance.
The remaining changes are clarifications in wording.
Director Folska asked if an example for the addition on page
19 would be taking the $60 million from the fund balance for
buying Right of Way and putting it somewhere else. Jannette

Scarpino replied that this could potentially happen. She
envisions staff asking the Board to use fund balances in the
event where the unrestricted balance goes to zero and there is
no cushion to support any downturns or economic difficulties.
Staff would look to the Board to approve use of the Capital
Acquisition fund balance and/or the Board Appropriated fund
balance if RTD found itself in a difficult economic situation.
Director Folska asked if there would be a differentiation
between capital projects, such as FasTracks, and base
operations. Jannette Scarpino replied that in the case of an
economic downtown, staff will use all resources available to
fund operations and maintain service levels.
Director Tobiassen asked for an explanation on the use of
“enterprise funds” as changed on page 23. Jannette Scarpino
said that under government accounting terms RTD is
considered an enterprise fund because the Agency is
operations oriented. Terry Howerter added that any entity
expected to support itself, for example water and golf courses
are considered enterprise funds. Others, like police and fire
departments, are funded by the corresponding government’s
general fund. Director Tobiassen noted that water, for
example, is fee based, not tax based, thus not needing a
Board for decisions. Marla Lien, General Counsel, clarified that
Colorado’s Tax Payer Bill of Rights (TABOR) created its own
definition of an enterprise fund. This definition can be found
on Article X, Section 20. Marla Lien said that what Jannette
Scarpino is referring to is the Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles’ (GAAP) definition of enterprise funds. Director
Tobiassen thanked Marla Lien for the clarification.
Director Menten asked staff to go over the other changes in
the document as the document on her electronic device was
not showing the red lines. Terry Howerter said the first
change was changing the word “increases” to “adjustments”
as this more accurately reflected the nature of fare
adjustments. He said there were 5 or 6 similar changes
throughout the document. Staff provided Director Menten
with a redlined copy of the document.
Director Menten asked if staff had an update on the pension
crisis regarding the represented employees. Marla Lien noted
that there is a difference between the legal and the accounting
requirements. RTD has fulfilled all of its contractual legal
requirements to fund the represented pension fund. Marla Lien

Director Menten asked if on the represented side RTD says
that it has fulfilled its obligation and the rest of the problem is
for the Unions to deal with. Marla Lien said that RTD can say
yes to the first part of the question. Terry Howerter said that
every payday there is a 9% expense of all the salaried wages
on the salaried side to fund the pension commitment. Every
payday there is a 12% expense of all union wages on the
represented side to fulfill the Collective Bargaining Agreement
(CBA) obligations. He said that the long term liability is being
worked off.
Director Solano asked if private and public accounting
principles are different. Jannette Scarpino answered in the
affirmative. She said that RTD follows GAAP principles. He
pointed out his concern in relation to revenue and high
efficiency when it comes to public versus private entities.

Jannette Scarpino, Manager for Budget and Financial Analysis, reviewed the
2015 Budget Update included in the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee Meeting packet for October 21, 2014. The presentation
included the budget theme: Building Fiscal Responsibility. It also addressed
assumptions, challenges, and next steps. She reminded the Board that the

Packet Pg. 43

said that GAAP has determined that governmental entities
have to report the pension liability whether they are
contractually obligated to pay it or not. RTD has taken this up
with GAAP on the salaried pension fund because it is a direct
commitment of the Board. If there is an unfunded liability, the
Board will be liable. Terry Howerter added that staff tracks
both expenses and the long term requirement to recognize any
unfunded liability for GAAP purposes.

2015 Requested Budget update was presented to the Directors during the
September 30, 2014 Study Session.

Director Folska said that in the State of Colorado there is a consistency of
budgets decreasing at about 6% while the cost of salary and benefits
increases. She added that it would be a good idea to look at worst case
scenarios which could project how this discrepancy would work in practical
terms. Jannette Scarpino reminded Director Folska that the Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) is a 6 year forecast from 2015-2020 which incorporates
the CU Leeds School forecast. The unrestricted balance in the SBP will be
positive. Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, added that the chart on
slide 6 refers to growth over the passing of time. Director Folska noted that
this meant the Sales and Use Tax revenue would accelerate at the same rate
of change that it decreases. Terry Howerter said that was correct.
Director Bagley said that the Sales and Use Tax Revenue Growth slide
presented is a great slide. He noted that Director Folska’s questions were
very pertinent. He said that the information on this slide is important for
future Boards to understand as the Sales and Use Tax revenue accounts for
59% of the total revenue. He said that future Boards need to be sensitive to
this issue in the next years.
Director Solano said that staff did a great job with the presentation. He
asked staff to explain why the forecast does not foresee any increases in
fares while an earlier recommended action asked for a vote based on fare
increase. Terry Howerter said that the Xerox contract request was mostly
for software changes to support the Smart Card infrastructure, including
cyber security for customers. The fare increase change was a small
percentage included in order to be proactive in implementing any changes as
quickly as possible. No fare changes have been modeled since nothing has
been proposed by the Fare Task Force.
Director Folska asked what staff is doing to invest in providing a very robust
cyber-security system across the agency. She noted that staff may not have
the answer right away; however, she is interested on cyber-security beyond
website: trains, buses, scheduling, etc. Terry Howerter said that he cannot

Director Folska noted that it is important for the Board and the Agency to
recognize the anticipated decrease in Sales and Use Tax revenue. She said
that according to slide 6 of the update, the CU Leeds School projected Sales
and Use Tax revenue at 3% by the year 2020. The Sales and Use Tax
revenue funds 58% of RTD’s operations. Jannette Scarpino said that was a
correct statement based on the forecast. She also noted that forecasts tend
to change as time progresses and economists incorporate more actuals into
their numbers. Jannette Scarpino said that the actual for 2014 is at 9%.

provide all the information. He did mention that there is a new cybersecurity officer that is working on the Information Technology end of all
cyber-security issues.

• August 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod, Manager of Financial Reporting, reviewed the August 2014
Monthly Financial Status Report included in the Financial Administration and
Audit Committee meeting packet for October 21, 2014. The report includes
ridership, fare revenue, and Sales and Use Tax revenue as well as other
financial statements.
Director Folska asked for the annual interest expense percentage. She noted
that this amount is important because there are so many moving pieces.
She added that fare box revenue and Sales and Use Tax revenue are
decreasing while interests are increasing. She said this information would
help create a holistic view. Doug MacLeod said that on the presentation it
was divided into base operations and FasTracks interests. The annual
interest expense on the base operations is $26 million, 5.8% of the base
operations budget. The annual interest expense for FasTracks is $71
million, 56% of expenses.
Director Lubow mentioned that she remembered reading that the national
ridership trend is flat or decreasing. Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer,
said that he does not have any figures but that he is aware of an upward
trend. Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, added
that at the APTA Annual Conference ridership was discussed to be at an alltime high. RTD’s August boarding figures are also at an all-time high. Staff
continues to see increases. Director Lubow said she stood corrected.
Director Lubow asked how staff analyzes trends and how they are
incorporated into the SBP. Terry Howerter said that for SBP purposes trends
are based on Sales and Use Tax projections. He noted that, for example,
the Sales and Use Tax was low during the recession. The economic growth
in recent years has increased that figured. In order to incorporate it into the
SBP staff carries all of this information into a longer term financial plan (30
years). All the known revenue items and known debt payments are
incorporated as well.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 21, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten asked how much parking fees contribute to total revenue.
Dave Genova, Assistant General Manager for Security and Facilities and
acting for General Manager Phil Washington, said that there will be a parking
update during the Operations and Customer Service Committee meeting. He
asked Director Menten to postpone this question until then.

6.E

Director Lubow noted that in order to be proactive we need to include
revenue forecast into what we do in operations for the 6 year plan. Terry
Howerter agreed, saying that it is a 6 year plan and a 30 year model. He
added that every time a new service is incorporated these items are taken
into consideration by staff. He said that staff is very thorough.

Motion:

Director Anderson moved to call for the orders
of the day.
There was no second to the motion.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion FAILED but noted.
Committee Chair Walker said that it was important to note that percentage
of growth does not mean dollar amounts.
Director Folska said that the SBP, aside from the General Manager Oversight
Committee chaired by Director Bagley, is the most critical subject the Board
handles. She encourages detailed questions on the matter. She would not
support the motion made by Director Anderson.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley reminded the Directors to complete the General Manager Oversight
survey sent via email.
Director Solano mentioned that he attended the APTA Annual Conference. He said
that it was a great conference in which General Manager Phil Washington was
inducted as APTA Chair. Director Solano said that during the Expo he met a
gentleman who invented a technology called zone defense. This technology is used
by Amtrak to stop or slow the train in case of fauna on the tracks. He wondered if
this was something that RTD has used and/or explored.

Howerter said that the SBP includes dollar amounts per year but not
percentages. He added that the percentages may be valuable in further
discussions. Director Lubow said that she would love to have percentages
on the next discussion.

B. Recommended Actions

• Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy
It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve the implementation of the Fare Disparate Impact and
Disproportionate Burden Policy.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the October 28, 2014
Board Meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Michael Washington, Title VI Manager, explained that in
compliance with Federal Transit Administration (FTA) policy,
RTD solicited public feedback on the policy during the Fare
Study Problem Identification phase. He noted that the policy
is an FTA basic requirement.
Director Lubow said that nothing seems to be looking at how
people of lower income would be impacted by a fare increase
under FTA requirements. She posed an example of a $1 fare
increase and how this would infinitely affect lower income
people more than higher income people. She asked when and
how under the federal analysis does RTD as an agency starts
caring about this matter. Michael Washington replied that FTA
requirements do care very much about this matter. Any
proposed fare increase would be examined against the
Packet Pg. 49

Director Lasater dialed in for the Operations and Customer Service committee meeting.

6.F

Director Lubow supposed as an example a dollar increase
proposal. This is found to have disproportionate impact. She
asked if that would mean local fares may change but regional
fares would not. Michael Washington said that this is true.
He noted that there are different degrees at which minorities
and low income people use different fare rates. To do a $1
increase across the board would still create disproportionate
impact. This type of increase would not be advisable.
Director Lubow asked if the federal analysis would then not
look at the dollar figure. Michael Washington affirmed that
federal analysis would not look at the dollar figure. Federal
analysis would look at the community impacted by the
percentage. He said that equity as defined by Title VI looks at
the proportion of the minority population that is impacted. If
they are not impacted by fare change technically it is not a
violation of the law. Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede
requested that Director Lubow take any further questions for
staff offline.
Director Solano stated that this issue is a complex dilemma.
He noted that it needs to be weighed against revenue and
efficiency/inefficiency. He said he looks at the need because
he serves a number of low income people in his District. He
said that there is a balance that needs to be addressed.
Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede called on Director Lubow
and asked her to keep her comments brief. Director Lubow
agreed with Director Solano’s point. She said that this issue
goes beyond Title VI requirements into what RTD thinks is fair.

percentage of low income people using that fare media. If low
income usage is at a 5% rate or higher, it would be considered
a disproportionate impact and the fare change proposal needs
to be revised.

C. Updates

• ADA Update

When discussing the new positions, Kenn Hardin pointed out that the ADA
Coordinator would work in the Civil Rights Division. The ADA Liaison
Officers would each work in the Bus Operations Division and the Fixed Bus
Route/Paratransit Contracted Services Division.
Kenn Hardin noted that Chair Sisk and Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede
suggested creating a brochure to promote the ADA services offered. Kenn
Hardin asked the Directors familiar with the ADA program to provide quotes
for the brochure. Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede asked the Directors to
provide the quotes to Paula Perdue, Executive Director of the Board Office.
Director Folska said that she applauds the integration of ADA policy into all
the Divisions. She noted that civil rights are for all humans. With regard to
employment issues, she recommended the following resources:
 Kathleen Martinez, Assistant Secretary of the Office of Disability
Employment Policy at the U.S. Department of Labor, who is blind
 Rebecca Cokley, Executive Director of the National Council of
Disabilities
 Geoffrey Ames, Accessibility Implementation Consultant at Meeting
the Challenge, Inc.
Director Menten asked if any of the positions were required by the FTA
regulations. She also inquired regarding the full time or part time status and
salary of the positions. Kenn Hardin said that the 3 positions are not
required by the Federal government. He said that all three positions would
be full time. The ADA Coordinator position is the only position that has
been defined. Kenn Hardin said he would get the salary figure of that
position to the Directors. He noted that the other two positions are still in
development and do not have a salary figure attached.
Director Menten pointed out the West line stations and Denver Union Station
misses in design regarding ADA. She asked if one of the positions would be
looking at assisting in future designs. Kenn Hardin replied that the ADA
Coordinator will be involved with all the Divisions, including Planning.

Packet Pg. 51

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 21, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Kenn Hardin, Senior Manager for Civil Rights, reviewed the American with
Disabilities Act (ADA) update included in the Civil Rights Committee meeting
packet for October 21, 2014. He reminded the Directors that the last ADA
update was presented during the February 11, 2014 Civil Rights Committee
meeting. The update included the creation of 3 new positions as well as
communications, compliance, and training.

Director Tobiassen expressed his thanks to the staff. He said that RTD
provides a superb transit system that involves civil rights and ADA. He cited
a recent experience helping his brother-in-law navigate the Colorado Springs
transit system, which he said was very challenging. He said RTD allows
people with disabilities to be independent. Kenn Hardin stated that it begins
with the work of many of the Divisions. He said that it start with the
leadership and actions of the Board, the General Manager, and the Senior
Leadership Team. He expressed his thanks to Bruce Abel, Assistant General
Manager for Bus Operations, and his team for always being willing to work
and coordinate. Kenn Hardin said that it takes a while to build a program of
this nature. He asked the Directors for patience and understanding as the
Agency goes through this growth process.
Director Anderson agreed with Director Menten on the many ADA misses
along the West line, specifically at the Federal Center Station. Director
Anderson said that the benches are too far away from the train. She
suggested staff would visit the Federal Center station with a person who
needs a cane for mobility to see what improvements could be made.
Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that she was very pleased to see the ADA
projects moving forward. She commended Kenn Hardin, his team, and the
Agency for their work. She agreed with her Director colleagues in that RTD
is a needed entity to provide independence.

D. Other Matters
Director Deadwyler addressed the article published in the Denver Post earlier in the
week regarding diversity at Denver Union Station (DUS). She said that the reply by
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, was great explaining
the inaccuracies with the lease and renovation approvals, among other details.
Director Deadwyler, however, felt that the reply missed the point the article was
trying to make about diversity at DUS. She said that the Board directed staff when
making the contract with USA to keep DUS available for the average Joe. She
wondered if RTD should have been overseeing the contract to make sure it carried
out the Board wishes. Scott Reed stated that his email to the author noted the lack
of accuracy in his statements on what RTD had control over and the changes that
could have been made given the historical designation of the property. He said that
it was not his place to comment on any suppositions and observations.
Director Deadwyler said that this article raises the diversity issue. She said that
several of her constituents have mentioned that they do not go to DUS because
they feel it is not for them. She reiterated her question regarding who was
responsible on the RTD side to ensure that the things the Board had in mind were
addressed. Marla Lien, General Counsel, replied that construction employed WIN
program participants. She stated that RTD specified that the main level needed to
be open to the public with seating available at all times and no hotel functions.
RTD set the times when the building opened and closed. RTD did not discuss price

6.F

Director Folska said that this was an opportunity for RTD to differentiate its brand
form the Crawford hotel as the operator has a 99 year lease. Scott Reed stated
that was the point he made when he first talked to the reporter. He pointed out
that RTD has no control over the points he addressed.
Director Walker agreed that it is not in RTD’s or Scott Reed’s place to comment on
what others think. He believes Scott Reed’s reply was great and to the extent of
his job.
Director Solano mentioned that hindsight is 20/20. He noted that past Boards were
not diverse and their decisions have been implemented. It is up to the current
Board to move forward. He stated that he advocates for more people of color to
take office. He referred to an article on the Westword which stated that people
move to Denver for the diversity. People enjoy the places along Federal Boulevard
due to its diversity. He agreed with Director Deadwyler in that DUS is out of range
for many, including himself. He suggested getting minorities on the Board and
others that look after minorities.
Director Lubow said that the Directors need to look at the bigger picture. If indeed
it is true that this big project turned out to have an air of exclusivity, the Directors
need to ask what can be done so that this does not happen again, avoiding the
finger pointing. She stated she feels the same way about handicap access.
Chair Sisk said it is unfair for the current Board to criticize past Board and staff
members. He agreed with Director Lubow that this may be an opportunity for the
Board and staff to be more inclusive; the Board and staff can always do a better
job. He pointed out that DUS is a project we can all be proud of. He said that as
members of the Board we are to be proud of all the components of the District:
DUS, Denver International Airport, Federal, etc. He said that criticizing is not
useful.
Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede took a point of privilege since DUS is in her
District. She said that she was on the Board that voted for all the DUS elements.
She stated that as a Latina she took to heart and a very public stand that this was
the living room of the community. She said that she had never worked with such a
caring, diverse, and willing group of people. She is very proud to have served with
Packet Pg. 53

settings, leasing, nor the ownership structure. It was always known that the hotel
would be a 4 to 5 star hotel. Marla Lien reaffirmed that everything approved by the
Board had been implemented. Director Deadwyler remembered Dana Crawford
sitting on the front row of Board meetings assuring the Directors that it would be a
participation-by-all place. She said that both Dana Crawford and USA made
promises that were not kept. She said that RTD missed the boat in including
participation of all cultures. She pointed out that if people do not feel comfortable
it is not the people’s house. Director Deadwyler said that if this continues we
would see people being thrown out of the building because they do not fit in.

those who worked for the betterment of the whole community. Committee Chair
Rivera-Malpiede said that diversity was approached not only by ethnicity, but in
history. She noted that Golda Meir walked through DUS and that this history
belongs to the entire community. She pointed out that she sits at the DUS living
room every Sunday to read and watch the community. She noted her lunch is a $5
hot dog and drink, which is pretty affordable. Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede
stated that she listens to the stories told by people of all ethnicities. She has met
young adults that bring their grandparents back so they could see DUS again. She
said that DUS is a real treasure and believes the author of the article missed the
point. Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede considers DUS the Jewel of the West.
From her observations on a weekly basis, she sees that the community feels part of
it.

B. Recommended Actions

• January 2015 Service Changes
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the January 2015 Service Change package
as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost
of approximately $647,200 and, further, to authorize the General Manager
or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private
operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
Committee Chair Lubow explained to the Board that since this evenings
Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet was published
on Friday, staff has made some changes in the wording of the
Recommended Action. She asked Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations, to read the revised language into the record.
Bruce Abel noted that staff has been in continuous conversations related to
the three Call-n-Rides that were being considered for cancellation. He said
that staff has reached an agreement for each of these Call-n-Rides to
support the continuance of service. He stated that the continuance of the
Call-n-Rides changed the Recommended Action to the following:
“It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee
that the Board of Directors approve the January 2015 Service Change
package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an
annualized cost of approximately $969,000 and, further, to authorized the

General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as
necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these
changes.”
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item
with the amended changes to the full Board at
the October 28, 2014 Board meeting.

Discussion:

Jessie Carter, Senior Manager of Service Planning and
Scheduling, shared that five public hearings were held with
nearly 200 people participating. The majority of the
comments related to service along Morrison Road in the
Westwood neighborhood, bus traffic in lower Downtown, and
the proposed cancellation of the Call-n-Rides. Jessie Carter
pointed out that the Board Report includes a look ahead
outlining items currently under consideration during the next
service change period which are:
 Service along Morrison Road in the Westwood
neighborhood
 Optimization of W-Line (Light Rail) peak period service
 Civic Center Station construction detours
Jessie Carter noted that highlighted in yellow in the Board
Report are a number of changes staff is recommending as a
result of the public comment process.
Director Bagley commended the staff that worked with
Douglas County in creating a proposal to avoid the
cancellation of the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride. He
recognized Eugene Howard, Douglas County Transit Mobility
Program Manager, for his extensive participation in working
toward a resolution in addition to the Douglas County
Commissioner and staff. Director Bagley knows that by
reaching out to not only Douglas County but also the
Highlands Ranch Community, RTD can work in conjunction
with the stakeholders to create a better Call-n-Ride. He
believes that this Call-n-Ride can become a model for future
Call-n-Rides that are on the edge of RTD’s metro area. He
reiterated how appreciative he is for what staff has done and
looks forward to continuing his participation in making this

“Joan owned a car until last month. Two months ago she
took a workshop on safe driving for seniors and realized it was
probably not best for her to drive as she had pretty serious leg
pain. She began inquiring about the Call-n-Ride bus. She was
pleased about being able to go to shopping locations and the
pharmacy and decided her kids could pick her up for other
family events. But it was extremely important to her to
continue on her bowling team. Once she figured out that she
could have a weekly subscription to and from bowling she was
“sold”. Today at a meeting she stated “I have never felt so
free”. “I have no car repairs, no insurance and no worries”.
Then she said “it gives me goose bumps” and rubbed her
arms. Followed by “I can’t talk anymore, it just feels great!”
She said that several other people on her team asked her
about the bus so she will be bringing flyers to them.”
Director Menten asked for more information about the looking
ahead section regarding the optimization of W-Line peak period
service. Jessie Carter explained that there have been a
number of changes, one of which is to include the removal of
one all day train on the W-Line; that has presented some
challenges to the operations department. He said that staff
also needs to further look at ridership on the W-Line and
optimize the service levels in the peak periods. The concept
would be looking at the level of service going to Federal
Center on the short term trains and looking at reducing that
from 15 minute frequency to every 30 minutes.
Director Menten shared that she has had many personal
communications with constituents regarding the Belmar Call-nRide. She wonders what staff has heard regarding the
proposed discontinuance of the Garrison Flex route. Brian
Matthews, Manager of Special Service, indicated that he has
heard only one comment on the discontinuance of the Garrison
Flex route. He noted that the Garrison Station would be
served by a reservation only Call-n-Ride, which should alleviate
some of the concerns of the local residents.

Director Hoy stated that he came prepared to persuade the
Board to exclude the Federal Heights Call-n-Ride but staff has
already proposed the change. He said he did want to read a
comment he received from a friend of one of the Call-n-Ride
riders that really illustrates the importance of the service RTD
provides:

6.G

Director Anderson commended staff for working with the
community and making changes as they receive input. She
thinks it is very important for our communities to know that
when staff proposes service changes, it is not written in
stone. Director Anderson also commended the Adams County
communities for stepping up and asking DRCOG to use some
additional grant money. She believes that the Federal Heights
Call-n-Ride is really on the way up and hopes it will be as well
used at the Golden Call-n-Ride.
Director Tobiassen echoed Director Anderson’s comments
about how well staff works with the communities and
stakeholders during the public meetings to really try to address
their concerns. He noted that he did receive a lot of cut-andpaste type emails from a group in Downtown Denver but was
unsure as to their concerns. He asked if staff could provide an
overview of their complaint. Jessie Carter explained that the
City of Denver is converting 18th to a two-way street. There
is concern from some of the members of the community that
live on 18th that RTD will be increasing the number of buses
that drive by their homes as we will no longer utilize the
current detour that has certain routes running outbound on
17th and inbound on 18th. He said that there is another portion
of the community that wants RTD to use the new two-way
street, which represents a larger portion of the community.
Director Deadwyler thanked staff for the hard work and efforts
they put in every day to solve any service problems. She
asked for additional details about the increased service for the
15 and 15L. Jessie Carter said that in conducting running
time and load analysis, adjustments were made to add trips
during peak periods. He noted that there would also be an
additional trip added going to Colfax and Tower Road after
7:00 p.m., running around 8:00 p.m.
Director Solano said that he finds it observable that Adams
County would provide for the Federal Heights Call-n-Ride
because that is where the most needy people are. He does
not think other areas need the Call-n-Ride as much.

Director Menten stated that she would be voting no this
evening as she would like to get information about the new
agreements for the Federal Heights, Highlands Ranch and
Parker Call-n-Rides. She indicated she would take this
conversation offline with staff.

6.G

Director Walker wonders if staff shares comments we receive
related to unsafe walking conditions to the appropriate city,
municipality, etc. Jessie Carter stated that staff is in frequent
contact to keep them up-to-date on RTD’s plans and any
comments we receive that might pertain to them.
Committee Chair Lubow shared that she has been receiving
numerous communications from a rider on Route HX about
overcrowding. She wonders if the additional a.m. and p.m.
trips will be a long-term solution to the problem. Jessie Carter
said that staff is hoping this will help but some additional
steps may need to be taken such as adjusting the times of
trips to better address ridership.
Director Lasater echoed Director Bagley’s sentiments related
to the great efforts between staff, Douglas County and the
City of Parker. He shared that about 40 to 50 people showed
up for the public comment meeting in Parker. The Call-n-Ride
was really their only mode of transportation, especially for the
many seniors in the community. He said that the President of
the Parker Senior Center also attended and expressed similar
concerns for his members. Director Lasater also recognized
Eugene Howard for all of his hard work. Director Lasater
stated that Mr. Howard really has a passion for transportation
and will work with RTD and the stakeholders to make the
Parker Call-n-Ride successful.
Bruce Abel thanked all the groups, cities, municipalities, etc.
that are contributing financially, as well as with staff time, to
make the Call-n-Rides sustainable. He said from a staff
perspective they really appreciate the ability to work
collaboratively with the community.

Committee Chair Lubow declared the motion PASSED.

It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that
free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military
should be extended from the presently approved date of December 31, 2014
to December 31, 2015. Utilization has been minimal to date and this
extension will have minimal impact on RTD.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the October 28, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Hoy wondered if there was a reason that this action
was only for one year. He said that he does not see himself
voting no in the foreseeable future and made the motion
extend the free rides for three years. There was no second for
the motion.
Director Tobiassen stated that approving this yearly is a good
opportunity for RTD to remind the active duty members of the
Unites States Military of the benefit and to recognize their
service.
Director Solano shared that his son-in-law and two grandsons
are in the Army; they talk to him all the time about how great
this benefit is. He said that all three asked him to extend their
thanks to the Board.
Director Anderson agrees with Director Tobiassen that it is
good to approve this every year to remind all active duty
Military that they get to ride for free and to extend the Board’s
thanks for their service. The is really a ceremonial process
that the Board does each year.

• Award of Contract for On-Vehicle Advertising
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the
General Manager or his designee be authorized to enter into a contract with
Lamar Advertising of Denver for the three year period January 1, 2015
through December 31, 2017 with a two year option for 2018 and 2019.
Under the terms of the recommended action, Lamar would remit to RTD
either 1) a minimum guarantee of $4.0 million in 2015, $4.1 million in 2016
and $4.2 million in 2017 or 2) seventy percent of net sales, whichever is
greater.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the October 28, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Tony McCaulay, Senior Manager of Marketing, explained that
this contract is for on-vehicle advertising for the interior and
exterior of the buses and light rail cars.
Director Menten pointed out that RTD does a lot of advertising
for our own services. She asked for more information on how
that works. She wonders if a paid advertisement will always
take priority over an RTD ad. Tony McCaulay stated that RTD
reserves a certain percentage of space for our ads as well as
media trades. He noted that there have been rare occasions
where Lamar Advertising has sold their allocation and
approached RTD for more. He explained that typically we do

Director Folska echoed Director Tobiassen and Anderson’s
sentiments. She said it is also a nice way for the Board and
staff to remember the service the Military members provide.

6.G

Director Deadwyler wonders if we have used this vendor
before and what the past revenue has been. Tony McCaulay
said that RTD has been working with Lamar since about 1998
and they bring in about $4.2 million per year. This contract
guarantees RTD a minimum of $4.0 million in 2016 or 70% of
net sales, whichever is greater. Scott Reed, Assistant General
Manager of Communications, noted that the $4.0 million
guarantee is more than Lamar’s current guarantee and
reiterated that RTD could receive more depending on net sales.
Director Deadwyler feels that if they have been exceeding
$4.0 million the guarantee for 2016 should be higher.
Director James informed the Board that he has suggested that
marketing look into a media trade with Colorado Public Radio
(CPR). He asked for a status on his suggestion. Tony
McCaulay said that staff has approached CPR but have not
reached an agreement at this time. He explained that media
trades with public radio can be difficult because they typically
have things like show sponsorships, which is typically worth
more than just a commercial.
Director Solano expressed his support for ads on buses but
has concerns about the articles he has seen where transit
authorities have gone into litigation with religious or political
groups regarding their advertisements. He wonders how much
RTD has spent on litigation in similar scenarios. Marla Lien,
General Counsel, stated that other than her staff salary, RTD
has not spent any money on this type of litigation. She
explained that staff’s efforts to either work with sponsoring
advertisers to fix the ads or determining the ads are within
First Amendment rights has resulted in RTD not being sued.
Tony McCaulay noted that the contract with Lamar
Advertising was only one part of the Request for Proposal
(RFP). The RFP also included advertisements on Access-aRide vehicles as well as in vehicle digital advertisements. He
said that RTD received one proposal for each; staff is
evaluating those proposals and will come to the Board with a
recommendation at a later date.

C. Updates
Bruce Abel thanked the Board for the opportunity to review the Fare Study
this evening. He introduced Lacy Bell, Project Manager for the Fare Study.
They reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board covering the
findings of CH2M Hill to-date as well as a reminder of the principals that
came out of the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force. A copy of the presentation
is available in the October 21, 2014 Operations and Customer Service
Committee Agenda Packet.
Bruce Abel informed the Board that is was very important to note that per
CH2M Hill’s findings, only San Diego puts out an hour of bus service more
cost effectively than RTD and only Pittsburgh does on the paratransit side.
He reminded the Board that there is no direct correlation between fare
increases and ridership. He noted that in 2005-2006, 2007-2008 and
2010-2011 there were fare increases and in every case, ridership also went
up; factors such as cost of fuel, employment, etc. have a significant impact
on ridership as well.
Director Folska pointed out that in many of the instances of fare increase
and ridership increase mentioned by Bruce Abel, these were also during
economic downturns when most people could not afford gas. She wonders
if one of this fare increases is also the same time when RTD cut a great deal
of service. Bruce Abel stated that there was a service reduction in January,
2012. He reiterated the point he was trying to make is that there is more
than just the fare charged that influences transit ridership.
Director Folska inquired if CH2M Hill has been taking into account other
factors such as the cost of parking, free services such as the 16th Street
Mall Shuttle, etc. Bruce Abel said those are elements that would be looked
at, especially the cost of parking, but had not been addressed yet.
Director Solano expressed concern that staff kept bringing up the idea of
revenue. He reminded the Board that transit agencies do not operate at a
profit, it is about efficiency. He said that it is also important to always
remember the uncertainty of RTD’s revenue.

• Fare Task Force Update

6.G

Director Walker thinks this is very interesting to review. He feels the size of
RTD’s service area compared to others is very surprising when put into
perspective. He said he is looking forward to the next update.
Committee Chair Lubow asked if the study will compare how RTD handles
the availability of discount passes, specifically for low income riders,
compared to other agencies. Bruce Abel said that will be an element looked
at, but at a later phase of the study.
Director Solano shared that he has talked to many people that do not even
have the capacity to apply for the non-profit passes. He believes it is a
dilemma that RTD really needs to look at.

 West Line Parking Management Update (No Back-Up)
Errol Stevens, Parking Management Administrator, reminded the Board that
they approved the addition of the W-Line to the parking management
program back in January, 2014. He said that staff has been in negotiations
with Central Parking, which did take longer than anticipated; however, an
agreement has been reached.
Errol Stevens shared that through Q3 of 2014 the parking management
program had generated a little over $100K in revenues to RTD’s general
fund. This has been the first net revenues to come out of the parking
program because there was a lot of initial infrastructure investment. He said
that there have been 17 new pay stations installed with more being installed
in the next 60 days. The new pay station allows the user to walk up,
determine if they are in or out of District, enter the number of days they will
be parking, and then pay.
Errol Stevens stated that implementation of parking fees for the W-Line
would go into effect on Monday, October 27, 2014. The marketing team
has put notices on the website and social media, distributed flyers and will
also have people at the stations the first day. He said it will be very
interesting to see what happens with the parking as right now 20-25% of
the users are out of District.

Director James commented that as one of the participants of the Fiscal
Sustainability Task Force he appreciates staff bringing up the history for
perspective. He also thanked staff for the inclusion of capital expenditures
in the presentation. It is easy to put off replacing buses and trains in the
interest of expanding ridership or maintaining low fares. He appreciates that
RTD does not do that. Director James also appreciates staff recommending
that we maintain our reserves.

6.G

Director Bagley shared with the Board that he recently visited the Sheridan
and Wadsworth parking structures during mid-day and neither was close to
capacity. He reminded everyone that these structures were built for 30
years from now, not today’s ridership. Director Bagley also believes that
locations that had Park-n-Rides before the rail came will have higher
utilization. Errol Stevens said that both the Southeast and Southwest
corridors saw parking of over 4,000 cars within the first year; on the west
line is it about 1600.
Director Tobiassen commented that he is on the E-470 Board and they have
a fairly significant loss of revenue due to temporary tags. He suggested
staff speak with them about their technology. He said he also hopes that
we are still participating in the State Patrols stolen vehicle program.
Director Daly expressed his continued concern about charging for parking on
the W-Line before the line to DIA is complete. He noted that parking at the
lot that RTD leases from Sports Authority is only at 4% utilization and
Sheridan 11%. He feels with that kind of usage, why would RTD deter
people from parking there. Errol Stevens stated that was a legitimate
question. He said that to date he has not seen an instance of parking going
down once fees are charged.
Director James acknowledged that if RTD was to charge parking rates, the
effect would most likely be to those that can afford it more than those that
cannot.
Director Solano believes that RTD should not rush into charging for parking
on the W-Line with so many unknowns.

D. Other Matters
Pertaining to the comments made under other matters during the Civil Rights
Committee Meeting on October 21, 2014, Director Anderson stated that she heard
several things over the evening that she found very disturbing about the Board not
being diverse enough and that diversity needs to be more represented. She takes
umbrage to people talking about quotas for diversity on the Board and not about
considering that people are elected by their peers in the community.
Director Solano asked for a point of order as this does not relate to Operations and
Customer Service. Committee Chair Lubow asked Marla Lien if all discussion
brought up in other matters had to pertain specifically to the committee. Marla Lien

stated that it should pertain to the committee topic but she has heard many other
members talk about many other things previously. She added that it is really up to

Chair Sisk noted we might expect large crowds
under public participation, particularly having to
do with the 18th street traffic and Nine to Five.
General Manager Washington was asked to
comment on the article about the reconstruction
of the Jersey Bridge. General Manager
Washington indicated that the press was
referred to Laura Rinker with DTP. He expressed
we have a wonderful relationship with our
partners and this is really a good story. The
beauty of the PPP is the design, build and
operate component where everyone including
the partner has skin in the game to make sure
we have a bridge that will hold over the lifetime
of the P3 relationship. Our partner has stepped
up to the plate to make the necessary changes
without cost to RTD or impact to the schedule.
Pertaining to the GM Oversight and Performance
Management Update, Director Bagley indicated
he will discuss that we have begun the process
for the GM annual performance evaluation which
will continue through the early part of
December. This is a very methodical and

Other Matters
Other Matters:
 Director Bagley indicated what an honor to have our General Manager as Chair of
APTA. He requested the Chair of the Board to do something in acknowledgement.
 Director Bagley provided comments and some historical perspective to the contract
for the DUS Crawford Hotel. He reminded the committee of the contract process
where the two proposers were significantly different in their approach and use for
the space. He believes the better option was selected. USA had to work with the
preservation as well as Denver Landmark to make sure the restoration met the
requirements. The Union Station advocates were very active. USA did a couple of
focus groups around what did people want to experience and what kind of tenants
they wanted. Results from these focus groups and surveys indicated they wanted
the appeal of a “living room” and did not desire any chains. He shared that he had
taken a couple of friends to DUS and had spoken to Walter Eisenberg of Sage and
Jo with Larimer Associates. They had shared this is exceeding expectations and
RTD has lots to benefit from DUS.
Director James added this is an iconic building where choices had to be made. It is
really a question of what level of quality from the high end of the spectrum to the
low end of the spectrum. Either way would have brought its own critics. He is
pleased with the outcome.
Director Tobiassen added that what was important to him is that DUS became selfsustaining. We have accomplished this goal.
Chair Sisk reflected on DUS as part of the overall FasTracks decision. It was
important that we have a hub that is multi-modal and transforms this region. DUS
has done that. We need to focus on the positive good and visibility around the
world that this center has created and embrace the positive that DUS is generating.
Director Folska added how well she thought the USA proposal was and how the
team gelled and were fully integrated with a common vision. This has been a great
team effort. She wondered if there was a way to fully distinguish the role of RTD
and USA. General Manager Washington indicated we have done that where it
makes sense and we have a great relationship with DUSPA and USA, our partners.

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors approves and adopts the 2015 Fiscal Policy Statement.



The full committee was in agreement that we need to focus on the business as
appropriate, embrace the success of the overall DUS project and not be deterred by
naysayers or unnecessary noise.
General Manager Washington thanked the Board for their support for him as Chair
of APTA. He reminded the Committee that he had come to them two years ago
when he was first approached for VP as APTA. He was given a head nod. Now
that he is Chair, APTA is working with him to make sure this does not conflict with
his duties as CEO for the RTD Agency as this comes first. In particular, APTA is
working around his ongoing Tuesday night commitments for committees and Board
meetings. If he starts to see this is taking too much time away from his obligations
here, he will be the first to call halt. Conversely, if any Board members has a
concern, they should let him know. He sees two primary benefits to RTD in his role
as APTA Chair:
 International exposure of RTD
 National stage-RTD has the opportunity to shape national transportation
policy. His platform is based around the megatrends and issues that RTD has
already started to explore. Another component of this is his professional
development. The experience he is gaining as the APTA Chair enhances his
knowledge, span of influence and his overall ability to be a more successful
employee. As the only employee of the Board, his professional growth
trickles down to the rest of the agency where the overall performance of the
agency improves.
 General Manager Washington spoke of the five megatrends that are part of
his platform and that he shared in the APTA General Session:
 Safety, security and unfunded mandates
 Resources and funding-He has requested a national call for action in
what he terms a National Infrastructure Advocacy day to be held
April 1 and which coincides with when Congress is not in session.
 Workforce-he is concerned if we will be people ready when money
starts to flow again for building and sustaining our infrastructure.

Demographic Shift-more people are coming back into the urban
areas. There is some projection that over 2 million people will be
moving back into the city. Can our infrastructure accommodate this
change. Demographically, there is an ethnic shift where the minority
is becoming the majority.
 Accelerating Technological Changes and Innovations-How do we
address these issues?
General Manager Washington shared that while at APTA annual, he had
spoken with US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, who offered his
support for the platform that General Manager had laid out.

General Manager Washington announced that Terry Howerter, CFO will be retiring
at the end of the year. He emphasized why the succession planning and his
leadership development programs are key to ensuring we have a well prepared
bench.
The committee members expressed their support for General Manager Washington
as the APTA Chair and how this is a good deal for RTD. Director Walker noted that
a strong leader especially on the national and international scene with the level of
visibility calls for a strong Board. The Board will need to step up their game in
support.
General Manager Washington noted there is a different dynamic that we can expect
on the national and international scene. Chair Sisk reiterated the support and
stated how pleased he is with Phil’s leadership. We have good success stories to
share. Director Bagley stated that being Chair of APTA is a big deal. He talked
about the meaning of the acronym team and stated that together everyone
achieves more. Director Hoy expressed this is a good deal for the General Manager
and if he wins, we all win. We need to be pushing cohesively in the same
direction.
Paula Perdue expressed this was a good conversation and Director Walker’s
comment around the Board stepping up its game segues into some of the things
they are working on for the next year:
 There is an expectation that all the Board members will participate in the
APTA TBM seminar that RTD will be hosting in 2015. One of the session
items that is up for discussion is how do we elevate the role of the Board as
a high performance Board. We expect this is a topic which will be of
interest for all the Board members and transit properties. We are also
looking forward for General Manager Washington to share with both the
Board members and the Board support staff about his Career Pathways.
There is a lot of interest in this area and Phil can talk to the actual
implementation process of how you go about building this level of career
development.
 Pertaining to the discussion on megatrends, she is working with a facilitator
to create a workshop for the Board in early February around a concept called
PEST (macro understanding of the political, economical,
sociological/demographic and technological) influences over the next five
years. We hope to have experts come in to engage the Board in a level of
discussion and discovery. This is akin to the megatrends that General
Manager Washington was discussing.
General Manager Washington concluded the discussion by sharing the Board should
not beat itself up over some of the things we have discussed. This is a good
Board. As long as this Board concentrates on making good policy decision, some
of the one-offs and noise should be ignored.

Retiree Awards
Chair Sisk acknowledged there were three retirees this month. He asked General Manager
Washington to introduce the two who were present.
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations and Mike Gil, Deputy AGM for
Bus Operations presented Allan Hill, a street supervisor with over 35 years of service with
RTD. Bruce shared that during Allan’s extensive years with RTD, he has served in a
number of capacities (i.e. bus ops, dispatch, emergency service, street supervisor). Allan
has been a dedicated employee during this time.
Mike Gil added that Allan is one of those seasoned employees who has been an integral
part of the operations team. He characterized Allan as a very diligent, prepared person
who was “Johnny on the spot.” Allan loves photography and has an image of everything
that has happened on the job. He even has black and white picture of Director Daly when
he was a driver. Allan catalogues his photos and in one month, covered 43 accidents.
Allan is always there with his camera and taking photos. He also credited Allan with
bringing us up to date with technology. Allan mapped every intersection for RTD so we
would have good information in our database for the drivers.
Allan acknowledged his wife Amy, his daughter Stacy and husband Jack in the audience.
He stated his life will be full with them and his grandkids. He started his career in 1978
and is proud of his legend of having driven with his father. At the time, buses were
manual with no power steering or anything. They did have windows that could open wide

Assistant General Manager Austin Jenkins with rail operations and Phil Eberl, General
Superintendent of light rail, introduced David Lockwood who was retiring with 36 years of
experience. David has also had a very extensive career with RTD starting first in bus
operations and moving over to the light rail division. Dave is the type of person who gets
along with everyone and is well liked.
Dave complimented the leadership for the fine job they are doing at RTD. It was a
pleasure to work for them and he is thankful for his time at RTD.
Pat Sisk, customer care sales representative with over 23 years was not present to receive
her plaque.
Chair Sisk acknowledged what a fine job each of these employees do and what they have
done to make RTD one of the best agencies in the industry. We know that it is the work
of the employees who make all of us look good. Thanks for a job well done.
Special Recognition-GFOA Distinguished Budget Presentation Award
General Manager Washington recognized the finance department for being the recipient of
the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) award. This team has won this
honor for the last 4 or 5 years and it is what makes our finance and budgeting department
tops in what they do. He acknowledged Jannette Scarpino, Finance Manager, Todd
Nikkel, Senior Budget Analyst, and Doug McLeod, Manager of Financial Reporting for their
contributions. Terry Howerter, CFO, was not present.
Director Anderson commented she is very aware of this aware and knows it is no small
feat to achieve.

Public Participation




Andrea Chiriboga-Flor, Denver, CO, spoke on behalf of the people who could not be
at the meeting. She is a member of the 9-5 group. She wanted to relay how the
costs of transportation affect residents. There are a group of residents who use
the Denver Indian Center. This is part of their heritage and sacred grounds.
Families congregate there as part of communal connections and the children play
and learn about their culture. They have been unable to go or send their children
because they cannot afford to pay the bus fare. This community is being cut off
from their culture.
Lorena Limón who lives in the vicinity of Mississippi and Lipan, spoke with an
interpreter. She stated it is difficult for her to get around due to the poor public

and he shared a story of one unfortunate experience. He plans to retire to a little traveled
area about 100 miles from Denver with lots of acreage and few neighbors. He considers
RTD part of his family and wants to thank RTD for his many years of service.

transportation. The bus comes infrequently, there are few bus stops and the roads
are not paved. Financially it is very costly for her to travel with her three kids
which cost her $9.00 each time. This is a major hardship on her family and she is
looking for affordable transportation options.
Andres Guerrero spoke on behalf of the re-entry population. Good transportation
access is vital, even life changing, for this population who must use public
transportation to look for jobs, visit their parole officers, and comply with testing
requirements. RTD is the last resort and the lifeblood for these individuals who are
trying to turn their lives around and become producing members of society.
Transportation must be affordable.
Zoë Williams, 9-5, commented on the public process for the fare study. She stated
that the overwhelming comment from the public is the desire to make public transit
more affordable. The low-income already spend a large amount of their income on
transportation which keeps them in the spiral cycle of poverty. She would ask RTD
to listen to the voices of the public.
Dana Nobles, Denver shared her personal story around public transportation. She
was six months pregnant when she graduated from college. Since that time, she
has been on a path where it has become difficult to dig her way out. She lived in
transitional housing but found it difficult to get to job interviews because of
transportation issues and at some point had to drop out of the market. She is
trying to find a job close to home but even that proves difficult. She is concerned
about her ability to find a job along a path where transit is accessible and
affordable. She sees this as the “slip effect.” If she is successful in getting a job,
she will lose her current benefits now, which will drive her cost of living higher.
She needs affordable transportable to even make this a viable option. She does not
want to choose between a job or her child.
Fadumo Adan, Aurora, spoke on behalf of the refugee community. She stated she
is a student and works two jobs; yet wages are stagnant and it is hard to make
ends meet. She needs sustainable work and pay. The refugee community which
lives along the Colfax line are seeing less and less of the American dream. These
days the focus is just on trying to pay all the bills, rising student debt and less than
affordable transportation. Making transportation affordable is a lifeline to her
community.
Robert Lopez indicated that he was homeless and just trying to make it. He stated
the cost of housing, and transportation are becoming unaffordable in this city. He
believes the cost of bus passes needs to be made similar to the ECO Pass for the
transit dependents and poor in this city. He also shared an experience with fare
reinforcement and asked for information on how to make a complaint.
Scott Kerr, Denver, thanked RTD for its service. He noted there has been
community dialogue over the last year about affordable transportation but he has
not seen any change. He has witnessed the community solidarity grow on the

issue of affordable transportation. Means based fares, expansion of the non-profit
program or expansion of the ECO Pass programs are options that can be
considered. He works at Bayaud Enterprises where he witnesses people not being
able to get or keep a job because of transportation issues. He offers up his service
and the service of many in the room in coming up with solutions on this problem.
Let’s build a bridge to the solution. Right now, there are various fare structures
where everyone on the bus are paying different fares; there is a bubbling up of a
sense of injustice. Please look for ways to make transportation affordable for the
working and non-working poor.

General Manager's Report
General Manager Washington shared these updates:
 White House Infrastructure Investment Summit—He was invited to be a participant
in this summit that occurred on September 9, 2014. This summit was hosted by
the US DOT Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, and included Secretary of
Commerce, Penny Pritzker, and Secretary of Treasury, Jacob Lew. The focus was
on ways to get more funds for infrastructure. He sat on a panel that was
moderated by USDOT Foxx and had a chance to tell the RTD story of using P3 for
the Eagle project. He referenced the Lessons Learned document that RTD produced
on the Eagle procurement in 2011, as did several others on the panel and at this
summit. This document is becoming a Bible on how to do a successful P3 project.
RTD has the only successful P3 project in the country. What he garnered from the
summit is there are private investors out there who may want to play but without
some national standards, this becomes challenging for them. The Secretary plans
to present recommendations to the President around November 16th.
 Meeting with USDOT Under Secretary for Policy, Peter Rogoff—While in
Washington, he met with Under Secretary Peter Rogoff to discuss issues on Buy
America. This is becoming more of a challenge for many transit agencies today.
The process to get waivers is long and arduous and delays projects.
 2014 Security Operations Peer Review in Sacramento, CA—The Sacramento office
requested Chief Tarbert to participate on a peer review of the Sacramento agency.
They have subsequently called and told him what a good job that Chief Tarbert did.
He also received notification today that Chief Tarbert has been selected as Chair of
the Transit Policing and Security Peer Advisory Group to the TSA.
 General Manager announced that RTD did not win a TIGER grant for the Central
Corridor or the US HWY 119 submission; He understands there were $9B
submission for the $300M grant; Colorado did receive two grants for other
projects.

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: October 28, 2014

Subject:

Utility Easement for South Weld Metropolitan
District for City of Dacono and St. Vrain
Sanitation District

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all documents necessary to convey a non-exclusive
utility easement over 3,769 square feet (0.086 acres, more or less) on the Boulder Branch segment of
the Boulder Industrial Lead in the SE¼ Section 14, Township 1 North, Range 68 West, City of Dacono,
County of Weld, State of Colorado.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the 2015 goal of fiscal sustainability in leveraging RTD assets. In 2009, RTD
acquired the railroad track and land known as the Boulder Industrial Lead (BIL) in the counties of Adams,
Boulder, Broomfield and Weld. The railroad corridor is 32.7 miles in length and an average width of 161
feet. The BIL is divided into two segments: the North Metro Line and the Boulder Branch. The North
Metro line extends from Colorado Blvd at East 64th Avenue in Commerce City, Adams County,
northward to 164th Avenue just east of I-25 in unincorporated Weld County. The Boulder Branch
extends from 164th Avenue just east of I-25, Weld County, westward 17.7 miles to Boulder’s Valmont
Power Station.
In February 2014, RTD granted two Licenses on the BIL Boulder Branch to Ranchview Investment Co,
for consideration of a one-time License fee of $2,500 per License, to construct a water line and a
sanitary sewer pipeline crossing the railroad right-of-way under the track in Weld County Road 8 to serve
the Ranchview Subdivision adjacent to CR 8, City of Dacono. By the terms of a Subdivision Agreement
between Ranchview Investment Co and the City of Dacono to govern the development, the City of
Dacono and the St. Vrain Sanitation District will undertake ownership and maintenance of the water line
and sewer line, respectively, upon completion and approval of the utilities. Two additional License
Agreements between RTD and the City of Dacono and St. Vrain Sanitation District were concurrently
executed to become effective upon final approval and acceptance of the utilities at which time the
License Agreements with Ranchview Investment Co will terminate.
DISCUSSION
The City of Dacono and the St. Vrain Sanitation District are concerned with License Agreements that are
revocable and terminable and initially sought a permanent interest in the property to ensure the
continued use and operation of the pipelines; however, with time constraints of the subdivision
development, they agreed to execute the Licenses to facilitate the installations while continuing to
pursue an easement.
The 2009 appraisal of the BIL rail corridor, conducted by Brad A. Weiman, MAI, and John P. Baker, MAI,
of Integra Realty Resources, further divided the North Metro Line and the Boulder Branch into land use
segments for valuation. Segments 1 through 14 of the North Metro Line that are highly developed and
urban ranged in value from $1.65 to $19.30 per square foot. Segments 15 through 21 of the Boulder

Packet Pg. 87

11.A

Branch, with rural locations and no immediate demand for rail development, ranged in value from $0.75
to $6.00 per square foot. The requested easement area is located in Segment 15 of the Boulder Branch
that was valued at $1.50 per square foot.
South Weld Metropolitan District proposes a value based on 50% of the fee value of $1.50 per square
foot for the subsurface utility easement with an escalator of 10% or $3,100 for the 3,769 square foot
easement area.
RTD shall retain all rights in and usage of the property as necessary to ensure RTD’s use for mass
transportation system purposes. The utilities are subject to modification or relocation whenever RTD
finds it necessary or desirable in the use and improvement of the property. The utility owners shall be
required to modify, adjust or relocate all or any portion of the utilities, as RTD may designate. The utility
owners shall bear the entire cost and expense incurred in connection with the construction,
maintenance, repair and renewal and any and all modifications, revisions, relocations or reconstructions
of the utilities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD will receive $3,100 in compensation for the non-exclusive utility easement.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all
documents necessary to convey a non-exclusive utility easement over 3,769 square feet (0.086
acre, more or less) on the Boulder Branch segment of the Boulder Industrial Lead in the SE¼ Section
14, Township 1 North, Range 68 West, City of Dacono, County of Weld, State of Colorado.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all documents necessary to
convey a non-exclusive utility easement over 3,769 square feet (0.086 acre, more or less) on the
Boulder Branch segment of the Boulder Industrial Lead in the SE¼ Section 14, Township 1 North,
Range 68 West, City of Dacono, County of Weld, State of Colorado. This is not recommended as
RTD is receiving fair market value for the easement and the easement does not limit current or future
RTD actions.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

From:

William C. Van Meter,
Manager, Planning

Subject:

Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate
Burden Policy

Assistant

Date: October 16, 2014
General

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 28, 2014

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the
implementation of the Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy.
BACKGROUND
Per Section 12 of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Master Agreement, RTD must comply with
49 CFR part 21 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, which effectuates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
(Title VI) and Executive Order 12898 “Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority and
Low-Income Populations.” Title VI and Environmental Justice essentially prohibit recipients of federal
financial assistance (grants, loans, land, etc...) from discriminating on the basis of race, color, national
origin and low—income status. Accordingly, RTD is committed to the administration of an equitable
mass transit system, with a specific interest in the impacts absorbed by minority and low-income
populations.
In pursuit of equitable transit, FTA Circular 4702.1B requires the completion of an equity analysis for all
fare changes. Through the equity analysis, RTD will evaluate fare changes for adverse effects that may
disproportionately impact minority or low-income populations. The FTA further requires that RTD develop
a Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy that will guide RTD in analyzing fare changes
for equity.
DISCUSSION
This policy establishes a statistical threshold to determine whether minority and low-income riders are
disproportionately impacted by the adverse effects of a proposed fare change. RTD has established
threshold of 5%. Thus the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority and low-income
persons as a result of any fare change or the average of multiple fare changes shall not be greater than
or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership (see full policy for details).
As RTD proceeds with the Fare Study, this policy is needed to ensure recommended alternative fare
policies are equitable in accordance with FTA requirements.
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The FTA also requires that this policy be established through the public decision-making process.
Accordingly, RTD solicited feedback on the threshold during the Fare Study Problem Identification phase.
During this phase RTD sought feedback on the proposed threshold from Local Governments,
Transportation Management Associations/ Organizations (TMAs/TMOs), non-profit organizations and
community based organizations through a series of focus group style discussions. We also provided the
general public with opportunities to comment via the RTD website, phone and six public meetings held
throughout the district.

Packet Pg. 92

11.B

Generally, participants asked questions about the manner in which the threshold would be applied in an
equity analysis rather than commenting on the 5% threshold. Participants seemed more interested in
fare affordability and access to discounted fare media in the context of equity. Overall, reactions to the
proposed threshold and RTD’s philosophy on equity were positive.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The approval of this policy doesn’t result in a financial impact.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Approve the Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy, achieving compliance with
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and secure current and future federal funding.
2) Delay the approval of the Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy and jeopardize
current and future federal funding.
3) Reject the approval of the Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy and jeopardize
current and future federal funding.

Fare Disparate Impact and
Disproportionate Burden Policy
As a recipient of federal financial assistance, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) is
required to comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898
“Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income
Populations” (Environmental Justice). Title VI and Environmental Justice require that federal
recipients administer all of their programs and initiatives without regard to race, color, national
origin and low-income status.
The purpose of this policy is to establish specific measures to avoid and mitigate
disproportionate impacts absorbed by minority and low-income populations with respect to
fare changes.

Definitions
The definition of each key term used in this policy is as follows:
Disparate Impact: a percentage of adverse effects absorbed by minority persons that is
considered to be significantly disproportionate.
Disproportionate Burden: a percentage of adverse effects absorbed by low-income persons
that is considered to be significantly disproportionate.
Fare Media: a form of payment for transit service (i.e. cash fare, monthly pass, etc...).
Fare Change: an increase in the price of fare media, decrease in the price of fare media,
creation of new fare media or the discontinuance of existing fare media.
Low-income Person: a person whose median household income is at or below 150% of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Poverty Guidelines. The HHS Poverty
Guidelines can be viewed at http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/index.cfm.

11.B.a

Minority Persons include the following:
(1) American Indian and Alaska Native, which refers to people having origins in any of the
original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and who
maintain tribal affiliation or community attachment.
(2) Asian, which refers to people having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far
East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia,
China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and
Vietnam.
(3) Black or African American, which refers to people having origins in any of the Black
racial groups of Africa.
(4) Hispanic or Latino, which includes persons of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or
Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.
(5) Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, which refers to people having origins in any of
the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.
Substantial Legitimate Justification: evidence that a policy/policy change is necessary to meet
a goal that is legitimate, important, and integral to RTD’s institutional mission and business
requirements (e.g. farebox recovery ratio policy).

Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Circular 4702.1B outlines Title VI and Environmental
Justice requirements pertaining to fare changes. Specifically, the circular requires recipients of
federal funds to establish a disparate impact and disproportionate burden policy. This policy
must establish a statistical threshold to determine whether minority and low-income riders
are disproportionately impacted by the adverse effects of a change between an existing
fare and a proposed fare.
Pursuant to this requirement, the RTD threshold indicating a disparate impact or
disproportionate burden shall be set to +/-5%. Thus the difference in the adverse effects
absorbed by minority and low-income persons as a result of any fare change or the average of
multiple fare changes, shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the
overall ridership.

Attachment: Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy (Final) (2110 : Fare Disparate Impact Disproportionate Burden Policy)

11.B.a

Prior to establishing this threshold, RTD reviewed the thresholds established by peer transit
agencies, as well as FTA partiality to trending thresholds. Based on this review, other transit
agencies and the FTA tend to prefer the more conservative threshold of 5%. See Appendix A to
view thresholds established by other transit agencies.
Every proposed fare change shall undergo an Equity Analysis using this threshold to identify
disparate impacts and disproportionate burdens during the planning stage. An Equity Analysis is
a comparative analysis used to ensure that each proposed fare change has the least
discriminatory effect while still fulfilling RTD’s business requirements. This analysis is primarily
dependent upon customer satisfaction survey results that detail the use of fare media on a
demographic basis (e.g. race, income, etc…). See Appendix B for an example of how an equity
analysis uses the policy to evaluate a fare change for a Disparate Impact and Disproportionate
Burden.
In the event a fare change proposal results in a disparate impact or disproportionate burden,
RTD will examine alternatives in an attempt to avoid, minimize and mitigate the discriminatory
results of the initial proposal. If after the revision of the proposal a disparate impact or
disproportionate burden still exists, the equity analysis must demonstrate that the proposed
fare change is the least discriminatory option and there is a substantial legitimate justification
for the proposal (see the decision tree in Appendix C). Each proposed fare change will be
accompanied by a summary of an equity analysis for the RTD Board of Directors’ awareness,
consideration and approval.

In the examination of the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy requirement,
peer transit agencies were examined as well to identify trends in establishment of the statistical
threshold. Thresholds ranging from 0% to 20% were observed in nationwide inquires. Though a
large range of threshold percentages were identified, the most commonly observed thresholds
were established at 10% or less. Depicted in the table below are the percentage thresholds
established by other transit agencies nationwide.

The above thresholds suggest a pattern of transit agencies moving toward a common threshold.
Further, some agencies were interviewed to obtain a more detailed understanding of the FTA’s
response to their established threshold(s). Although the FTA has yet to provide a formal and
acceptable statistical differential for transit agencies, the evidence suggests that the FTA has
shown a general preference for a threshold of 5% or less. This percentage more closely
resembles the use of the statistical significance principle. Statistical significance refers to
whether any differences observed between groups being studied are "real" or simply due to
chance. While this principle doesn’t fit squarely into the context of measuring equity in transit,
it serves as a basic framework for determining disparate impacts and disproportionate burdens.

As an example, assume a fare increase on 10-Ride Ticket Books was proposed. RTD would have
to examine the percentage of minorities and low-income populations using 10-Ride Ticket
Books, compared to the percentage of the overall population that utilizes the 10-Ride Ticket
Books.

The example chart above clearly reveals the existence of a disparate impact resulting from the
proposed fare change, as minority populations will absorb greater than 5% of the effects
absorbed by the overall population. Yet there is not a disproportionate burden since the effects
absorbed by low-income populations is less than 5% of the effects absorbed by the overall
population.

Subject:

Award of Contract for On-Vehicle Advertising

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the General Manager or his
designee be authorized to enter into a contract with Lamar Advertising of Denver for the three year
period January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017 with a two year option for 2018 and 2019. Under
the terms of the recommended action, Lamar would remit to RTD either 1) a minimum guarantee of $4.0
million in 2015, $4.1 million in 2016 and $4.2 million in 2017 or 2) seventy percent of net sales,
whichever is greater.
BACKGROUND
On August 20, 2014, a Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued soliciting proposals for the sale and
installation of exterior and interior advertising on RTD vehicles. Responses to the RFP were due on
September 25, 2014. This RFP offered proposers the option to submit for one or any of three sections:
1) bus, light rail and commuter rail; 2) ADA paratransit vehicles and 3) other in-vehicle advertising
opportunities. Three responses were received for section 1, and one response was received for each of
section 2 and section 3. Additional research is required prior to staff making a recommendation on the
proposals submitted for sections 2 and 3, so this action item covers section 1 only (bus, light rail and
commuter rail). The two remaining sections will come forward to the Board at a later time.
DISCUSSION
A total of three responses were received for the bus, light rail and commuter rail section of the RFP;
from CBS Outdoor, Direct Media and the incumbent Lamar Advertising of Denver. CBS Outdoor indicated
that they were declining the opportunity to submit a proposal, as they felt the minimum annual
guarantee contained in the RFP ($3.5 million per year) was beyond what they could offer. Staff reviewed
the remaining two proposals for compliance with a set of four minimum qualifications: 1) experience of
firm; 2) onsite key personnel experience; 3) sales history; and 4) financial responsibility. Both Direct
Media and Lamar were deemed to have met the minimum qualifications as outlined in the RFP.
Qualifying proposals were then ranked by a pre-established formula based on their revenue proposal,
which factored both minimum annual guarantee and percentage of net sales.
Upon review of the revenue proposals, Direct Media’s proposal did not meet the minimum annual
guarantee specified in the RFP. Lamar’s revenue proposal exceeded the minimum annual guarantee for
each year. For the first three years of the contract period, Lamar’s minimum guarantee was a total of
$3.9 million more than that of Direct Media.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Lamar’s financial proposal was the most advantageous to RTD, offering a minimum guarantee of $4.0
million in 2015, $4.1 million in 2016 and $4.2 million in 2017 or 70 percent of net sales, whichever is
greater. For this reason, staff is recommending that the contract be awarded to Lamar.

Packet Pg. 104

11.C

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Award a contract to Lamar Advertising of Denver for the three year period January 1, 2015
through December 31, 2017 for the exclusive sale of exterior advertising on RTD buses, light rail
and commuter rail vehicles and for the non-exclusive sale of interior advertising on RTD buses,
light rail and commuter rail vehicles. Under the terms of this alternative, Lamar would remit to
RTD either 1) a minimum guarantee of $4.0 million in 2015, $4.1 million in 2016 and $4.2
million in 2017 or 2) seventy percent of net sales, whichever is greater. This is the staff
recommendation.
2.

Do not award a contract to Lamar Advertising of Denver and reissue the RFP. This alternative is
not recommended because the contract amount proposed by Lamar exceeded the minimum
guarantee required in the RFP and there is no indication that a higher revenue figure could be
obtained.

Free Rides for Members of the Military

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free rides on RTD for active duty
members of the United States Military should be extended from the presently approved date of December 31,
2014 to December 31, 2015. Utilization has been minimal to date and this extension will have minimal impact
on RTD.
BACKGROUND
At the October 30, 2006 Special Board Meeting, the RTD Board of Directors approved a resolution allowing
active duty U.S. Military personnel to ride free on all RTD services through the end of 2006. This offer has
been extended annually by the Board since that time and is now valid through December 31, 2014. As a result
of these actions, all active duty members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, National Guard,
and Reserves are entitled to ride free on any RTD service including special services such as SkyRide and
BroncosRide. To be eligible to ride for free, active duty military personnel must either be in uniform or present
an active duty military ID card.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the RTD Board of Directors extend this offer beyond the current expiration date of
December 31, 2014 and that the expiration date be extended by one year at this time and revisited again next
year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The exact financial impact of this action is not known, but is expected to be minimal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Extend free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should from the
presently approved date of December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. This is the staff
recommendation.
2. Do not extend RTD’s program offering free rides for active duty members of the United States Military.

January 2015 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the January 2015 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A
resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $969,000 and, further, to authorize the General
Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose
service is impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, system maintenance actions and several service reductions. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments as appropriate in
future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Five public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended between October 2nd
and October 16th. Public meetings were held in Denver, Federal Heights, Highlands Ranch and Parker
with nearly 200 hundred public participants. Comments from these meetings and the service change
website are summarized in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the
January 2015 service change:

Arapahoe at Village Center Station
Due to the development of the hotel at this station, several routes will need to have gate
assignments changed to allow for construction and future operations. This change will
impact Routes: 65, 66, AT and T.
Belmar Call-n-Ride
The Belmar Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line.
The Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 8:00pm. The Call-n-Ride currently
serves the Garrison Station. The boundaries can best be described as 13th on the north
and one stop on Colfax at Garrison, Wadsworth on the east, Kipling on the west and
Morrison Road to the south. The Call-n-Ride also runs a Flex Route on Garrison during the
peak hours. The ridership has been averaging 1.6 passenger boarding’s per hour. This
proposal calls for discontinuing the Garrison Flex route and for the changing of the north
boundary to be moved south to 10th Avenue. The boundary will be adjusted west of
Kipling and north of 13th to the Oak Station.
Additionally, the south boundary at
Morrison Road will be moved up to Jewell. This change to the Oak Station will now allow
customers to transfer to the Route 16 and 100 at a station and alleviate neighborhood
concerns regarding the safety and the vehicle traffic in the neighborhood in and around the
Garrison Station.
After further consideration from public input, the boundary will continue at 13th and
Garrison Station will continue to be served by reservation only.
No additional costs are anticipated.

Dry Creek Call-n-Ride
The Dry Creek Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006 with the opening of the
Southeast Light Rail. The Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 7:00pm. The
Call-n-Ride currently serves the Dry Creek Station. The boundaries can best be described
as Arapahoe Road on the north, I-25 on the east, County Line Road to the south and Holly
on the west. During off peak hours the Call-n-Ride serves the entire area. During peak
hours the Call-n-Ride serves only to Quebec. This proposal calls for changing the
boundaries by not serving west of Quebec and north of Dry Creek. This area has been
very unproductive and by removing this section may allow better productivity in the
remaining area. No costs associated with this change.
DUS Routes: 31X, 40X, 80X, 86X, 104X, 120X, B, L, S
General schedule and gate assignment changes as needed

12.E.a

however, it will also reduce some early-morning “C-Line” pullout trains from Evans to
Union Station, which are currently lightly patronized.

It is also proposed to discontinue ten additional Monday-Friday trips on the fringes of the
AM and PM peak periods: Eastbound trips from Federal Center Station at 6:31 AM, 8:31
AM, 3:46 PM, 4:16 PM, and 6:16 PM and Westbound trips from Union Station at 6:11
AM, 8:11 AM, 3:26 PM, 3:56 PM, and 5:56 PM. This proposed change effects
approximately 529 passengers that will need to take a W-Line 7.5 minutes earlier or later.
Total hours saved: (Mondays-Thursdays) 1,275 annualized.
Route 102 Loop Extras – it is proposed to make minor adjustments to the Loop Extras,
trains 10, 50, and 70, to adjust times and service based on early information gathered
from the August 2014 runboard. Changes to hours are not anticipated.
Savings 1,700 annual hours, $314,500
W-Line: It is proposed to extend the existing Denver Union Station (DUS) Weekday hostler
hours so that there is coverage all day for one hostler (currently there are two hostlers in
each AM and PM peak). This would change the existing four splits to two splits and two
straights. This change helps provide layover and relief for W-Line operators at DUS.

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC MEETINGS – JANUARY 2015

Doug Monroe conducted the meeting. Staff in attendance included Nataly Erving, Nate
Diaz, Jessie Carter, Jeff Becker, Jeff Dunning, Nick Shoup, Dave Menter, Daniel Menter,
Diane Marquis, Brian Matthews, Pate Heye and Chris Marko. There were no elected
officials in attendance. In addition there was a count of 43 members of the public who
signed in.
Route 11:
On Sundays, Leticia Mangeson said that she needs the route 11 to run later than its
current end time of 7:00 pm.
Denver Union Station/18th Street Detour:
Many in attendance were in favor of the city’s proposal to establish two-way traffic along
18th St between Wynkoop and Blake and therefore have bus service along this segment
thus removing it from Wynkoop St. Among those in favor were Elizabeth Orr who wanted
to know the time frame for its implementation. [Jessie Carter answered that it would be
on October 31st, 2014]. Andy Youtz, who lives at 1720 Wynkoop noted an increase in
activity along Wynkoop since Union Station opened last May not only with RTD buses, but
with convention buses, tour buses, more taxis and cars standing in the middle of the
street blocking traffic and for this reason feels that 18th would be better for routing buses
than Wynkoop is and therefor he wants to make sure that the decision not to route them
on Wynkoop is upheld. Andy’s sentiment was echoed by Vickie Godbey of the Union
Station Advocates. Ryan King is also in support of this upcoming change.
However, Tom Rickert, who lives at Franklin Lofts likes the current routing arguing that if
the plan is implemented, 100% of the buses would be on 18th and he did not find that to
be “equitable” and asked that some buses use other streets.
John Parkinson pointed out that there are priorities on all sides and that the final decision
should not be swayed by individual interests.
Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride:
Terry Whitmore asked us to save the Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride stating that the trip that
her daughter uses to get to school is full. She pointed to many factors that suggest our
keeping this service including the projected doubling of the region’s population by 2040
with 1 in four residents being over 60 at that time, many of which are likely to want to
remain independent, yet also remain in this region but needing to not depend on Single
Occupancy Vehicles (SOV). She said that when customers are forced to become a SOV
due to elimination of transit service, they are likely lost to transit and not likely to return.
She also mentioned that the Douglas County residents that would be negatively affected
by this cut contribute to the system with the highest farebox rate and that equity in the
system would keep service to their area running.

Morrison Rd / Westwood neighborhood:
There was considerable support for the possibility of restoring transit service in the
Westwood neighborhood including along Morrison Rd which was discontinued in January,
2012 due to budget constraints. Among the comments supporting restored service:
 Lillian Castaway who is disabled, who would like this service restored not to just
during peak hours but during the entire day. Andrea Chiriborga-Flor and Lorena
Limon agreed that full day service is needed as there are many elderly in this area
and she wants to avoid transit “pockets” of non-service. Andrea also thanked RTD
for the opportunity to address this issue at this meeting.
 Patricia Grado who works in Westwood said that many families that live in the area
do not have cars and without convenient transit service have to walk more than a
mile to where there is service, even if they have cancer and are going to medical
appointments. Marisol Valencia also said that she could use this service to get to
medical treatments and therefore it would be helpful for it to run during the entire
day.
 Mayra Olivas who works with the families in the Westwood area said that families
have to walk more than a ½ mile to buy groceries and in the winter that gets even
more difficult.
 It’s difficult with good transit service for kids to get to school according to Lydia
Cameron.
 Tracy Kaye, who works for Healthy Places a Colorado Health Fund, referred to
Westwood as an “island” of non-service. She said that there are many community
members who have multiple part-time jobs that they have trouble getting to. She
said that not only do they “deserve” service, but providing such transit service
would get them to walk to/from the bus and therefore contribute to their overall
health. Laura Martinez who works as a housekeeper also finds it very difficult to
get to / from work without better service in this neighborhood.
 Barnum resident Eric Kornabi, the Executive Director and Co-Founder of Re:Vision,
an organization that works with people in marginalized neighborhoods suggested
that with Westwood not having convenient transit options, our service is not
“Equitable” as it is in areas such as LoDo. He mentioned that although between
16,000 – 17,000 vehicles a day travel on Morrison Rd, there is not one transit
stop. He said that his organization is helping to establish a new grocery store on
Morrison Rd and that having transit service along that street will benefit this new
business.
 Olga Seguin mentioned that it is not safe for children to walk along Morrison Rd
and that bus service that they could take would make things safer for them. Bertha
Perez also said that walking along Morrison Rd is dangerous and that she has
missed medical appointments at Denver Health Medical Center because of the poor
transit service in the area. Marisol Valencia also mentioned this would be helpful for
children getting to and from school.
 Ivan Escalante is also in favor of restoring this service since students now have
very far to walk, but he pointed out that the fares are too high as many can not
afford them.
 Rachel Cleaves of Westwood Unidos, who was surprised that no proposals for new
service on Morrison Rd was proposed, did a survey in which 52% of those she

survey said that one’s employment is affected by access to public transit and such
transit is currently not accessible in this neighborhood which she said is one of the
youngest and densest in the city. She also asked RTD to be “creative” in how we
establish this new service saying that the old service was not adequate and that
she would prefer a “shuttle”.
Monica Acosta of Parents and Youth United, an education and justice organization
is dedicated to removing the boundaries that hinder education and employment
opportunities and that one of these barriers is poor public transportation. She said
that her families rely on public transportation for such things as getting to school,
child care, work, shopping and health care. Without public transit, many have to
walk ten blocks or so to Sheridan Blvd and that their quality of life gets impacted
when they have to make difficult choices as a result of the poor transit.
Others that affirmed agreement with creating service in this area included Mary
Cruz Herrera.

RTD Administrative Offices
Thursday, October 2, 6:00 PM, 2014
Jessie Carter conducted the meeting with Director Angie Rivera-Malpiede present. RTD
Staff in attendance included Jonathan Wade. There were 23 members of the public who
signed in.
There were no comments or questions concerning items listed in the service change
proposal. The following topics and question were discussed during the public input
session:


The Westwood neighborhood would benefit from service along Morrison Road
connecting them to other RTD services, grocery stores, and medical facilities.
The Westwood community would like RTD to consider operating a “circulator”
service in the Westwood area.
The Urban land Conservancy (ULC) has invested in housing developments in the
Westwood community and would like to see service along Morrison Road.
Why are there delays on the D-Line Light Rail service in the Five Points area?
As RTD expands the light rail system to the suburbs it seems that RTD has
forgotten about the people in the inner city.

The meeting was concluded at approximately 7:15pm.

Since no school bus service is provided, we need to keep the Call-n-Ride.
The CnR arrival phone notification system is very inaccurate.
The CnR is too busy during the peak hours for anyone to get rides except for
students.
One neighborhood of 200 homes is all seniors who will be left without
transportation if the CnR is cancelled.
The CnR is perfect for students and teaches independence with more safety than
401 or 402 Ltd.
There has not been sufficient marketing, especially to charter schools.
The drivers are great and we feel safe allowing our children to use CnR.
We appreciate the CnR and it will be needed even more with the continued growth
of Highlands Ranch.
CnR would operate better with a central dispatch instead of drivers doing it
themselves.
Ridership would double with a second bus during peak hours.
Students need a bus just for them from 7:00am-9:00am and 2:30-4:30pm.
Parents would be happy to pay a higher fare to keep the CnR service for students.
The community was not given enough advance notice of CnR cancellation to help
do something about keeping it.
One person gave us a written letter. Attached.

Federal Heights Call-n-Ride - The rest of the public was in support of keeping the Federal
Heights Call-n-Ride. The majority of attendees were residents of the Villa Maria senior
living community and were encouraged to attend by community advocate Bonnie Good
and arrived via the Federal Heights Call-n-Ride. Community members stressed the benefits
the service provided, stating that it gave them freedom, the ability to get to the store,
pharmacy, and doctor, an opportunity to make friends with other riders, and access to
restaurants and community and cultural events. One member of the public, who teaches
disabled youth, said that she had just recently learned of the Call-n-Ride and now all 20 of
her students are able to use it to get to and from their jobs at the local ARC. Bonnie Good
spoke last, highlighting the need for the service for students, seniors, emergency
preparedness, first and final mile connections and community building. She also submitted
a letter of support for the Call-n-Ride to the public record (please see attached).
All of the public commended RTD on the dependable, safe and courteous drivers operating
the Call-n-Ride Service. Several community members brought up frustrations with the Calln-Ride scheduling software. One cited complaint was the software’s inability to handle
recurring, once-a-month trips. Frequently mentioned was the software’s inability to handle
multiple passengers wishing to go to the same or nearby destinations and the desire for it
to suggest more logical and efficient routings. One member of the public suggested, as
call-n-Ride buses are replaced, they are re-wrapped with a design that more clearly shows
the “RTD” logo, so as to cut down on confusion as to what it is.
6:47p - The hearing was closed, so that attendees could return home via the Federal
Heights Call-n-Ride.

The route P always gets assigned the old buses.
We need to extend the RTD boundary to the south because those people ride the
bus and should pay taxes for it.
The route P needs to serve the Pinery area.

be moved back from a 5:21p departure at Union Station to 5:30p to accommodate the
additional distance to reach Union Station as compared to the former Market Street
Station.

Remove the 5 minute window and it will speed things up.
The current morning driver has a bad attitude and is hurting ridership.
A second bus would help ridership.
If Lincoln Station were served ridership would increase greatly.
The CnR system needs to have a central dispatch. Drivers have problems with the
phone calls. They often do not answer or return call.
Need to organize shopping trips for seniors.
More marketing needs to be done before cancelling the service.
Should expand the CnR boarders to the west.

Equity Analysis

In the pursuit of the provision of mass transit service in the Denver Metro Area, equity is a core principle
of the Regional Transportation District (RTD). An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the
benefits and adverse effects of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin or lowincome status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Environmental Justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national
origin in programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically Title VI states, “No person in the
United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, shall be excluded from participation
in, denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving
Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898 “Federal Actions to Address Environmental
Justice in Minority and Low-Income Populations,” which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high
and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority
populations and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular,
the FTA requires RTD to evaluate any and all major service changes to determine whether those changes
will have a disproportionate negative impact on minority or low-income populations.

SERVICE CHANGE PHILOSOPHY
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We continually adjust services in response
to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also our
responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or
cancellation of service as warranted. We utilize our official Service Standards to establish performance
metrics by which we identify underperforming services on a class of service basis.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities. The general assembly further finds that the
farebox recovery ratio of the district must be improved so that resources once allocated for
mass transportation can be made available for other surface transportation needs.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

12.E.c

Equity Analysis

The FTA also requires that RTD establish policies that will guide the analysis of major service changes for
equity. Accordingly, RTD has established equity analysis policies to meet this requirement and establish a
service evaluation process.

Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change policy, a Disparate
Impact policy and a Disproportionate Burden policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational
requirements for evaluating major service change proposals for equity. These policies and their
applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction
in the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All
major service changes will be subject to an equity analysis which includes an analysis of adverse
effects.
a. Adverse Effect: is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service which
includes but is not limited to: elimination of a route, shortlining a route, rerouting an
existing route and an increase in headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse
effects, and analyze those effects, when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority
population 10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a
disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will
consider modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it
removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot
be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service
change, the FTA will allow RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Proposed Major Service Changes
Pursuant to the intent to provide cost effective demand responsive services, RTD has proposed many
service changes to take effect in January of 2015. Per the Major Service Change Policy, the proposed
major service changes subject to this analysis are listed below.
Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride – Cancellation
The Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006 with the opening of the Southeast
Light Rail line. The Call-n-Ride operates weekday hours 6:00am – 6:00pm. Currently, weekday ridership
is at 2.1 passenger boardings per hour. Applicable service standards require a minimum of 3 boardings
per hour. Ridership has never attained a 3.0 boarding per hour since operations began in November
2008. This proposal calls for the discontinuance of the Call-n-Ride due to low ridership. Some alternative
service is available using the Routes 401, 402Ltd and 403.

Parker Call-n-Ride – Cancellation
The Parker Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006 with the opening of the Southeast Light Rail
line. The Call-n-Ride operates weekdays 5:30am – 6:00pm. Currently weekday ridership is at 1.8
passenger boardings per hour. Applicable service standards require a minimum of 3 boardings per hour.
This proposal calls for the discontinuance of the Call-n-Ride due to low ridership. Some alternative service
is available using the Route 153.
Savings: Annual hours saved: 3,200, saving $183,312 (includes fuel).

Equity Analysis Methodology
As previously mentioned, the basic framework for analyzing service changes for equity involves the
comparison of affected populations. The manner in which these populations are identified and compared
is described below:
1. Assess the proposed service change for adverse effects (e.g. frequency decrease, shortlining,
etc…)
2. Obtain applicable population or ridership data (e.g. customer satisfaction survey, census data,
etc…)
3. Examine the proportions of adverse effects absorbed by minority and low-income populations.
The two proposed major service changes are cancellations of Call-n-Rides. Call-n-Ride is a demandresponse bus service. Patrons make a reservation for pick-up at any location within a predefined service
area and can then travel to any destination within that predefined service area. Typically, Call-n-Rides
have operated within multiple low-density, suburban neighborhoods that don’t have a ridership demand
high enough to justify fixed-route bus service.
Considering all customers traveling within the predefined service area can be impacted by these
changes, we’ve elected to utilize U.S. Census population data to assess the impacts absorbed by minority
and low-income populations. Table 2.1 depicts demographic data from the 2010 Census.

As stated in the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies, minority and low-income
populations should not be subjected to adverse effects that are at a rate greater than or equal to 10%
more than non-minority and non-low-income populations. Based on this demographic profile, we find that
a service change affecting minority populations at a rate greater than or equal to 32% (22% + 10%)
would be considered a disparate impact. We also find that service changes affecting low-income
populations at a rate greater than or equal to 38% (28% + 10%) would be considered a
disproportionate burden. Accordingly, through Tables 2.2 and 2.3, we will examine the two services in
question, the nature of the service changes and rate at which minority and low-income populations are
impacted. We also utilized Geographic Information Systems (GIS) maps to examine the demographic
data as well (see Appendix A).

CONCLUSION
As mentioned previously, our primary objective within this analysis is to examine proposed major service
changes to ensure minority and low-income populations would not disproportionately absorb adverse
effects. The Census demographic data shows the Highlands Ranch and Parker Call-n-Ride service areas
have percentages of minority and low-income populations well under the applicable policy thresholds of
the disparate impact (32% minority) and disproportionate burden (38% low-income) policies. Therefore
neither disparate impact nor a disproportionate burden was identified and the proposed service changes
do not require revision.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

October 1, 2014

Board Meeting Date: October 28, 2014

Subject:

Approval of Budget Transfer for North Metro
Sidings

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
transfer of $16 million from FasTracks Railroad Right of Way budget to a project to construct additional
track sidings (see attached) on the North Metro Rail Line (NMRL). These sidings will improve system
reliability on the entire RTD commuter rail network. They provide for a more robust, reliable operation
on the current North Metro segment to 124th Avenue and facilitate the future construction of the
remaining segment to 162nd Avenue. Funding for the FasTracks Railroad Right of Way Budget is
included in the 2014 Amended Budget for the FasTracks capital program.
BACKGROUND
Implementation of this action would advance the 2015 RTD strategic goals of: (1) advancing/completing
FasTracks; and (2) improve service delivery. One of the major challenges of FasTracks has been securing
railroad right-of-way at a cost consistent with our budget. Many challenges and unforeseen costs have
occurred. In response to these challenges, the FasTracks program had set up a Railroad Right of Way
budget of $16 million to address risks in this area. This is a programwide element and not assigned to
any specific FasTracks project
Through prudent management of this area, our projects have been able to address these railroad issues
within their project budgets and contingency. Our FasTracks projects, most of which have a high level
of interface with the railroads, are now far enough along that we are projecting that these issues can be
addressed within the project budgets without needing to use this programwide $16 million Railroad Right
of Way account.
DISCUSSION
The North Metro Rail Line is designed as a single track railroad with passing sidings. Trains in opposite
directions are scheduled to meet on these passing sidings. This can work well as long as trains operate
exactly on time with no disruptions.
However, train operations are subject to a number of factors that can cause delays including equipment
breakdowns, inclement weather, passenger boarding/medical emergency issues, power problems, etc. A
delayed train will cause the train in the opposite direction to wait at the end of a siding until it clears the
single track section. Once a delay begins, it may ripple through the scheduled service for hours,
affecting customers on other RTD trains as well as the delayed train(s). Single-track operations increase
the pressure on the operating entity to turn trains promptly at terminals within tight schedule windows;
this may require additional staff members (hostlers) to be added so that trains can run on time.
Updated computer simulations of train operations for North Metro were performed incorporating the
latest information about the alignment, performance of the Hyundai Rotem commuter rail vehicles and
positive train control (PTC). The updated simulations have shown that small delays or disruptions can
compound to create significant delays. This could lead to an inherently unreliable operation that would

Packet Pg. 141

12.F

not meet ridership expectations or result in a longer headway that provides less service. Providing
additional sidings (or reducing the length of single track) gives trains more opportunities to pass each
other without waiting, even if one train is delayed.
Delays on the NMRL can also affect the entire commuter rail network as these trains interface with
trains from the East, Gold and Northwest Rail at Denver Union Station.
In addition, installing these sidings now would facilitate the ultimate goal of construction of the entire
NMRL to 162nd Avenue. Waiting to install these sidings until later when the line is in service would be
significantly more expensive than now when the project is under construction.
RTD has previously launched enabling works on this corridor (maintenance facility expansion, double
tracking, and electrification modifications) in a similar manner before full construction was funded.
These board decisions to proceed with early enabling works were critical in RTD being able to afford the
current project to 124th Avenue.
The work on these sidings would incorporate design, trackwork, special trackwork (turnouts/crossovers),
signaling (including positive train control), electrification and communications. The work would be
performed by the Regional Rail Partners (RRP) contractor who is the design-builder for this corridor.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The work will be funded by a transfer of $16 million from the FasTracks Railroad Right of Way budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
transfer of $16 million from FasTracks Railroad Right of Way Budget to a project to construct

Request for Increase to ACS Smart Contract
(Howerter/McMurphy)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance, Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager or his designee to increase the Xerox Transport Solutions contract notto-exceed amount by $2,349,912 to a new contract amount not to exceed $19,731,382.
BACKGROUND and DISCUSSION
Smart Media System changes will be required in order to configure the system to utilize RTD’s new fare
structure that will be a result of the Fare Study currently under way. In addition, changes to the public
facing web portal are required so as to create a web portal that is easy to use and navigate by RTD’s
customers. Once the web portal changes are made, RTD needs to ensure that all pages and functionality
of the portal are ADA compliant so that persons with disabilities can easily navigate the web portal.
In Q3-2015, RTD will begin issuing Stored Value Cards, which in essence are debit cards for use on the
RTD system. Because some cards will be purchased via the Smart Card Web Portal, RTD needs to be
very confident that the highest levels of cyber security have been implemented on our system to protect
credit card and personal information. This is the first time that RTD has undertaken this type of payment
vehicle that is open to the public. Xerox will be working closely with RTD to ensure that the web portal
and back-end systems meet the high standards of RTD’s Cyber Security requirements.
With the 2016 opening of the new rail lines, approximately 140 new platform validators will be installed,
along with the 138 platform validators already in operation. An increased inventory of spare parts will
need to be on hand and managed in order to expedite and correct any hardware issues that may be
encountered on our light rail platforms. The spare parts must come from Xerox the company from which
RTD purchases the platform validators currently in use.
Based on these considerations, additional funds are needed to facilitate enhanced security, web portal
enhancements, additional cards, nine SMV installations on SE, additional APOS units, file compression
and recharge selection software, and ADA Compliance enhancements, as well as the creation of a
validator spare parts inventory.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for these additional SMT Program Activities will be provided via the Unrestricted Funds Balance.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Finance, Administration and Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager or his designee to
issue a change order to Xerox, Inc. to a new contract amount not to exceed $19,731,382.

Packet Pg. 145

12.G

2) Do not accept the Recommended Action. The SMT Web Portal may be at a higher risk due to the
lack of enhanced security. The web portal may also be unusable by some constituents due to its
lack of accessibility to those with disabilities. Spare parts to fix the platform validators would
eventually become unusable and/or unavailable. Without the Services of Xerox, the Smart Media
system changes required as a result of the Fare Study may not be timely implemented.

SMT Program Schedule

The schedule to deploy and operate the next elements of the SMT program is attached.
This set of steps and milestones are consistent with previously briefed information to the
Board of Directors. It is important to note a few key caveats to the associated milestones:
•

With the deployment of the ECO and College Pass elements of the system, system
administrative capacity limitations surfaced. To rectify the problems there were
root cause analysis, alternative solutions architected, a preferred solution selected
and finally software development to mitigate the system limitation. The success of
future deployments is challenged without correction of these limitations. The
software to correct the problem is completed, the vendor has done their testing and
RTD is just starting the acceptance testing process. Once it’s determined the
system software meets the defined objectives, it will be moved to production later
in November. These steps are necessary to advance the next phases of the
deployment.

•

We continue to be involved in the conversations regarding possible changes to the
RTD fare structure and possible impacts to the timeline. We will advise the Board of
should any impacts to the timeline be identified.

Salaried
(Howerter/Sprague)

Benefit

Plans

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the 2015 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorize the General Manager or his designee to
enter into agreements with the Insurance Carriers.
BACKGROUND
Annually the staff brings the proposed Salaried Employee Benefits plan for approval to the Board of
Directors. Approval of the plan by the Board establishes the rates for Open Enrollment and provides
costs for the 2015 Budget. The Open Enrollment period for salaried staff begins November 16 through
December 1, 2014.
DISCUSSION
The goals for the 2015 plan year are: 1) Achieve the 2015 budget goals, 2) Continued focus on
containing cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism, 3) Maintain market
competitiveness, and 4) Insure compliance with PPACA – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Health Care Reform provisions as applicable to RTD).
Following is a summary of the modest changes for the 2015 plan year.
Medical
- Cigna administers two self-funded plans on behalf of RTD. Both the PPO Plan and the HDHP (High
Deductible Health Plan) Plan have a specific individual $150,000 stop-loss ceiling in 2015. The
administrative cost will increase by 10% in 2015. The Cigna Plans are expected to have
approximately 460 employees enrolled. 2014 claims are running 10% above expected claims YTD
and 2015 claims are currently projected to be slightly higher than 2014 levels.
-

Kaiser provides 3 Plan Options: a fully insured HMO; a DHMO (HMO Plan with deductibles), and an
HDHP. The Kaiser plans are expected to have approximately 200 employees enrolled. This plan has
proposed a 5% blended increase over 2014 and Kaiser has requested removing the HMO (High Plan)
due to low enrollment (10 people).

-

Cost-sharing, the employee contributions for the plan, will be increased for employees by 10%.

Dental
- No carrier/plan changes and a 1% renewal rate increase, with a two-year Administrative rate
guarantee through 2016. Delta is a self-funded plan and has projected a 5% increase in expected
claims exposure.
Life & Disability
- The rate guarantee with Lincoln National expired and an RFP was conducted. It is recommended that

Packet Pg. 150

12.H

the Short Term Disability, Long Term Disability, Accidental Death & Dismemberment, and Voluntary
Insurance be moved from Lincoln to Cigna. This move results in a reduction in annual premiums of
12% or approximately $55,000.
Vision/Business Travel Accident
- Vision Plan is currently a fully insured plan with Anthem Blue Cross – Blue Shield. Based on
utilization, Anthem has proposed an 8% renewal increase. There are no carrier/plan changes and no
costs increase with the Business Travel Accident Plan.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2015 planned Salaried Employee Insured Benefit budget is projected to be an 8% increase over
2014 projected benefit costs. RTD’s current utilization and projections are slightly below the medical
trend of 10%. With the additional costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, the overall benefit
budget increase is projected to be 8.4% over 2014.
The major cost impacts in 2015 are due to Cigna Plan increases of 10%. The net additional benefit
costs anticipated in 2014 are essentially flat. This is the fifth year we have achieved strong cost
containment as a result of our shift in carriers, plan offerings, plan design and funding models.
The 2014 estimate of the Salaried Employee Insured Benefits is $9,699,223. The projected increase of
8.4% results in an increase of $812,341 or a total projected cost of $10,511,564 in 2015. The increase
meets the projected costs in the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). RTD’s benefit costs are at or below the
average for Metro area companies, which are experiencing 8-15% cost increases according to the
Denver Chamber of Commerce.

Do not approve the recommended salaried employee benefit plans. This is not recommended, as
this will result in the Agency being unable to provide competitive and cost effective benefit plans
to the salaried employees.

Certification of the 2015 contribution for the
RTD Salaried Employees' Retirement Plans
(Howerter)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
certifies a 2015 contribution to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB
Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the RTD
Board of Directors certifies a 2015 contribution to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan
Trust (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment, at
a percent of each participant’s eligible compensation.
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9 percent of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION
DB Plan
In 2012 the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan would
be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a result of
the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The recommended fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million
to the DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to
maintain a “fully funded” status for the plan in the future. The actuaries have updated the DB Plan
projections to reflect the final 1/1/2014 valuation assumptions for the DB Plan. The 2014 Actuary
Recommended Contribution is expected to exceed the $3.1 million fixed annual contribution amount
through the 2019 Fiscal Year and fall below the fixed annual contribution amount thereafter. The DB
Plan is projected to reach 100% funding in 2028 assuming that the $3.1 million contribution were to
continue after the actuary’s recommendation drops below the $3.1 million fixed contribution if all other
actuarial assumptions are met each year. The Plan remains on target to achieve this goal.
As stated above an actuarial evaluation of the DB Plan is completed annually to monitor the funding
status of the plan. The actual 2015 Actuary Recommend Contribution is $5.7 million based on current
projections. Should the Board approve contributing a higher amount to the DB Plan and continue to fund
at the amount calculated to be the Actuary Recommended Contribution the DB Plan would be fully
funded in 2024.
In summary, the Board could continue to approve a fixed contribution amount of $3.1 million and be
fully funded in 2028 or fund the DB Plan at the Actuary Recommended Contribution amount of $5.7
million and be fully funded in 2024.

The assumed contributions indicate the different amounts that would be required to fund the plan at
9%, 8% and 7% of eligible salaries in 2015.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors certifies a 2015 contribution to RTD’s Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust at the recommended amount of $3.1 million and
Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan Trust rate at 9% of each participant’s eligible
compensation as planned in the SBP.
2.

The RTD Board of Directors could certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust or the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution
Plan Trust at amounts other than $3.1 million and 9% respectively.

3.

Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plans. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: October 15, 2014

From:

Terry L. Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

Date:

October 15, 2014

Board Meeting Date: October 28, 2014

Subject:

Proposed 2015 Fiscal
(Howerter/Scarpino)

Policy

Statement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves and adopts the 2015 Fiscal Policy Statement.
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the
proposed Policy for the upcoming fiscal year for approval to the Board of Directors as an initial step
in development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and Recommended Budget.
The most recent modification to the Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in October 2013
for the 2014 fiscal year. Those changes primarily related to clarifying that the Strategic Budget Plan
includes the current practice of including fare adjustments every three years to account for inflation
and that the Board at its discretion may consider potential fare adjustments annually at the time of
the development of the SBP. The Policy Statement was also updated with the most recent rating
agency credit ratings at the time.
DISCUSSION
For 2015, the following changes are proposed.
Fund Balance Policies #1 is amended to read as follows: “RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance
in the Base System and in the FasTracks operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures
of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as
a result of economic downturns affecting revenue.”
Under Budget Policies #1 it is stated that the budget is prepared using Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles with certain exceptions, to which is added the “exclusion of the non-cash
portion of long-term unfunded pension accruals.” This is to reflect the appropriation of only the cash
outlay of the pension obligation.
The Policy Statement is updated with the most recent rating agency credit ratings in effect at this
date.
All other proposed changes to the Policy Statement are primarily wording clarification and are
reflected in the attachment.
Please see the attachment for the full proposed document with changes indicated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Fiscal Policy Statement as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2015
Recommended Budget.

Packet Pg. 158

12.J

ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended changes to RTD’s 2015 Fiscal Policy Statement. Staff supports
this alternative because the Policy Statement documents the policies to be adhered to in 2015
and provides clarification of certain practices.
2. Board further modifies the recommended changes. Staff reviewed the fiscal policies and
welcomes any suggestions for modifications requested by the Board of Directors.
3. Do not adopt the RTD 2015 Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not recommended because
RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current language, would not adhere to
best practices, and would not best facilitate the needs of RTD’s financial operations.

2015 FISCAL POLICY STATEMENT

REVENUE POLICIES
1. Staff will plan fare adjustments every 3 years in the mid and long-term budgets to
adjust for inflation. The Board of Directors may consider potential fare adjustments
annually at the time of the development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). As
part of this process, staff will review potential fare increases adjustments to
establish a fare structure with due consideration for:
 consistency and equity throughout RTD;
 ease of use and simplicity;
 maintaining or increasing ridership and fare revenues;
 acceptability and marketability of fare structure to customers and the general
public; and
 verification and enforceability of fare payment compliance.
2. Fare policies will take into account the special needs of transit dependent, elderly,
youth, student, handicapped, and commuter patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.
6. Staff will identify on an annual basis excess property and equipment, and will
make an ongoing attempt to sell such excess property and equipment to enhance
cash flow.

INVESTMENT POLICIES
1. RTD will review its investment policy annually with the Board to ensure
consistency with the following objectives (in order of priority):
 safety of invested funds;
 maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs; and
 attainment of the maximum yield possible consistent with the first two
objectives
2. RTD will review its investment performance on a quarterly basis with the Board.

EXPENDITURE POLICIES
1. RTD will endeavor to achieve service levels that will make the transit system easier
to use, improve travel times, and be more effective.
2. RTD will continue to look for and implement the most cost-effective and reliable
methods of delivering transportation services.
3. RTD will maintain all assets at a level that protects capital investment and
minimizes future maintenance and replacement costs.
4. RTD maintains a risk management program which will provide protection against
loss and mitigate exposure to liability.
5. A safety program will be maintained to minimize RTD's exposure to liability and
thereby reduce the number of claims against RTD.
6. RTD will develop service changes that are needed to respond to budget shortfalls
using the system-wide and route-specific productivity measures that have been
approved by the Board.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT POLICIES
1. RTD will prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
including projected capital construction and improvements, service levels and

operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Capital
projects to be included in the SBP will be evaluated using the following criteria:
 total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
 source of funding;
 operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the SBP period;
 benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited
to the effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and
ridership;
 consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); consequences of not
funding; and
 RTD mission statement elements.
2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks financial plan (see 7.).
3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted SBP as the basis for
the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If
the cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be
brought to the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future
technological changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the
public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance
with the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks financial plan incorporating the
actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital
improvement costs, service levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the
FasTracks capital and operating programs.

FUND BALANCE POLICIES
1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and in the FasTracks
operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring
nature, or to meet unexpected increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions
as a result of economic downturns affecting revenue. This unrestricted fund
balance will be comprised of a Board appropriated fund, a capital replacement fund
and an undesignated working capital fund as described below. For the Base

System, the total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount
approximately equal to three months of Base System operating expenses excluding
depreciation. For FasTracks, the total of these three funds should be maintained at
an amount approximately equal to two months of FasTracks operating expenses
excluding depreciation. RTD will consider and pursue resources that will be
directed to fund balance replenishment. For example, RTD may define the revenue
sources that would typically be looked to for replenishment of fund balance to
include non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses. Year-end surpluses are an
especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as severe economic downturns. With
Board approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce
the need for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade
bond rating. The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for
scheduled major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases. The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and will take place in a prompt manner.
4. RTD will designate excess and undesignated working capital that may accrue at
each year-end to be placed in an unrestricted fund to be used to respond to
unanticipated events.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado
Constitution.
6. The Board shall establish three reserves for future construction under the
FasTracks plan:
 The FasTracks Contingency Reserve will be appropriated at a level of $30
million each year. These funds will be available to fund adjustments to the
FasTracks construction schedule, relating to logistics or cost savings
opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is adopted, and will not
be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System capital or operating activity.
 The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding
for future FasTracks projects that are currently unfunded. Expenditures from
the FISA will be subject to Board approval with the staff recommended project



goals identified in the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Funding of the FISA will be
provided from the sources identified in the Board approved RAM and other
sources approved by the Board.
All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a
reserve for future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be
used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System expenditures.

DEBT POLICIES
1. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, Certificates of Participation
(COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to exceed
the expected useful life of the asset.
2. Effective communication with credit rating agencies will be maintained, and a
policy of full disclosure on every financial report and official statement will be
followed.
3. Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures will be analyzed.
4. Debt financing will not be issued to support current operating expenditures.
It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's credit ratings at the highest reasonably attainable
level in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to
receive lower interest rates and lower debt insurance premiums than would be
possible with lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:
