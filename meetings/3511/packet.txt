BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2024-2029 Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP)

September 12, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
September 26, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2024-2029 Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
BACKGROUND
The 2024-2029 MTFP is the six-year financial forecast used as the basis for the development of the
2024 Budget and provides guidance for future year financial planning. The development of this forecast
seeks to balance planned expenditures with anticipated available funding sources in alignment with
RTD’s Strategic Plan. Adoption of the 2024-2029 MTFP by the Board is not a commitment or
appropriation of funding.
DISCUSSION
The 2024-2029 MTFP projects that the agency’s forecasted revenues and reserves are sufficient to
meet expected operational, debt service and asset management expenditures while maintaining reserves
as required by the Board approved RTD Fiscal Policy. While RTD’s financial position is forecasted to
meet the Strategic Priority of Financial Success through 2029, vigilance will be required to ensure the
agency maintains activities within the projected fiscal constraints. The 2024-2029 MTFP was developed
in consideration of a prudent, fiscally sustainable approach including provisions such as restrained sales
and use tax growth projections resulting from Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) implications. The result of
this forecast is a presentation of a fiscally conservative plan that allows for agility and scalability over
the six-year period.
2024-2029 MTFP Assumptions
• Fare revenue is based on current trends in ridership as well as the Systemwide Fare Study and
Equity Analysis provisions. Ridership is forecast to increase 9.7% in 2024 due to lower fares and
increase 2.0% annually thereafter. A modest fare increase is assumed in 2027 subject to
additional future discussions
• Sales and use tax projections provided in August 2023 by the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business project a $31.7 million decrease over the March 2023 forecast. The decrease
is primarily due to weaker collections during 2023 and lower year-over-year growth due to
forecasted Base System growth capped at 1.4% after 2024 for TABOR limits. The 1.4% Base
System growth assumption matches the assumptions from Reimagine RTD in which growth was
capped at the growth rate of property taxes in alignment with TABOR revenue growth limits

•

Operating expenses increase at an annual rate of 5.1% over the six-year MTFP period due to
inflationary assumptions. Limited increases to headcount are assumed
Asset management expenditures are included that maintain assets in a state of good repair based
on current information
Reserves are projected to increase $191.5 million during the six-year MTFP to ensure that
operating reserves of three months expenses and a capital replacement fund are maintained as
required by fiscal policies

Current Outlook
• The 2024-2029 period balances funding sources and uses while maintaining reserves
• Service levels reflect the System Optimization Plan requirements
• Funding is maintained to address the asset management backlog, plus reserves for future needs
• Debt service coverage ratio policy of 1.2x is met each year
• Reserves of three months operating expenses are met in each year
• Base System funding will continue to supplement FasTracks
• Limited new projects are included
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2024-2029 MTFP projects balanced funding sources and uses while meeting asset management
needs and fiscal policy requirements for reserves and debt service coverage ratios.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Revenue Diversification

September 12, 2023

BOARD/STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Director, District I
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The RTD Board held a Retreat on March 25, 2023, which resulted in a policy goal seeking to shore up
RTD’s financial position by creating a long-term, sustainable and resilient funding model for the agency.
RTD’s 2023 sales and use tax collections are projected to account for approximately three quarters of
RTD’s total annual revenues. The remaining one quarter of RTD’s annual revenues are comprised of
federal grants, fare revenue, investment income and miscellaneous collections. This current revenue
composition exposes RTD to financial risk from economic volatility. Furthermore, the Taxpayer Bill of
Rights (TABOR) revenue growth limitation provisions are currently expected to negatively impact RTD’s
overall revenue retention beginning after December 31, 2024, at which point future annual growth will
be limited to the growth in inflation plus property tax valuations within the District.
During the May 9, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, Vice Chair Erik Davidson and the
Chief Financial Officer presented a Discussion Item regarding this Board revenue diversification policy
goal, which included a discussion of RTD’s revenue portfolio as well as proposed activities to mitigate
the financial risks associated with reliance on a limited number of funding sources.
DISCUSSION
In a memorandum dated August 22, 2023, the General Manager and CEO informed the Board of a
Revenue Diversification Working Group that will be assembled to investigate revenue diversification and
other financial risk mitigation strategies to recommend to the Board in the coming months.
Participants in this Revenue Diversification Working Group include:
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Melanie J. Snyder, General Counsel
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
Erik Davidson, Director

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact from these activities, however, some minor costs may be incurred
through the use of professional services such as external legal counsel and financial advisory services, if
such subject matter expertise is necessary.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update

September 12, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Acting Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
Patrick Stanley, Manager, Engineering Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
In November 2004, Colorado voters approved the Regional Transportation District (RTD) FasTracks Plan
through a sales tax increase. The FasTracks Plan is a comprehensive program to construct and operate
new rail lines and improve elements of bus rapid transit (BRT), bus service and park-n-rides throughout
the region. The Northwest Rail (NWR) is a 41-mile segment of the FasTracks Plan. Six miles of the NWR
are in operation as the B Line from Denver to Westminster, with the remaining 35 miles yet to be
constructed. Between 2010 and 2021, RTD completed an Environmental Evaluation Study and the
Northwest Area Mobility Study and continuously gathered input from local transportation partners and
NWR jurisdictional partners. Based on this input, the peak service concept, in which RTD would provide
limited rail service along the corridor during morning and evening commute times, emerged as a
community-preferred alternative with the goal to minimize overall project costs.
In order to develop an updated common set of facts, on April 6, 2021, the Board of Directors granted
initial approval for staff to conduct the NWR Peak Service Feasibility Study (PSFS) to solidify project
scope, impacts, and costs.
On August 24, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the General Manager and CEO to transfer
$8,000,000 from the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) to fund the PSFS and to enter into all
required contracts to complete the study within the Board-approved budget. In April 2022, RTD provided
notice to proceed to a consulting firm to assist RTD in the planning, engineering, and outreach efforts for
the PSFS.
With the Board’s authorization, RTD staff, supported by a consulting team and jurisdictional
stakeholders, is conducting a comprehensive NWR PSFS, which will result in an independent assessment
of a plan to operate weekday commuter rail service at peak times, with three trips between Longmont
and Denver during the morning and three trips between Denver and Longmont in the evening peak
periods. The study will assess the feasibility of a peak service scenario, identify viable vehicle
technologies, fleet and infrastructure needs, lifecycle costing, risk and mitigation strategies, operational
rights within the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) corridor, and independent capital and operating

1.E.2

cost estimates. These critical components are being studied independently and may require separate
contracts for different areas of emphasis. The study includes extensive, robust community outreach.
The PSFS will support the first phase of the commitment to deliver NWR as outlined in the 2004
FasTracks plan and will assess the potential future integration of NWR and Front Range Passenger Rail
(FRPR) from Boulder to Longmont.
Staff intends to leverage the study deliverables as part of future contracts in connection with any
property acquisition, key agreements, and design and construction, should funding become available for
implementation. In a continued effort to establish and foster partnerships in the Northwest area, the
PSFS summary Scope of Work was reviewed by the northwest area stakeholders prior to the selection
of the consultant team. The stakeholders act as project ambassadors by serving as the members of the
Study Advisory Team (SAT). The SAT is comprised of representatives from the following stakeholders:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

Boulder County
City of Arvada
City of Boulder
City and County of Broomfield
City of Longmont
City of Louisville
City of Westminster
Colorado Department of Transportation
Denver Regional Council of Governments
Front Range Passenger Rail District
Commuting Solutions
Boulder Transportation Connections

The Study is being conducted through a five-milestone process:
• Milestone 1 – Peak Service Concept
• Milestone 2 – Local Plans and Commitments
• Milestone 3 – Initial Footprint
• Milestone 4 – Service Options and Partnerships
• Milestone 5 – Options, Strategies, and Next Steps
Milestones 1 and 2 are fact-finding efforts to understand Peak Service requirements and to research and
document local plans and commitments that have been made along the corridor since the EE was
conducted by RTD in 2010.
In Milestone 3, which is currently underway, the information discovered in Milestones 1 and 2 is being
analyzed to define the infrastructure requirements and costs for implementing Peak Service on the NWR
corridor.

Packet Pg. 21

1.E.2

In Milestones 4 and 5, the PSFS will identify possible partnership opportunities and funding solutions for
potential avenues for the advancement of the project.
On April 11, 2023, the PSFS study team provided a progress update to the Finance and Planning
Committee. The progress update included an overview of the NWR PSFS, a summary of the community
outreach efforts, environmental justice and equity updates, and next steps.
DISCUSSION
In conducting the PSFS, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic Priorities of
Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success.
The purpose of this discussion item is to update the Board regarding the current study status, project
schedule, community outreach efforts and next steps. Since the April 11, 2023, Finance and Planning
Committee meeting update, the PSFS study team:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Held kick-off meeting and began ongoing coordination with BNSF to identify required
infrastructure to operate passenger service on freight tracks
Analyzed potential fleet vehicles, platform configurations, and mid-day storage options
Continued the environmental justice analysis for the rail corridor and potential maintenance facility
Continued station design development in collaboration with the Northwest area stakeholders
Continued identification and analysis of the Common Set of Facts including required

What is Northwest Rail?
Proposed commuter
rail service from
Denver Union Station to
Boulder that terminates
in Longmont

35-mile extension from
Westminster Station to
Longmont would use existing
freight railroad tracks owned by
Burlington Northern Santa Fe
(BNSF) Railway

RTD is evaluating an
initial peak service
approach as a first step
toward full-day
rail service to Boulder
and Longmont

Peak Service
Concept

Voters approved a new
tax to build transit
expansion program

EE recommended
building 11 new
stations and a second
track alongside the
BNSF freight track

RTD and local transportation partners
prioritized cost-effective, near-term
mobility projects (e.g., Flatiron Flyer
and other Bus Rapid Transit projects)
to advance while pursuing Northwest
Rail as a longer-term goal

First Northwest
Rail segment to
southern
Westminster
begins service

RTD asked by
stakeholders to evaluate a
peak hour commuter rail
starter service

Base Configuration - Passing Sidings
§ Freight Passing Sidings
• Four sidings required to minimize impact on
freight operations

• Gives exclusive track time to commuter trains
in peak periods

• Freight trains would pull into sidings during

peak service times, allowing passenger trains
to have priority

• Peak Service Study Team recommended two
alternate sidings to eliminate issues with
adjacent uses and roadway crossings
