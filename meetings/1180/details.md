#### 1. Approval of I-225 Alignment Changes

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors approve a change in alignment and station location on the I-225 corridor.  This change would move the alignment along Montview Avenue at the Anschutz/ Fitzsimons Medical Campus to a new alignment in the general vicinity along Fitzsimons Parkway.  The station location will also change from Montview to along Fitzsimons Parkway.  The exact location will be defined as part of a collaborative effort with the City of Aurora, the University of Colorado stakeholders as well as public input, and also to include a transportation plan that will accommodate the needs of persons who are transit dependent to access the Anschutz Campus.  A general depiction of the changes is shown in Exhibit 1.

All changes will be made within the originally approved I-225 Project budget.
