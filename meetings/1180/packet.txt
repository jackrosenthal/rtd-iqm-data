Approval of I-225 Alignment Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors approve a change
in alignment and station location on the I-225 corridor. This change would move the alignment along
Montview Avenue at the Anschutz/ Fitzsimons Medical Campus to a new alignment in the general
vicinity along Fitzsimons Parkway. The station location will also change from Montview to along
Fitzsimons Parkway. The exact location will be defined as part of a collaborative effort with the City of
Aurora, the University of Colorado stakeholders as well as public input. A general depiction of the
changes is shown in Exhibit 1.
BACKGROUND
The I-225 corridor is a major component of the FasTracks plan. On October 20, 2009, the Board of
Directors approved the I-225 Environmental Evaluation (EE), which defined the project scope, alignment,
station locations and characteristics, impacts and mitigations. The I-225 EE was a collaborative effort
among all the corridor stakeholders including the City of Aurora and the stakeholders on the
Anschutz/Fitzsimons Medical Campus. The preferred alignment identified in the EE was the basis for an
unsolicited proposal and subsequent RFP. On July 24, 2012, the Board approved a design-build contract
for the construction of this corridor.
DISCUSSION
As shown on Exhibit 1, part of the alignment through the Anschutz/Fitzsimons Campus travels along
Montview Avenue. Agreements with the City of Aurora and the Fitzsimons Redevelopment Authority
(FRA) required that a Metro District reconstruct the Montview roadway to accommodate a corridor for
the I-225 light rail line and future traffic and development needs. However, funding by the third party
for this construction is not in place and the imminent construction of light rail places new urgency on
reconstructing the Montview roadway. LRT speeds along Montview will be slow (approximately 15
mph), governed by traffic signals and with up to six at-grade crossings.
The University of Colorado and FRA have major plans to make Fitzsimons a preeminent, international
medical research facility. This development has the potential to be a major economic driver for the
region.
The University of Colorado staff has raised concerns about the impacts of electromagnetic interference
(EMI) and vibration and the ability to develop the site to potential. We have learned that medical
research and technology has become increasingly sophisticated and highly sensitive to environmental
influences. EMI generated from the LRT trains may interfere with the sensitive equipment forcing it to
be located far from Montview. Similarly vibration from the trains can interfere with the operation of this
sensitive equipment. Similar mitigation efforts by other transit agencies for EMI and vibration adjacent
to existing medical research facilities are extremely expensive, with no assurance that they will achieve
the desired mitigation.

Packet Pg. 37

1.C.1

The understanding of the impacts of electric trains on adjacent medical facilities has been rapidly
developing in the past few years. Seattle and Minneapolis transit systems recently had to agree to
elaborate mitigation. Some of the mitigations they are using have never been tried in actual service and
their agreements require extensive ongoing monitoring and additional mitigation or adjustments if the
measures do not achieve their desired results.
Potential mitigations for EMI include precisely located underground power feeder system. A floating slab
(which is a very large concrete slab located under the trackway and resting on rubberized pads or
springs) would be applied to reduce low frequency vibration from the trains. The cost of these
mitigations along with delay costs and asbestos removal in Montview is estimated at approximately $58$60 million. A schedule delay of one to two years for the project, if the alignment were to remain on
Montview would also be incurred due to the re-design, additional work and time to negotiate a final
agreement.
The University of Colorado does not wish to be in an uncompetitive situation regarding its ability to
attract national and international medical research to its campus.
Therefore, the University of Colorado sent a letter (Exhibit 2) requesting that RTD move the alignment
from Montview to an alternative site along Fitzsimons Parkway. This relocation will eliminate their
concerns. Although there may be some initial decrease of ridership due to the station move, the letter
states that CU is planning to take measures that enhance ridership including the use of shuttles from the
Fitzsimons Parkway station, a parking garage and development around the station.
An update to the Environmental Evaluation would be performed if the Board approves this change. The
update would include coordination with affected stakeholders and a public involvement process. The
updated EE would identify any environmental challenges and mitigations required for this new alignment.
To avoid additional costs, design and construction of certain elements can proceed during the
environmental process.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The final cost for the change in alignment to Fitzsimons Parkway will be developed as design progresses.
The cost will be within the corridor budget and will not require funds from other parts of FasTracks or
RTD’s budget. The cost of the recommended alignment could be less than that for the original
alignment along Montview.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors approve a change in alignment and station location on the I-225 corridor. This
change would move the alignment along Montview Avenue at the Anschutz/Fitzsimons Medical
Campus to a new alignment in the general vicinity along Fitzsimons Parkway. The station location
will also change from Montview to along Fitzsimons Parkway. The exact location will be defined as
part of a collaborative effort with the City of Aurora, the University of Colorado stakeholders as well
as public input. A general depiction of the changes is shown in Exhibit 1.
2. Do not accept the recommended action. Instead leave the alignment along Montview and build the
appropriate mitigations required by the University of Colorado. This is not recommended because the
additional cost($58-$60 million) is not in the project budget, a schedule delay of one to two years
will result and there is no assurance that the mitigations will be effective, putting the medical
campus in a potential non-competitive situation (nationally and internationally) and RTD at risk for

Packet Pg. 38

1.C.1

further mitigation efforts.
3. Do not accept the recommend action. Instead continue to negotiate with the University of Colorado
to reduce the mitigations required. This is not recommended as there is no certainty as to the
timeframe or success of these negotiations. The project would need to be stopped through this area,
causing a significant cost and schedule delay while negotiations continue for an undetermined
amount of time.

Subject:

North Metro Segment 2, Phase 1
Commuter Rail Project Property Acquisition

Clarke

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: June 11, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the North Metro
Segment 2 (Stock Show to 72nd Avenue), Phase 1 Commuter Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed
with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law and to provide the General Manager or
designee with authority to enter into all contracts necessary to consummate real property transactions.
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the successful proposer for the construction of the
North Metro Segment 2, Phase 1 Commuter Rail Project the right of way necessary for the construction
of the project. Properties identified to be acquired in the North Metro Segment 1, Phase 1 were certified
by passage of Resolution No. 11 Series of 2011 in September 2011. Property needs will be identified
and specific legal descriptions prepared beginning the formal acquisition process. This process begins
with good faith negotiations, but may ultimately result in court proceedings under eminent domain law.
Staff would like to proceed with the acquisition of all property identified, subject to any modifications or
additions required by the contractor and/or construction activities.
DISCUSSION
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by design and authorize the
General Manager and/or Property Managers to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition in this action is included in the North Metro budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties
as necessary for construction of the North Metro Segment 2 (Stock Show to 72nd Avenue), Phase
1 Commuter Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state
eminent domain law and to provide the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into
all contracts necessary to consummate real property transactions.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ___ SERIES OF 2013
NORTH METRO SEGMENT 2, PHASE 1 COMMUTER RAIL PROJECT
PROPERTY ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the North Metro Segment 1 Commuter
Rail Project; and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed that attached Right of Way plans tabulation sheets, which list
the property to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just compensation
to acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate
condemnation proceedings to acquire the Properties and to obtain immediate possession of the
properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall have the
authority to amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of the Properties as it
deems necessary in the best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to exercise the
power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title 38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by the North
Metro Segment 2, Phase 1 Commuter Rail Project, although financially compensated according
to the law, makes a significant personal sacrifice for the public good, a sacrifice not made by
others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public purpose, that
there is a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within the corridor for and in
furtherance of a public purpose, and that the acquisitions are for the benefit of the public
health, welfare and safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Managers, as the Board’s
delagatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.

Packet Pg. 45

1.C.2

The Board directs that the RTD delagatees should negotiate in good faith for the
acquisition of the property and if the delagatee is unable to acquire any property through good
faith negotiations, then the RTD may acquire such property through the exercise of the power
of eminent domain.
The Board further resolves to make every possible effort to communicate with property
owners, to recognize time constraints that may impact them, and to address concerns of
owners to the maximum extent feasible without negatively impacting the Project.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of the Properties
as soon as permitted by law.
The Board directs that the General Manager or delegatee shall have the authority to enter
into all contracts necessary to consummate real property transactions.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: June 6, 2013

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

June 5, 2013

Board Meeting Date: June 11, 2013

Subject:

Easement for Brainard Drive Relocation Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all documents necessary to convey a non-exclusive
drainage easement over 10,881 square feet (0.249 acres), more or less in Section 28, Township 1
South, Range 69 West, City and County of Broomfield, State of Colorado.
BACKGROUND
In 1997, RTD acquired property for future transit facilities in the vicinity of the interchange of US 36 and
96th Street in the city limits of Broomfield. The City of Broomfield held an option on approximately 56
acres of vacant land and lacked sufficient available funding to exercise the option prior to its expiration
in late 1997. RTD desired to secure a portion of the property, at that time below the current market
value and pursuant to an IGA between RTD and the City of Broomfield, RTD exercised the option on the
56 acres. The City of Broomfield had the right to purchase up to 46 acres of the land from RTD at the
original option price prior to the end of 2002. RTD retained 10 acres for future development of a transit
center/park-n-Ride facility. On the property retained by RTD, the Flatiron park-n-Ride was developed.
DISCUSSION
The City and County of Broomfield will acquire a permanent easement from RTD for drainage. The
Colorado Department of Transportation, BNSF and Broomfield desire to relocate the BNSF siding tracks
in Broomfield so that the siding tracks will no longer cross two roadway intersections. In order to do
this, Broomfield must relocate the location where Brainard Drive connects to Midway Boulevard. This is
generally shown on the attached graphic.
The value of the proposed easement has been determined by CDOT and the City and County to be 90%
of the fee value of $2.00 per square foot or $19,586 for the 10,881 square foot easement.
Valuation was based on appraisal work done by Douglas P. Agne, MAI of Pinnacle Evaluation. His
appraisal of adjacent property to the north of the RTD parcel conclude land valuation at $0.55 per
square foot as but also valued the property at $1.33 per square foot if sold for transit oriented
development. The Broomfield City council approved a Purchase and Sale Agreement of the adjacent
north five acres at their April 23, 2013 meeting at $1.00 per square foot.
The grant of this easement will not preclude future development and will in fact enhance future access
to the RTD parcel.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD will receive $19,586 in compensation for the easement.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all

documents necessary to convey a non-exclusive drainage easement over 10,881 square feet (0.249
acres), more or less in Section 28, Township 1 South, Range 69 West, City and County of
Broomfield, State of Colorado.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all documents necessary to
convey a non-exclusive drainage easement over 10,881 square feet (0.249 acres), more or less in
Section 28, Township 1 South, Range 69 West, City and County of Broomfield, State of Colorado.

Factors Affecting Opening Day Light Rail Ridership

• Rule of thumb: minimum time to establish new
travel patterns is at least 6-12 months
• Seasonality
– West Rail Line opened at end of school year
(Auraria and Red Rocks campuses finishing spring
semester)
• High ridership when schools are in session

– Low ridership in “vacation” months such as
summer months and December
