BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Internal Audit Activities

Committee Meeting Date:
March 2, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager of Internal and IT Audit
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Internal Audit was introduced to the Regional Transportation District in 1979, to enhance and protect
organizational value by providing risk-based and objective assurance, advice and insight. Information
Technology Audit was added to the functions’ responsibility in 2015. The Internal Audit Charter was
introduced in 2015 as a service level agreement with the Board of Directors so that there is a clear
understanding of the role, purpose and position of Internal Audit within the organization and the scope
and nature of its work.
DISCUSSION
Section 32-9-115(3), C.R.S, requires the State Auditor to conduct a performance audit of RTD at least
once every five years. The recent State Audit concluded that RTD has not utilized its Internal Audit unit
to effectively identify and respond to organizational risks. Hence, it was recommended that the agency
improve the internal audit unit's effectiveness and compliance with Internal Audit Standards and
establish procedures and expectations for the unit to be utilized, supervised and evaluated. The results
of the State Audit caused consideration of an independent evaluation of the function with the objective
of addressing the State recommendations while improving the Internal Audit function.
In January, the General Manager and CEO sent a formal request to the American Public Transportation
Association (APTA) requesting a peer review of the agency’s Internal Audit function. The request for
the peer review was received by APTA and recently commenced in mid-February.
An APTA peer review is designed to assist the requesting agency in addressing agency specified issues
through subject matter experts within the transit industry. Coordinated by APTA with the requesting
agency, the subject matter experts, who typically are from peer agencies, convene at the requesting
agency and conduct an intensive review of the issues to be addressed. Due to the pandemic this peer
review will be held virtually.
The peer review typically includes the following:
• Introductory meeting including the peer review panel and agency representatives
• Briefing by agency as to background for the peer review request and issues to be addressed
• Presentations and/or briefings by agency staff
