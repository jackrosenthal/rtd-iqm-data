Local Government Relations Update

The following are items for July 5, 2016:
1. CCA Transportation Funding Proposals – The Colorado Contractors Association decided
to hold off on pursuing an initiated tax increase ballot measure in 2016. The 10 proposals
lacked dedicated funding for transit and other multi-modal transportation (bicycle,
pedestrian, etc.) and revenues generated would have been inequitably distributed.
2. CML Summer Conference – The Colorado Municipal League (CML) held its summer
conference June 21-24. CRL hosted a dinner which was well attended by elected
officials and city managers from the metro area.

Re:

Update

The Joint Budget Committee reviewed the June revenue forecast on June 15th. Overall, the
forecast shows slow economic growth in both Colorado and the US in 2016 and 2017. The
numbers do not show Colorado moving into a recession but there was a great deal of caution
from both forecasts on the economic landscape for Colorado.
According to the Legislative Council forecast FY2016-17, General Fund revenue is expected to
be $268.3 million which is 2.6 percent short of the amount needed to fully fund the budget and
the required reserve. The OSPB forecast shows a smaller shortfall a budget difference. While
concerning, the June forecast is the least impactful as there are many months between now and
when budget decisions need to be made for the next fiscal year.
According to both forecasts, no TABOR refunds are expected for tax years 2016 and 2017,
however there is a possibility of a refund in tax year 2018.
In FY2015-16 (current budget year, ending on June 30, 2016) no funds are expected to be
diverted from the General Fund as a result of SB16-218 The BP America Production Co vs.
Colorado Department of Revenue. Severance tax revenues are expected to be sufficient to
address the current refunds. There is significant uncertainty on the amount of future refunds
moving forward. The Department of Revenue is in an extensive rulemaking process to look into
the issue further and it is expected that in October DOR would have a better idea of the transfer
amounts.
The primary was held on June 28th. BBMK will provide an update on key races and how this
might impact the balance of power in the House and Senate.
The Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) has scheduled two tours in July
visiting Craig, Glenwood Springs, Alamosa and Antonito. The first legislative meeting is on
August 1st which will include a presentation from CDOT and discussion of HB16-1031 a bill
sponsored by Rep. Carver and Senator Cooke that looked at changes to the transportation
commission districts.
BBMK has been following the potential ballot initiatives of interest to the District. To date all
the ballot initiatives proposed that would have attempted to fund transportation projects and
transit have been removed from the ballot by the proponents.

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: JULY 5, 2016



The Senate has passed its Transportation/HUD (“THUD”) appropriations bill to fund
federal transportation programs for the coming year. While most highway and transit
programs are funded directly through the FAST Act independent of the appropriations
process, the Senate THUD appropriations bill does provide funding for the very popular
transit New Starts and TIGER programs.



The House has passed its THUD appropriations bill out of Committee – providing robust
funding for New Starts and TIGER as well – but further action on the THUD bill in the
House is unlikely, as floor consideration of appropriations bills has been stalled by
controversial amendments and a sit-in over gun control legislation.



What’s next? It is a near certainty that Congress will not be able to pass all 12 individual
appropriations bills this year. Instead, Congress is expected to pass a short-term Continuing
Resolution before the end of the federal fiscal year (on September 30) to fund all
departments and programs of the federal government at current-year funding levels for
several weeks – likely until mid-November when Congress re-convenes after the presidential
election.



During their lame duck session after the election, Congress is expected adopt an Omnibus
appropriations bill to fund all agencies and programs federal government for the remainder
of FY 2017.

Announcement of TIGER Grant Awards Expected:




Within the next several weeks, it is widely understood that US DOT will announce the
projects to be awarded funding under the eighth round of the TIGER program. RTD seeks
up to $12.85 million in TIGER funding for proactive state of good repair work on the aging
Central Corridor.
TIGER remains a highly popular and intensely competitive grant program for innovative,
multimodal capital projects. US DOT announced in June that 585 TIGER applications
seeking $9.3 billion were submitted for the $500 million in available TIGER funding – so
project applications total almost 19 times the available funding.

Little Progress on Transportation Spending Bills for Fiscal Year 2017:
Congress continues to focus on advancing appropriations bills – with limited success.
