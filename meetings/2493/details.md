#### 2. State Update - Brandeberry McKenna

Jenifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry~McKenna (BBMK), commented that the major event at the State Capitol this time of year is the budget.  She said there has been some forecasting done but the more relevant numbers will be available in the fall.  She stated preliminary forecasts for Fiscal Year 2016-2017 show the General Fund revenue is expected to be 2.6% short of the amount needed to fully fund the budget and required reserve.

Jenifer Brandeberry indicated BBMK has also been following the Colorado Primary Elections.  She said BBMK would provide the Board with a summary of the outcomes.  She shared that BBMK will be meeting with the candidates prior to the fall election.  She pointed out that the Senate is Republican controlled by one seat so she anticipates a lot of money will be spend on those contested seats.

Jenifer Brandeberry indicated the Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) has posed their schedule with the first two meetings being State tours.  She stated the first legislative meeting will be on August 1 with a presentation from CDOT and a discussion of House Bill 16-1031 related to changes to transportation commission districts.

Director Francone thanked Jenifer Brandeberry for her update.  She shared she recently spoke with Senator Baumgartner and he indicated he was still interested in moving his bill forward (Senate Bill 16-210) related to fixing Colorado’s roads.  She said any assistance or guidance BBMK could provide would be appreciated.

Director Bagley wondered if Jenifer Brandeberry had a sense of how accurate the shortfall projections are for the next Fiscal Year.  Jenifer Brandeberry explained that traditionally those figures really do shift over the summer and fall.  She noted Colorado is fairly healthy fiscally because of the constitutional restraints.  She believes there will be a large debate about infrastructure and funding.  Director Bagley thinks there is a lot of uneasiness and risk avoidance given the uncertainty between now and the election.  He stressed the importance of the Board being thoughtful and understanding that the economic situation may get worse from what is forecasted.

##### a. State Update for 7-5-16

#### 3. Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs, noted both the House and Senate are back in session.  He indicated the Senate has passed their appropriations bill related to transit which included $150 million for the Eagle P3 project.  He said the House has only managed to get their transportation bill out of committee.  He believes there will be continuing resolutions for appropriations through the November elections.

Mike Dino reminded the Board that RTD submitted an application for a Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant in the amount of $12 million for State of Good Repair work along the Central Corridor.  He noted there were 585 TIGER applications submitted seeking $9.3 billion in funding for the $500 million that is available, so the grant process will be highly competitive.

Committee Chair Folska shared that when she was in Washington, D.C. for the Accelerate Colorado trip she heard that Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chair Shuster was interested in coming to Denver for a tour and visit.  She asked if anyone had followed up on this.  Mike Dino indicated he would look into Congressman Shuster’s schedule and what he would be interested in visiting.
