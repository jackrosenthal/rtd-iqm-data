BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Salaried Trustee Appointment

February 14, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
February 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve Resolution No. ______, Series of 2023, replacing Leah Riley, Chief
Administrative Officer, with Charlene Polege, Chief People Officer as Trustee with a term expiring
December 31, 2023, replacing Kent Enwright, Manager, Labor Relations with Adam Barnett, Manager,
Total Rewards as a Trustee with a term expiring December 31, 2024, extending the December 31, 2022
expired term of Bill Weidenaar, Manager, Technical Services as a Trustee through December 31, 2024,
extending the December 31, 2022 expired term of Director Bob Broom as a Trustee through December
31, 2024 and replacing Director Peggy Catlin, whose term expired December 31, 2022 with Director
Bobby Dishell as a Trustee with a term expiring December 31, 2024 for the Salaried Employee Defined
Benefit Pension Plan (DB plan) and Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Retirement Plan (DC plan).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 001, Series of 2008 (Resolution No.
1), which established a committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee
Pension Trust Fund, and the Finance Chair (i.e., the Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit
Committee as it existed at that time) to screen applications from prospective pension and DC plan
Trustees from among “the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management
salaried employee class and…[to] bring recommendations back to the Board.”
As a revision to the process established in Resolution No. 001, the Board adopted Resolution No. 27,
Series of 2010, which stated that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have served satisfactorily and in
whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to seek applications
for renewal, and instead the application process established by the Board in 2008 would be used on
those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or appropriate to appoint new salaried Trustees to
the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008, Series of 2016 (Resolution No. 008), the RTD Board of
Directors amended the Defined Benefit Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Retirement Trust
(Trusts, collectively) to remove the “senior” and “middle” management distinction established in
Resolution No. 001. Instead, Resolution No. 008 authorized the Board to appoint two employee Trustees

1.D.1

who participate in the pension plan and two who participate in the DC plan, as well as two Directors
appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a permanent member of the Trusts, to
serve as the same Trustees on both trusts.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priorities of Employee Ownership and Financial Success.
RTD provides a defined benefit pension plan to non-represented (salaried) employees hired before
January 1, 2008, and a defined contribution retirement plan to salaried employees hired thereafter. Each
plan is currently overseen by a Board of Trustees comprised of four RTD staff, two RTD Board members
and the RTD Chief Financial Officer serving as a permanent Trustee. RTD staff Trustees are
recommended to the RTD Board by the General Manager and CEO for appointment and the RTD Board
Chair, with full RTD Board approval, appoints two RTD Board members as Trustees.
This action item seeks Board approval to modify the Trustee composition of these Trusts with the
following:
• Replace Trustee Leah Riley, Chief Administrative Officer, with Charlene Polege, Chief People
Officer, as a Trustee with a term expiring December 31, 2023
• Replace Trustee Kent Enwright, Manager, Labor Relations, with Adam Barnett, Manager, Total
Rewards, with a term expiring December 31, 2024
• Extend through December 31, 2024, the term of current Trustee Bill Weidenaar, Manager,
Technical Services, that expired on December 31, 2022
• Extend through December 31, 2024, the term of current Board member Trustee Director Bob
Broom, whose term expired December 31, 2022
• Replace Board member Trustee Director Peggy Catlin, whose term expired December 31, 2022,
with Director Bobby Dishell to a term expiring December 31, 2024
• No change to current Trustee Bill Sirois, Manager, Transit Oriented Communities, with a term
expiring December 31, 2023
• No change to the Chief Financial Officer position as a permanent member
The above actions will result in a body of seven Trustees with two of those Trustees, Mr. Weidenaar
and Mr. Sirois, being participants in the closed defined benefit pension plan.
The appointment of these Trustees will focus Trust governance with employees who participate in and
represent staff colleagues participating in these retirement plans, have expertise in the areas of human
resources, health and wellness benefits and finance as well as maintain Board participation in the
salaried employee retirement Trusts in its capacity as a policy-making body.
Further, the Trust plan documents will continue to require Board approval for changes in plan design and
annual budget appropriation in addition to any material changes to the plans coming to the Board
through the Audit Committee.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Town of Parker Anthology Annexation

February 14, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
February 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the annexation petition from Anthology Management for inclusion
of a 984-acre parcel into the District. Upon approval of this annexation, the area would become part of
District G, currently represented by Director Bouquet.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager, Planning Department
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Section 32-9-106.7, Colorado Revised Statutes, provides a process for areas outside the RTD boundary
to petition into the District. Specifically:
32-9-106.7. Additional district area – petition or election – required filings – definitions. (1) (b) For
any area in an incorporated or unincorporated portion of any county containing multiple parcels of
land, any of which is less than 35 acres and which area is contiguous to any boundary of the district,
the area may be included in the district after one of the following conditions is met:
I.One hundred percent of the owners of the land within the specified area, including the owners of
any land constituting a planned unit development or subdivision, submit a petition to the
board seeking inclusion in the district. The petition shall contain a legal description of the land,
shall state that assent to the inclusion is given by the fee owner or owners thereof, and shall
be acknowledged by the fee owner or owners in the same manner as required for the
conveyance of land.
II.(A) A petition requesting an election for the purpose of including the specified area in the district
signed by at least eight percent of the eligible electors who reside within the geographic
boundaries of the area is submitted to the board. The petition shall contain a legal description
of the area.
Pursuant to 32-9-106.6 (1) (b), Colorado Revised Statutes, any area annexed by an in-District
municipality on or after May 25, 1994, is automatically included in the District. However, many
properties within the Town of Parker, including the property in question, were annexed to the Town of
Parker prior to 1994 and, accordingly, are not included within the District boundaries, thereby creating a
checkerboard of properties that lie within and outside the boundary.

Packet Pg. 9

1.D.2

The applicant, Anthology Management, owns 100 percent of the property and has submitted an
annexation petition to RTD, which includes a legal description of the property in the Town of Parker. The
petition has been reviewed by Legal Division staff for legal sufficiency; the legal description has been
further reviewed by RTD’s boundary mapping consultant.
The property is in the Town of Parker and contains approximately 984 acres west of South Parker Road
in the general vicinity of an area defined by Motsenbocker Road, Hess Road, Stroh Road and
undeveloped land to the west. The land is mostly vacant, although zoning will allow for a mix of
approximately 23 acres for commercial use with the remaining land zoned as open space and residential
uses, allowing up to 3,082 residential units in a mix of single and multifamily residences.
The land is contiguous with the current District boundary along several boundaries to the north, east and
south side of the land to be annexed. The proposed annexation is located adjacent to Director District G.
Currently, the nearest transit service to the property is provided by the P Regional route, which runs
along South Parker Road, approximately two miles east of the property. The Board-adopted System
Optimization Plan does not envision new service to this area.
DISCUSSION
Upon the Board’s approval of the Anthology Management’s petition, the area would become part of
District G, currently represented by Director Bouquet.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of
Community Value. Currently, much of the Town of Parker is within the RTD boundary, but substantial
pieces lie outside, thereby creating confusion among residents as to whether they are required to pay to
park at Park-n-Rides or whether they are subject to the RTD sales and use tax. Inclusion of additional
areas of the town into the District will serve to alleviate this issue to some extent.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Financial impacts to RTD from this action include an undetermined amount of additional revenue from
sales tax and use taxes from the commercial properties and relatively small amounts from automobile
sales to residents of the area. There may also be future expenditures should RTD opt to expand transit
services to this area. The Board-adopted System Optimization Plan does not envision new service in the
immediate area; however, the Subregional Service Councils and the Call for Projects Partnership Program
provide an avenue for ongoing dialogue and potential funding for new services, if desired.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis Update

February 14, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights Division
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Since RTD implemented the most recent fare changes derived from the Pass Program Study
recommendations in 2019, the agency has received feedback from many customers and stakeholders
stating that current fares and pass programs are overly expensive and complicated. RTD is also
experiencing other changes that affect the outlook on fare policy. Like many other agencies in the United
States, there has been a consistent trend of declining ridership over the last several years. That trend
dramatically worsened due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The intent of the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis has been to explore simplifying fares to
make services more equitable and easier to understand while aligning fares with the service value
provided. Unlike previous studies, this study has taken a customer-centric approach, focusing on equity,
affordability and simplicity. Also included in the study was the exploration of the trade-offs associated
with lowering fare revenue targets to accomplish broader goals related to affordability and ridership.
Like most transit systems, RTD collects fares from customers who use the system. The fares contribute
to the operating costs of the system. It should be noted, however, that fares cover only a portion of the
cost for RTD to provide service. The percentage of operating costs covered by fares is known as the
“farebox recovery ratio.” Prior to the pandemic, the farebox recovery ratio was approximately 15%; that
ratio is now less than 10%.
Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide public transit service within the Denver
region. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit
service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and
reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 (Environmental
Justice). The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires transit agencies to assess whether a
proposed fare change would have a “disparate impact” on minority populations or represent a

Packet Pg. 23

1.E.1

“disproportionate burden” on low-income populations. A preliminary fare equity analysis will be
conducted on the fare alternatives prior to release of the alternative to the public.
A subsequent analysis will be conducted prior to the Board considering a final recommendation. An
average fare analysis will be a key component of the equity analyses. The average fare analysis will help
RTD understand the cumulative impacts of the proposed fare changes and determine whether minority or
low-income customers are adversely impacted or whether overall customers disproportionately benefit
from the changes.
The three primary goals of the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis are as follows:
1. Equity: Supporting the transit-reliant and financially burdened customers; and to provide equitable
and fair access to RTD fares, products and discounts, regardless of race, color, national origin,
income status or other marginalized communities
2. Affordability: Aligning fares with the value of services received
3. Simplicity: Ensuring that fares are easy to understand, including standard discounts and
streamlined fare payment options
To ensure a community-driven process and inclusion of voices often not heard, the project team
partnered with community-based organizations to assist in reaching their respective client populations.
Those groups included the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Focus ReEntry
Cultivando
Athletics and Beyond
Denver Streets Partnership
CREA Results
Una Mano Una Esperanza

Additionally, the project team established stakeholder groups, representing larger constituencies, through
three focused feedback panels: Equity, Pass Program, and Jurisdiction. The feedback panels used
customer and community input to provide feedback to RTD on how the fare structure could best meet
the study’s goals (equity, affordability, and simplicity), fulfill customer and community needs, and
balance trade-offs among all goals and needs. The three feedback panels convened during each of the
three engagement milestones.
Membership of the feedback panels was as follows:
• Equity Feedback Panel: Representatives from different marginalized communities and
organizations working with those communities: low-income, Black, Indigenous, and People of
Color (BIPOC); English language learners; immigrant populations; people with disabilities; youth;
seniors; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ); and individuals experiencing
houselessness

•
•

Pass Program Feedback Panel: Representatives from groups participating in different pass
programs: employers, schools, universities/colleges, nonprofits, and neighborhood associations
Jurisdiction Feedback Panel: Representatives from local jurisdictions, including state, regional, and
municipal entities and transportation management organizations/associations

There have been three rounds of public engagement (milestones) as described below:
1. Milestone #1 (April/May 2022) provided the public introduction to the study. Engagement efforts
included the following:
a. The launch of a website and social media campaign
b. Customer and community meetings held in English and Spanish
c. Community partner focus groups
d. Meetings with the three feedback panels
e. An online survey asking for perspectives on the current fare structure
2. Milestone #2 (June/July 2022) provided an identification of conceptual fare options along with
conceptual evaluation criteria. Outreach efforts included the following:
a. Customer and community meetings held in English and Spanish
b. Meetings with the three feedback panels
3. Milestone #3 (October – December 2022) introduced two detailed fare alternatives to the
community and public for review. As with the previous milestones, outreach efforts included:
a. Community and customer meetings held in English and Spanish
b. A second customer survey in English and Spanish
c. Meetings with targeted focus groups
d. Meetings with the three Feedback panels
e. Meetings with community partner focus groups
f. A community-based organization survey
g. A press release and social media campaign
DISCUSSION
In conducting the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis, the agency demonstrates its commitment
to meet the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success.
The project team completed the third round of public engagement (Milestone #3), in which two detailed
fare alternatives were introduced to the community for review.
In developing the two detailed fare alternatives for public review, the project team considered the
following:
• Customer and community feedback
• Fare strategies to achieve the three study goals of equity, affordability and simplicity
• Impact on minority and low-income populations
• Other transit agencies’ fare pricing, structure and policies
• Fare pricing to maintain long-term financial sustainability
• Operational, technical and capital considerations

Alternatives for Customer and Community Consideration
The existing fare structure includes Local, Regional and Airport categories with discounts offered for
Day and Monthly passes. For reference, the following table illustrates the current fare structure:
Existing Fare Structure
LOCAL
3-Hour
$3
DAY
$6
MONTHLY
$114

REGIONAL
$5.25
$10.50
$200

The two proposed draft alternatives provided to the community in Milestone #3 were as follows:
Alternative A
3-Hour
DAY
MONTHLY

LOCAL
$2.75
$5.50
$88

REGIONAL
$5
$10
$160

AIRPORT
$10

Alternative A would lower fares overall, but would retain the Local, Regional and Airport fare levels. The
feedback that informed the development of Alternative A included the following:
• Fare prices should be lowered
• Maintain current service levels without increasing fares
• Reward frequent customers
• Lower airport fares
When measured against the project goals, Alternative A performed as follows:
• Equity: Low-income and minority customers would experience a greater decrease in fares than
other customers
• Affordability: All customers would benefit from the reduced fares, the current distance-based fare
levels (Local, Regional, Airport) would be retained, thereby aligning fares with services received.
Additionally, Local fare and monthly pass price decreases would improve transit competitiveness
against other modes
• Simplicity: Since the distance-based fare categories would remain in place, this alternative would
not address the goal of simplifying the fare structure
Alternative B

Alternative B would simplify the fare structure by combining Local and Regional fares, thereby
“flattening” the fare structure; however, an Airport fare for those traveling to or from Denver
International Airport would be maintained. Feedback that informed Alternative B included:
•
Simplify fare structure
•
Maintain current service levels without increasing fares
•
Remove distance-based fares
•
Reward frequent customers
•
Lower Airport fare
When measured against the project goals, Alternative B performed as follows:
• Equity: Since local fares would remain static, non-low-income and non-minority customers would
experience greater average fare decrease than low-income and minority customers
• Affordability: Not all customers would benefit from the elimination of the Regional fares since
there would be no reduction to the Local fare; however, the reduction of the Regional fare and
the Monthly Pass price decrease would improve transit competitiveness with other modes
• Simplicity: Simplified fare structure and payment except for Airport trips
As part of the Milestone #3 engagement, the project team conducted a survey to gauge community
support for the draft alternatives. Results from the survey are graphically depicted in the following table:

Packet Pg. 27

1.E.1

There were 3,610 survey responses. While survey participation from low-income and minority
populations increased compared to the first survey conducted in spring as part of Milestone #1, the
survey results still skew somewhat towards higher income respondents. In general, survey respondents
indicated that they preferred Alternative B because of simplicity, the lower Regional fares, and the lower
Monthly Pass prices. For low-income respondents and those respondents that completed the Spanish
version of the survey, participants expressed greater support for Alternative A since it would provide a
lower Local fare.
Proposed Draft Recommended Alternative
Based on community and customer feedback, the project team has formulated a modified version of
Alternative B to address respondents who expressed a preference for Alternative A. The modified
version of Alternative B would lower the Local/Regional fare to $2.75, the Day Pass to $5.50 and the
Airport fare to $10, as shown in the following tables, while maintaining the simplified fare structure.

The modified Alternative B responds to customer and community input by providing the following:
• Lowered Local and Airport fares
• Simplified fare structure by removing the Regional Fare category. Customers would pay a flat fare
for all travel except for trips originating or ending at Denver International Airport
• Lowered Monthly Pass multiple to reflect hybrid work schedules and reduced transit costs for
transit-reliant customers
• For Discount customers (seniors, people with disabilities, Medicare recipients and customers
enrolled in LiVE), a single price would provide access throughout the region, and a greater
discount is applied to the Monthly Pass

The proposed draft Airport pricing reduces fares for all airport travelers, with a particular focus on
lowering transit costs for airport and airline employees. Through the customer and community
engagement process, occasional travelers indicated that the 3-Hour Pass price was a “good value.”
However, customers traveling three or more days per week expressed concern that the Airport fare is
“too expensive.” As illustrated in the table above, the cost for a monthly pass would drop significantly
from $200 to $88. The cost for a 3-Hour Pass/Day Pass would be reduced to $10. A preliminary
analysis has indicated that if the Airport 3-Hour/Day Pass were to be reduced further than proposed,
potential equity impacts could arise, thereby limiting the ability to further lower that fare.

The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) allows transit agencies to charge up to twice the
comparable fixed-route fare for paratransit fares. The modified Alternative B fares would remain below
the maximum permitted by ADA and would continue to allow Access-A-Ride customers to use bus, rail
and FlexRide services for free. Additionally, the modified Alternative B would introduce LiVE fare
discounts for Access-A-Ride customers.
Proposed Changes to Existing Fare Programs
The proposed recommended draft alternative would also make changes to existing fare programs as
described in the next section.

Packet Pg. 30

1.E.1

LiVE Program
Based on input from community-based organizations (CBO), the proposed recommended alternative
would increase the income threshold for LiVE eligibility. Additionally, CBOs also expressed a need for
RTD to work with community partners to better market and expand the LiVE program. Specific
recommendations for the LiVE program include the following:
• Increase the LiVE discount from 40% to 50% to align with other Discount fares
• Increase the income threshold from 185% to 250% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)
• Develop a comprehensive outreach and engagement action plan
• Eliminate the requirement for an in-District address
• Explore expanding means testing beyond the current system (means testing determines whether
customers are qualified for the LiVE program based on a person’s income. Currently, means
testing is only done through the State of Colorado’s PEAK system, which is used to determine
eligibility for federal and state assistance programs such as the Supplemental Nutritional
Assistance Program (SNAP) and Colorado’s Medicaid program.)
Current Pass Programs
In response to customer requests for greater flexibility and predictability with the existing pass
programs, the recommended alternative would provide the following changes to the pass programs
(EcoPass, CollegePass, NECO Pass)
• Contracts would have fixed pricing for two-year periods, based on system utilization
• All trips priced will be based on full fare, Local, 3-Hour Pass price (higher Airport fare will not
apply to Pass Program participants)
• Contract minimums will be reduced to lower barriers to participation
• No bulk or customer category discounts will be applied to any pass program
• New pricing would take effect in 2024
The cost for an EcoPass contract is determined by two factors: the Service Level Area (SLA) in which a
business is located, and the business size. The current SLAs are four zones within the District defined by
the density of RTD service within the zone. As an example, SLA C is downtown Denver and SLA D is
the Denver Airport. The proposed draft alternative would simplify the system by reducing the number of
SLAs from four to three. Furthermore, the employer size categories would be combined, thereby
reducing the EcoPass pricing matrix from 16 to three unique prices.
Bulk Purchases
While RTD currently has a program for bulk purchases, the recommended alternative is to introduce an
expanded program based on input from CBOs, non-profits and businesses. The program would apply to
“retail” products (3-Hr Pass, Day Pass, 10-Rides, Monthly Pass). The program would not apply to
EcoPass participation or resellers/sales outlets/vendors, such as King Soopers and Safeway grocery
stores. The program would introduce a 10% discount for bulk fare purchases at or above $1,500.
New Pass Programs

Packet Pg. 31

1.E.1

The proposed recommended alternative would also introduce several new pass programs in response to
community and customer input. These programs are not fully formulated and require additional work and
coordination with stakeholders, including, in some cases, securing external funding.
Zero Fare for Youth
Throughout the community engagement process, the community expressed a strong desire for
establishing a zero fare for youth program. This desire spanned across all customer and stakeholder
segments.
The program would be targeted at those 19 years and younger. Even though some college students may
be eligible, no changes are proposed to the CollegePass contracts, as college freshmen are not the target
market for this program. The age-based threshold was chosen for simplicity to ensure all high school
students as well as those recently graduated are covered by the program. Given funding limitations, this
program is proposed to be introduced as a one-year pilot with the intent of seeking funding partners to
continue it as a permanent program.
Transit Assistance Grant
This program would respond to CBO/non-profit concerns about lack of accessibility of LiVE program for
clients with immediate needs. The program would address the needs of RTD’s most vulnerable
customers. The proposed recommendation includes the implementation of a grant program for nonprofits serving clients with immediate needs. The proposed recommended RTD funding for the program’s
first year would be $1 million.
Semester Pass
The Semester Pass responds to the need for an alternative to CollegePass for community colleges and
technical schools, that lack the critical mass of students who can participate in the CollegePass
program. The proposal would establish a Semester Pass, whereby participants could purchase a
discounted pass on a semester basis. The estimated price would be approximately $70 per month, or a
20% discount compared to the Full Fare Monthly Pass price.
Fare Structure Changes Considered but Not Recommended
Some proposed changes that were identified during the evaluation of conceptual alternatives are not
proposed to be advanced. Concepts that were considered, but not proposed to be advanced include:
•

•

Elimination of all fares – customers and community members did express a desire to consider
eliminating all fares. This concept would have too great of a financial impact on RTD and would
result in reductions to RTD service or reduce the number of service improvements identified in the
System Optimization Plan.
Modifications to the 3-Hour Pass and the Day Pass – feedback was expressed to consider
increasing the 3-Hour Pass to four hours and reducing the cost of the Day Pass. The 3-Hour Pass
was established in 2019 to accommodate the longest one-way trip in RTD’s system. The threehour window was not intended to accommodate round trips, even though some shorter
roundtrips can be accomplished under three hours. Similarly, the Day Pass is priced at two times

Packet Pg. 32

1.E.1

•

the price of a 3-Hour Pass and is intended as a good value for customers who take two or more
trips throughout the day.
Introduction of an Affordable Housing NECO Pass program – this concept was reviewed and
determined not to be feasible at this time. Concerns were expressed during customer and
community feedback about the potential administrative burden on affordable housing providers. In
addition, there are inconsistencies between how eligibility for affordable housing is determined –
area median income (based on a stratification of incomes in the Denver region) – and how RTD’s
LiVE program determines eligibility – federal poverty level (FPL). These two measures are not
comparable and would result in inconsistencies between the two programs. However, RTD is
committed to working with affordable housing providers to improve access for affordable housing
residents through the proposed expansion of the LiVE program.

Projected Ridership and Revenue Forecasts
Unlike previous fare study efforts, this study did not assume specific revenue targets; however, based
on direction from the Chief Financial Officer, the project team aimed to develop a recommended package
that is generally within 20% of the existing fare structure for 2024. (Note that the current Mid-Term
Financial Plan (MTFP) assumes a fare revenue decrease based on the early direction of this study.)
In addition to forecasting the revenue changes associated with a new fare structure, the effects on
ridership were also modeled. The following analysis assumes an external funding partner can be
identified after the first year of the zero fare for youth pilot. The following table illustrates 2024 forecast
ridership and revenue for the existing fare structure, the MTFP assumptions and the recommended
alternative.

Change From Existing Fare Structure

-25% to -20%

* Ranges in expected ridership and fare revenue reflect potential impacts of the Zero Fare for Youth Pilot
As shown in the table, the proposed recommended alternative would increase ridership over the existing
fare structure by approximately 8% to 14%. However, the ridership increase would be accompanied by
a revenue decrease of approximately 20% to 25% (over the existing fare structure). The corresponding
increase in ridership would not be enough to offset the financial impact of the lower fares. National
examples indicate that, in general, a fare price decrease will result in a loss of fare revenue, despite an
increase in ridership.
Transit customers typically have what is known as an “inelastic” response to price – that is to say, they
have limited sensitivity to price. The reduction in fare revenue, while significant, represents a small

Packet Pg. 33

1.E.1

impact to RTD’s overall budget (approximately 2%). No impact to service levels in the 2023-2028 MTFP
timeframe would be anticipated. This is attributed to the fact that the MTFP assumed a fare revenue
reduction starting in 2024. As noted in the table above, the 2024 MTFP assumed fare revenue is
$79.3M, which is within 1 to 7 % of estimated fare revenue under the draft recommended alternative.
The ridership and fare estimates depict the wide range of outcomes based on the scenario assumed for
the zero fare for youth program. If no zero fare for youth program is implemented, the ridership increase
would be at the low end of the range (8% increase). A zero fare for youth program would place the
increase in the high end of the range (14% increase). Likewise, with the financial assumptions, if the
program were to be implemented, but no external funding partner were to be found, the revenue
collected would be 25% less than under the existing fare structure. Should an external funding partner
be identified, revenue collections would be 20% below the existing fare structure.
Proposed Recommended Alternative Response to Study Goals
Equity
A preliminary equity analysis suggests that while low-income and minority customers will experience a
nearly 20% decrease in the average fare paid with the recommended alternative, the decrease is less
than the system as a whole. It should be noted that a 20% decrease in average fare is a substantial
benefit to these communities; and, added commitments to achieving the equity goal include changes to
LiVE pricing and eligibility, introduction of zero fare for youth pilot, the transit assistance grant program
and the discounted semester pass for college students.
In transit fare studies, there is often a trade-off between equity/fairness and simplicity goals. Through
customer feedback, participants in the Denver region expressed a strong preference to improve the
simplicity of the fare structure through this study. The study team respected that feedback and worked
to ensure that equity goals remained a key focus, and as noted, a full equity analysis will be performed
as part of the study.
Overall, the draft recommended alternative that will be presented for the Board’s consideration will:
• Lower Local fare, which is used by majority of equity population customers
• Lower Monthly Pass multiple, which enables more customers to benefit from Monthly Pass
• Expand the LiVE program
• Provide a single fare regardless of distance traveled or services used throughout the region for
Discount Fare customers
• Introduce a zero fare for youth one-year pilot program, which will address a significant segment
of equity populations and reduce transit costs for families
• Significantly decrease fares for Regional customers, which responds to the expansion of equity
populations in suburban communities
Affordability
• Lower fare levels for all RTD services, including Access-a-Ride
• Significantly reduce costs for frequent users with the lower Monthly Pass price

Packet Pg. 34

1.E.1

Simplicity
• Address confusion with the zone-based system by having a single fare to most destinations
except for Denver International Airport
• Align LiVE fare with the Special Discount fare for seniors and individuals with disabilities and
Medicare recipients, reducing the number of unique fares
• Simplify fares for customers paying discounted fares by charging same fare regardless of distance
traveled or services used
• Harmonize pricing for all discount fare customers (during zero fare for youth one-year pilot)
Next Steps
The proposed next steps are as follows:
• Board provides review and feedback on the proposed draft recommended alternative - February
14 through March 1, 2023. Board comments and questions should be sent to the Board Office
who will then forward to staff for review. A form will be provided by the Board Office for all
Board comments and questions.
• Board authorization to release a draft recommended fare structure and draft fare equity analysis
to public – April 2023
• The public review and comment on a draft recommended fare structure – May 2023
• Board consideration of final recommended fare structure and associated fare equity analysis –
July 2023
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this discussion item; however, as stated in the discussion
section above, the final recommended fare structure will yield a financial impact in Fiscal Year 2024, to
be further described in a subsequent Board presentation.
