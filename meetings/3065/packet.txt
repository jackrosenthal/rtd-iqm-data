Background
• Oct. 22: Staff presentation to the Board regarding
need for a service reduction to address operator
shortage
• Board requested staff gather input from
stakeholders on a potential service reduction
• Nov. 4 – 17: Staff conducted a two-week
input process
o 13k survey responses
o 59% indicated a desire to reduce service
to improve reliability

• Nov. 21: Staff presentation to the Board
of outreach results
• Dec. 19: Presentation to the Board of requested
proposed service reduction plan

Packet Pg. 4

Attachment: Proposed Service Reduction FINAL Dec. 19 Study Session (4059 : Potential Service

2.1.a

Current Situation
• Operator shortage continues to impact ability
to deliver current level of service
• Current service level (weekdays):
o Bus trips daily – 10,000
o Light rail trips daily – 1,000

• Trips are being dropped daily – mostly light rail
• We’re providing 99% of bus service and
96% of rail service, but at the expense
of our employees
• Weekly mandating:
o 69% of bus operators
o 42% of rail operators

Packet Pg. 5

Operator Shortage Impacts

• Affects our employees’ quality of life
• Affects our customers’ confidence level
• Affects our ability to uphold core values
of safety and reliability
• Affects our overall credibility

Recruitment and Retention
Extensive measures over past three years:
• Marketing campaign within and outside RTD
district, including colleges and tech schools
• On-vehicle advertising
• More efficient hiring process
• Job fairs, veteran/military expos
• Referral bonuses ($2,000 and $1,000)
• Pay increases
• Increased shift differential pay
• Incentive pay for mandated work and split shifts
• Increased professional funds for education
• Work environment adjustments and collaboration
with the union
• Over a 33-month period through September:
o 791 bus operators hired
o 177 rail operators hired

Packet Pg. 7

Training
Bus Operators

7-week training program:
o half in the classroom
o half behind the wheel

Light Rail Operators
11-week training program:
o 5 weeks of classroom and field training
o 5 weeks of revenue training
o 1 week for certifications
o Current training class will be ready to begin
service in mid-January; another class will begin
then

• Increase in applicants, but challenges remain:
o Processing and training new recruits
o Providing support staff to assist our operators in
mentoring, training and a buddy system

Packet Pg. 8

Framing Proposed Service Reduction
• Goal is to reduce the amount of mandating
so that working overtime is a choice rather
than a mandate
• Goal of the service plan reductions is to:
o Reduce mandating
o Uphold our core value of safety
o Improve reliability for our customers

• Would align service with our available
workforce
• Will allow opportunity to build up workforce
while providing some relief to our operators
• Will not completely eliminate our need
to mandate

Guiding Principles
Follows Board-adopted service standards:
• Service performance evaluation based on RTD service standards
• Effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit-dependent markets
• Availability of alternative services to affected riders
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and family
of services, and the ability to enhance service when possible
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to
race, color and/or national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority
populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

2.1.a

Clarifying Points
• Poorly performing service that does not
meet standards will likely not be reinstated
– these eventually would have come as
recommended changes
• Better performing service that was reduced
will be considered for reinstatement when
sufficient staffing levels are available
• Service will be reinstated during normal
service change processes
• Tonight’s information is about reductions
related to operator shortage
• Full May service changes will be presented
in January

Packet Pg. 11

Bus Service Reductions
• 6 bus routes proposed for elimination
• 19 bus routes proposed to reduce service
• Suspension of special services (BroncosRide,
BuffRide, Rockies service, RunRide)
• Routes: see attachment
• MallRide - Reduction of peak frequency to 3 minutes
• Paratransit Service
o We are committed to not impact current paratransit
services
o Those currently being served will be grandfathered in
provided they continue to reside at their current
address
o No new customers will be added to the program if
fixed routes are eliminated in their area

Light Rail Service Changes and Reductions
• E,F,R Extension:
o Ten trains per hour are required by the FTA grant agreement;
the extension is currently overserved during peak periods
o FTA was unable to grant our request to reduce the off-peak
service levels to six trains per hour
o Possibility to adjust R Line from four trains/hour to two
trains/hour to align service with the lower ridership on that
line

• D Line: Will no longer run service on weekends
• C Line: Weekend service will be expanded to provide an option
for D Line riders

• Dropped trips are still likely, but not to the current degree

Packet Pg. 13

Next Steps
• Board guidance on proceeding with proposed plan
• Standard May service changes presented to the
Board at January Ops Committee meeting
• Public input process in January/February
o 15+ public meetings – one in each district
o Will follow normal service change process

• Return to the Board in March with results of the
public input and final service plan
• Staff recommendation to approve final plan and
implement it as the May Service Change
