Subject:

Approval of 2018 Contract Amendment to
Kumar
and
Associates,
Inc.
for
the
Construction Materials Testing and Inspection
Services Contract

General

Board Meeting Date: November 28, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the 2018 Contract Amendment for Kumar and
Associates and increase the contract Not-to-Exceed amount by $1,000,000. This will result in a new
Not-to-Exceed contract amount of $6,000,000 for Construction Materials Testing and Inspection
Services.
It is further recommended that the Contract end date be extended from December 31, 2018 until
December 31, 2019 to complete work on the North Metro and SERE projects. Funds for the amendment
are contained in the 2018 Recommended Budget for the specific projects for which Kumar’s services are
utilized.
BACKGROUND
On July 15, 2008, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to Kumar and
Associates spanning August 1, 2008 through December 31, 2013, for an initial Not-to-Exceed amount
of $5,000,000. The contract also allowed for the exercise of up to five option years beyond the initial
contract period. The Not-to-Exceed amount was only expected to cover the initial contract period, with
increases to the Contract amount negotiated at each annual amendment.
Since 2008, the contract has been amended annually based on the scope of work for the year,
which included both FasTracks and Base System projects. After the initial five years and five
months, RTD exercised its option years in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017; and yet in the nearly 9½
years since contract award the Not-to-Exceed amount has never been increased. The 2018
workscope will require an increase the Contract price.
DISCUSSION
The Construction Materials Testing and Inspection Services Contract was specified for an initial term of
five years and five months, with five option years, to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s
work scope. The purpose of the annual re-negotiation of the contract was to ensure that specific tasks
and deliverables responded to the needs of RTD’s capital programs.
Kumar and Associates is a locally-based DBE firm that provides 1) Acceptance Testing of construction
materials such as concrete and soils for RTD’s smaller projects, 2) Verification Testing for large projects
whereby the contractor has been tasked with Acceptance Testing, and 3) audits of contractor testing
procedures, personnel, and equipment. They can also provide specialized testing and inspections for
unique applications such as micro-pile installation at Civic Center, weld inspections, etc.
Specific projects that will require Kumar’s support in 2018 include:



North Metro Rail Line
Southeast Rail Extension
Streets and Misc. projects
Facilities Engineering projects

Projects that will require Kumar’s support in 2019 will be limited to those in which Kumar has had an
ongoing role that requires continuity of effort, namely:
 North Metro Rail Line
 Southeast Rail Extension
RTD has established a 12% DBE Goal for this Contract. However, since Kumar and Associates is a
certified DBE, 100% of the work counts toward the DBE Goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this contract amendment is included in the 2018 Recommended Budget for the specific
projects whereby Kumar’s services will be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to increase
the board authorized contract amount with Kumar and Associates by $1,000,000 for a total Notto-Exceed amount of $6,000,000; and that the Contract end date be extended to December 31,
2019. Funds for the contract authorization are included in the 2018 Recommended Budget for
the specific projects where Kumar’s services are utilized.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Rather, authorize the General Manager to increase the
board authorized contract amount with Kumar and Associates by $500,000 for a total Not-toExceed amount of $5,500,000; and keep the Contract end date at December 31, 2018. Funds
for the contract authorization are included in the 2018 Recommended Budget for the specific
projects where Kumar’s services are utilized. This is not recommended at this time, as this
would cause a break in responsibilities at a critical time in two major corridor projects, with little
time for a new testing contractor to learn the project history and strengths/weaknesses of the
design-builders’ quality programs.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
contract amendment to Kumar and Associates. Rather, transfer the scope of work to one of the
other support contracts. This is not recommended since Kumar is satisfactorily performing as a
prime contractor with RTD and has deferred working with any of our construction contractors to
avoid conflicts of interest. Any other consultants working for RTD would have to sub-contract
this work out to one of the few qualified testing firms in the local area, most of which are
working or have worked for our contractors.
4. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
contract amendment to Kumar and Associates. Rather, re-solicit and award this work to another
testing contractor. This is not recommended at this time, as Kumar is satisfactorily performing its
work assignments on all of RTD’s current projects. Furthermore, it is anticipated that RTD will
procure a new materials testing contract in 2018 to take over testing for any new projects.
