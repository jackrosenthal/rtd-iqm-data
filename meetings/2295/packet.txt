FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: JUNE 2, 2015



As widely predicted, the House and Senate have passed a two-month extension of MAP-21
(through July 31), which President Obama has indicated he will sign, averting a shutdown of
Federal surface transportation programs on June 1.



The length of the extension was dictated by the level of revenues remaining in the Highway
Trust Fund: US DOT has estimated that Highway Trust Fund resources are sufficient to
support the Federal transit and highway programs through late July or early August.

Next Steps:


While some in Congress hope to use the next 60 days to adopt a long-term Highway Trust
Fund revenue solution, the leaders of the House and Senate tax-writing committees continue
to support another patch through the end of the calendar year.



This longer timeline keeps the Highway Trust Fund revenue solution tethered to those
committees' tax reform efforts. Their thinking is that revenues derived from changes to
corporate tax laws could be sufficient to fund a single 5- or 6-year transportation bill.



Even if tax reform could generate sufficient revenues to fund the next transportation bill,
that solution is several months – and several billion dollars – away. House and Senate
transportation leaders must find $11 billion in new revenues and/or spending cuts to offset
the transfer of General Fund revenues to the Highway Trust Fund to fund another
extension through December 2015. This exact task proved too difficult to accomplish
before May 31, resulting in the two-month patch using remaining Highway Trust Fund
resources.



At this time, there is bipartisan, bicameral unwillingness to consider the most obvious source
of additional revenues: an increase in the Federal gas tax.



The Senate committee with jurisdiction over the highway program is again taking the lead on
MAP-21 policy legislation – if not the revenue solution. The Senate Environment and
Public Works Committee has announced plans to hold a mark-up of its multi-year highway
bill on June 24. To date, no other House or Senate authorizing committee has announced
plans to mark-up reauthorization legislation, and none have released copies of their bills.

FY 2016 House Transportation/HUD Appropriations Bill:


On a party-line vote, the House Appropriations Committee on May 13 approved a spending
bill to fund the programs of the US Department of Transportation for the fiscal year
beginning on October 1. None of the amendments offered by Democrats to increase
funding for capital programs like New Starts and Amtrak, or for the highly popular TIGER
program, were adopted.



Democrats objected strongly to the funding levels in bill as a whole, urging their Republican
counterparts to fund programs at levels that would require the Committee to exceed the
sequester-imposed funding levels for this year. The White House and Congressional
Democrats continue to insist that sequester cuts cannot be accepted, but Republicans in
both the House and Senate are drafting all spending bills to fit within FY 2016 sequester
levels. It is unclear how this broader stand-off over sequestration will be resolved.
