BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2026 Comprehensive Operations Analysis

July 16, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
July 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize a transfer of $3,500,000 from the unrestricted fund, approve the
scope summary for a solicitation, and authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO), or her
designee, to enter into a contract for consulting services to conduct the 2026 Comprehensive
Operational Analysis (COA).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug Monroe, Manager, Corridor Planning (Operations)
Brian Welch, Senior Manager, Planning Technical Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
A COA is used by transit agencies to address changing travel patterns, regional growth, and mobility
needs in communities typically triennially. RTD’s COA ensures the agency effectively delivers bus and
rail services in a manner that supports its mission of making lives better through connections across the
entire service area.
In July 2022, the Board of Directors adopted the agency’s branded COA known as the System
Optimization Plan (SOP), with a planning horizon concluding in 2027. The SOP is a detailed evaluation of
travel patterns, demographics, and transit routes in the service area, and it includes recommended
modifications to RTD’s fixed-route services to better meet near-term mobility needs in the region. RTD’s
planned route reinstatements and modifications can be found in the SOP.
As is RTD’s established practice, service plan modifications will continue to be implemented three times
a year during service changes, which typically occur in January, May, and August/September.
In Q3 2025, RTD will commence efforts to conduct a new COA in 2026, focusing on future service
modifications and community needs. The process to complete an updated COA typically takes 18
months and incorporates feedback and input from customers, stakeholders, and the community.
The COA will analyze current and projected boardings, customer demand, front-line staffing levels, land
use, population growth, transit-oriented and housing developments, activity centers, and travel patterns.
The final COA will serve as RTD’s service development and delivery roadmap, ensuring the agency
remains efficient and responsive to community needs.

Packet Pg. 3

1.D.1

This budget transfer is requested so that procurement of a consultancy can commence in 2025, and the
project work can commence in early 2026.
DISCUSSION
If approved, staff will prepare a solicitation seeking consulting services to conduct the 2026 COA to
include the following primary tasks:
1. Project Management and Administration: The consultancy will control and manage the project
from start to finish.
2. Stakeholder Engagement: The consultancy will lead stakeholder engagement efforts to solicit the
opinions of the Board, staff, local municipalities, customers, and the general public. The public
hearings, as required, will also be conducted prior to any Board action.
3. Current System Assessment: The consultancy will evaluate the current fixed-route and demand
response system by analyzing the characteristics and performance of existing services. The
analysis will be reported to understand how services compare to each other and to industry
standards. The Current System Assessment will also analyze RTD’s operating and maintenance
facilities and Service Development Division policies.
4. Market Research, Market Segmentation, and Travel Demand Analysis: The consultancy will
provide a comprehensive analysis of who RTD’s current and potential customers are in order to
understand current ridership and inform decisions on future services. This will include the use of
location-based services data.
5. Framework and Strategies for Service Improvement: The consultancy will develop a framework
for improving service by presenting options for tradeoffs, service and network types, matching
travel markets and services, service design guidelines, utilizing transit priority measures, and
coordinating with non-RTD transit services.
6. Develop an Updated Transit Network: The consultancy will produce an updated transit fixed-route
and demand-response network informed by information and decisions from the previous tasks.
The updated transit network will include plans for phasing, workforce needs, infrastructure needs,
cooperating, and cost sharing with local jurisdictions, RTD operating policies, and impacts to
customers.
7. Title VI Compliance: The consultancy will ensure that all plans are compliant with Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Staff expects the project to be completed within 18 months of contract execution.
The 2026 COA will provide RTD with a new service plan moving forward. The lasting socio-behavioral
shifts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding impacts of remote work on transit
demands are now better understood; evaluating transit service delivery under current conditions will
allow RTD to better address customer needs and allocate agency resources where they can have the
greatest impact.

In adopting this recommended action, RTD seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Priorities of
Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success by developing a COA that meets the
needs of customers and the community and is reflective of RTD’s fiscal reality.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this action is derived from the 2025 budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Bus Stop Infrastructure and Accessibility Assessment
Contract Amendment

July 15, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
July 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) or her designee to
execute a change order to the contract with Nelson\Nygaard Consulting Associates, Inc.
(Nelson\Nygaard) to facilitate the completion of enhanced scope of work elements for the Bus Stop
Infrastructure and Accessibility Assessment (Project) in the amount of $231,862, increasing the total
amount not to exceed from $608,772 to $840,634.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights Division
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Delegation of Authority and Competitive Selection (Resolution
No.010, Series of 2022), the GM/CEO was authorized to enter a contract with Nelson\Nygaard on
September 25, 2024, to facilitate the Project. The original contract amount was $608,772, which falls
within GM/CEO purchasing and contracting authority. The change order increase from $608,772 to
$840,634 represents a 38% increase in the not-to-exceed amount. Resolution No.010 requires the
Board of Directors to approve contract amendments or change orders that exceed a cumulative total of
25% of the original contract amount.
As identified in the scope of work for the contract, the purpose of the Project is to develop a
comprehensive understanding of bus stop infrastructure within the RTD service area. Currently, RTD is
lacking a comprehensive, up-to-date dataset related to bus stops. The Project has also engaged local
stakeholders who have responsibilities for bus stops, since more than 96% of the stops within RTD’s
service area are controlled by others, including local jurisdictions, private property owners, and
advertising entities. The purpose of engaging local stakeholders is to develop a systemwide strategy for
enhanced investment in bus stop infrastructure and a more coordinated approach to bus stop
management and maintenance. The specific scope elements included in the contract are as follows:
Task 1 - Project Management and Administration
• Regular coordination with the RTD project management team and Planning Advisory Group
(PAG) and management of the subconsultants

Packet Pg. 6

1.D.2

Task 2 - Existing Conditions and Best Practices
• Analyze current practices regarding RTD’s transit amenities and service delivery
• Review other agencies’ bus stop infrastructure and amenities programs
Task 3 - Bus Stop Inventory and Gap Analysis
• Conduct extensive data collection on bus stop amenities, accessibility, right-of-way
ownership, and maintenance responsibilities
Task 4 - Implementation and Prioritization Strategy
• Establish bus stop typologies to organize and standardize levels of bus stop
amenities/investment
• Develop criteria to prioritize bus stop improvements
Task 5 - Governmental Stakeholder Outreach and Coordination
• Engage governmental stakeholders to improve coordination and establish a regional bus stop
improvement framework
Task 6 - Final Report
The expected completion of the Project is slated to occur in Q1 2026. Staff plans to provide an update
on the progress of the Project to the Finance and Planning Committee no later than November 2025.
Currently, the focus of the Project is on data collection under Task 3.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence. The purpose of this action is to ensure the successful
completion of the Project.
Enhanced scope items are required above what was anticipated in the original scope of work. These
additional items were requested by staff to ensure successful completion of the Project. There are
several areas where additional scope has been completed or will be completed, including:
•

Improved Internal Staff Feedback Collection and Coordination – Outside of administrative tasks
and project oversight, the current scope for Task 1 (Project Management and Administration) only
includes Consultant assistance with internal coordination to collect input from staff across
numerous business units via meetings or interviews as appropriate. The scale of this Project
requires more in-depth participation and feedback from staff identified as subject matter experts
to inform key Project deliverables, including the existing conditions and best practices memo
under Task 2, the data collection plan for Task 3, and a proposed methodology for prioritization
and implementation of bus stop improvements under Task 4. To achieve this objective, the RTD
project management team determined six Project Advisory Group (PAG) meetings will need to be
conducted and facilitated by Nelson\Nygaard. The PAG includes RTD representatives who deal
directly with bus stops from Bus Operations, Service Development, Asset Management, and

Packet Pg. 7

1.D.2

Capital Programs. The proposed change would increase the fee from $54,275 to $95,955 for an
additional fee of $41,680.
•

Right-Sized Data Collection Approach – Task 3 (Bus Stop Inventory and Gap Analysis) was
identified in the scope of work as the largest and most critical task of the Project. It was also
clarified in the original project scope that "RTD will review the scope of data collection before a
final notice to proceed is signed to ensure that the scale of the data collection effort is
commensurate with the available budget." Prior to the contract notice to proceed, the RTD
project management team agreed to defer the question on the scope of the data collection until
Nelson\Nygaard formally developed a data collection plan with the support of the project
management team and the PAG. The data collection plan has been developed and articulated that
a significant increase in budget for the data collection task is justified. After reviewing RTD's
existing bus stop data, Nelson\Nygaard with support from the RTD project management team
concluded that imagery should be collected for all bus stops versus imagining only a subset of
stops. This proposed change increased the task budget from $268,820 to $397,090, for a total
increase of $128,270.

•

Optimized Governmental and Stakeholder Outreach – The RTD project management team
determined that adding eight additional county workshops to the Project is critical to garner
additional buy in from external stakeholders on a regional framework for investment in bus stops.
This additional scope was not added to the original contract signed by Nelson\Nygaard in
September 2024 and was deferred for future consideration. The need for eight additional
workshops was determined to be the optimal amount after further discussion between
Nelson\Nygaard and the RTD project management team. The RTD project management team is
proposing to add this additional scope at this time. The proposed budget for Task 5 would be
changed from $54,204 to $116,116, for a total increase of $61,912.

Summary of Contract Amendment
The costs for the enhanced and additional scope are summarized below:
Task 1 – Project Management
$41,680
Task 3 – Bus Stop Inventory and Gap Analysis
$128,270
Task 5 – Governmental and Stakeholder Outreach
$61,911
Total:
$231,862
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this change order in the amount of $231,862 would come from the unallocated Project
funds originally approved in the 2025 budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project Progressive Design
Build Contract Award

July 15, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
July 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) or her designee to enter
into a progressive design-build (PDB) contract with Flatiron Dragados-Herzog Downtown Rail Joint
Venture (FDHJV) for the remaining phases of the Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project (DRRP),
consisting of design and full-depth reconstruction of light rail tracks from 7th Street and West Colfax
Avenue to 30th Street and North Downing Street in an amount not to exceed $125,000,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Acting Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Central Corridor (Corridor) is the oldest rail segment in the agency’s light rail system, having
opened for revenue service on Friday, October 7, 1994. The Corridor extends 5.3 miles from I25·Broadway Station to 30th·Downing Station. With the Corridor approaching its 30th year in continuous
revenue service, several paved track segments along the Corridor require full-depth reconstruction, and
associated rail infrastructure requires replacement as part of long-term operations and maintenance of
RTD’s assets to improve safety and mobility, address aging transit infrastructure, and extend the design
life of the agency’s key transportation assets.
Maintaining the agency’s assets in a state of good repair through sound asset management principles
furthers RTD’s Strategic Initiative of Back to Basics. These principles involve identifying, funding, and
implementing projects to replace assets as they meet their expected useful life.
DISCUSSION
As presented to the Board by the GM/CEO at the March 25 and June 24, 2025, Board meetings,
respectively, RTD is completing the DRRP in four phases. Phase 1 was successfully completed in
September 2024 and focused on track reconstruction at five key intersections in downtown Denver.
Under the PDB contract, FDHJV will perform design and construction work required to replace the rail
and associated substructure and upgrade certain stations in downtown Denver from 7th Street and West
Colfax Avenue to 30th Avenue and North Downing Street (Phases 2 through 4), except for the Kalamath
Street portion of Phase 3, which will be performed under a separate contract authorized by the Board on
June 24, 2025.

Packet Pg. 10

1.D.3

The approximately 10,000 linear feet of track and crossing replacement will complete the track
replacement through these corridors and limit the need for future disruption of service for required
maintenance.
Design for this work is anticipated to commence immediately upon execution of the PDB contract with
construction of Phases 2 and 3 anticipated to be completed by August 2026 and construction of Phase
4 anticipated to be completed by September 2027.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Priorities
of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success.
Solicitation Overview
On December 2, 2024, RTD advertised a solicitation for a PDB contractor to complete the DRRP.
Proposals were received April 7, 2025.
After evaluation of responsive proposals based upon the published evaluation criteria, a seven-member
technical proposal evaluation panel and a three-member cost proposal panel scored the proposals.
FDHJV was the highest scoring proposer and is recommended for award.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the contract, in an amount not to exceed $125,000,000, is included in the 2025 Budget.
RTD has submitted a Congressionally Directed Spending/Community Project grant application to the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) for $4,850,000 to supplement this RTD funding. This award, if
received from the FTA, will be used for the design of Phases 2 and 3.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with A.D. Miller Services, Inc., for the replacement of 15 bus hoists at the East Metro Bus

BACKGROUND
As part of the agency’s asset management renewal process, staff identified 15 original bus hoists that
have met their useful life and require replacement. These hoists were installed during the building’s
construction in 1977, and the existing hoists have been repaired and had parts replaced for more than
45 years.
The hoists will be replaced with new scissors and platform lifts.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Priorities
of Community Value, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success.
On March 27, 2025, RTD issued a solicitation for a contractor to complete the Hoist Replacement
project based on prepared plans and specifications. Proposals were due on May 23, 2025. The
evaluation committee recommends A.D. Miller Services, Inc., as the most qualified proposer.
Should the Board approve this recommendation, the contractor will phase installation of the lifts to
accommodate maintenance operations. The project is expected to be completed within 18 months
following contract award.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Up to $2,829,048.00 of the costs of this project will be paid for through a Colorado Department of
Transportation award. The remaining cost will be funded from existing capital improvement dollars
allocated in the 2025 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
US-36 and Sheridan Bus Platform Expansion Contract
Award

July 15, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
July 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with Krische Construction, Inc., for the expansion of the eastbound US-36 and Sheridan Station
bus boarding platform from four to eight bus bays for a total not-to-exceed amount of $3,321,093.62.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Acting Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The existing eastbound bus boarding platform at US-36 and Sheridan Station is configured to include
four straight bus bays that serve all eastbound Flatiron Flyer (FF) trips in addition to local routes. When
all routes are running at capacity, the limited amount of bus bays is insufficient, resulting in operational
inefficiencies and impacts to service.
With this project, the bus loading plaza will grow from the current four, straight bus bays to eight bus
bays total (six sawtooth and two straight). The addition of four sawtooth bus bays and the
reconfiguration of two of the existing straight bus bays to sawtooth bus bays will result in an increase in
operational efficiency, ease of use by RTD bus operators, and improved customer orientation and
experience. The additional bus bays will provide for sufficient capacity for local and FF bus services as
identified in the System Optimization Plan. A new, separate Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant
accessible ramp with adjacent stairs will be constructed for better access to the newly configured bus
platform from the Park-n-Ride lot.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Priorities
of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership.
On May 20, 2025, RTD issued an invitation for bids for a contractor to complete the bus platform
reconfigurations based on prepared plans and specifications. Bids were due on June 24, 2025. Krische
Construction, Inc., submitted the lowest responsive and responsible bid.
The project is expected to be completed within six months following the contract award.

Packet Pg. 40

1.D.5

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Up to $1.5 million of the cost will be paid for through a Colorado Department of Transportation grant
administered through the Funding Advancement for Surface Transportation and Economic Recovery
(FASTER) initiative. The remaining cost will be funded from existing capital improvement dollars
allocated in the 2025 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Bus Maintenance Facility Alternatives Analysis and
National Environmental Policy Act Study

July 15, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
July 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the summary scope of work (SOW) for a solicitation and to
subsequently authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) or her designee to enter into a contract
for consulting services to conduct facility alternatives analysis and environmental planning work
necessary to support the development of a new bus operations facility.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
To meet the agency’s evolving bus fleet needs in the coming decades, staff is preparing to release a
solicitation seeking consulting services to conduct environmental planning work necessary to support the
development of a new bus operations facility. A new facility has been identified in the agency’s longrange plans for several years. Reimagine RTD, a long-range comprehensive operational analysis
completed in 2022, analyzed RTD’s existing bus operations facilities and determined that the facilities
were not adequate to meet the growing needs of the Denver region. Additionally, RTD’s 2024 Facilities
and Fleet Transition Plan (FFTP) assessed RTD-owned property for its ability to accommodate a new
operations facility. This project will build on prior work and include a facility alternatives analysis and a
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)-level environmental planning review for RTD’s next bus
operations facility. Completion of the NEPA process will allow the facility to be eligible for future federal
funding.
DISCUSSION
The scope summary includes the following primary tasks:
1. Project Management and Administration: The contractor will maintain overall management and
control of the project from start to finish.
2. Alternatives Analysis: The contractor will analyze up to five sites, plus a no-build scenario, for
suitability of a new bus operations facility. The contractor will conduct a thorough alternatives
analysis.
3. NEPA Documentation: The contractor will complete the NEPA process, including necessary
documentation and public involvement, to ensure environmental compliance.
4. Stakeholder/Public Engagement: The contractor will conduct engagement with stakeholders and

Packet Pg. 44

1.D.6

with the public necessary to advance the study.
5. Preliminary Engineering: Concurrent with the NEPA process, the contractor will create space
programming and preliminary design plans for the selected site, sufficient to support the NEPA
process and inform future design phases.
6. Funding Strategy: Funding for construction has not yet been identified; accordingly, the
contractor will develop a strategy for acquiring the funding necessary to advance the project
through construction.
7. FFTP Reassessment: Using the completed FFTP as a building block, the contractor will assess
how a new bus operations facility will integrate into RTD’s transition plan.
Staff expects the facility alternatives and NEPA study to be completed within two years of contract
execution.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the study is included in the Board-adopted 2025 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2026-2030 Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF)

July 15, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVES
Kelly Mackey, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 2026-2030 Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF) is the financial forecast used as the basis for the
development of the 2026 Proposed Budget and provides guidance for future year financial planning.
The development of the FYFF seeks to balance planned expenditures with anticipated available funding
sources in alignment with RTD’s Strategic Plan. The FYFF is prepared on an annual basis or can be
produced more frequently if material changes in assumptions and inputs occur. The previous 2025-2029
FYFF was approved by the Board in September 2024.
The 2025-2029 FYFF was prepared using currently available information to assist in planning and
modification of the Fiscal Policy, if necessary, within projected financial constraints.
This Discussion Item is provided in advance of the September 9, 2025, Finance and Planning
Committee, during which staff will present a Recommended Action to approve the 2026-2030 FYFF,
which will include projected cash flows and fund balances over five years. The FYFF is a forecast or
projection of financial results and is not an appropriation of funds and is non-binding.
DISCUSSION
The 2026-2030 FYFF is being prepared using currently available information and does not include
assumptions regarding future potential changes, such as new grant funding from Senate Bill 2024-230
Oil and Gas Production Fees. A second view has been incorporated to show the impact of potential
costs associated with joint passenger rail service along the front range, which will be updated in the
future as cost estimates are provided. The FYFF will only include funding source and use projections that
have reasonable certainty to occur in accordance with RTD’s Board-approved Fiscal Policy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The FYFF projected cash flows and fund balances will be provided during the September 9, 2025,
Finance and Planning Committee meeting and will adhere to the Fiscal Policy requirements and reflect
ongoing fiscal sustainability and Financial Success through 2030.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
RTD Real Property Overview

July 15, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carmelita Cervantes, Manager, Real Property, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
This discussion provides an overview of the agency’s real property, including its uses, governing
regulations, parcel inventory, and agency coordination.
DISCUSSION
RTD owns and leases real property to support transit service delivery across its 2,345-square-mile
service area. Property uses include rail corridors, Park-n-Ride locations, transfer facilities, administrative
and operational sites, and infrastructure such as sidewalks, drainage, and utility corridors. RTD also
leases properties including the Civic Center Administration Building, for its own operations and leases
out certain properties for external uses.
Per the RTD Act, Article 9 of Title 32, Colorado Revised Statutes, the agency has authority to operate
its services on public roadways. Rail corridors are often located in public streets through
intergovernmental agreements. Most commuter rail corridors are located on property or easements
owned by RTD. Certain Park-n-Ride facilities are located on land owned by the Colorado Department of
Transportation or local jurisdictions.
Pursuant to §§32-9-119(1)k) and 32-9-161, C.R.S., RTD is authorized to utilize eminent domain to
acquire real property necessary for transit use. The agency has used this authority when necessary to
acquire residential and commercial property.
Approximately 60% of RTD’s real property acquisitions were supported by federal grant funds. These
properties must remain under RTD control for transit purposes per Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
requirements. Disposal of such properties requires FTA review and reimbursement of the federal share at
fair market value.
The agency’s Capital Programs Department manages all real property transactions, including
acquisitions, leases, and disposals in compliance with local, state, and federal requirements.
