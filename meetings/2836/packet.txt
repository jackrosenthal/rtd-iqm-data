Re:

Service Availability – December 2018

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.64% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in December 2018. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons reflect a decrease
during the month of December over the same month last year. Although lost service year to
date is higher, a large portion of lost service occurred during the first half of 2018. Service
delivery has improved significantly since June 2018. Lost service for personnel related
reasons follows:






December 2018 – 124.27 hours
December 2017 – 626.37 hours
Year to date hours for 2017 – 6,261.47hours
Year to date hours 2018 – 10,100.03 hours
Total service availability for 2018: 99.21% (includes service loss for any reason)

While RTD did provide in excess of 99.64% of all scheduled hours of service in the month, it
was necessary to cover 2,425 shifts by operators working a 6th day (one of their scheduled
days off). This represents approximately 19,400 hours of service being provided by a “6th
day” RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our
contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev. This number is also trending downward with
this December’s numbers lower than December of last year.

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in December were numerous large special
events (two Broncos Games, Parade of Lights, and route AB holiday additional service for
capacity). Staff continues to collaborate with our partners to address and implement measures
to attract, retain and sustain skilled employees.

May 2019 Service Change

Discussion

DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and finances allow.
The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions.
The introduction of the Southeast Rail Extension service plan, which involves an extension of the E, F
and R Light Rail Lines in the South Metro area, is a notable part of this proposal. Also included is a
proposal to discontinue service on the Route 33 – Platte Valley, due to low ridership in an area with
overlapping transit service. A reduction of Saturday service to the Jefferson County Government Center
Station on the W Line light rail service is also proposed. With the expiration of grant funding for
expanded service on the Free Metro Ride and the review of ridership performance, it is proposed that
FMR service frequency be reduced. Additionally, a number of service changes aimed at increasing ontime performance and service reliability are included in these proposals. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

May 2019 Proposed Service Changes
BUS

Route 1 – 1st Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Move east terminal from Birch/Virginia to Virginia/Cherry, immediately behind King Soopers
at Leetsdale/Cherry for operator restroom and customer convenience. No cost impacts are
anticipated.
Route 15 – East Colfax
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
This proposal is an effort to relieve passenger overloads east of Monaco to VA Hospital by
adding selected trips between 9:00am and 1:00pm. Move short turn recovery location from
Oneida/Colfax to Leyden/Colfax, for operator restroom access. The new terminal is close
to Walgreens, McDonalds, 7-11. A weekday bus for recovery and on-time performance.
Revise recoveries at East Metro as necessary, for adequate recovery. Anticipated cost
impacts are estimated to be $241,000 annualized.
16/16L – West Colfax
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Running time analyses on weekend services. No cost impacts are anticipated
Route 33 – Platte Valley
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Due to low ridership performance, it proposed that this route service be discontinued.
Current ridership performance stands at 10.3 passenger per hour, which falls below the
Urban Local ridership standard. This proposal would impact approximately 55 weekday
passengers. Alternative service to the Route 33 can be found in using combinations of
Central and West Light Rail corridors, Routes 4, 9, 30 and 30Limited.
Cost saving impacts are estimated to be approximately $301,700 annualized.
Route 36L – Fort Logan Limited
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Running time analysis, for operator recovery and on-time performance. No cost impacts are
anticipated.
Route 44 – 44th Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Reroute eastbound buses via Larimer Street instead of Lawrence, between Broadway and
Downing. This change consolidates service onto the historic transit corridor, instead of

being split between two streets. Bus stop improvement along northbound Larimer are
currently underway in support of this reroute. No cost impacts are anticipated.

Additionally, to provide faster service for more riders, the following existing route 51 bus
stops are proposed to be eliminated due to their low usage and/or their close proximity to
other nearby bus stops.
Northbound
Sheridan Blvd & Amherst Ave (16539)
Sheridan Blvd & 2nd Ave (16473)

Route 51 – Sheridan Boulevard
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
This proposal would, formalize the current 4-block route detour in Englewood, which was
put into effect due to the City having converted a part of Elati Street into a one-way
operation. The new Southbound route direction from Kenyon Street would be left on
Galapago, right on Ithica, left on Elati, to regular route. The new northbound routing from
southbound Elati, right on Ithica, left on Galapago, right on Kenyon, to regular route.

1.C.2.a

Route 65 – Monaco
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Running time analysis, for operator recovery and on-time performance. No cost impacts are
anticipated.

Free Metro Ride – 18th-19th Street
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Due to lower ridership (down from 82 passengers per hour to 62 passengers per hour) it is
recommended that the Free Metro Ride peak frequency be reduced from 15 trips per hour
to 8 trips per hour. Cost savings to FasTracks is estimated to be $281,500 annualized.

Rail
W Line - Light Rail/ Denver Union Station to Jefferson County Gov. Center/Golden Station)
It is proposed to reduce service between Federal Center Station and Jeffco Government
Center/Golden Station on Saturdays to every 30 minutes, consistent with Sunday service.
Under the proposed changes, this will require 6 all day trains rather than 7 as is used
currently and will be a savings of 1 all-day train. This will impact approximately 392
passengers who will need to choose a departure either 15 minutes earlier or 15 minutes
later. Anticipated FasTracks cost savings are estimated to be $134,600 annualized.
Southeast Rail Extension (SERE)
The Southeast Rail Extension Project is part of RTD’s 2004 voter-approved FasTracks plan
to expand rapid transit across the Denver metro region. The project will extend the Southeast
Rail Line 2.3 miles from Lincoln Station to RidgeGate Station in Lone Tree. There will be
three new light rail stations: Sky Ridge Station near Sky Ridge Medical Center; LoneTree
City Center Station; and a 1,300-space Park-n-Ride at the RidgeGate Station (Sky Ridge and
Lone Tree Stations will be “Kiss-n-Ride” stations). Anticipated cost impacts to FasTracks
are estimated to be $5,162,000 annualized.
E – Line (Light Rail Route - Denver Union Station to Lincoln Station
It is proposed to extend the E Line Light Rail route to the Ridgegate Parkway Station
according to the 2004 FasTracks Southeast Rail Extension plan. In addition to extending the
line to the new station, minor running time adjustments are proposed. This proposal will
require 2 extra all-day trains for a total of 9 all-day trains.
F – Line 18th/Stout Station to Lincoln Station
It is proposed to extend the E Line Light Rail route to the Ridgegate Parkway Station
according to the 2004 FasTracks Southeast Rail Extension plan. In addition to extending
the line to the new station, minor running time adjustments are proposed. This proposal will
require 1 extra all-day train for a total of 8 all-day trains.

It is proposed to extend the E Line Light Rail route to the Ridgegate Parkway Station
according to the 2004 FasTracks Southeast Rail Extension plan. This proposal will require
1 extra all-day train for a total of 10 all-day trains during week days. It also proposed to
increase weekend frequencies to 15 minutes all day in order to bring total rail service into
compliance with the Southeast Rail Extension FTA Full Funding Grant Requirements. This
will be an increase of 4 additional all-day trains for a total of 10 all-day trains on weekends

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his Designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to
amend Contract No. 17DO02, MCCi Laserfiche VAR Services and Support, to increase the contract
amount from a current total of $499,850 by $890,000 to a new total not-to-exceed amount of
$1,389,850 (subject to further Board action by budget authorization for budget years 2020 through
2022), in order to support RTD’s operations, maintenance and project development based on Laserfiche
software through 2022.
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
In early 2017, RTD chose the Laserfiche software system as the backbone of RTD’s improved enterprise
content management efforts. RTD had used Laserfiche for many years for storage of certain RTD
records. Instead of buying a completely new enterprise content management (ECM) system, based on
extensive review and cost analysis by RTD subject matter experts and our consulting ECM expert, RTD’s
ECM Steering Committee concluded that Laserfiche was the most cost effective way for RTD to manage
its unstructured information (i.e., information not already managed in place by software such as Oracle).
Laserfiche is now being steadily implemented District-wide as the repository for most unstructured
records. (Some records are being managed in place where their remaining retention periods would not
justify conversion.)
RTD’s Information Governance and Management (IGM) Division has completed many successful
information governance projects with the upgraded version of Laserfiche in collaboration with RTD’s
existing Value Added Reseller (VAR): MCCi, under contract with RTD since 2017. First, in 2018, IGM,
MCCi and RTD’s Safety Division developed and implemented the Safety Management System (SMS)
using Laserfiche. The SMS program is an FTA required program in which RTD must demonstrate it has a
formalized, data driven safety reporting program that complies with the requirements set forth by the
FTA. RTD was awarded the 2018 Laserfiche Excellence Award for the most innovative implemented
project using Laserfiche.
Additionally, IGM, MCCi and RTD’s Human Resources Division completed Phase I of the HR Digitization
project. IGM was able to scan over 3,000 current and former employee files and place them in our
secure Laserfiche repository. Security and access controls have been applied to each employee file to
ensure confidentiality and retention has been applied to ensure RTD adheres to our retention schedule.
Employee files are now available digitally to approved managers and supervisors, thus saving money on
paper copies and space by eliminating extensive shelving in HR.

Packet Pg. 13

2.B.1

Third, IGM and HR were able to help RTD save thousands of dollars by automating the yearly decal
distribution using Laserfiche forms. Employees signed for their decals via digital signature and a record
of who received what decal number is kept. This process saved money by eliminating the cost of two
temporary employees and paper.
These are only a few examples of how continued and expanded use of Laserfiche is not only supporting
better information management, but is already saving the District time and money.
DISCUSSION
RTD moved to Laserfiche’s latest enterprise level version, called Laserfiche RIO, in late 2017. This past
year has been a learning curve for the IGM team in terms of new system functionality. The IGM team is
committed to learning as much as possible from the MCCi consulting team so that RTD staff can
become self-reliant in administration and development of future Laserfiche projects; however,
professional services from MCCi will continue to be needed to fully employ Laserfiche RIO in our ECM
efforts. In 2019/2020 IGM will be undertaking some large projects which will require significant support
from our VAR. The requested $890,000 funding increase will allow IGM to pay for up to three more
years (2020-2022 – 2019 is already paid) of annual software support at an estimated $110,000 per
year (total $330,000), and for up to four more years (2019-2022) of professional services on specific
projects selected by RTD at an estimated $140,000 per year (total $560,000), for a total of
$1,389,850. Projects already anticipated for Laserfiche starting in 2019 include:
 North Metro Operations Document Control
 Phase II of the H.R. Digitation project – *There

RTD’s initial contract with MCCi was for $400,850. Based on higher than originally anticipated use of
Laserfiche licenses and MCCi project support, RTD amended the contract to add $99,000 for a new NTE
of $499,850. RTD continues to identify additional projects for 2019 and future years to take advantage
of Laserfiche’s benefits as our ECM backbone as our information governance efforts continue to mature.
Granting this Board authority now will allow RTD staff to further amend the contract in stages to allow
for additional MCCi support through this budget year. Importantly, funding for these types of services
was already included in the 2019 IGM Division budget. Board authority will allow RTD staff not to have
to go back to the Board to further amend the contract for 2020, 2021 and 2022 (including option
years), but amendments for 2020-2022 will not occur unless these services continue to be authorized in
the RTD budget, and unless RTD staff determines that exercise of the option years is in RTD’s best

Packet Pg. 14

2.B.1

interest. For professional services, the amounts sought are on a not to exceed basis, and RTD staff will
determine whether and to what extent projects justify use of MCCi resources or can be handled
internally.
Laserfiche has proven effective and popular, justifying our consultant’s recommendation of it as a highly
cost effective alternative to going outside for an entirely new, multi-million-dollar ECM system. Our IGM
team believes that this requested amount will provide the funds needed to ensure adequate Laserfiche
licenses, technical support, and professional services through 2022 to help us develop the above and
additional projects to take advantage of Laserfiche. While RTD’s IGM team is highly capable in
Laserfiche, support from MCCi will continue to be needed to help our staff succeed with such projects.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The amount of the contract amendment sought is $890,000, bringing the not to exceed total authorized
contract amount to $1,389,850 (subject to Board authorization through the budget process for years
2020-2022).
SBE PARTICIPATION
The RTD Small Business Opportunity Office established a 0% SBE participation goal for this project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his Designee to negotiate and execute all
documents necessary to amend Contract No. 17DO02, MCCi Laserfiche VAR Services and
Support, to increase the contract amount from a current total of $499,850 by $890,000 to a
new total not-to-exceed amount of $1,389,850 (subject to further Board action by budget
authorization for budget years 2020 through 2022), in order to support RTD’s operations,
maintenance and project development based on Laserfiche software through 2022.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This alternative is not recommended, because
constraining Laserfiche services would have a substantial detrimental impact on, and increased
costs to, RTD, impeding development of present and future projects which are imperative to
RTD’s record management and document control needs. RTD would need to stop using
Laserfiche at the end of this year and immediately start the procurement process for a substitute
software system.
3. Authorize a smaller amount only to cover 2019, and require staff to return to the Board for
further authorization for 2020-2022. This is not recommended because there is already a
contract with MCCi with option years in place through 2022, and because funding and
amendments for 2020-2022 will already be subject to Board oversight through the budget
process.

Subject:

NMRL Financial Analysis

Date: January 10, 2019

Board Meeting Date: January 29, 2019

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
To have a competent, independent third-party company perform a complete financial analysis to evaluate
and compare the RTD and Denver Transit Partners proposals for the start-up and first ten years of
dispatch, operations, and maintenance for the North Metro Rail Line. (NMRL)
The Board of Directors hereby directs the General Manager to commission a competent, suitable and
independent agency to perform a complete financial analysis in an amount not to exceed $50,000.
Subsequent to the complete analysis, a decision will be made by the appropriate RTD committee to
move an action forward to the Board of Directors who shall vote on which entity shall dispatch, operate,
and perform maintenance on the North Metro Rail (NMRL).
The December 2018 action to acquire four additional properties for a North Metro Rail Line Maintenance
Facility, which will require displacing several businesses, shall be suspended until the Board of Directors
review and affirm those property acquisitions under state eminent domain law.
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
Over the course of the last 16 months the board has received presentations about the NMRL budgets
while staff sought feedback on who shall dispatch, operate, and maintain this portion of the commuter
rail line network. The choices presented by staff included operating the North Line internally or
subcontracting it out to Denver Transit Partners (DTP) under the partner Denver Transit Operators (DTO)
as an extension to the Eagle P3 concession agreement.
The RTD Board of Directors, though asked for informal head-nods, never formally voted on the singlesubject of who should run the North Metro Rail Line. Instead, the action was inferred to be accepted by
our very recent approval of the 2019 budget.
In January 2019, it was discovered and came to the attention of the RTD Board of Directors that Denver
Transit Partners submitted a proposal in April 2018 which implies substantial savings if Denver Transit

Packet Pg. 17

2.B.2

Partners dispatch, operate, and maintain the North Metro Rail Line. One major difference between
RTD’s and DTP’s operational plans is employee headcount. Denver Transit Partners proposal notes they
would need 71 employees to operate the North Metro Rail Line while RTD’s budget includes 121
employees to operate the North Metro Rail Line. Some of the employee positions, if the line is operated
by RTD, appear to be redundant as DTP already operates the A, B, and G Line once opened.
More questions have arisen that make it difficult to compare cost-benefit, applicable Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA) regulations related to dispatch operations at Denver Union Station, and a like-to-like
analysis.
Furthermore, in December 2018, the RTD Board of Directors authorized acquiring four properties,
presently occupied by several businesses, to provide for a North Metro Rail Line maintenance facility
which is only needed if RTD were to self-perform operation and maintenance of the North Metro Rail
Line. As it is unclear what cost this potentially adds to the North Metro Rail Line self-perform option and
these property acquisitions would displace several businesses, the property acquisitions under state
eminent domain law shall be suspended until this action to self-perform operation and maintenance of
the North Metro Rail Line is affirmed by the current Board of Directors.
It is in the best interest of constituents, stakeholders, and the Regional Transportation District to hire a
competent firm to perform a complete financial analysis to ensure that funding is spent in the most
efficient manner possible while delivering the best service for our riders.
Additional background documentation will be presented to the board and added to this packet once
public release is approved.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The complete financial analysis shall cost no more than $50,000. Experienced professionals have
estimated this analysis may require 80 hours and top-level compensation is estimated at $300 per hour

Information

DISCUSSION
Smart Media Technology
The Smart Card Program is an Electronic Fare Collection and Payment System designed to increase fare
payment convenience for our customers, reduce and optimize fare collection costs for the agency and
reduce fraud associated with paper based fare media. The contract was signed with Xerox Transport
Solutions, Inc. (now Conduent) in mid-2010. A smart card is a plastic card onto which customers load
and reload RTD fare products. There are currently 4 products; EcoPass, CollegePass, Neighborhood
EcoPass and MyRide Stored Value available on the smart card.
All bus and rail validator installations are complete. Additional validators will be installed as new buses
and rail stations are commissioned into service.
The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass and Neighborhood EcoPass customers on
January 1, 2013. There are approximately 343,330 active cards in circulation. During the month of
December 2018, 1.37M taps were recorded.
Starting the morning of January 4, 2016 MyRide Stored Value cards were dispersed to the public pilot
program participants at the RTD retail outlets. On Wednesday May 17, 2017, the MyRide web portal
went live to the pilot participants and on May 24, 2017, the MyRide web portal was launched to the
public. As of December 2018, approximately 34,340 cards were issued, of which 25,580 (74%) were
full fare cards and 8,770 (26%) were discounted cards. The average stored value loaded (initial
purchases and reloads) was $39.92, with a total value loaded of $5,097,800. There were nearly
1,616,420 trips taken using these MyRide cards, with a fare payment value of $4,272,100. Of these
trips: 78% were local, 19% regional and 3% airport.
Additional value can be loaded onto the card online, at RTD sales outlets and at retail outlets (Safeway
and King Soopers). As of June 1, 2017, customers can load cash value onto their MyRide cards at 47
Safeway retail stores. Since launch, Safeway has processed $88,370 in cash value loads. As of July 1,
2017, customers can load cash value onto MyRide cards at 86 King Soopers retail stores. Since launch,
King Soopers has processed $73,900 in cash value reloads.
On February 23, 2018, the MyRide program was expanded by offering customers the option to get a
new MyRide card and load initial cash value at Safeway locations. Since go-live, Safeway has loaded
1,937 MyRide cards, totaling $63,280 in sales. There are active discussions to expand the program at
King Soopers locations.

Information

BACKGROUND
RTD commits to reviewing its Fare Structure and Fare Programs every three years to determine if any
additions or changes are required to provide the best options for RTD ridership and meet RTD’s revenue
targets. Over 20 months ending in mid-2018, the Pass Working Group and RTD staff reviewed all fares
and fare programs to define potential fare changes and improvements, RTD staff presented a
recommendation to the RTD Board of Directors and received approval mid-September 2018. The goal of
this project was to implement changes to the RTD Fares, Fare Structure, changes and additions to the
Fare Programs as approved by the RTD Board of Directors.
2019 Approved Changes Summary:
 Cash Fare: $3 Local / $5.25 Regional / $10.50 Airport.
 3-Hour Pass: These fares allow riders to travel for three hours in any direction. This change
replaces the three-hour one-way transfer or ticket.
 Retain ticket book and MyRide discount with modifications (Riders purchasing a 10-ride ticket
book or paying with a MyRide smart card will receive a discount)
 The youth discount will increase from 50 percent to 70 percent and will be solely age-based
(ages 6-19).
 Utilization pricing for pass programs: Pricing for EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass
will now be priced based upon trips taken.
 EcoPass: Other updates to pricing based on changes in service levels and employer categories.
 FlexPass: Discontinue program discount. Employers and employees pay regular monthly pass
price.
 New Low-Income Program (Targeting Summer 2019)
DISCUSSION
Each year, RTD provides free rides to the public the night of New Year’s Eve and into New Year’s Day.
Any fare changes for the New Year are effective immediately thereafter. This year, rides were free on
all services beginning at 7:00 p.m. on December 31st through the full service day on New Year’s Day
ending at 2:59 a.m. on January 2nd. The new 2019 fare rates and fare media were successfully
implemented and made available to the public for the beginning of the service day on January 2nd. Only
very minor issues arose during the implementation and each issue was immediately rectified.
Fare change implementations impact virtually every area of RTD as well as our customers and involve
significant effort to plan, coordinate and implement.

LOW INCOME PROGRAM
RTD is working with the State’s Office of Information Technology (OIT) to implement a program for
evaluating RTD rider’s eligibility for the low income program using the State’s public benefits software
system. RTD staff have been meeting with employees from various departments and the OIT every
week for several months. The following has been completed:



High level requirements have been provided to the State
RTD has received a level of effort cost estimate from the State’s technology vendor for the
vendor’s portion of the work
Next Steps
 Anticipate receiving the remaining cost estimate and timeline for delivery from the State by
January 11th
 RTD will need to review total cost estimate and see if fits within the RTD identified budget
 RTD will need to review the timeline once received
 Once the timeline and budget have been agreed upon we can finalize and execute the
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the State
 Once the (IGA) is executed we can begin final design documents and the state’s vendor can
begin work
