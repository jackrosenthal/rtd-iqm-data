#### 1. Contract Amendment Authority for MCCi (Laserfiche Value Added Reseller)

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his Designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to amend Contract No. 17DO02, MCCi Laserfiche VAR Services and Support, to increase the contract amount from a current total of $499,850 by $890,000 to a new total not-to-exceed amount of $1,389,850 (subject to further Board action by budget authorization for budget years 2020 through 2022), in order to support RTD’s operations, maintenance and project development based on Laserfiche software through 2022.

Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management

#### 2. NMRL Financial Analysis

To have a competent, independent third-party company perform a complete financial analysis to evaluate and compare the RTD and Denver Transit Partners proposals for the start-up and first ten years of dispatch, operations, and maintenance for the North Metro Rail Line. (NMRL)

The Board of Directors hereby directs the General Manager to commission a competent, suitable and independent agency to perform a complete financial analysis in an amount not to exceed $50,000.

Subsequent to the complete analysis, a decision will be made by the appropriate RTD committee to move an action forward to the Board of Directors who shall vote on which entity shall dispatch, operate, and perform maintenance on the North Metro Rail (NMRL).

The December 2018 action to acquire four additional properties for a North Metro Rail Line Maintenance Facility, which will require displacing several businesses, shall be suspended until the Board of Directors review and affirm those property acquisitions under state eminent domain law.

Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services

Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability

BACKGROUND

Over the course of the last 16 months the board has received presentations about the NMRL budgets while staff sought feedback on who shall dispatch, operate, and maintain this portion of the commuter rail line network. The choices presented by staff included operating the North Line internally or subcontracting it out to Denver Transit Partners (DTP) under the partner Denver Transit Operators (DTO) as an extension to the Eagle P3 concession agreement.

The RTD Board of Directors, though asked for informal head-nods, never formally voted on the single-subject of who should run the North Metro Rail Line. Instead, the action was inferred to be accepted by our very recent approval of the 2019 budget.

In January 2019, it was discovered and came to the attention of the RTD Board of Directors that Denver Transit Partners submitted a proposal in April 2018 which implies substantial savings if Denver Transit Partners dispatch, operate, and maintain the North Metro Rail Line.  One major difference between RTD’s and DTP’s operational plans is employee headcount. Denver Transit Partners proposal notes they would need 71 employees to operate the North Metro Rail Line while RTD’s budget includes 121 employees to operate the North Metro Rail Line. Some of the employee positions, if the line is operated by RTD, appear to be redundant as DTP already operates the A, B, and G Line once opened.

More questions have arisen that make it difficult to compare cost-benefit, applicable Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations related to dispatch operations at Denver Union Station, and a like-to-like analysis.

Furthermore, in December 2018, the RTD Board of Directors authorized acquiring four properties, presently occupied by several businesses, to provide for a North Metro Rail Line maintenance facility which is only needed if RTD were to self-perform operation and maintenance of the North Metro Rail Line. As it is unclear what cost this potentially adds to the North Metro Rail Line self-perform option and these property acquisitions would displace several businesses, the property acquisitions under state eminent domain law shall be suspended until this action to self-perform operation and maintenance of the North Metro Rail Line is affirmed by the current Board of Directors.

It is in the best interest of constituents, stakeholders, and the Regional Transportation District to hire a competent firm to perform a complete financial analysis to ensure that funding is spent in the most efficient manner possible while delivering the best service for our riders.

Additional background documentation will be presented to the board and added to this packet once public release is approved.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The complete financial analysis shall cost no more than $50,000. Experienced professionals have estimated this analysis may require 80 hours and top-level compensation is estimated at $300 per hour
