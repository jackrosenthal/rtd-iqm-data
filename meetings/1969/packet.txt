From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

Board Meeting Date: October 28, 2014

Subject:

January 2015 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the January 2015 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A
resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $647,200 and, further, to authorize the General
Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose
service is impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, system maintenance actions and several service reductions. The proposals regarding the
cancellation of certain Call-n-Ride services are ridership/performance based and in accord with RTD
Service Standards. We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes
and propose adjustments as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Five public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended between October 2nd
and October 16th. Public meetings were held in Denver, Federal Heights, Highlands Ranch and Parker
with nearly 200 hundred public participants. Comments from these meetings and the service change
website are summarized in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to

Arapahoe at Village Center Station
Due to the development of the hotel at this station, several routes will need to have gate
assignments changed to allow for construction and future operations. This change will
impact Routes: 65, 66, AT and T.
Belmar Call-n-Ride
The Belmar Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line.
The Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 8:00pm. The Call-n-Ride currently
serves the Garrison Station. The boundaries can best be described as 13th on the north
and one stop on Colfax at Garrison, Wadsworth on the east, Kipling on the west and
Morrison Road to the south. The Call-n-Ride also runs a Flex Route on Garrison during the
peak hours. The ridership has been averaging 1.6 passenger boarding’s per hour. This
proposal calls for discontinuing the Garrison Flex route and for the changing of the north
boundary to be moved south to 10th Avenue. The boundary will be adjusted west of
Kipling and north of 13th to the Oak Station.
Additionally, the south boundary at
Morrison Road will be moved up to Jewell. This change to the Oak Station will now allow
customers to transfer to the Route 16 and 100 at a station and alleviate neighborhood
concerns regarding the safety and the vehicle traffic in the neighborhood in and around the
Garrison Station.
After further consideration from public input, the boundary will continue at 13th and
Garrison Station will continue to be served by reservation only.
No additional costs are anticipated.
Route DD – Colorado Blvd
Schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance are proposed. No cost impacts are
anticipated.
Dry Creek Call-n-Ride
The Dry Creek Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006 with the opening of the
Southeast Light Rail. The Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 7:00pm. The
Call-n-Ride currently serves the Dry Creek Station. The boundaries can best be described

Federal Heights Call-n-Ride
The Federal Heights Call-n-Ride began operating in January 2012 under a Congestion
Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) grant. The Cities of Federal Heights,
Thornton, Northglenn and Adams County applied for and contribute financially to operate
the Call-n-Ride. The municipalities requested the RTD to operate the service with all
parties agreeing that as part of the Call-n-Ride branding and operating within the RTD
family of services, the opportunity to succeed would be greatly increased. The costs to
operate the service is approximately $191,950 annually (includes fuel). The Call-n-Ride
operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 7:00pm. Currently, Weekday ridership is at 2.9
passenger boarding’s per hour. This proposal calls for the discontinuance of the Call-nRide due to low ridership. Alternative service is available using the Routes 6, 8, 31, 80,
92 and 104.
It should be noted that an offer to extend the Call-n-Ride service via a cost share
agreement has been made to the municipalities that the Federal Heights Call-n-Ride serves.
If this offer or a counter offer is received and agreed upon by the RTD, this proposal for
the January Service Changes will be rescinded. At this time a formal response from the
municipalities has not been received.
Cost: increase dependent on a Cost Share Agreement.
Free MetroRide
To improve reliability in the afternoon peak, it is proposed to add one-bus and make minor
schedule adjustments. Service will still be offered every 6 minutes.
Projected cost: 893 hours and an estimated $36,150 annualized.
Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride
The Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006 with the opening of
the Southeast Light Rail line. The Call-n-Ride operates weekday hours 6:00am – 6:00pm.
Currently, weekday ridership is at 2.1 passenger boarding’s per hour. RTD requires a
minimum of 3 boardings per hour. Ridership has never attained a 3.0 boarding per hour
since operations began in November 2008. This proposal calls for the discontinuance of
the Call-n-Ride due to low ridership. Some alternative service is available using the Routes
401, 402Ltd and 403.
It should be noted that an offer to extend the Call-n-Ride service via a cost share
agreement has been made to the municipalities that the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride
serves. If this offer or a counter offer is received and agreed upon by the RTD, this

as Arapahoe Road on the north, I-25 on the east, County Line Road to the south and Holly
on the west. During off peak hours the Call-n-Ride serves the entire area. During peak
hours the Call-n-Ride serves only to Quebec. This proposal calls for changing the
boundaries by not serving west of Quebec and north of Dry Creek. This area has been
very unproductive and by removing this section may allow better productivity in the
remaining area. No costs associated with this change.

Parker Call-n-Ride
The Parker Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006 with the opening of the
Southeast Light Rail line.
The Call-n-Ride operates weekdays 5:30am – 6:00pm.
Currently weekday ridership is at 1.8 passenger boarding’s per hour. RTD requires a
minimum of 3 boardings per hour. This proposal calls for the discontinuance of the Call-nRide due to low ridership. Some alternative service is available using the Route 153.
It should be noted that an offer to extend the Call-n-Ride service via a cost share
agreement has been made to the municipalities that the Parker Call-n-Ride serves. If this
offer or a counter offer is received and agreed upon by the RTD, this proposal for the
January Service Changes will be rescinded. At this time a formal response from the
municipalities has not been received.
Savings: 3,200 annual hours saved, $183,312 (includes fuel).
Savings could be reduced depending on a Cost Share Agreement.

Schedule adjustments are proposed to address on-time performance issues. No cost
impacts are anticipated.

Light Rail
W – Line (West Corridor Light Rail)
It is proposed to use the Mariposa yard as a garage for Weekday W-Line trains. Under the
proposed changes, this will require capacity for 9 peak trains and 22 peak light rail
vehicles. This proposal will greatly reduce the strain placed on the I-25 & Broadway
Junction before the morning peak and reduce deadhead and livehead travel times;

however, it will also reduce some early-morning “C-Line” pullout trains from Evans to
Union Station, which are currently lightly patronized.

It is also proposed to discontinue ten additional Monday-Friday trips on the fringes of the
AM and PM peak periods: Eastbound trips from Federal Center Station at 6:31 AM, 8:31
AM, 3:46 PM, 4:16 PM, and 6:16 PM and Westbound trips from Union Station at 6:11
AM, 8:11 AM, 3:26 PM, 3:56 PM, and 5:56 PM. This proposed change effects
approximately 529 passengers that will need to take a W-Line 7.5 minutes earlier or later.
Total hours saved: (Mondays-Thursdays) 1,275 annualized.
Route 102 Loop Extras – it is proposed to make minor adjustments to the Loop Extras,
trains 10, 50, and 70, to adjust times and service based on early information gathered
from the August 2014 runboard. Changes to hours are not anticipated.
Savings 1,700 annual hours, $314,500
W-Line: It is proposed to extend the existing Denver Union Station (DUS) Weekday hostler
hours so that there is coverage all day for one hostler (currently there are two hostlers in
each AM and PM peak). This would change the existing four splits to two splits and two
straights. This change helps provide layover and relief for W-Line operators at DUS.
Costs 2,040 annual hours, $377,400
Total net proposal cost is estimated to be 340 hours, $62,900 annualized.

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC MEETINGS – JANUARY 2015

Doug Monroe conducted the meeting. Staff in attendance included Nataly Erving, Nate
Diaz, Jessie Carter, Jeff Becker, Jeff Dunning, Nick Shoup, Dave Menter, Daniel Menter,
Diane Marquis, Brian Matthews, Pate Heye and Chris Marko. There were no elected
officials in attendance. In addition there was a count of 43 members of the public who
signed in.
Route 11:
On Sundays, Leticia Mangeson said that she needs the route 11 to run later than its
current end time of 7:00 pm.
Denver Union Station/18th Street Detour:
Many in attendance were in favor of the city’s proposal to establish two-way traffic along
18th St between Wynkoop and Blake and therefore have bus service along this segment
thus removing it from Wynkoop St. Among those in favor were Elizabeth Orr who wanted
to know the time frame for its implementation. [Jessie Carter answered that it would be
on October 31st, 2014]. Andy Youtz, who lives at 1720 Wynkoop noted an increase in
activity along Wynkoop since Union Station opened last May not only with RTD buses, but
with convention buses, tour buses, more taxis and cars standing in the middle of the
street blocking traffic and for this reason feels that 18th would be better for routing buses
than Wynkoop is and therefor he wants to make sure that the decision not to route them
on Wynkoop is upheld. Andy’s sentiment was echoed by Vickie Godbey of the Union
Station Advocates. Ryan King is also in support of this upcoming change.
However, Tom Rickert, who lives at Franklin Lofts likes the current routing arguing that if
the plan is implemented, 100% of the buses would be on 18th and he did not find that to
be “equitable” and asked that some buses use other streets.
John Parkinson pointed out that there are priorities on all sides and that the final decision
should not be swayed by individual interests.
Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride:
Terry Whitmore asked us to save the Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride stating that the trip that
her daughter uses to get to school is full. She pointed to many factors that suggest our
keeping this service including the projected doubling of the region’s population by 2040
with 1 in four residents being over 60 at that time, many of which are likely to want to
remain independent, yet also remain in this region but needing to not depend on Single
Occupancy Vehicles (SOV). She said that when customers are forced to become a SOV
due to elimination of transit service, they are likely lost to transit and not likely to return.
She also mentioned that the Douglas County residents that would be negatively affected
by this cut contribute to the system with the highest farebox rate and that equity in the
system would keep service to their area running.

Morrison Rd / Westwood neighborhood:
There was considerable support for the possibility of restoring transit service in the
Westwood neighborhood including along Morrison Rd which was discontinued in January,
2012 due to budget constraints. Among the comments supporting restored service:
 Lillian Castaway who is disabled, who would like this service restored not to just
during peak hours but during the entire day. Andrea Chiriborga-Flor and Lorena
Limon agreed that full day service is needed as there are many elderly in this area
and she wants to avoid transit “pockets” of non-service. Andrea also thanked RTD
for the opportunity to address this issue at this meeting.
 Patricia Grado who works in Westwood said that many families that live in the area
do not have cars and without convenient transit service have to walk more than a
mile to where there is service, even if they have cancer and are going to medical
appointments. Marisol Valencia also said that she could use this service to get to
medical treatments and therefore it would be helpful for it to run during the entire
day.
 Mayra Olivas who works with the families in the Westwood area said that families
have to walk more than a ½ mile to buy groceries and in the winter that gets even
more difficult.
 It’s difficult with good transit service for kids to get to school according to Lydia
Cameron.
 Tracy Kaye, who works for Healthy Places a Colorado Health Fund, referred to
Westwood as an “island” of non-service. She said that there are many community
members who have multiple part-time jobs that they have trouble getting to. She
said that not only do they “deserve” service, but providing such transit service
would get them to walk to/from the bus and therefore contribute to their overall
health. Laura Martinez who works as a housekeeper also finds it very difficult to
get to / from work without better service in this neighborhood.
 Barnum resident Eric Kornabi, the Executive Director and Co-Founder of Re:Vision,
an organization that works with people in marginalized neighborhoods suggested
that with Westwood not having convenient transit options, our service is not
“Equitable” as it is in areas such as LoDo. He mentioned that although between
16,000 – 17,000 vehicles a day travel on Morrison Rd, there is not one transit
stop. He said that his organization is helping to establish a new grocery store on
Morrison Rd and that having transit service along that street will benefit this new
business.
 Olga Seguin mentioned that it is not safe for children to walk along Morrison Rd
and that bus service that they could take would make things safer for them. Bertha
Perez also said that walking along Morrison Rd is dangerous and that she has
missed medical appointments at Denver Health Medical Center because of the poor
transit service in the area. Marisol Valencia also mentioned this would be helpful for
children getting to and from school.
 Ivan Escalante is also in favor of restoring this service since students now have
very far to walk, but he pointed out that the fares are too high as many can not
afford them.
 Rachel Cleaves of Westwood Unidos, who was surprised that no proposals for new
service on Morrison Rd was proposed, did a survey in which 52% of those she

Packet Pg. 16

survey said that one’s employment is affected by access to public transit and such
transit is currently not accessible in this neighborhood which she said is one of the
youngest and densest in the city. She also asked RTD to be “creative” in how we
establish this new service saying that the old service was not adequate and that
she would prefer a “shuttle”.
Monica Acosta of Parents and Youth United, an education and justice organization
is dedicated to removing the boundaries that hinder education and employment
opportunities and that one of these barriers is poor public transportation. She said
that her families rely on public transportation for such things as getting to school,
child care, work, shopping and health care. Without public transit, many have to
walk ten blocks or so to Sheridan Blvd and that their quality of life gets impacted
when they have to make difficult choices as a result of the poor transit.
Others that affirmed agreement with creating service in this area included Mary
Cruz Herrera.

RTD Administrative Offices
Thursday, October 2, 6:00 PM, 2014
Jessie Carter conducted the meeting with Director Angie Rivera-Malpiede present. RTD
Staff in attendance included Jonathan Wade. There were 23 members of the public who
signed in.
There were no comments or questions concerning items listed in the service change
proposal. The following topics and question were discussed during the public input
session:






The Westwood neighborhood would benefit from service along Morrison Road
connecting them to other RTD services, grocery stores, and medical facilities.
The Westwood community would like RTD to consider operating a “circulator”
service in the Westwood area.
The Urban land Conservancy (ULC) has invested in housing developments in the
Westwood community and would like to see service along Morrison Road.
Why are there delays on the D-Line Light Rail service in the Five Points area?
As RTD expands the light rail system to the suburbs it seems that RTD has
forgotten about the people in the inner city.

The meeting was concluded at approximately 7:15pm.
Highlands Ranch
Thursday, October 2, 6:00PM, 2014
Brian Matthews conducted the meeting. RTD Staff in attendance included Patrick Heye,
Dan Menter, and Doug Monroe. Director Kent Bagley was also present. There were 23
members of the public who signed in.
Brian first asked for any comments that were not related to the Highlands Ranch Call-nRide and received the following:

The route 0 is much too slow to ride all the way to downtown Denver. An express
or limited 0 is needed.
Access-a-Cab service is inefficient, unreliable, and customer hates using it.
Extend the 402Ltd and extend the service hours.

The meeting was then turned over to comments regarding the proposal to cancel the
Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride and the following comments were recorded:

Since no school bus service is provided, we need to keep the Call-n-Ride.
The CnR arrival phone notification system is very inaccurate.
The CnR is too busy during the peak hours for anyone to get rides except for
students.
One neighborhood of 200 homes is all seniors who will be left without
transportation if the CnR is cancelled.
The CnR is perfect for students and teaches independence with more safety than
401 or 402 Ltd.
There has not been sufficient marketing, especially to charter schools.
The drivers are great and we feel safe allowing our children to use CnR.
We appreciate the CnR and it will be needed even more with the continued growth
of Highlands Ranch.
CnR would operate better with a central dispatch instead of drivers doing it
themselves.
Ridership would double with a second bus during peak hours.
Students need a bus just for them from 7:00am-9:00am and 2:30-4:30pm.
Parents would be happy to pay a higher fare to keep the CnR service for students.
The community was not given enough advance notice of CnR cancellation to help
do something about keeping it.
One person gave us a written letter. Attached.

The meeting was concluded at approximately 7:45pm.
Federal Heights
Wednesday, October 8, 6:00PM, 2014
Staff in attendance included: Brian Matthews, Pat Heye, and Nate Diaz. There were 28
members of the public in attendance, primarily in favor of the continuation of the Federal
Heights Call-n-Ride. RTD Board Member in attendance included: Larry Hoy.
Officials included Federal Heights City Council members John Hamlin and Daniel Dick, as
well as Kent Moorman, Traffic Engineer for the City of Thornton.
Director Hoy and Brian Matthews gave an update on the status of the offer to continue the
Federal Heights Call-n-Ride service as a cost share proposal between RTD, Adams County,
Northglenn, Federal Heights, and Thornton until May 8, 2015.

Federal Heights Call-n-Ride - The rest of the public was in support of keeping the Federal
Heights Call-n-Ride. The majority of attendees were residents of the Villa Maria senior
living community and were encouraged to attend by community advocate Bonnie Good
and arrived via the Federal Heights Call-n-Ride. Community members stressed the benefits
the service provided, stating that it gave them freedom, the ability to get to the store,
pharmacy, and doctor, an opportunity to make friends with other riders, and access to
restaurants and community and cultural events. One member of the public, who teaches
disabled youth, said that she had just recently learned of the Call-n-Ride and now all 20 of
her students are able to use it to get to and from their jobs at the local ARC. Bonnie Good
spoke last, highlighting the need for the service for students, seniors, emergency
preparedness, first and final mile connections and community building. She also submitted
a letter of support for the Call-n-Ride to the public record (please see attached).
All of the public commended RTD on the dependable, safe and courteous drivers operating
the Call-n-Ride Service. Several community members brought up frustrations with the Calln-Ride scheduling software. One cited complaint was the software’s inability to handle
recurring, once-a-month trips. Frequently mentioned was the software’s inability to handle
multiple passengers wishing to go to the same or nearby destinations and the desire for it
to suggest more logical and efficient routings. One member of the public suggested, as
call-n-Ride buses are replaced, they are re-wrapped with a design that more clearly shows
the “RTD” logo, so as to cut down on confusion as to what it is.
6:47p - The hearing was closed, so that attendees could return home via the Federal
Heights Call-n-Ride.
Parker
Thursday, October 9, 6:00PM, 2014
Brian Matthews conducted the meeting. RTD Staff in attendance included Patrick Heye,
Cesar Ochoa, and Dan Menter. Director Gary Lasater and three Parker city council
members were present. There were 47 members of the public who signed in.
Brian first asked for any comments that were not related to the Parker Call-n-Ride and
received the following:



The route 410 only runs between 5:00am-8:30am and 2:00pm-5:00pm. We need
midday service.
This customer runs a website “rtdpriders.com” and wants everyone to visit it.
The route P always gets assigned the old buses.
We need to extend the RTD boundary to the south because those people ride the
bus and should pay taxes for it.
The route P needs to serve the Pinery area.

Route 31x - One member of the public spoke asking if the last PM trip of Route 31x could
be moved back from a 5:21p departure at Union Station to 5:30p to accommodate the
additional distance to reach Union Station as compared to the former Market Street
Station.

Parker pays 7.9 million annually to RTD and gets almost nothing in return.
The charter school students need CnR service.
The CnR is a necessity to us, not just a convenience.
The senior population is growing fast and depends on CnR service.
The CnR area should be expanded to include the Jorden and Pine area.
Running Saturday service during the holiday season would help ridership.
Remove the 5 minute window and it will speed things up.
The current morning driver has a bad attitude and is hurting ridership.
A second bus would help ridership.
If Lincoln Station were served ridership would increase greatly.
The CnR system needs to have a central dispatch. Drivers have problems with the
phone calls. They often do not answer or return call.
Need to organize shopping trips for seniors.
More marketing needs to be done before cancelling the service.
Should expand the CnR boarders to the west.
Organize some senior shopping trips in the midday to increase ridership.

Equity Analysis

In the pursuit of the provision of mass transit service in the Denver Metro Area, equity is a core principle
of the Regional Transportation District (RTD). An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the
benefits and adverse effects of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin or lowincome status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Environmental Justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national
origin in programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically Title VI states, “No person in the
United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, shall be excluded from participation
in, denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving
Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898 “Federal Actions to Address Environmental
Justice in Minority and Low-Income Populations,” which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high
and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority
populations and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular,
the FTA requires RTD to evaluate any and all major service changes to determine whether those changes
will have a disproportionate negative impact on minority or low-income populations.

SERVICE CHANGE PHILOSOPHY
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We continually adjust services in response
to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also our
responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or
cancellation of service as warranted. We utilize our official Service Standards to establish performance
metrics by which we identify underperforming services on a class of service basis.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities. The general assembly further finds that the
farebox recovery ratio of the district must be improved so that resources once allocated for
mass transportation can be made available for other surface transportation needs.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.B.1.c

Equity Analysis

The FTA also requires that RTD establish policies that will guide the analysis of major service changes for
equity. Accordingly, RTD has established equity analysis policies to meet this requirement and establish a
service evaluation process.

Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change policy, a Disparate
Impact policy and a Disproportionate Burden policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational
requirements for evaluating major service change proposals for equity. These policies and their
applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction
in the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All
major service changes will be subject to an equity analysis which includes an analysis of adverse
effects.
a. Adverse Effect: is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service which
includes but is not limited to: elimination of a route, shortlining a route, rerouting an
existing route and an increase in headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse
effects, and analyze those effects, when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority
population 10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a
disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will
consider modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it
removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot
be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service
change, the FTA will allow RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Proposed Major Service Changes
Pursuant to the intent to provide cost effective demand responsive services, RTD has proposed many
service changes to take effect in January of 2015. Per the Major Service Change Policy, the proposed
major service changes subject to this analysis are listed below.
Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride – Cancellation
The Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006 with the opening of the Southeast
Light Rail line. The Call-n-Ride operates weekday hours 6:00am – 6:00pm. Currently, weekday ridership
is at 2.1 passenger boardings per hour. Applicable service standards require a minimum of 3 boardings
per hour. Ridership has never attained a 3.0 boarding per hour since operations began in November
2008. This proposal calls for the discontinuance of the Call-n-Ride due to low ridership. Some alternative
service is available using the Routes 401, 402Ltd and 403.

Parker Call-n-Ride – Cancellation
The Parker Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006 with the opening of the Southeast Light Rail
line. The Call-n-Ride operates weekdays 5:30am – 6:00pm. Currently weekday ridership is at 1.8
passenger boardings per hour. Applicable service standards require a minimum of 3 boardings per hour.
This proposal calls for the discontinuance of the Call-n-Ride due to low ridership. Some alternative service
is available using the Route 153.
Savings: Annual hours saved: 3,200, saving $183,312 (includes fuel).

Equity Analysis Methodology
As previously mentioned, the basic framework for analyzing service changes for equity involves the
comparison of affected populations. The manner in which these populations are identified and compared
is described below:
1. Assess the proposed service change for adverse effects (e.g. frequency decrease, shortlining,
etc…)
2. Obtain applicable population or ridership data (e.g. customer satisfaction survey, census data,
etc…)
3. Examine the proportions of adverse effects absorbed by minority and low-income populations.
The two proposed major service changes are cancellations of Call-n-Rides. Call-n-Ride is a demandresponse bus service. Patrons make a reservation for pick-up at any location within a predefined service
area and can then travel to any destination within that predefined service area. Typically, Call-n-Rides
have operated within multiple low-density, suburban neighborhoods that don’t have a ridership demand
high enough to justify fixed-route bus service.
Considering all customers traveling within the predefined service area can be impacted by these
changes, we’ve elected to utilize U.S. Census population data to assess the impacts absorbed by minority
and low-income populations. Table 2.1 depicts demographic data from the 2010 Census.

1.B.1.c

As stated in the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies, minority and low-income
populations should not be subjected to adverse effects that are at a rate greater than or equal to 10%
more than non-minority and non-low-income populations. Based on this demographic profile, we find that
a service change affecting minority populations at a rate greater than or equal to 32% (22% + 10%)
would be considered a disparate impact. We also find that service changes affecting low-income
populations at a rate greater than or equal to 38% (28% + 10%) would be considered a
disproportionate burden. Accordingly, through Tables 2.2 and 2.3, we will examine the two services in
question, the nature of the service changes and rate at which minority and low-income populations are
impacted. We also utilized Geographic Information Systems (GIS) maps to examine the demographic
data as well (see Appendix A).

CONCLUSION
As mentioned previously, our primary objective within this analysis is to examine proposed major service
changes to ensure minority and low-income populations would not disproportionately absorb adverse
effects. The Census demographic data shows the Highlands Ranch and Parker Call-n-Ride service areas
have percentages of minority and low-income populations well under the applicable policy thresholds of
the disparate impact (32% minority) and disproportionate burden (38% low-income) policies. Therefore
neither disparate impact nor a disproportionate burden was identified and the proposed service changes
do not require revision.

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

October 10, 2014

Board Meeting Date: October 28, 2014

Subject:

Free Rides for Members of the Military

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free rides on RTD for active duty
members of the United States Military should be extended from the presently approved date of December 31,
2014 to December 31, 2015. Utilization has been minimal to date and this extension will have minimal impact
on RTD.
BACKGROUND
At the October 30, 2006 Special Board Meeting, the RTD Board of Directors approved a resolution allowing
active duty U.S. Military personnel to ride free on all RTD services through the end of 2006. This offer has
been extended annually by the Board since that time and is now valid through December 31, 2014. As a result
of these actions, all active duty members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, National Guard,
and Reserves are entitled to ride free on any RTD service including special services such as SkyRide and
BroncosRide. To be eligible to ride for free, active duty military personnel must either be in uniform or present
an active duty military ID card.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the RTD Board of Directors extend this offer beyond the current expiration date of
December 31, 2014 and that the expiration date be extended by one year at this time and revisited again next
year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The exact financial impact of this action is not known, but is expected to be minimal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Extend free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should from the
presently approved date of December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. This is the staff
recommendation.
2. Do not extend RTD’s program offering free rides for active duty members of the United States Military.

Subject:

Award of Contract for On-Vehicle Advertising

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the General Manager or his
designee be authorized to enter into a contract with Lamar Advertising of Denver for the three year
period January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017 with a two year option for 2018 and 2019. Under
the terms of the recommended action, Lamar would remit to RTD either 1) a minimum guarantee of $4.0
million in 2015, $4.1 million in 2016 and $4.2 million in 2017 or 2) seventy percent of net sales,
whichever is greater.
BACKGROUND
On August 20, 2014, a Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued soliciting proposals for the sale and
installation of exterior and interior advertising on RTD vehicles. Responses to the RFP were due on
September 25, 2014. This RFP offered proposers the option to submit for one or any of three sections:
1) bus, light rail and commuter rail; 2) ADA paratransit vehicles and 3) other in-vehicle advertising
opportunities. Three responses were received for section 1, and one response was received for each of
section 2 and section 3. Additional research is required prior to staff making a recommendation on the
proposals submitted for sections 2 and 3, so this action item covers section 1 only (bus, light rail and
commuter rail). The two remaining sections will come forward to the Board at a later time.
DISCUSSION
A total of three responses were received for the bus, light rail and commuter rail section of the RFP;
from CBS Outdoor, Direct Media and the incumbent Lamar Advertising of Denver. CBS Outdoor indicated
that they were declining the opportunity to submit a proposal, as they felt the minimum annual
guarantee contained in the RFP ($3.5 million per year) was beyond what they could offer. Staff reviewed
the remaining two proposals for compliance with a set of four minimum qualifications: 1) experience of
firm; 2) onsite key personnel experience; 3) sales history; and 4) financial responsibility. Both Direct
Media and Lamar were deemed to have met the minimum qualifications as outlined in the RFP.
Qualifying proposals were then ranked by a pre-established formula based on their revenue proposal,
which factored both minimum annual guarantee and percentage of net sales.
Upon review of the revenue proposals, Direct Media’s proposal did not meet the minimum annual
guarantee specified in the RFP. Lamar’s revenue proposal exceeded the minimum annual guarantee for
each year. For the first three years of the contract period, Lamar’s minimum guarantee was a total of
$3.9 million more than that of Direct Media.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Lamar’s financial proposal was the most advantageous to RTD, offering a minimum guarantee of $4.0
million in 2015, $4.1 million in 2016 and $4.2 million in 2017 or 70 percent of net sales, whichever is
greater. For this reason, staff is recommending that the contract be awarded to Lamar.

Packet Pg. 38

1.B.3

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Award a contract to Lamar Advertising of Denver for the three year period January 1, 2015
through December 31, 2017 for the exclusive sale of exterior advertising on RTD buses, light rail
and commuter rail vehicles and for the non-exclusive sale of interior advertising on RTD buses,
light rail and commuter rail vehicles. Under the terms of this alternative, Lamar would remit to
RTD either 1) a minimum guarantee of $4.0 million in 2015, $4.1 million in 2016 and $4.2
million in 2017 or 2) seventy percent of net sales, whichever is greater. This is the staff
recommendation.
2.

Do not award a contract to Lamar Advertising of Denver and reissue the RFP. This alternative is
not recommended because the contract amount proposed by Lamar exceeded the minimum
guarantee required in the RFP and there is no indication that a higher revenue figure could be
obtained.

Peer Review: Fare Policies
• Transfers
– Most other agencies also offer free transfers.
– RTD’s 3 hour bus transfer period is notably longer.
– Some agencies limit the number of transfers.
– Portland and Dallas have gone to a 2-hour pass essentially
turning transfers into short duration passes.

• Day Passes
– Day passes introduced 20 years ago as a means of responding to
transfer fraud. Passes available on bus and from TVMs.
– RTD break even point at 3 trips which is in line with other
agencies.
– Many agencies sold day passes on buses or from TVMs.

• Discount Eligibility
– Some agencies have gone to integrating proof of discount
eligibility onto smart cards to minimize disputes with operators.

Opportunities for Fare Simplification
• RTD is only one of three agencies with a distance-based light rail
fare structure. Some agencies (e.g., San Diego and Portland) have
recently eliminated zones to simplify fares.
• RTD’s light rail fare is higher than the bus fare for a trip with the
same origin and destination. Offering comparable and affordable
fares on light rail and bus may enable RTD to provide service more
cost effectively.
• Surcharges for light rail and bus trips connecting to airports are
common. To offset the impact on airport employees, discounted
fares and passes are available for these employees.

1.C.1.a

Opportunities for Fare Simplification
• Smart card fare systems enable the introduction of accumulators
and fare capping. The implementation of smart card can eliminate
transfer abuse and improve enforcement.
• Some agencies are transitioning away from the concept of paying
for a trip (and offering transfers) towards the concept of buying time.
This can simplify fare enforcement by eliminating the need to
enforce complicated transfer policies, such as no round tripping.
• Day passes are another strategy some agencies have adopted to
minimize transfer abuse. Day passes are also popular among
customers who cannot afford the up front cost of longer period
passes and are convenient for social service agencies to distribute.
