Date:

Subject:

Approval of 2018 Public
Agency Safety Plan (PTASP)

Safety,

Board Meeting Date:
Transportation

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the 2018 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) as required by 49 CFR
Part 674 State Safety Oversight Regulations.
The recommended action proposed supports the following GM Goals:
Task Goal #3 Asset Management/State of Good Repair
DISCUSSION
The FTA created a new State Safety Oversight regulation 49 CFR Part 674 in 2016 and the Colorado
Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) was certified in April of 2018 making the new ruling effective in
August 2018. The new regulation replaced State Safety Oversight/System Safety Program Plan (SSPP)
regulation 49 CFR 659 which required transit agency’s to develop a System Safety Program Plan. The
new regulation requires Rail Transit Agencies to develop a Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan
(PTASP) based on a Safety Management System (SMS) framework that is signed by the Agency
Accountable Executive (General Manager and CEO) approved by the Board of Directors and then
submitted to the CPUC/State Safety Oversight Agency for certification annually.
However, the FTA only recently (July 2018) released the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan
regulation 49 CFR Part 673 which requires agencies to develop and be compliant with a PUC approved
PTASP by July 20, 2020. As a result of the mismatched timing of the regulations, we are in a
transitional period, still technically under Part 659 SSPP as an Agency, but also technically beholden to
the new Part 674 regulation. Therefore, we are submitting an initial PTASP in the SMS Framework that
is a bridge document that includes all certified SSPP elements plus some additional SMS elements. We
are asking for your approval of this 2018 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan, understanding that
it will meet all requirements for the current 49 CFR Part 659 SSPP requirements and the current PUC 49
CFR Part 674 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan transition requirements.
Financial Impact – There is no financial impact.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the 2018 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) to ensure
compliance with 49 CFR Part 674 State Safety Oversight regulations.
2. Do not approve the 2018 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) and RTD will not be
in compliance with 49 CFR Part 674 State Safety Oversight Regulations potentially forfeiting
government funding.

Approval of 15L Route Improvements Contract

General

Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to execute the
contract for the 15L Route Improvements with Jalisco International, Inc. in the dollar amount of
$8,690,000.00, subject to evaluating the bid for being responsive and responsible, and Colorado
Department of Transportation approval (CDOT). Funding for this contract is included in the 2019
Adopted Budget for the Colfax Transit Improvements project. Any changes to the contract amount and
performance will be made in compliance with the RTD Procurement Manual and agreements governing
the Grant funds.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 goal - Core Goal #1: Successful
Delivery of Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
The route 15L runs between the Decatur-Federal Station in Denver and the Aurora Metro Center Station
in Aurora, a total distance of 15 miles, on Colfax Avenue, owned by the Colorado Department of
Transportation. Between Broadway and I-225 the route makes limited stops, spaced approximately ½mile (8 blocks) apart. The 15 and 15L routes combined carry approximately 24,000 passengers on
weekdays, which is comparable to the southwest light rail corridor (C & D lines combined). Many of the
15L stops have more than 500 boardings per weekday, and the eastbound (EB) stop at Lincoln has more
than 2,000 boardings per weekday.
The 15L stops were originally constructed in 1986-87, many with “half-back” shelters consisting of a
canopy structure on top of a short concrete wall, along with benches built into the walls and trash
receptacles. Over the years many shelters have been damaged and removed, while others have been
removed due to safety concerns (i.e. EB Colfax at Lincoln). No significant capital improvements have
been made to the 15L stops in the last 30 years.
This requested Board action culminates RTD’s planning and design efforts that have been underway on
the East Colfax Corridor for several years. RTD, in a partnership with the City and County of Denver
(CCD), completed a Transit Signal Priority (TSP) study for the corridor in 2014. The study included
recommendations for bus stop enhancements as well as operational improvements including bus bulbs,
queue jump/bypass lanes and TSP that could be implemented in the near-term future to improve transit
travel time and reliability for the Route 15L.
With information from the completed study, RTD was able to secure a total of $9,025,000 in federal
and state grant funds, including a Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Ladders of Opportunity grant, a
CDOT FASTER grant, a DRCOG Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) grant, and
a Senate Bill -1 grant award, for design, construction, materials testing, and inspection of the project.
Since FASTER grant funds will be used, CDOT also must approve the award of this contract.

Packet Pg. 68

1.C.2

In a parallel effort, the City & County of Denver continues to pursue their Colfax Corridor Connections
project, which began in 2012 and eventually hopes to construct Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) dedicated lanes
in the center of Colfax. The Colfax Corridor Connections project is still in the concept phase, with
environmental clearance planned to begin in 2019. The Elevate Denver Bond Program set aside $55
million, for implementation of BRT from Auraria to Yosemite. The City and County of Denver does not
have all the funding identified to build the center running BRT project. The Elevate Denver Bond funds
need to be spent by 2027. RTD and CCD staff have been working together to ensure that Colfax
Corridor Connections will utilize the improvements put in place by the 15L Route Improvements Project.
Once the Colfax Corridor Connections BRT is constructed, the new shelters installed as part of this
project can be relocated to another BRT corridor within the District (e.g. Federal, Broadway, and Speer).
The shelters are designed to be moved, and have interchangeable parts with some of the other shelters
that we currently use.
DISCUSSION
The 15L Route Improvements project will improve the passenger experience, passenger safety, and
service reliability for 15L riders in the near-term until the Colfax Corridor Connections project is
constructed. Improvements are planned to be made to 37 stops (total, eastbound and westbound)
including:
Bus Stop Improvements
 Enhanced shelters with lighting, trash receptacles and benches
 Security cameras at most stops
 Programmable Information Display Systems (PIDS) as a pilot program at six stops
 Concrete bus pads
Operational Improvements
 Bus bulbouts (curb extensions) at 11 stops
o Bulbouts allow buses to stop in the travel lane, improving safety and reducing dwell time
o Bulbouts also provide additional space for amenities and waiting passengers
 Queue bypass lanes and queue jump signals for buses at 9 locations
 Relocating stops to the far-side of the intersection where possible
 Expanded boarding areas with space for two buses where possible
 Re-spacing of bus stops per Service Development
 Transit signal priority at 14 intersections in Denver (already installed under a separate project)
After completing the required environmental review and developing 100% construction plans for the
above listed improvements, RTD issued an Invitation for Bid (IFB) on September 17, 2018. A pre-bid
and Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) outreach meeting was held on October 4, and bid opening
was on November 13, 2018. The apparent low bidder is Jalisco International, Inc. Document review is
being finalized to determine if the apparent low bidder is responsive and responsible.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 69

1.C.2

The funds for this Project are appropriated in the 2019 Adopted Budget. Funding for maintenance of the
new shelters, lighting, and camera systems elements has been included in the mid-range plan ($125,000
for 2019 and $250,000 for subsequent years).
DBE / SBE GOAL
RTD has established a 24% DBE participation goal. Jalisco International, Inc. is a DBE firm, and has
committed to meet the DBE goal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to
execute the contract for the 15L Route improvements with Jalisco International, Inc. in the dollar
amount of $8,690,000.00, subject to evaluating the bid for being responsive and responsible,
and Colorado Department of Transportation approval (CDOT). Funding for this contract is
included in the 2019 Adopted Budget for the Colfax Transit Improvements project.
Any
changes to the contract amount and performance will be made in compliance with the RTD
Procurement Manual and Agreements governing the Grant funds.
2. Do not accept the recommended action. Allow the 15L to operate as it exists today and continue
to maintain the existing stops. This is not recommended, since the awarded grants could be lost.
3. Resolicit the work. This is not recommended as construction bid prices continue to trend
upwards, and it is possible that grant funding could be lost.

Approval of Contract Extension and Increase
for Jacobs Engineering for FasTracks Program
Support Consulting Services

General

Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering for
Program Support Consulting Services (PSC) for FasTracks, to extend the contract completion date from
December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, and to increase the contract not-to-exceed amount by
$1,200,000 to a total of $192,623,336. Funding for this contract is included in the 2019 Adopted
Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where Program Support Consulting
(PSC) support would be utilized.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 goal - Core Goal #1:
Delivery of Transit Services.

Successful

BACKGROUND
On May 24, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to CarterBurgess (later purchased by Jacobs Engineering) for Program Support Consulting Services at an initial
2005 Contract amount of $2,360,000, and a Notice to Proceed of July 5, 2005. The RTD Board
approved subsequent contract amendments through June 30, 2017 that have brought the current
Contract Not-to-Exceed price up to $191,423,336. In May, 2017, the Board extended the contract
completion date to December 31, 2019 without increasing the contract price. At that time, the contract
was amended to cover specific named individuals and functional areas, with projected timeframes of
availability for each one.
The PSC team provides program management support and specialized technical staff support to augment
RTD FasTracks Team staff. Key PSC staff members are co-located with RTD Staff at the RTD FasTracks
offices. The PSC functions as an extension of RTD staff. This approach adds value, cost-effectively, by
allowing RTD to tap the PSC’s specialized resources in planning, environmental, design, engineering,
construction management support, program control, and related disciplines on an as-needed, often parttime, basis.
DISCUSSION
The Program Support Consultant Contract originally was specified for a term of six years with a six-year
option, to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work tasks. In May, 2017, the contract end
date was extended to the current end date of December 31, 2019.
RTD has reached the stage of the FasTracks program where several of the ongoing corridor projects
have reached revenue service, and are entering the closeout phase. At this time, it is crucial to retain
the institutional knowledge needed to close out all contracts, meet final reporting requirements for FTA
grant projects, and finalize the transactions and mapping that will secure the right-of-way for the

Packet Pg. 77

1.C.4

program alignments, including survey and mapping support for final acquisitions and utility relocations,
post-construction surveys, and filing of right-of-way plans. The proposed time extension to the Jacobs
contract would make the resources available to RTD to complete the project closeout in a timely and
cost-effective manner.
In addition, as part of the contract closeout process, RTD faces claims and lawsuits related to its
projects. Support from the PSC staff that were involved in the original issue could be critical to
resolving the issues in a manner that would be most favorable to RTD.
The contract extension will cover specific named individuals and functional areas, with projected
timeframes of availability for each one. In the event that a named individual were to leave Jacobs
before the end of the contract timeframe, the contract would be amended to remove all remaining hours
for that individual. Any future consultant support outside of these designated areas will be procured
through the Construction Management Support Consultant contract with Triunity-Hill, and will not be
added to the scope of this contract.
The contract extension identifies the following specific functions and tasks in support of FasTracks:
Program Management
 Assist RTD in coordinating the overall program-wide and project mapping, right-of-way (ROW),
and utility survey for all corridors and facilities
North Metro
 Provide construction support through end of 2020
 Perform mapping, survey and right-of-way support
I-225
 Provide mapping, survey and right-of-way support
 Provide construction support through project closeout
SEC Ext.
 Provide mapping, survey and right-of-way support.
Eagle P3 (East, Gold, CRMF, Northwest Rail Electrified Segment)
 Provide P3 and railroad support through project closeout
 Provide Federal Agency Liaison and Risk Manager through project closeout
 Provide full time Project Controls Manager and Contract Manager through project closeout
 Provide FEIS/ROD mitigation monitoring through project closeout
 Provide field survey, mapping, and right-of-way management support
 Provide construction oversight through project closeout
 Provide support for the ongoing litigation with Denver Transit Partners
RTD has established a 7% DBE goal for this Contract. The DBE report through September 2018
indicates that the PSC’s actual cumulative DBE percentage has been 19%. RTD does not foresee any
additional opportunities for DBE subcontracting through this contract extension because all of the named
roles are filled by Jacobs employees. If RTD were to spend the full Contract Not to Exceed amount, the
DBE participation on the overall contract would be approximately 18.6%.

Packet Pg. 78

1.C.4

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the PSC contract from 2005 through 2020, would
increase to $192,623,336 with this amendment. Funding for the remainder of this contract is included
in the 2019 Adopted Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where PSC
support would be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve
a contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering for Program Support Consulting Services for
FasTracks, to extend the contract completion date from December 31, 2019 to December 31,
2020, and to increase the contract not-to-exceed amount by $1,200,000 to a total of
$192,623,336. Funding for this contract is included in the 2019 Adopted Budget for the
FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to extend the
contract completion date for Jacobs Engineering. This is not recommended because RTD does not
have in-house staff with the institutional knowledge, background, and technical skills of the
specific staff to be retained through this amendment, and would not be able to replace their
expertise in a timely and cost-effective manner.

General

Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to FRSC to extend the
contract completion date from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019, and increase the total
contract amount by $1,743,739, for a total contract authorization of $72,726,498. Funding for this
scope is included in the 2019 Adopted Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects
where FRSC support would be utilized.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 goal - Core Goal #1: Successful
Delivery of Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
In April 2005, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for professional services for a Systems
Engineering Consultant for the overall FasTracks Systems Engineering Services. On September 20,
2005 the RTD Board approved the selection and award to FRSC for the Systems Engineering work for a
six year term and an option for another six years. The RTD Board approved exercising the six year option
in November 2011. Subsequently, the FRSC contract was due to expire in November of 2017. In May
of 2017 the Board approved a one year extension of the contract on projects that FRSC had extensive
involvement with. This extension carried forward valuable historical project knowledge and experience.
FRSC has successfully performed the stated tasks outlined in the original Scope of Work. Specific
systems design and support scope in their contract includes traction electrification system (TES)
including overhead contact system (OCS) and traction power substations (TPSS), train control,
communication and central control system, corrosion control, systemwide electrical, rail vehicles, and
operation planning support. FRSC has worked with RTD staff in a number of areas:


Provided engineering review and inspection services of the Eagle P3 commuter rail vehicles

Packet Pg. 80

1.C.5



Provided engineering advising services in regard to the commuter rail vehicle equalizer beam
warranty issue

DISCUSSION
The RTD selected a single Systems Engineering Consultant for the entire FasTracks Program for
consistency and standardization of design. This approach has saved the RTD cost and will continue to
facilitate the operation and maintenance of the system. This work effort was consistent with the work
required to move each corridor forward and maintain the FasTracks schedule.
RTD has reached the stage of the FasTracks program where several of the ongoing corridor projects
have reached revenue service, and are entering the closeout phase. At this time, it is crucial to retain
the institutional knowledge needed to close out all contracts and meet the final reporting requirements
for FTA grant projects. Other projects will be completing construction and entering systems integrated
testing in 2019. The proposed time extension to the FRSC contract would make the resources available
to RTD to complete construction, systems integrated testing, and project closeout in a timely and costeffective manner.
Specific projects where FRSC assistance is anticipated to continue in 2019 include:
 Eagle P3 Commuter Rail Project
 North Metro Rail Line Project
 Southeast Rail Extension Project
 14th & California Track Replacement Project
 Power Switch Upgrade Support Project
 Mariposa Yard Switch Heaters Project
 Welton Blankout Signs Project
 System Wide Stray Current Monitoring
In addition to the listed FasTracks projects, FRSC is the designer of record of state of good repair
projects on the base system. These projects are currently underway but unfinished and retention of
FRSC is recommended for cost and practically purposes. New projects will be assigned to the current
Systems On-Call Consultant (HNTB)
The DBE goal for this contract was set at 10%. To date FRSC has achieved a 20.3% DBE goal. FRSC
has proposed a 15.9% DBE goal for base system work and 17.3% DBE goal for FasTracks work in
2019. Both of these goals exceed the RTD proposed goal of 10%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for project scope of work to be completed in 2019 is included in the 2019 Adopted Budget for
the FasTracks capital program and in previously approved budgets for base system projects in the
specific projects where FRSC support would be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve
a contract amendment to FRSC to extend the contract completion date from December 31, 2018
to December 31, 2019, and increase the total contract amount by $1,743,739, for a total
contract authorization of $72,726,498. Funding for this scope is included in the 2019 Adopted
Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where FRSC support would be
utilized.

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the System Engineering approach. This is
not recommended as RTD does not currently have the specialized staff to meet the System
Engineering needs of the FasTracks Program. Selection of alternative two could delay
implementation of the FasTracks Program.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Date:

Subject:

Authorization for Acquisition of Property for
the North Metro Maintenance Facility

General

Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying certain properties as necessary for
the North Metro Maintenance Facility and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under
state eminent domain law.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 Goal – Task Goal #1 – Successful
Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
RTD’s decision to self-perform the North Metro Commuter Rail Line operations and maintenance was
supported by Board adoption of the Strategic Budget Plan and Annual Program Evaluation (APE) which
included RTD’s direct operation and maintenance of the corridor on October 24, 2017. On November
28, 2017, the RTD Board adopted the 2018 budget which included funding for the North Metro capital
budget of $13.4 million which included the first year of facilities modifications, rescue locomotive, fleet
vehicles, heavy equipment and additional expenditures required to support revenue service. Additional
funding for capital projects is included in the 2019 budget.
As part of N Line operations, RTD will require two capital maintenance facilities; the third bay of the 711
Facility and permanent Maintenance of Way facility to be located on properties identified and shown on
the exhibit to the attached resolution.
DISCUSSION
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by survey and authorize the
General Manager and/or Project Managers to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition is included in the North Metro budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Pass the attached resolution. It is recommended by Planning/Capital Programs and FasTracks
Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying
certain properties as necessary for construction of the North Metro Maintenance Facility and
authorizing staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.

2. Do not pass the attached resolution. This is not recommended as failure to acquire required
properties would result in the inability to provide the necessary facility required for the operation
and maintenance of the North Metro Commuter Rail N Line.

Re:

December Board Update

Prior to the November Election BBMK coordinated a call with Shad Murib, Chief of Staff for
Governor Elect Polis to discuss transit-oriented development and affordable housing. General
Manager Genova and Sherry Ellebracht provided an update on RTD’s experience with TOD and
offered the District as a resource on these issues. In addition to this call, at the request of
Governor Elect Polis BBMK submitted a two-page memo detailing RTD’s priorities for 2019.
BBMK is working with RTD Executive Staff to coordinate a tour for legislators of the Transit
Oriented Development sites within the District. The tour will be on November 28th at 9:45am
meeting at the Whole Foods Store on the corner by Chestnut Place. BBMK invited the newly
elected members to participate in this tour and will continue to educate legislators about the
District’s impact in Colorado. To date we have a number of new legislators attending as well as
legislative council staff for the Transportation Committee.
Governor Hickenlooper submitted his final budget request on November 1st. Governor Elect
Polis will have an opportunity to make changes to this request, but those changes will have to go
through the JBC supplemental process. Governor Hickenlooper’s budget request includes:
•
•
•
•

•

•
•
•
•
•

FY19-20 budget request is for $33.4 billion or a 4.8% increase in total funds. This
includes a General fund request of $13.2 billion or a 4.7% increase over FY18-19.
Reducing the Budget Stabilization Fact by $77 million to $595 million.
Increases per pupil spending by $182.02 to a total of $7,606.68 (2.45 percent).
$10 million investment in key initiatives emerging from the bipartisan Education
Leadership Council to address teacher shortages, incentives for students completing
industry credentials, internships and apprenticeships.
$9.7 million from Marijuana Tax Cash Funds for 105 additional school health
professionals to increase substance abuse, mental health prevention and intervention
programs.
$6.5 million for scholarships to college students that commit to teaching in rural and
underserved school districts.
$200 million will be provided to transportation as a result of SB18-001.
$2 million to hire more state troopers.
$40 million to replenish the controlled maintenance fund as the money was used for
wildfires.
Increase the general fund reserve from 7.25% to 8%. This would require legislation.

Increase of $121 million general fund to keep tuition flat at all public institutions of
higher ed for school year 2019-20.
A change in the TABOR surplus refund mechanism to childcare, workforce development
and working families via tax credits, in addition to the existing Senior Homestead Act.
This would require legislation.
Merit pay increase of 3.0 percent for most state employees beginning July 1, 2019.
$247.2 million in total capital construction with $224.4 million coming from the General
Fund.
Medicaid provider rate increase of 1.0 percent across the board for community providers.
$130 million in MTCF appropriations and transfers. Approval of the governor’s request
would leave 19.4 million available for other purposes in FY19-20 or future fiscal years.
PERA Direct distribution allocation to all departments through a compensation common
policy which allocates 56.5. million including 29.2 million to general fund and 27.3
million to cash and federal fund sources. This would require legislation.

The failure of the two transportation ballot initiatives punts transportation funding back to the
legislature to decide a path forward. As a result of SB18-001 the legislation submits a question
to the voter’s in 2019 and this session will determine if that question will indeed be on the ballot.
The Polis Administration announced his transition team and has selected as chairs of the
Transportation, Infrastructure and Local Affairs the following community members;
Co-chairs: Former House Democratic Leader Sal Pace and Former House Speaker Crisanta
Duran. Members: Rutt Bridges; Tim Mauck; and Dr. Florine Raitano.

• Return of CRP funds on RRIF Loan: Seeking the return of the $29 million credit risk
premium on the now-repaid RRIF loan for the DUS project.
• Secured favorable provision in FY 2018 Omnibus Appropriations bill (March 2018)
defining each cohort as loans made in a single year.
• US DOT secured special “anomaly language” in the Continuing Resolution
(September 2018) to effectively un-do our provision.
• FY 2019 transportation spending bill may define cohorts in law.
• Upcoming Opportunities for RTD:
• Shape infrastructure bill and FAST Act reauthorization from RTD’s position as a
national leader: As a recipient of 5 FFGAs, 2 TIFIA loans and a RRIF loan, RTD
knows both the benefits and challenges of advancing major projects.
• Pursue project earmarks if reestablished by Congress.
• In reauthorization, pursue formula funding at or above FY 2018 levels and a HTF

revenue solution to support those levels.
• Continue to pursue Federal discretionary grants, particularly after recent State-level

transportation funding ballot measures were unsuccessful.

• Common Ground: Democrats take control of the House and have reinvigorated efforts to

move a large, well-funded infrastructure bill. President Trump has repeatedly stated he can
work with Democrats on infrastructure.
• Democrats: Envision a big and bold bill, with support for projects of national significance.

Rejected Trump’s earlier infrastructure proposal as lacking new revenues, over reliant on
finance tools and P3s, and undermining transit and environmental protections.
• Trump: After Trump’s infrastructure proposal found few supporters in Republican-led

House and Senate and showed little nexus to his transportation budget proposals, unclear
what Trump may advance in 2019.
• How to pay for it? Same politically-difficult options remain (more later).
• Tax increase:

• Cons: Big infrastructure bill, independent of FAST Act reauthorization, is not a
“must pass” bill so could lack the momentum required to carry a tax increase.
• Pros:
• DeFazio wants $1 trillion bill with “real money” that only a robust revenue
increase could support.
• Restoring earmarks could build direct Congressional support to fund them.
• Deficit spending (tax reform legislation).

• Deadline: FAST Act reauthorization is “must pass” legislation: virtually all FAST Act spending
ends on September 30, 2020.
• New Policies: Where an infrastructure bill may funnel funds into current FAST Act programs, a
reauthorization bill would make substantive policy changes, large and small.
• New Revenues? With Democrats – who are not retreating from the notion of a gas tax increase
– bill could finally include a Highway Trust Fund revenue solution, not just another revenue
patch.
• Closing the gap between spending levels and dedicated HTF revenues seen as “unfinished
business” from FAST Act.
• Even if new revenues are secured, all sides will pursue ways to make limited Federal funds go
further:
• Take from one program and give to another.
• Scale back what constitutes a Federal interest.
• Ask others to do more: incentives to attract greater local, State, and private investment.
• Reduce Federal requirements that may impact project costs.
• Leverage limited Federal funds: TIFIA, RRIF, WIFIA, private activity bonds.
• Return of earmarks? House Democrats may push for reinstating project earmarks, asserting
Congress’ “power of the purse,” particularly where Congress questions Executive Branch
exercise of discretion over programs, like New Starts and BUILD (TIGER).

• Spending exceeds HTF revenues by almost $20 billion/year, shored up by transfers

from the General Fund under the FAST Act, through FY 2020.
HTF will be insolvent at the end of the FAST Act, FY 2021. So clear nexus between HTF
solution and FAST Act reauthorization.
To simply fund the next transportation bill at current program levels, Congress must
close this revenue gap.
• Could do yet another revenue patch or a true revenue solution.
• But no expectation that Congress will live within the current means of the HTF,
i.e., reduce program funding in the next bill to levels well below the FAST Act.
Filling the gap? Known, well-defined, and viable options, but each is politically difficult.
• Gas tax increase?
• Supported to varying degrees by many Democrats, President Trump.
• For Republicans, a very heavy political lift and could erode their support for
any infrastructure bill – even one promoted by President Trump.
• Vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) fee? Privacy concerns remain.
Timing: 2019 is the year to act; Congress likely won’t pass a major tax increase in an
election year (2020).
