BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Account-based Ticketing Contract Extension and Fixed
Fees

Committee Meeting Date:
September 13, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
September 28, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to extend the
contract with Masabi by one year and implement a fixed monthly fee.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Tonya Anderson, Senior Product Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Account-based Ticketing (ABT) initiative is a fare modernization project to decommission the current
card-based Conduent Smart Media Technology System implemented in 2013 and replace it with the
Masabi Justride Platform. The Board of Directors approved the project with an amendment to the Masabi
contract to implement ABT on October 27, 2020, and a new bus and rail platform validator contract
with Masabi on April 20, 2021.
The key project elements include adding new features to the RTD Mobile Tickets app, including stored
value accounts, tap-to-ride fare payment, and fare capping; launching a newly branded MyRide card;
replacing bus and rail platform validators, upgrading the fare enforcement inspection devices and app,
and transitioning pass program customers from using the legacy smart cards to using mobile barcodes or
new ABT smart cards.
RTD and Masabi have been implementing the ABT system components during the course of July and
August 2022, with an anticipated go-live date in October 2022, with full completion expected at the end
of 2022.
DISCUSSION
Masabi currently charges RTD a commission for each transaction in the mobile ticketing application. In
addition, RTD reimburses Masabi for the payment card fees that Masabi incurs on behalf of RTD. RTD
and Masabi began discussions in March 2022 regarding the potential to negotiate a fixed fee
arrangement with the implementation of ABT to provide both entities with a more stable revenue and
cost agreement which would also incorporate the costs of software licensing related to the ABT
validators and other features such as the fare inspection app licenses, an online portal for customers,
and a vendor portal for the ABT retail network.

Packet Pg. 32

16.A

A fixed fee arrangement with Masabi would combine the existing mobile ticketing fees, ABT fees, and
customer and vendor portal fees into a fixed monthly payment and amend the contract with Masabi to
extend the term for one year under this arrangement. Masabi would continue to charge RTD for payment
card fees at a reduced rate.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of this recommended action results in a one-year extension of the Masabi contract
with a not-to-exceed amount of $2,800,000. This cost will be partially offset by the elimination of the
legacy Conduent smart card system with identified savings of $988,000 and possibly more, depending
on adoption of ABT electronic fare media as opposed to MyRide cards. Funding has been included in the
2022 Amended Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Bank Signature Authorization

Committee Meeting Date:
September 13, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
September 28, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization to authorize
certain staff members to sign payments exceeding certain thresholds regarding checks, automated
clearing house payments, and wire transfers and to remove the requirement that Board Officers provide
wet signatures for certain payments.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Throughout RTD’s procurement, invoicing and payment processes, several internal budgetary controls
serve to prevent incorrect payments including a robust approval process that must conform with the
Board appropriated budget.
Signature authorizations for certain large payments are one such control. Payment thresholds have been
established that require specific signatures for these payments to be processed by the Accounts Payable
Division and RTD’s commercial bank, currently Wells Fargo.
Board approval is currently necessary to designate which individuals may sign these payments and to
authorize them to do so. Current practice requires a signature from an authorized staff member as well
as a Board Officer for payments of $100,000 and above. This requires a Board Officer to provide wet
signatures for these payments at least once a week.
Budgetary controls prevent the issuance of payments without explicit prior authorization; by definition,
spending authority for any pending payment that currently requires Board Officer signature has already
been granted, either under the Board’s authority or that of the General Manager and CEO GM/CEO,
meaning that a wet signature is in essence perfunctory.
Wells Fargo relies on a positive pay system in which requests for disbursements by customers must
match payment files received from RTD in order to avoid fraud. Wells Fargo does not review payment
requests for correct signatures or the number of signatures but does require authorized signatories to
complete a separate Wells Fargo form “signature card” for their record of authorized individuals.

Packet Pg. 34

16.B

Currently, the Accounts Payable Division processes approximately 400 checks, Automated Clearing
House (ACH) transfers and wire payments each week, of which approximately 10 such transactions
require a wet signature from a Board Officer under current practices.
In order to obtain a wet signature from a Board member, this process requires that the Accounts Payable
Division send these payment requests from the District Shops facility to the Blake Street offices twice a
week to obtain signatures, which necessitates additional administrative efforts and record-keeping and
can result in delayed payment to vendors.
DISCUSSION
Aligned with the Strategic Priority of Financial Success, RTD takes very seriously the management of all
financial resources, this Recommended Action seeks Board approval to remove the requirement for Board
Officer signatures for checks, ACH transfers and wire payments.
Best practices for payment authorization are included in RTD’s internal control process. Obtaining
additional signatures from Board creates additional burdens for staff as well as for the Board member
who must travel to the Blake Street offices to provide payment signatures.
Both Wells Fargo and Plante Moran, RTD’s external auditor, have independently confirmed that requiring
a second signature from a Board Officer is a highly uncommon practice and does not enhance controls.
In approving this Recommended Action, the Board duly authorizes the GM/CEO, the Chief Financial
Officer, the Chief Operations Officer, and the Chief Administrative Officer to continue to approve
payments within their designated signing authority.
Any future change to the staff positions authorized as bank signatories requires Board approval.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of this Recommended Action.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Salaried Trustee Appointment

Committee Meeting Date:
September 13, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
September 28, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve Resolution No. ______, Series of 2022, appointing Bill Sirois,
Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities, to a term expiring December 31, 2023, as a Trustee for
the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit Pension Plan (pension plan) and Salaried Employee Defined
Contribution Retirement Plan (DC plan) effective October 1, 2022.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 001, Series of 2008 (Resolution No.
1), which established a committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee
Pension Trust Fund, and the Finance Chair (i.e., the Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit
Committee as it existed at that time) to screen applications from prospective pension and DC plan
trustees from among “the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management
salaried employee class and…[to] bring recommendations back to the Board.”
As a revision to the process established in Resolution No. 001, the Board adopted Resolution No. 27,
Series of 2010, which stated that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have served satisfactorily and in
whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to seek applications
for renewal, and instead the application process established by the Board in 2008 would be used on
those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or appropriate to appoint new salaried Trustees to
the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008, Series of 2016 (Resolution No. 008), the RTD Board of
Directors amended the Defined Benefit Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Retirement Trust
(Trusts, collectively) to remove the “senior” and “middle” management distinction established in
Resolution No. 001. Instead, Resolution No. 008 authorized the Board to appoint two employee trustees
who participate in the pension plan and two who participate in the DC plan, as well as two Directors
appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a permanent member of the Trusts, to
serve as the same trustees on both trusts.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 46

16.C

voting Trustee. Mr. Van Meter is a participant in the Salaried Pension Plan as is Mr. Sirois.

There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action.

o The establishment of a Joint Union Management Safety Committee
o Public health emergency response criteria
• Incorporation of Operational Risk Management
• Notable continuity with
o The 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, including mission, vision, values, and strategic priorities

1.1

Policy

The first element of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) is Safety Policy. This, in its most
simple form, is the safety policy developed, approved, and signed by the Regional Transportation District
(RTD), a multimodal agency comprising bus, light rail, commuter rail, and special services in the Denver
metro area. This element also describes RTD’s commitment to safety; its objectives, safety goals, and the
organizational structure established; and plans written to obtain these goals and objectives.
In August 2021, the RTD Board of Directors adopted a new strategic plan that looks toward the next
five years of the agency’s future. The document—against which all initiatives, projects, and priorities are
measured—serves as a blueprint for success and outlines the intentionality RTD will bring with its redefined
mission: “We make lives better through connections.”
The strategic plan was developed by General Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson and RTD’s executive
leadership team in concert with the agency’s 15-member Board of Directors. It establishes four strategic
priorities—community value, customer excellence, employee ownership, and financial success—that serve
as functional pillars to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure RTD’s overall performance.
Development of the PTASP was completed in accordance with RTD’s strategic plan; Title 49 Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 672, 673, and 674; and Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) State
Safety Oversight (SSO) Program Procedures and Standards.
RTD has adopted a Safety Management System (SMS) approach to administering safety throughout the
organization. SMS is flexible and scalable and consists of four elements as described in the following table:
SMS Element

Description

Safety Policy

Definition of safety policies, procedures, and organizational structure

Safety Risk Management

Formal process for management of hazards to an acceptable level of risk

Safety Assurance

Establishment of process measures, assessments, and controls to assess the
effectiveness of risk control strategies

Safety Promotion

Safety training and risk communication practices to promote a culture of safety

1.1.2

Authority

RTD is a special transportation district of the state of Colorado and is authorized under Colorado Revised
Statutes Title 32, Article 9. As such, the district has its own taxing authority and operates within the
counties of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, Jefferson, and Weld. The agency is
governed by its elected Board of Directors and managed by the General Manager and CEO, who develops
and implements a comprehensive and integrated PTASP. To that end, the General Manager, by signature
authority of the district’s Safety Policy Statement, has authorized the RTD Chief Safety Officer (CSO) to
develop and implement a PTASP as an operating document of the agency for all modes of operations,
including light rail, and bus/paratransit.

1. POLICY

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) recognizes the CPUC as the state safety oversight agency for RTD.
CPUC-SSO is FTA’s certified safety oversight agency, working cooperatively to regulate RTD’s light rail transit,
by ensuring compliance with state and federal requirements, regulations, and guidance, as applicable.
The FTA functions as both a funding administrator and as a federal regulator as defined by 49 CFR Parts
670, 672, 673, and 674. The FTA conducts regular reviews of the state safety oversight agency (CPUCSSOA), to determine the SSO’s and RTD’s compliance to the FTA’s general requirements. RTD’s light rail
service is regulated by the FTA and CPUC-SSO agencies.

1.1.3

Policy Statement

As the accountable executive for all operations and activities, I will ensure that resources are available
to make the SMS robust and successful. RTD executive leadership will take steps to prevent workplace
incidents, injuries, and illnesses and will provide support of safety program initiatives. RTD will consider
employee suggestions for achieving a safer, healthier workplace; keep informed about workplace safety
and health hazards; and regularly review the agency’s safety programs.
RTD is committed to:
●

Integrating safety management among the primary responsibilities of all managers and employees

●

Clearly defining accountabilities, expectations, and responsibilities for the delivery of RTD’s SMS
performance for all levels of staff

●

Supporting the SMS with appropriate human and financial resources

●

Developing an organizational culture that fosters safe practices, and encourages effective
employee safety reporting and communication

●

Enhancing hazard identification, analysis, and safety risk evaluation activities, including an
employee safety reporting program, to eliminate or mitigate the safety risks resulting from all
activities to a level of safety as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP)

●

Complying with federal, state, and RTD safety-related requirements, rules, and standards

●

Ensuring that all staff are provided with appropriate safety-related information, equipment, and
training

●

Establishing and measuring our safety performance against realistic, data-driven safety
performance indicators and targets

●

Continually improving safety performance through management processes that ensure appropriate
actions are taken and assure effectiveness

●

Ensuring externally supplied systems and services meet RTD’s safety performance standards

RTD managers and supervisors are responsible for communicating this policy to employees supervising
and training workers in safe work practices. They are expected to reinforce safe work, behaviors, and
compliance with agency safety rules and to work to eliminate hazardous conditions. Managers and
supervisors will lead safety efforts by example.
All RTD employees are expected and encouraged to participate in safety activities, including reporting
hazards, unsafe work practices, near misses, and accidents immediately to their supervisor or a safety
committee/department representative.

Disciplinary action will not be taken against an employee who acts to prevent an injury or who reports any
accident, incident, near miss, concern, or hazard to any level of management. All employees are required
to abide by the standards and procedures set forth in the SMS policy and the PTASP. Behaviors such as
illegal activity, negligence, acts of willful misconduct, or undue care and attention shall be considered
outside the scope of this policy.
The SMS Program is managed under my authority by the CSO, who has direct access to me. All levels of
management and all employees are accountable for the delivery of the highest level of safety performance,
starting with the General Manager and CEO.

16.D.b

The overall consideration in the development of the agency’s PTASP is to provide safe and reliable
movement of customers throughout the transit system. The customers and the general public must be
confident that the RTD transit system is a safe system. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to design,
construct, and maintain a system that aims to reduce recognized hazards as much as practicable with the
safety of employees, customers, and the general public in mind. RTD’s objectives will be met by drawing
information from system observation, local and state codes, federal guidelines, and specific agency
requirements into an SMS to ensure a safe transportation system.
RTD will track the following safety performance measures as required by the National Public Transportation
Safety Plan:
●

Fatalities (total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode)

●

Injuries (total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode)

●

Safety Events (total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode)

●

System Reliability (mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode)

RTD’s safety performance targets for 2023 are:
●

Preventable accident rate per 100,000 miles:
○

●

●

Combined bus and light rail, less than 1.0

5% reduction of:
○

lost time days due to on-the-job Injuries (OJIs)

○

OJIs

○

slip and fall injuries

○

injuries from strains

Measure and hold to current levels of performance for system reliability without decline in reliability
or increases in costs as described in the current Transit Asset Management Plan (TAMP).

Specific activities to achieve these safety performance targets for the 2023 calendar year include the following:
●

Continue developing, formalizing, and maturing the SMS, focusing on key processes that will
improve and strengthen RTD’s efforts

●

Continue the implementation of the Event Notification, Reporting and Investigation Policy and
Procedure

●

framework for guiding the SMS. All agency safety policies are available on the intranet.

1.2.3

Integrating Safety Into All Aspects of RTD

The objective of the SMS is the continual improvement of processes and operations to maximize safety to
the highest practicable level. This effort is undertaken by providing continual opportunities for employees
to be reminded of safety, incorporate safe practices into their operations, and supply each employee with
multiple means to identify potential hazards.
RTD accomplishes this through safety training, safety moments at meetings, safety committee meetings,
weekly safety messages, safety poster campaigns, identification and mitigation of hazards, and proactive
reviews and inspections to identify potential hazards.
Within different departments, multiple means of incorporating safety are presented. As examples:
● Safety is a part of Planning Department meetings to plan for safety in new projects at the
earliest opportunity

1.3 Overview of Management Structure
RTD Board of Directors and Executive Staff

RTD was created by the Colorado General Assembly in 1969 for the purpose of providing a public mass
transportation system for residents of the district. The agency began operations in 1972. A 15-member
elected Board of Directors is the legislative body for RTD and determines all questions of overall
governance and policy for RTD. The Board of Directors appoints the GM/CEO, who is ultimately responsible
for safety.
The GM/CEO has full charge of the acquisition, construction, maintenance, and operations of the system
and facilities of RTD, and of the administration of RTD business affairs. The GM/CEO supervises executive
staff, including Chief Officers and AGMs. Included among these officers is the Chief Operations Officer,
who is responsible for bus and rail transit operations. The CSO has the responsibility for agency safety. The
Safety Division reports monthly to the GM/CEO.
The following activities will assure that safety goals and objectives are achieved:
●

Perform timely review of accident and incident investigation summary reports to identify trends and
recommend corrective action to minimize loss

●

Review reports of system standard operating procedures and rules for compliance with
established guidelines

●

Review summary reports regarding periodic equipment and facility inspections, and system
hazard analysis

●

Promote safety awareness by incorporating customer and employee involvement

1.3.2

Management — Key Role in Safety Overview

The SMS will be incorporated into every aspect of transit services, by rail and bus service managers.
Safe operations of the bus and rail divisions are the responsibility of the AGMs. Each department has
an AGM or Chief Officer, who, along with Senior Managers, Managers, and Supervisors, is responsible
for implementing policies and procedures for safe operations. The AGMs of the rail and bus divisions
have charged their management teams to effectively manage safety; to develop safety programs, plans,
procedures, training, policies, and rules to govern safety; and to fully comply with the PTASP. Bus and rail
maintenance facilities are staffed with a Manager of Maintenance responsible for the safe operation of
their employees within the facility and are supported by Shift Supervisors and maintenance workers. RTD
models policies, procedures, and processes for occupational safety and health on Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) regulations.
Supervisors’ responsibilities place them at the forefront of RTD’s safety efforts. A significant portion of their
duties is monitoring, ensuring, and emphasizing safety performance and rules compliance, and promoting
a strong safety climate. All employees are charged with adhering to safety, but supervisors are RTD’s key
to improved safety-related behavior and positive safety outcomes. Supervisors have the responsibility to
monitor safety compliance of their employees and ensure employees understand their job functions and
the associated safety requirements.
RTD safety and health are managed at all levels of staff. All employees are trained in safety and job
duties, and are given responsibility for their own safety, as well as the safety of the individuals with whom
they work. All employees have the responsibility to halt an operation or stop work if it is deemed to be
unsafe. RTD’s system safety processes emphasize open and consistent dialogue between leaders and

1.3.5

Climate/Geography

The Denver metro region normally has a semi-arid continental climate with four well-defined seasons.
Summers are characterized by hot, dry weather, but the high temperatures are usually not oppressive
since the relative humidity is generally low and the nights usually cool. August is the hottest month, with
temperatures reading 90-100 degrees Fahrenheit. Winters are cold but usually not severe. The average
annual snowfall is less than 65 inches at Denver International Airport, but much higher amounts fall in
foothill locations. Precipitation is generally light during the summer and early fall but may be heavy in the
spring when storms from the Pacific Ocean move through the area more frequently than any other season
of the year.
RTD’s transit services extend throughout the Front Range area at a width of approximately 60 miles
between Pine Junction and Denver International Airport. The north-south coverage area ranges from
Longmont to Lone Tree, a distance of 70 miles. Service areas include the foothills situated along the Front
Range of the Rocky Mountains. Elevations range from approximately 4,850 feet above sea level to greater
than 9,000 feet above sea level in the foothills.

1.4 PTASP Annual Updates, Revisions,
and Changes

16.D.b

Continuous improvement is defined by FTA as a process by which a transit agency examines safety
performance to identify safety deficiencies and carry out a plan to address the identified safety
deficiencies.
RTD has established a leadership safety committee that meets regularly throughout the year to review
the current performance of the agency, against the safety performance targets and the strategic plan
objectives, and to take action to address any safety deficiencies that are identified.
RTD will use the management review cycle (annual PTASP update) along with performance data for the
SMS to identify and prioritize continuous improvement of each process. All levels of management, from
the accountable executive to managers, are involved in this management review cycle. This method is
consistent with SMS principles and allows for the resourcing and prioritization of SMS efforts.

1.6 SMS Documentation and Records
Documentation and recordkeeping pertinent to each component or subcomponent of SMS is described
in the relevant section of the SMS. This subcomponent will also include changes for the management of
new or revised safety requirements from regulations or otherwise, such as the introduction of minimum
standards for safety. In addition, this subcomponent includes safety data and analyses, delivered to and
used by management for safety-related decision-making.
All documents included, attached, or referenced, describing the programs, policies, and procedures used
to implement this PTASP, will be maintained for a minimum of three years. All documents will be made
available to the FTA, federal entities, or the SSOA upon request.

1.5 Continuous Improvement

16.D.b

1.7.1

System Security Plan

The security program for RTD is described in the SSP, which is reviewed and graded in person by the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), on an annual basis.
The SSP is also reviewed and incorporated into a triennial agencywide “Base Assessment,” which includes
a physical inspection of random locations throughout the district. The Base Assessment ultimately results
in a scoring of the RTD security model, which is sent to TSA headquarters in Washington, D.C. The SSP is
considered sensitive security information (SSI) per 49 CFR Parts 15 and 1520, with distribution controlled
to only those with a need to know. The SSP complies with DHS guidance, including the National Response
Framework, National Incident Management System (NIMS), and National Preparedness Goal. For response
to terrorism or natural disaster incidents, the EMP is based on partnerships with the Urban Area Security
Initiative working group, and first-responder organizations of cities and counties throughout RTD’s
service area.
For traditional security functions as well as terrorism prevention, RTD’s plans are based upon a formally
adopted policy of awareness, observation, and reporting by all employees, especially frontline personnel,
combined with effective responses by both Security Operations Command and first-responder law
enforcement and emergency management organizations. Customers are also asked to report suspicious
behaviors or packages to employees, by contacting the Security Command Center, via the RTD Transit
Watch App for mobile phones, or by calling 911 in the event of an incident. RTD’s Transit Police Division
works in partnership with police and sheriff ’s departments and federal partners throughout RTD’s service
area, for high responsiveness to calls for police assistance on the transit system, for application of the
Code of Conduct throughout the service area, and for effective criminal investigations and prosecutions.
In support of security awareness and reporting by transit system employees, RTD design criteria for new
service projects applies Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design principles and provides closedcircuit television and other equipment across the system to enhance security.

1.7.2

Emergency Management

The ability to respond quickly and in an organized manner is vital to the continuation of transit service
during a special event or emergency, or recovery from a catastrophic incident, including but not limited to
the following:
●

Earthquake

●

Fire

●

Flooding

●

Hazardous material spill

●

Medical emergency

●

Severe weather

●

Pandemic

●

Transit-related accidents

●

Acts of violence

●

1.7 Integration with Public Safety and
Emergency Management

Each mode within RTD (light rail, commuter rail, fixed-route and on-demand bus) is required to develop
and update its specific emergency response plan. These plans detail activities and responsibilities for RTD
personnel. This plan, along with the safety program documents and SSP, describes coordination of the
following emergency preparedness/management activities:
●

Incident management – management of an emergency event or incident is based on the principles
of National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the Incident Command System (ICS). NIMS
principles allow emergency response agencies to communicate with field supervisors and/or the
Security Command Center (SCC).

●

Coordination with external agencies – the Chief of Police and Emergency Management is
principally responsible for the coordination of incident management resources with various
emergency service agencies to provide for effective interaction between RTD and those agencies.
Liaising with law enforcement agencies is primarily the responsibility of the CSO, with assistance
from the Chief of Police and Emergency Management.

●

Emergency response planning and mitigation – RTD establishes a FLSC for each new rail
extension or significant transit facility project. The committee comprises safety and security staff;
RTD operations, maintenance, and engineering representatives; and police, fire, emergency
medical, and other area emergency response agency representatives. The committee reviews
transit system designs and recommends fire protection, life safety and security measures, and
procedural response and training needs related to the new extension or facility project.

●

Emergency planning – As a critical transportation provider in the Denver metropolitan area, RTD is
a member of the Regional Emergency Management and the Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)
and Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI). It is RTD’s intent to develop a task force with regional
emergency management agencies responsible for emergency preparedness, response, recovery,
and mitigation planning and coordination among the counties and cities in the metropolitan area,
emergency response agencies, utility companies, and other critical groups. RTD, with assistance
from the FLSC, has developed emergency management operating plans and procedures to
address a wide range of emergency incidents and events, including criminal activity, earthquakes,
fire at transit stations and along the rights-of-way, hazardous materials releases, medical
emergencies, severe weather, terrorism, transportation mishaps, and other emergency situations
occurring within the transit system.

●

Emergency preparedness exercises – A minimum of one emergency tabletop or field exercise is
planned and conducted annually to ensure the adequacy of emergency plans and procedures.
These may include readiness of RTD personnel to perform under emergency conditions; effective
coordination between RTD and emergency response agencies; and coordination of regional
emergency exercises that are facilitated through use of Tera software or other means. All exercises
are followed by after-action analyses and reports to document lessons learned and actions needed
to improve RTD’s emergency operations capabilities.

●

Emergency response training – All frontline RTD transportation and maintenance personnel
will undergo emergency response training to ensure full understanding of their role and
responsibilities during an emergency incident. The level of training will be based on their
anticipated role during the incident. At a minimum, training is provided on the emergency plans
and procedures that the employee may be required to implement. Training to familiarize fire,
rescue, and other emergency service personnel with special transit system requirements is
coordinated through the FLSC and Safety and Transit Security Division staff, with assistance from
the Bus and Rail Divisions, as appropriate.

2.1.1.2

Local Hazard Logs

Local site senior managers, managers, and supervisors, along with Transit Safety Specialists (TSSs),
ensure that local hazard logs are used to track hazards at the departmental level within RTD. These
logs are to be maintained within the department and are reviewed by the local safety committee on a
monthly basis. Hazards placed on the local log receive their initial and final hazard ratings using the Risk
Assessment Matrix. These individuals may give hazards their initial rating when hazards are received
and final ratings when they are closed. This same group may also present hazards to the local safety
committee for hazard ratings or employ the Safety Division for assistance in rating hazards. Hazard ratings
may be changed with new information or as a result of data analysis.

2.1.1.3

Hazard Management

When a hazard is identified as needing mitigation that requires cost or changes beyond that of the local
safety committee or department abilities, the hazard will be elevated to the corresponding Safety Division
Hazard Logs and be reviewed by the System Safety Working Group (SSWG). The SSWG represents key
department managers that have the ability to make decisions and will employ multiple disciplines at RTD
and have access to higher level budgeted solutions.

2.1.1.4

Safety Division Hazard Logs

TSSs are responsible for the maintenance of Safety Division hazard logs. They ensure that hazards
meeting defined criteria are entered into the appropriate category within the hazard reporting system for
accurate record keeping. Hazard rating should be developed with input from the Safety Division, local site
senior managers, managers, and supervisors. The following are specific hazards that are identified and
mitigated at the agency level:
●

Unacceptable hazards (high hazards)

●

Hazards identified from reviews from outside agencies (CPUC, FTA, FRA, OSHA)

●

Hazards identified from accident investigations

●

Hazards where corrective action will cost more than an estimate of $25,000

●

Serious or high hazards on local department hazard log over 45 days

●

When warranted by the Safety Division

2.1.1.5

Corrective Action Plan (CAP)

CAPs are used within RTD for hazards that meet certain criteria. The following hazards require the usage of
a corrective action plan:
●

Hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, or 1C (high hazards)

●

Findings from regulatory agencies resulting in non-conformance (CPUC, FTA, FRA, OSHA)

●

Corrective action resulting from accident investigations

●

When warranted by the Safety Division

22

Packet Pg. 98

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2023_v5_sml (4694 : 2023 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

16.D.b

In the following instances, CAPs must receive prior approval by the State Safety Oversight Agency (SSOA)
before corrective action plans may be carried out:
●

Unacceptable hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, or 1C (high hazards)

●

Findings from regulatory agencies resulting in non-conformance (CPUC, FTA)

●

Accident investigations requiring corrective action

Testing or reviews of industrial hygiene that potentially exceed Permissible Exposure Limits For hazards
that do not meet the Unacceptable Risk Assessment Codes of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, or 1C (High Hazards), SSOA
staff will review and preliminarily approve the CAP before safety risk mitigation activities are implemented.
If an emergency corrective action must be taken immediately to ensure safety, the SSOA must be notified
of the issue immediately, and RTD must follow up with the SSOA for subsequent review and approval of the
corrective action within five business days.
The SSOA will review and provide final approval of all CAPs on a quarterly basis.
CAPs are assigned a specific tracking number by the Electronic Hazard Reporting System and are linked
with their associated hazard. CAPs must contain at a minimum:
●

A person of responsibility for the corrective action

●

A proposed completion date

●

Plan approval when applicable

2.1.1.6

Corrective Action Plan/Preventative Action Plan Development

CAPs are developed by department managers/designee in conjunction with the Safety Division. TSSs will
ensure that the CAP process is followed and properly tracked until it is closed.

2.1.2

Hazard Process Overview

RTD’s hazard process includes all facilities, light rail, and bus systems. The hazard management flowchart
lays out an overall description of how hazards are identified, evaluated, analyzed, controlled or eliminated,
tracked, and reported to RTD leadership and CPUC State Safety Oversight.
●

TSSs assigned to light rail, bus, and capital projects are the primary points of contact for the hazard
management process

●

Safety committee members for rail and bus will be able to identify, evaluate, and analyze hazards

●

The TSSs will enter identified hazards into the electronic hazard reporting system

●

The TSS and/or committee will develop a CAP for each unacceptable and undesirable hazard
entry, identify a point of contact or owner of the hazard, and place this information within the
hazard reporting system for tracking purposes

●

CAPs may also be identified as a result of an incident and investigation

●

Safety committee members also participate in the evaluation and control or elimination of the hazard

16.D.b

●

Hazards must be mitigated at the lowest level possible. However, when a hazard is identified as
having a mitigation that involves multiple departments or requires cost or changes beyond the
safety committee or department abilities or budgets, the hazard are elevated to the SSWG. The
SSWG will represent key department managers, have the capability to employ multiple disciplines,
and have access to higher level budgeted solutions.

●

Recommendations/results from contractor or internal review, testing, or industrial or environmental
sampling results requiring corrective actions will be placed in the hazard log for follow up and
possible need for retesting for compliance with Safety or Environmental requirements. If mitigation
or control of a hazard is not achieved through the SSWG, the hazard mitigation process may be
elevated to the CSO and/or the GM/CEO.

2.1.2.1

Hazard Identification

Identifying hazards is the responsibility of all employees and contractors. The continuous identification,
monitoring, and elimination of hazards is key to an effective safety program.
Hazard identification methods include, but are not limited to, the following:
●

Observation, inspection, and interaction with all employees and contractors

●

Review of reports from safety committee members, customers, and customer service and field personnel

●

Evaluation of accidents, incidents, and near misses, to include data trends and projections

●

Conducting Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) of a design or new construction

●

Conducting safety certification, system integration testing, pre-revenue testing, system
modification, configuration management verification, and inspection processes

●

Conducting Operation Hazard Analysis (OHA) of revenue operations

●

Review of internal and external safety reviews, inspections, observations, defects, findings,
observations, violations, and reviews

●

Review of controller logs, daily operating clearances/bulletins, and training feedback

●

“Lesson learned” inputs

●

Review of applicable regulatory codes and standards

●

Review of NTSB, FRA, FTA, OSHA, safety recommendations, guidance, initiatives, and alerts

●

Review of Nonconformance Reports, Corrective Action Reports

●

Review of data and information provided by the SSOA

The Hazard Management Flow Chart (in the attached document as Exhibit E.6) will be followed by
employees in identifying and correcting hazards at the employee/supervisor level. Actions will be taken to
move the hazard to the safety committee and beyond if necessary.

2.1.3

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2023_v5_sml (4694 : 2023 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

16.D.b

Hazard Investigation, Evaluation, and Analysis

RTD is currently in the process of developing and refining a database where incidents and observed
hazards can be tracked and analyzed for leading indicators of potential hazards. This will allow
management to be proactive in correcting hazards.

24

Packet Pg. 100

Safety concerns are identified and corrected at the lowest level (employee/department) as soon as
practicable. Safety concerns that are not eliminated at this level are reported to a supervisor or a TSS.
Reported concerns will be assessed by a TSS and/or safety committee to determine if a safety hazard
exists and assign an initial hazard rating. Hazards will be evaluated and risks will be ranked to ensure
prioritization for elimination or control as described in the ORM framework.

2.1.3.1

Root Cause Analysis and Accident Evaluation

Hazards are investigated following the Event Notification, Reporting and Investigation policy and
procedure. Hazards originating from accidents are reviewed by TSSs, Managers and Supervisors, and
respective safety committees. A third-party expert may assist with an investigation if deemed necessary.
The level of investigation and the methodology used will be determined based upon risk assessments.
HIGH risk hazards (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B) that receive an unacceptable initial hazard analysis made by
management, a safety committee, or a TSS receive immediate attention/control. A high hazard rating
requires corrective action. Hazards that receive a high hazard rating will be elevated from the local hazard
log to the electronic hazard reporting system.
SERIOUS hazards (1C, 2C, 3A, 3B) that are undesirable may require corrective action and decisions by
management. Hazards that receive a serious hazard rating will remain on the local hazard logs no more
than 45 days before being moved to the appropriate Safety Division log.
MEDIUM (1D, 1E, 2D, 3C, 3E, 4A, 4B) hazards may be acceptable with review and documentation by
management.
MODERATE (2E, 3D, 4C, 5B) hazards are acceptable with review.
LOW (3E, 4D, 4E, 5C, 5D, 5E) hazards do not require review and are acceptable.

2.1.3.2 Hazard Reporting Threshold to Colorado Public Utilities Commission
RTD will notify CPUC of all identified hazards in the light rail system during monthly/quarterly reporting.
RTD will notify CPUC in a timely manner of all hazardous conditions that affect the immediate safety of the
light rail system. At a minimum, RTD notifies CPUC not later than 24 hours from time of discovery or the
determination of the risk assessment code, according to the notification procedures in the CPUC standard,

2.1.3.3 Operational Risk Management Matrix
Assessing risk is the process of determining the severity of risk and the probability of the risk being
realized. In order to ensure that risk assessments are consistent, it is important to use a standard definition.
Severity is a quantitative or subjective measure of the worst credible mishap resulting from personnel
error, environmental conditions, design inadequacies and/or procedural efficiencies for system,
subsystem or component failure or malfunction. Severity is categorized as Catastrophic, Severe, Serious,
Limited, or Negligible.
Probability is defined as the likelihood of the number of times that a specific event will occur during
the planned life expectancy of a system. A risk probability may be derived from the analysis of a transit
system’s operating experience, evaluation of RTD safety historical data, or the analysis of reliability and
failure data. Probability is categorized as Frequent, Probable, Remote, Improbable or Highly Improbable.

The required resolution action is based on the determined risk level.
Risks that have been evaluated and ranked will be mitigated at the lowest feasible level. Mitigation actions
that exceed funding levels authorized at each level will be elevated to the next higher level for action.

2.1.4

Hazard Control, Elimination, and Tracking

Safety critical hazards that have been identified must be controlled or eliminated so that the hazard
does not continue to pose a danger. This may be done in a temporary manner as long as the hazard is
controlled. The process of controlling, tracking, and eliminating hazards is recorded on the hazard log,
which is generated from the electronic hazard reporting system. The portions of the hazard log applicable
to the light rail system are discussed with the CPUC on a monthly basis.
Depending upon the risk ranking, hazard log entries may require a mitigation plan or CAP, tracking number,
brief description, projected completion date, and an initial hazard/risk rating (IHR/IRR) using the Hazard
Assessment Matrix.
●

CAPs include the following information:

●

Element of activity identified as deficient

●

Planned activities to resolve deficiency

●

Department responsible for implementing corrective action

●

Scheduled completion date for implementation

27

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2023_v5_sml (4694 : 2023 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

16.D.b

Packet Pg. 103

Hazard log entries with their associated CAP are reviewed regularly by the Safety Division, safety
committees, and CPUC-SSO. They are periodically reviewed by senior management. CAPs may be tracked
and sorted from the hazard log. When a CAP is closed, the hazard log will reflect this action and a
closed date.
Individual CAP files are stored by hazard tracking number.

2.1.4.1

Hazard Resolution and Elimination

Hazard resolution is defined as the analysis and subsequent actions taken to reduce the risk associated
with an identified hazard to the lowest level practicable. Hazard resolution is not synonymous with hazard
elimination. In a transit environment, some hazards are impossible to eliminate, and others are highly
impractical to eliminate. Reduction of risk to the lowest practical level can be accomplished in a variety of
ways, from protective and warning devices to special procedures. The hierarchy of controls will be followed
to achieve a tolerable risk level, as described below.
1.

Design out or design to minimize hazard severity. To the extent permitted by cost and
practicality, identified hazards will be eliminated or controlled by the design of equipment,
systems, and facilities.

2. Hazards that cannot reasonably be eliminated or controlled through design will be controlled
to the extent practicable to an acceptable level through the use of fixed, automatic, or other
protective safety design features or devices. Provisions will be made for periodic functional checks
of safety devices and training for employees to ensure that system safety objectives are met.
3.

When design and safety devices can neither reasonably nor effectively eliminate or control an
identified hazard, safety warning devices will be used to the extent practicable to alert persons to
the hazards.

4.

Where it is impossible to reasonably eliminate or adequately control a hazard through design or
the use of safety warning devices, procedures and training will be used to control the hazard.

2.1.5

Hazard Tracking

Each CAP developed for hazards or findings from investigations or deficiencies will be submitted to CPUC
for review and approval. The CAP form is automatically assigned a tracking number and placed on the
hazard log with its identified hazard. Upon completion of the corrective action, the Safety Division will
submit to CPUC as required. The completed CAP is formally adopted by receiving CPUC-SSO’s signature.
The hazard log will then be updated to show the status of the identified hazard with its CAP as “CLOSED.”
RTD will monitor all CAPs with the use of the Hazard Log and will provide CPUC with an updated hazard
log quarterly.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2023_v5_sml (4694 : 2023 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

16.D.b

Internally, the Safety Division will coordinate with the appropriate department to develop a mitigation plan
and fill out the appropriate form for the identified hazard. The form will be assigned a tracking number by
the electronic hazard reporting system and placed on the hazard log with the corresponding hazards for
tracking purposes.

28

Packet Pg. 104

2.1.6

Ongoing Reporting to State Safety Oversight Agency

A TSS will review the current status and identify any issues with the resolution action and dates. The
portions of the hazard log applicable to the light rail system, at a minimum, is provided to the SSOA monthly.
All hazards identified and rated as unacceptable hazardous conditions will be separately tracked and
reported to CPUC with a determination of an unacceptable hazardous condition, along with the CAPs for
each unacceptable hazardous condition found.
The CPUC notifies RTD in writing of its acceptance or rejection of the CAP and in accordance with
procedures specified in the CPUC-SSO standard. The CAP form requires a CPUC-SSO electronic or wet
signature approval, indicating the assigned resolution and completion of the CAP. The CAP is maintained
in the Laserfiche hazard reporting system files and is identified by a specific hazard log identifier tracking
number. After a hazard has been resolved, it will be assigned its final hazard rating.

2.1.7

Pre-Job Safety Briefings

Employees who perform infrequent tasks (less than once every three months) or high-risk job tasks
(working at heights, energy isolation, confined space, hoisting and rigging, etc.) are required to discuss job
tasks and identified hazards that are associated with those tasks or job steps during pre-job briefings.

16.D.b

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) operates over an eight-county district along Colorado’s Front
Range area. These activities have the potential to affect local waterways, soil, air, wildlife, vegetation,
and human health. RTD’s Safety and Environmental Division strives to exceed all state, federal, and local
municipality regulatory requirements to limit the District’s impact to the local environment. The following
management procedures are in place to ensure this goal is met.

2.2.1

Management of Hazardous Materials

For any hazardous chemical used or stored in the workplace, RTD must submit an annual Tier II chemical
inventory report to their State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning
Committee (LEPC), and local fire department via the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Tier II Submit
software by March 1st of each year. The information is made available to the public under the Emergency
Planning and Community Right to Know Act. Tier II Submit software is updated yearly by the EPA and
completed by the RTD Safety and Environmental Division.
Over 2,000 listed hazardous materials and 600 extremely hazardous chemicals are subject to reporting
under EPA rulemaking. Reporting requirements have been limited by quantity.
Common hazardous materials used by RTD that are subject to reporting:
●

Diesel fuel

●

Gasoline

●

New and used oil

●

Antifreeze (ethylene glycol)

●

Lead acid batteries (sulfuric acid)

RTD uses many hazardous chemicals contained in soaps, solvents, brake cleaners, paints, and aerosols.
These materials are described in the product specific Safety Data Sheet (SDS) forms.
Secondary containment, oil water separators, illicit discharge monitoring, stormwater best management
practices, and leak detection systems are utilized to help identify and remediate spills.

2.2.2

New Chemical Product Approval Program

A new product approval process is in place at RTD to ensure that all materials arriving on-site have been
approved by the Safety and Environmental Division for use. The process starts when the division or group
that is requesting a new product contacts RTD’s Safety and Environmental Division by email with a copy of
the SDS and a completed Product Approval Evaluation Form. If the material is acceptable for use, the SDS
will be placed into RTD’s electronic storage database (Safetec) for employees to view via intercompany
websites (e.g., Trapeze or the Hub). If the requested material is not approved, an alternative product that is
less harmful to human health or the environment may be suggested.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2023_v5_sml (4694 : 2023 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

2.2 Environmental Management and
Hazardous Material Program

All employees and contractors directly responsible for safety as well as each employee who works with
hazardous materials receives training on proper storage/handling of chemical products, appropriate use of
personnel protection equipment, compliant disposal of unused materials, and how to locate SDSs.

30

Packet Pg. 106

2.2.3

Management of Hazardous Waste

RTD’s District Shops is a small quantity generator (SQG) of hazardous waste. All other facilities are
categorized as very small quantity generators (VSQG) of hazardous waste. Hazardous wastes can be
generated by:
●

Discarding a hazardous material (e.g., oil-based paint, solvents, thinner contaminated rags)

●

Using a product (e.g., batteries, fluorescent lamps, HID lamps, electronic waste, aerosol dregs)

The Environmental Protection Agency and Colorado Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division
regulate the generation of hazardous wastes.
Hazardous wastes are to be stored in closed containers and accumulated in satellite accumulation areas or
the Central Accumulation Storage Building at District Shops. Waste containers are labeled and located near
where the waste is generated. The Safety and Environmental Division is responsible for properly identifying
hazardous waste, labeling waste containers, performing internal inspections, inventorying monthly
generation amounts, mitigating spills, training employees, preparing off-site shipments for disposal,
recordkeeping, and collaborating with regulatory agencies during audits.
RTD personnel that add or remove hazardous waste from containers are required to receive compliance
training that is equivalent to their job duties and measured through routine performance-based internal
inspections. RTD Safety and Environmental personnel that arrange hazardous waste shipments are
required to receive training in EPA’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) site compliance and
maintain Department of Transportation (DOT) ground shipper certifications before having authorization
to sign uniform hazardous waste shipping manifests. Electronic manifests, individual site information,
and notifications are stored electronically on the EPA information system RCRAInfo. RTD Safety and
Environmental personnel have access to the RCRAInfo database and use this tool to submit and view
required compliance documentation to the Colorado Hazardous Materials and Waste Management
Division.

2.2.4

Underground and Aboveground Storage Tank Management

RTD is the owner of 32 regulated storage tanks throughout the District ranging from 1,000 to 48,000
gallons of diesel, gasoline, anti-freeze, and lube oil. Storage tank systems are regulated by the Colorado
Division of Oil and Public Safety (OPS). Common components of tank systems include underground piping,
secondary containment, leak detection systems, overfill protection equipment, and automatic tank gauging.
These components are monitored daily for functionality, regulatory compliance, product inventory, and
release detection. RTD Safety and Environmental collaborates with the RTD Capital Programs Division to
arrange OPS required compliance testing, inspections, and certifications for tank systems.
Spill Prevention Control and Counter Measure Plans (SPCC) that are certified by a licensed Professional
Engineer (PE) are in place at RTD facilities that store over 42,000 gallons of petroleum products in
underground storage tanks (UST).
Each of the six RTD facilities that currently use underground storage tanks to fuel vehicles has an onsite
designated B-operator (Facilities Maintenance Supervisor) that oversee day to day operations and
maintenance, an A-operator (Manager, Facilities Maintenance Operating Facilities) that direct B-operators
in their work, and a listed Facility Contact (Manager, Environmental Compliance) that collects required
compliance documentation and is the liaison between RTD and OPS for audits, site characterization

31

reporting, and general inquiries at all six facilities. All three of these positions require OPS approved A/Boperator training through an approved training provider.
RTD Safety and Environmental personnel are required to download and store compliance documentation
from the InSite360 Veeder-Root remote monitoring system at a minimum of every 30 calendar days.
Abnormalities in the tank system are reported to the local B-operator and RTD tank compliance contractor
for resolution. Compliance reports that are run include tank tightness testing, liquid sensor reports, and
alarm history.

2.2.5

Stormwater Management

To comply with the provisions of the Colorado Water Quality Control Division (WQCD), RTD has historically
held a number of stormwater discharge permits for operating maintenance divisions, rail corridors, stations,
construction activities, and the Tunnel 16 Groundwater Treatment Facility (GWTF). These permits authorize
the discharge of stormwater from these locations to the local waterways provided that RTD and its
contractors follow the requirements listed on each set of Colorado Discharge Permit System (CDPS) issued
documents. Common CDPS requirements include:
●

Illicit discharge detection and elimination procedures are in place

●

Construction site runoff controls are in place before and after project completion

●

Good housekeeping activities are continually practiced, monitored, and improved if needed

●

Internal training is conducted annually to help employees recognize and report illicit discharges

●

Proper storage and containment systems are in place for hazardous materials

●

Conducting internal inspections and collaborating with facility personnel to correct findings

●

Numeric or practiced-based effluent limitations are being met

●

Annual reporting is completed accurately and submitted to WQCD

●

Monthly submissions of Discharge Monitoring Reports through EPA’s NetDMR System

CDPS issued permits historically held by RTD:
●

COR900000 Light Industrial Activity (operating facilities)

●

COR070000 Non-Standard Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (rail corridors/stations)

●

COG318000 Discharge from Long-term Remediation Activities (Tunnel 16 GWTP)

●

COR400000 Stormwater discharges associated with construction activities (East Metro UST
replacement)

2.2.6

Stationary Source Air Emission Management

RTD operating maintenance divisions that use boilers, paint booths, outdoor fueling stations, and parts
washing units that exceed CDPHE established thresholds are regulated by the Colorado Air Pollution
Control Division (APCD). The Safety and Environmental Division is responsible for gathering fuel, natural
gas, and paint consumption throughput from these sources and must be prepared to submit inventoried
data to APCD upon request. Air Pollution Emission Notifications (APENs) must be submitted prior to
operating systems that exceed APCD thresholds and renewed every five years or before that time if
significant alterations have or will occur.

The Platte and East Metro bus maintenance facilities have large boilers that must be managed to follow
specific permit requirements, including:
●

Adhering to emission limitations set forth in the individual permits

●

Not allowing visible emissions to exceed 20% opacity during normal operation

●

Suppling diesel fuel to the boilers that contain less than 0.5% sulfur by weight

●

Ensuring the units are maintained in a manner to follow the manufacturer’s operating recommendations

2.2.7

Industrial Hygiene

RTD is in a continual cycle of renovation, repair, construction, and demolition of current facilities. Safety and
environmental considerations for these projects include:
●

Identification abatement of asbestos and lead paint in building materials that are to be disturbed

●

Proper identification, monitoring, and disposal of contaminated groundwater and soils

●

Removal of hazardous wastes that a previous facility owner may have left behind

RTD Safety and Environmental uses a third-party environmental consulting firm in most cases to identify,
mitigate, and prepare required reports for these activities. These environmental consulting services can
often be very expensive and time consuming. Identifying and addressing the need of these environmental
services at the inception of new projects is helpful in avoiding project delays, cost increases, and noncompliance issues with regulatory agencies.
RTD facilities and properties may encounter industrial hygiene (IH) issues throughout their life span that include:
●

Mold evaluations

●

Presence of air contaminants

●

Environmental site assessments

●

Site characterization reports

●

Visual emission opacity readings

Facilities throughout the District require routine IH evaluations that include:
●

Laboratory testing of 27 individual oil water separators at six different facilities

●

Preparation of monthly discharge monitoring reports (Tunnel 16 GWTF)

●

Groundwater sampling and annual reporting to OPS for the Platte Bus Maintenance Facility

2.2.8

Emergency Spill and Biological Waste Response

RTD serves an eight-county District of over 3 million people and uses a large amount of petroleum and
chemical products on a day-to-day basis. RTD frequently has a need for additional spill and biological
response assistance due to accidents, incidents, and crime.
●

RTDuses multiple emergency spill and biological cleanup contractors for situations that involve:

●

Chemical releases that are beyond the capabilities of RTD staff and resources

●

Spills that reach storm water drains or local waterways

●

Mold and asbestos remediation

These contracted service providers are approved and funded through the RTD Safety and Environmental
Division. On-track Safety Training is provided to contractors via the Litmos learning system.
The Safety and Environmental Division is responsible for reporting spills that exceed state and federal
established thresholds to the appropriate regulatory agency.

2.2.9

Management of Petroleum Contaminated Debris

Due to the large amount of petroleum contaminated rags, wipes, pads, and absorbents that RTD
historically generates at local maintenance facilities, it has been a long-standing best management
practice to separate most of this material from normally occurring trash throughout the facilities. Operating
facilities are equipped with specialized containers (mini-boxes) that are lined with thick cubic-yard-size
polyurethane tote bags that are manifested, sealed, and picked out of the mini-boxes by boom trucks
and takin separately offsite to avoid comingling with normal outgoing refuse. The contents of the miniboxes are profiled through a vendor-supplied customer database that also stores shipment details. The
debris is verified to be non-RCRA hazardous waste through periodic sampling and analytical lab reporting
through which the RTD Safety and Environmental Division contracts. Pickup requests are called in by local
Storeroom Supervisors or RTD Safety and Environmental personnel.

ASSURANCE

The third element of the PTASP is Safety Assurance, which describes how RTD will measure and review
its processes to ensure it remains in compliance with established standards. These processes, safety
performance targets, and reports provide assurance to RTD leadership that the organization and system
are functioning at an acceptable level of safety. The reviews, inspections, rules checks, and compliance
verification procedures are described, required schedules set, and acceptable measures established.

3.1 Internal Safety Review Process
Internal safety reviews (ISR) and inspections are critical components of an integrated system safety
program. As such, internal safety reviews are conducted semiannually to assure compliance with the
SMS and that the plan is effectively implemented. Facilities are inspected monthly for occupational safety
issues and local fire codes. Written reports of each review are prepared and distributed once the ISR is
completed. Senior leaders will discuss safety reviews, evaluate the effectiveness of the SMS, recommend
corrective action if necessary, and ensure timely implementation and follow up. An internal light rail audit
review report is compiled each year in January and submitted to the CPUC by February 15. The report
documents the review findings for the year, including the results of internal reviews performed during
the previous year; a summary of required corrective actions taken, if any; and provision for follow up to
ensure timely implementation and to determine effectiveness of the SMS. The annual audit report will be
accompanied by a formal letter of certification signed by the GM/CEO indicating that RTD is in compliance
with its SMS. If RTD identifies areas of deficiency, the GM/CEO will identify the activities RTD will take to
achieve compliance. Documentation of inspection and reviews are maintained.
As part of the ISR program, all departments are subject to review. The Senior Manager of Safety is
responsible for and has complete authority to conduct IRSs. Two reviews are conducted each year, one
in the summer and one in the winter. Within a three-year period, all PTASP elements are reviewed for
compliance with the plan and SSO requirements. The sixth review cycle, which is in the last quarter of the
third year, is reserved to review and revise the audit process to assure that all elements are completed and
that the program meets SSO requirements.
RTD will notify the CPUC of an upcoming review cycle at least 30 days prior to the start of the safety review.
An opening conference may be scheduled with the departments subject to safety review. At the opening
conference, checklists are distributed, discussed, and reviewed for accuracy, and a schedule is set.
The actual ISR consists of interviews with key personnel, documentation review, and observation of
activities to assess compliance and understanding of rules, training, and procedures. After completion
of the onsite activities, the checklists are completed, and a written draft report is developed. The draft
report may include recommendations or findings. Recommendations are defined as suggestions to
make improvements, while findings are defined as documented deficiencies in the implementation of
established programs, rules, or procedures. The draft report is distributed for review and comment to
the affected parties. A final report is completed and distributed to all parties. Recorded findings require
the development of a CAP. The annual ISR report prepared and submitted to the CPUC will include an
evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the SMS.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2023_v5_sml (4694 : 2023 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

3.

Recommendations from previous review cycles will be reviewed and evaluated in subsequent cycles.
Findings will be tracked under the CAP process of placing all findings on a tracking spreadsheet, and the
subsequent quarterly corrective action plan progress reports will be filed with the CPUC.
RTD has 30 days to respond to the draft report, including an opportunity to correct any findings.

Collect, Analyze, and Report Safety Management System Data, and
Maintain Records

SMS data is collected through a variety of sources including near miss information, accident investigation
reports, ISRs, safety committee meetings, occupational injury reports, incident reports, use of an accident
matrix, system monitoring including testing and inspection records, and the hazard management program.
This safety data will be analyzed and used for development of Key Safety Performance Indicators and
Targets. RTD reports the following to National Transit Database (NTD):
●

Fatalities – total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

Injuries – total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

Safety events – total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

System reliability – mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode

These safety performance measures are used to select improvement targets for these four measures
and for each mode of transit, in order to encourage improvements and monitor the safety performance
of delivering transit services. In addition, RTD selects additional performance measures and targets, both
leading and lagging, to ensure continual improvement of the SMS. RTD communicates safety performance
information throughout the agency using various methods of communication, including electronic message
boards, committee meetings, newsletters, and team/crew meetings to keep employees informed of SMS
initiatives, risks and performance.
RTD will make its safety performance measures improvement targets available to applicable state agencies
(e.g., CDOT) and metropolitan planning organizations (currently DRCOG), together, “external entities”; and,
to the maximum extent practicable, will coordinate with the external entities in the selection of external
entity safety performance targets.
The safety data collected will be analyzed for potential safety impacts. Identified areas of concern are
reported to appropriate personnel in the form of specific project reports and memos. Records of system
safety data are maintained in the office of the Safety Division for a minimum of three years. Certain
information, such as safety certification backup documentation, is maintained by RTD’s document control
process managed by the Capital Programs Department. In addition to safety, the Safety Division maintains
data and documentation of activities required by the SMS.

3.1.4

System Modifications or Major Repairs

New fixed facility equipment modifications and retrofits are reviewed and approved by the RTD
engineering group and the technical support staff. Review may also take place by the RTD Infrastructure
Change Review Committee. Non-infrastructure changes will follow the non-infrastructure change process.

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are included in the risk management program
process as described in section 3. This process is facilitated by the Safety Division and performed jointly
by the Capital Programs, Bus Operations, Rail Operations, and Safety divisions. New equipment, system
expansions, and modifications are ultimately reviewed, approved, and documented.

42

Packet Pg. 118

3.1.5.1

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification Review

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are reviewed and approved by the Capital
Programs Department and Bus Operations, Rail Operations, and Safety divisions. This review is conducted
to assure that new equipment, expansions, and modifications safely and operationally integrate into the
existing system.

3.1.5.2 New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification Acceptance
Operational readiness of new equipment and system expansions is verified through the equipment
acceptance and safety and security certification process. The Bus Operations and Rail Operations divisions
perform rigorous equipment and integration testing as part of the vehicle and equipment acceptance
process. Once complete, new vehicles and equipment are formally accepted by the Bus Operations and
Rail Operations divisions. This information is presented and approved by the Safety Certification Program
and described in section 3. The Safety and Security Certification Program provides an identification,
design, review, and verification process for system expansions and modifications. Certification process
completion is verified by sign-off from the CSO.

3.1.5.3 Exceptions to Established Design Criteria
RTD has a process to request variances to design criteria. All variances go through three levels of review.
Level 4 and above exceptions to design criteria are approved only by the acceptance of the CSO and the
GM/CEO. If appropriate, the design criteria may be amended or modified to accommodate acceptable
modifications. The AGM of Capital Programs is responsible for the maintenance and distribution of
the design criteria. The design criteria will be reviewed prior to new corridor construction and vehicle
acquisitions.

3.1.5.4 Procurement Procedures
Procurement of equipment and materials is controlled by the Procurement Standards Manual. Each
procurement requires the development of detailed specifications assembled by the requesting manager.
Levels of review are built into the procurement process depending upon the scope of the procurement.
As the scope of the procurement increases, so does the level of review. Minor procurements require
authorization from the Materials Management Division and the Division Manager of the requesting division.
Major procurements, such as light rail- or bus construction-related projects or procurement of buses or
light rail vehicles, are subject to the following review process. The Capital Programs Division and technical
support staff develop detailed specifications through the design process. These specifications are subject
to several internal reviews at varying levels of design, peer reviews by personnel from other transit
agencies, and ultimate approval by the GM/CEO. In addition to procurement specifications, the safety and
security certification review process described in Section 3 governs light rail construction.

Management of Change (MOC)/Configuration Control of Infrastructure within RTD will be managed through
the Infrastructure Change Review (ICR) process, which is managed by the Capital Programs Department.
The MOC process is managed by the CSO and the Chief Engineer. MOC/Configuration Management within
RTD consists of the ICR process during design and construction, and the MOC process during operations.
The ICR process coordinates physical changes, before they are implemented in the existing operating
environment. Formal Project Management Plans are prepared for large projects.
Representatives from each involved department and safety are represented in the ICR and MOC processes.
When changes are made to existing structures or facilities, it is critical that affected personnel, the public,
or other groups be notified of changes that might have potential safety or security impacts. Affected
personnel are invited to participate in project meetings and coordinate any changes. Additional training
may be required. Operations and maintenance procedures, bulletins, or SOPs may need to be developed.
Communications Department personnel assist with communications to outside agencies or affected group.
An essential element of communications must take place after the project is completed. Any observed
negative or hazardous impacts of physical changes must be reported to the Chief Engineer, or CSO, as soon
as possible, so that hazards may be assessed and included in the hazard resolution process.

3.2.1

Safety and Security Certification

System safety personnel develop and implement safety and security certification programs to assure that
safety and security concerns and hazards are addressed prior to the initiation of rail passenger operations
for new corridors, system extensions, rehabilitation, or modification or replacement of equipment. RTD uses
the FTA Handbook for Transit Safety and Security Certification to develop the requirements for each safety
and security certification program. An individual safety and security certification plan is developed for
each new corridor. For minor extensions or projects, safety and security certification is addressed through
the preparation of safety and security certification forms applicable to the scope of work. If equipment is
procured as part of a new maintenance facility, it is included in the certification program for the facility. Rail
vehicles undergo a formalized acceptance program under the supervision of Rail Operations.
The safety and security certification program has the following goals:
●

Verify that acceptable safety and security levels are met or exceeded

●

Document the verification of safety and security standards

●

Provide consistency for project certification

With these goals in mind, the objectives of the program can be more narrowly defined. The program
objectives are to identify and verify:
●

Safety and security requirements of the system design

●

Safety and security requirements for construction and system equipment installation

●

That safety and security requirements are met or exceeded for system testing

●

That safety and security requirements are met for changes or modifications to standard operating
procedures, training manuals, rule book, and system elements

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2023_v5_sml (4694 : 2023 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

3.2 Management of Change

The CSO and the Manager of Safety are responsible for the management of the program.

44

Packet Pg. 120

3.2.2

Quality Assurance

Capital projects have a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) function built into the design and
construction of the project. Specific personnel are responsible for QA/QC activities. In general, QA/QC
activities in large projects follow standard industry practice and are subject to review by the FTA and
others. Quality control during construction projects is a requirement of the contractor and submitted in the
quality plan prior to initiation of construction. RTD retains qualified inspectors and testing firms to provide
quality assurance by document submittal reviews and periodic testing of materials throughout the project.
Received goods are required to be compared to items ordered, lot numbering, or other certifications
as required on safety critical items. Where applicable, receiving personnel assure that lot number
documentation is provided before materials are received or accepted. Periodically, purchasing personnel
or TSSs will randomly sample hardware, slings, lifting devices, and other devices for compliance with
specifications. Items will also be functionally tested periodically to assure they meet standards.

3.3 Rules Compliance
Reports and Data Analysis

The results of various operational tests, including periodic efficiency checks, are compiled, and reviewed
at least quarterly by the General Superintendent of Rail Transportation, or designated manager. A written
form of the review will be retained by Rail Operations and available upon request of the Safety Department
and during Internal Safety Reviews (ISRs). An annual report completed by the Manager, Service Delivery,
summarizing the previous year’s results of the operational tests, including a trend analysis of the available
data. The annual report is retained by Rail Operations and provided during ISRs and on request from the
Safety Division for further review and trend analysis.

3.3.1.1

Enforcement Violations

Rule violations are addressed through the agency’s management process, which includes coaching,
retraining, and formal discipline that may result in termination. Additionally, all accidents and incidents are
reviewed by supervisors and the Safety Division to determine if rules have been violated, or if revisions,
changes, or additions are necessary to the SMS and the PTASP.

3.3.1.2 Risk Management
A TSS may incorporate violation trends or deficiencies for any rule or procedure into the risk management
program for resolution. Risks unresolved by the RSC or the BSC are directed to the SSWG for further
tracking, review, resolution, and/or correction. Noncompliant review findings determined to be hazardous
are documented in the hazard log. A date of observation, description of the hazardous condition, corrective
action required, and implementation date are tracked until the hazardous condition is corrected. (See the Risk
Management Program portion of the PTASP for further information.) The Safety Division conducts ongoing
and regular observations and reviews to determine the effectiveness of the rule compliance program.

3.3.2

SMS Policies, Procedures, and Processes

RTD has adopted policies, procedures, processes, training materials and employee rule books to establish
requirements and expectations for safe operations, maintenance, and construction for the agency. These
are reviewed periodically and updated as necessary according to the following guidelines: prior to revenue
service of a system expansion, new bus route, or new corridor; or as recommended by the ISR process. A
committee consisting of Controller/Supervisors, Operators, and TSSs performs review. Recommended SOP
changes are reviewed and approved by the Chief/AGM of the affected division/department.

Techniques, Schedules, and Procedures

Preventative maintenance (PM) inspection schedules are generated through the computer system per
equipment manufacturer guidelines and recommendations, and as required by local, state, and federal
regulations. A Maintenance Supervisor identifies upcoming PM inspections and assigns the work to their
crew for completion. Inspectors use checklists to identify potential physical hazards, unsafe equipment,
unsafe acts, and policy and procedural deficiencies with the facility or equipment being inspected.
Completed inspection reports and checklists are returned to the supervisor for review. Each department is
responsible for maintaining inspection and repair records to confirm the inspection process.

3.4.2.1 MOW (Line, Signal, and Rail Maintenance) Standards and Procedures
Line and Signal Technicians use a Maintenance of Way plan, “MOW Procedures,” that outlines specific
testing and maintenance procedures modeled after FRA regulations. These are in accordance with 49 CFR
Parts 233-236.

3.4.3

Tracking and Resolving Hazards Identified During Inspections

The majority of safety hazards and concerns are resolved immediately by employees and/or supervisors,
and require no formal tracking process. Safety-critical hazards that cannot receive immediate attention are
forwarded to the appropriate supervisor and will be reported to the Manager of Safety or safety committee.
An observed safety critical hazard that cannot be corrected in a timely manner will be entered into the
hazard log for tracking purposes and managed by the SSWG. A CAP, responsible person, and completion
date will be assigned. Follow-up inspections will verify that the hazard has been resolved.

3.4.4

Railroad Bridge Safety Management Program

The Railroad Bridge Safety Management Program (BSMP) has been developed and implemented to
minimize damages and identify and repair deficiencies in bridges carrying RTD traffic, to safeguard their
ability to carry RTD traffic, and to minimize risk of human casualties.

3.5.1

Maintenance

Maintenance and service of all vehicles, equipment, and facilities is established using manufacturer
manuals, codes, standards, and established procedures as guidelines. Maintenance is performed at a
level of readiness that ensures safe, efficient, and reliable service. RTD maintains data to track scheduled
maintenance of vehicles and equipment.
Safety critical equipment that does not meet established requirements is withdrawn from service.
Vehicles or equipment involved in an accident are removed from service if there is reason to suspect that
equipment failure contributed to the cause of the accident. Vehicles or equipment are returned to service
only after it is determined that no defects could have contributed to the accident. RTD has established
procedures to ensure rapid deployment, recovery, and return to service in the event of an emergency.
Effective maintenance is an indispensable prerequisite to safe and efficient operations. The Bus and Light
Rail divisions have standards that make safety and reliability the primary objectives of the system. These
goals are met through the incorporation of preventive and repair maintenance programs for all aspects of
the system. The Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance Plan addresses incorporates the following principles:
●

Preventive maintenance programs will be cost-effective in minimizing service failures

●

Changes in preventive maintenance programs may be expected periodically as experience is
gained on the equipment maintained

●

Preventive maintenance goals and policies will not be altered due to time constraints or as a costreduction measure in times of financial stress

3.6 Drug and Alcohol Program
Drug and Alcohol Program

RTD maintains an employee drug and alcohol program in compliance with U.S. Department of
Transportation and FTA regulations. The program includes criteria for random testing of safety sensitive
personnel and testing for cause, either accident related or from observed behavior. The Administration
Department manages this program, which is subject to frequent review by the FTA.
Drug and alcohol testing and information about drug and alcohol abuse is included in RTD’s Drug and
Alcohol Policy. Training on this policy is required for each new hire and provided during orientation. The
program is administered by the Drug and Alcohol Program Manager, who verifies compliance with the
program and oversees training. Revisions to the program are distributed to all employees. If necessary,
follow-up training is provided.
Compliance with and knowledge of the program are accomplished through direct supervision of
employees and refresher training if necessary.
GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT
RTD is dedicated to providing safe, dependable, and economical transportation services to the public, and
to providing a healthy, safe, and satisfying work environment for employees. RTD and the Amalgamated
Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001 agree that employees must be able to work in a drug- and alcohol-free
work environment. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect the rights and respect the
privacy of all employees. The employer has the right and duty to protect its employees, customers, and
the public from the adverse effects of drug and alcohol abuse. It is not the intent of the employer to restrict
employees’ on-the-job conduct.
A successful drug and alcohol program must address the safety implications of drug and alcohol abuse
and must also institute proper procedures and controls guaranteeing accurate alcohol and drug testing
results, while preserving confidentiality and focusing on rehabilitation through an effective employee
assistance program.
It is the responsibility of all employees to report to work not under the influence of alcohol or controlled
substances. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect and respect employees’ rights and privacy.
To meet these goals and comply with legal requirements, RTD has implemented this policy to:
●

Detect drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through testing

●

Encourage employees to obtain treatment and rehabilitation for drug and alcohol problems

●

Deter drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through education, training, and discipline

●

Enforce RTD’s goal of a drug- and alcohol-free work environment through appropriate discipline

Drug and alcohol abuse can have profound effects on the health, work, and personal life not only of
the abuser, but also the abuser’s family, friends, and the public at large. Employees should be aware of
the signs and symptoms of drug or alcohol problems, and of available methods of intervening when a
substance abuse problem is suspected.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2023_v5_sml (4694 : 2023 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

3.6.1

This policy was originally adopted by the Board of Directors on Oct. 18, 1994, with subsequent
modifications adopted in September 1998, July 2000, May 2003, July 2011, and March 2013. Many
elements of this policy are required by federal regulations covering persons in safety-sensitive job
classifications. Other elements of this policy are not required by federal regulations but are official policy.

53

Packet Pg. 129

Employees wishing to review federal regulations on drug and alcohol use may contact the Drug and
Alcohol Program Manager.
This policy supersedes all other drug, alcohol, or substance abuse policies. To the extent that any
elements of this policy may conflict with federal or state regulations as they may be amended or revised
in the future, the regulations shall take precedence. Employees are expected to review, be familiar with,
and obey this policy and all laws concerning drug and alcohol use and testing. All existing and new
employees must receive at least 60 minutes of training on the effects and consequences of prohibited
drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment, and the signs and symptoms that may
indicate prohibited drug use.
Compliance with this policy, including participation in RTD’s drug and alcohol testing program, is a required
condition of employment.

3.6.2

Applicability

3.6.2.1 Categories of Employees
This policy applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive employees, volunteers, and contractors
and are referred to in this policy as “employees” unless otherwise noted. This policy applies to all
employees while on RTD property to perform duty or while performing any work-related business. Visitors
and vendors are expected to adhere to this policy while on RTD property.
In addition to being subject to all other elements of this policy, employees who perform “safety sensitive
functions” for RTD, as that term is defined in federal regulations 49 CFR Part 40 as amended and Part
655, are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other special requirements set forth in this
policy. Generally, a safety-sensitive function occurs when an employee is performing, ready to perform, or
immediately available to perform any duty related to the safe operation of public transportation.
The following are safety-sensitive functions:
●

Operation of a revenue service vehicle, whether or not such vehicle is in revenue service

●

Controlling dispatch or movement of a revenue service vehicle

●

Maintaining revenue service vehicles or equipment used in revenue service

●

Operating a non-revenue-service vehicle when required to be operated by a holder of a
Commercial Driver’s License (CDL)

●

Carrying a firearm for security purposes

●

Supervising any function listed in the items above

RTD reviews the actual duties performed by employees in all job classifications to determine which
employees perform safety-sensitive functions and determines which job functions may require the
performance of safety-sensitive duties. An analysis will be performed if any new job classifications are
developed, or current job description changes, to determine if the job should be considered safetysensitive by querying the policy.

57

Packet Pg. 133

4.1.2.3 Bus Safety Committee (BSC)
The BSC coordinates ongoing safety efforts within the transportation, facilities, and maintenance functions
of the Bus Operations Division. The committee meets monthly to update and mitigate hazards within
their facilities and on their systems. Committees are formed for the District Shops, Platte, East Metro, and
Boulder divisions. The BSCs are chaired by the Safety Division’s delegate, usually a TSS. The committees
consist of up to any manager within the division, and one or more employees from the following areas:
Street Operations, Bus Operations, Bus Maintenance, Facilities Maintenance (to include Service and
Cleaning), Health and Wellness, Transit Security, and any other unique area (e.g., Treasury). The ATU 1001
appoints bargaining unit employees to the BSC as needed to serve as safety representatives from the
ranks of each department.
Committee members are granted an opportunity to speak, and to present safety issues to the BSC, through
an open communication process. Minutes are maintained and distributed to the members of the BSC and
the transportation managers, posted to the local safety board in the division, and made available to others.
The BSC minutes contains an open item log listing issues brought forward at BSC meetings, submitted
through the Hazard Management System, and placed in the safety suggestion boxes posted at each
division. The log will include the month/year the item was brought forward to the committee, an initial
hazard rating (Risk Assessment Code), and the estimated month/year the corrective action will be
completed. There also is a log of closed/completed items, as well as informational items for employees.
This log is posted at each division for all employees to view. Most safety issues are resolved within the
parameters of the BSC. Issues not resolved in the BSC, or safety critical hazards, are referred to the SSWG.
BSC actions include the following:
●

Review facility and operations system safety issues identified by members, staff, reviews, or inspections

●

Assign responsibility for correcting hazards

●

Review open items for completion

●

Ensure safety and regulatory rule compliance (FTA, CPUC)

4.1.2.4 Rail Safety Committee (RSC)
The RSC coordinates ongoing safety efforts within the Operations and Maintenance functions of the light
rail system. They meet monthly to update and mitigate hazards in their facilities and on their systems.
A committee is formed for light rail consisting of the Operations Manager, two representatives (one
represented, one non-represented) from Operations, Light Rail Maintenance, Facility Maintenance,
Maintenance of Way, and the TSS-rail, the latter serving as a technical advisor and chair to the committee.
The corresponding maintenance facilities (Elati, Rio Court, and Mariposa) are represented respectively
on their RSC. The ATU appoints bargaining unit employees to the RSC annually to serve as safety
representatives from the ranks of each department, voicing safety concerns to the RSC.
Committee members are granted an opportunity to speak, and to present safety issues to the RSC, through
an open communication process. Minutes of discussion and action are maintained and distributed to the
members of the RSC and are available to others.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2023_v5_sml (4694 : 2023 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

16.D.b

The RSC maintains a local hazard log listing issues, corrective actions, and closeout dates. The hazard log
includes the date entered and the responsible party to correct the action. Most safety issues are resolved
within the parameters of the RSC. Issues not resolved in the RSC, or safety critical hazards, are referred to
the SSWG.
58

Packet Pg. 134

RSC actions are similar to those listed under the BSC above. Additionally, the RSC uses the General Code
of Operating Rules (GCOR), FRA 49 CFR Part 214, 49 CFR Parts 200-399, as a model for and examines for
compliance with FTA 49 CFR Parts 673, 674.

4.1.2.5 Fire and Life Safety Committee (FLSC) (Large Scale Projects Only)
The FLSC serves as a liaison between project safety and local police, fire, and emergency response
agencies. The FLSC is chaired by the System Safety Engineer. Members include local police, fire, and EMS
staff, and supervisors within the Safety, Bus Operations, and Rail Operations divisions.
The FLSC coordinates inspections and drills to verify the fire and life safety and security emergency
response, and familiarization and compliance with the system. Drills are initiated during the activation
phase and continue during revenue operations, per federal requirement, to maintain an effective
interagency rapport.

4.1.2.6 System Safety Working Group (SSWG)
The SSWG comprises subject matter experts from all RTD departments who collaborate to review,
implement, and execute a system process required to complete a project or event that has been identified.
This group reviews systems or issues with the perspective of looking for hazards, identifying risk to:
●

Design or engineer problems out of the system

●

Correct through standard operating procedure

●

Mitigate with personal protective equipment

●

Eliminate the risk/hazard

The SSWG may not change the scope of the project but may make decisions that relate directly to the
remediation of specific hazards. To this end, it is best for the SSWG to be included in the scope phase of
the project plan.
The SSWG defines the job-specific Certified Items List (CIL) and creates and maintains the PHA. If the
SSWG determines that the residual risk of a hazard cannot be reduced below the Medium risk level, then
the SSWG presents its findings to the CSO for final risk analysis.

4.1.2.7 Investigation Team
This team comprises staff from various departments that have a role in the development of a CAP/
preventative action plan or mitigation plans resulting from RTD-involved events, occurrences, accidents, and
incidents. This process will follow the Event Notification, Reporting and Investigation Policy and Procedures.

4.2 Training and Certification Program
Employee Safety Training, Certification, Verification, and Performance Testing

Employees receive formal training and certification for the work they perform according to their job
classification. The categories of safety-related work requiring training and certification are Rail and
Bus Operators and Maintainers. The specific programs are discussed below. However, each training
and certification program contains classroom and hands-on training and written exams. Certification
documentation, including tests and test scores, is maintained in employee files and is subject to review
during the internal safety review program.
Except for the on-track safety training program required of contractors working on or near RTD rail
property, RTD does not train or certify contractors or employees of contractors. The on-track safety training
program is required of contractors prior to issuance of an access permit to work near or on RTD rail
property. The program is usually instructed in a train-the-trainer format allowing contractors to train their
own personnel. Compliance with this program is verified through in-field observation and examination of
contractor training cards. The Safety Division maintains a log of all contractors trained under the program.
Regarding performance testing (to include operational tests and efficiency checks), any operating or
maintenance rule is subject to verification and compliance. Compliance with rules, training, and certification
requirements is verified in several ways. Rail and Bus Operators are frequently observed in the field by
supervisors and Safety Division employees; however, a supervisor must discuss an observed rule violation
with the operator as soon as practicable. In addition to ongoing monitoring and observation, Rail and
Bus Operators are subject to formal ride checks in which Supervisors, usually anonymously or covertly,
observe Operators according to predetermined criteria or a checklist. These ride checks are documented,
reviewed with the Operator, and maintained in the operator’s employee file. These records are subject to
verification during the ISR process. Any trend or issue discovered during system monitoring, observation,
and ride checks is reported to the RTD divisional leadership and the CSO for inclusion in the operational
risk management risk register.
Bus, Rail, and Facility Maintainers also receive direct supervision, including observation and verification
of their maintenance activities. Each piece of work that is assigned to a maintainer is reviewed and
approved for correctness by his or her immediate Supervisor through the work order process. When a
Maintainer completes a work assignment, the direct Supervisor verifies and approves the work through
observation and signature approval on the work order. The Maintainer will enter in the system that the
work is complete, and the direct Supervisor will verify and approve the work, then accept that the work
was properly completed in the enterprise system. Maintenance activities are also observed during
the ISR process. Supervision is assessed during the ISR program by the review of documentation and
compliance with schedules. If issues are discovered, they are reported as recommendations or findings in
the review report. Review findings are referred to the Senior Manager of Safety for inclusion in the hazard
management program.

4.2.2

Operator Certification

Light Rail Operators must complete a course based upon light rail standard operating procedures and rules
prior to certification. Written tests and practical examinations are administered, and operators must score
100% on the Hands Bells Signals test with a cumulative final examination score of 80% to pass. A minimum
of three weeks is spent in the light rail vehicle in actual operation with a revenue instructor. Competency
standards are established in the “Regional Transportation District Light Rail Training Quality Manual” (see
Exhibit XVI and section 4.3, Light Rail Operator Training).

4.2.3

Operator Biennial Recertification

Recertification every two years is required of all Light Rail Operators and Controller/Supervisors.
Controller/Supervisors also complete this training as they are required to maintain their operator
certification. Recertification consists of the following: light rail vehicle ride checks with operator and
a written test covering SOPs and rules. Recertification requires a score of at least 80% while a 100%
grade is required for Signal and Flagging recognition tests. Competency standards are established in
the “Regional Transportation District Light Rail Training Quality Manual” (see Exhibit XVI and section 5,
Biennial Recertification and Practical Examinations).

4.2.4

Light Rail Maintenance Certification

Maintenance personnel, including Electromotive Mechanics, General Repair Mechanics, Track Maintainers,
and Signal and Power Maintainers receive classroom and hands-on training resembling a one-year
apprenticeship program. Maintenance personnel are certified at the end of one year, with demonstration of
passing scores on a written exam and hands-on practical exam.

4.2.5

Light Rail Maintenance Biennial Recertification

Every maintenance employee has an opportunity to receive up to 40 hours of annual refresher training
relating to their responsibilities. Recertification occurs every two years. Maintenance personnel must again
demonstrate passing scores on a written exam and a hands-on practical exam.

4.2.6

Bus Operator Training

Bus Operators must complete a nine-week training program, which includes obtaining a class B CDL
with a P2 endorsement and meeting the Entry-Level Driver Training (ELDT) Federal guidelines. Training
consists of six weeks of classroom and behind the wheel training, and three weeks of on-the-job revenue
training. This training program covers rules and standard operating procedures before entering revenue
service. Participants must pass a series of eight written tests with a minimum score of 75% before moving
to revenue training. Prior to entering service, operators must pass a final drive examination with a minimum
correct score of 75%.

4.2.7

Operator Recertification

Bus Operators undergo annual refresher training of no less than 8 hours. The general timing is quarterly,
and training sessions topics include, defensive driving, safe driving evaluation, vehicle inspection,
basic control skills, road testing, and ADA. Additional training includes conflict resolution, training on
new equipment, and major changes in procedures. Training after an extended absence from work. is
progressive, depending upon time away from driving. This training covers the topics from the active
operator sessions and additional safe driving refresher.

Bus Maintenance Certification

The General Repair Certification Program is a structural program for General Repair Mechanics. This
program is voluntary, self-paced, and designed to help employees increase their skills and expertise
and to improve opportunity for promotion. The certification process assures that Mechanics have the
qualifications, knowledge, and skills to perform their jobs. This program has been divided into the following
eight zones, which represent the major skills that Mechanics must have: chassis, power train, electrical,
air systems, preventative maintenance, wheelchair lifts, heating and air conditioning, and brakes
service capabilities.

4.2.9

Bus Maintenance Recertification

Bus mechanics who are certified are required to recertify on an annual basis in order to maintain
certification. Recertification consists of retaking the class for the maintenance section in which the original
certification was given.

4.2.10

Safety Training for Safety Personnel and Other Units

Safety personnel receive regular system safety training by attending American Public Transportation
Association (APTA) seminars and safety-specific training classes. The training includes the Rail System Safety
Course presented by the Transportation Safety Institute and other courses covering occupational safety.
Personnel outside the safety unit may receive the Rail System Safety Course and attend APTA seminars.
System safety personnel conduct in-house training for RTD personnel regarding safety certification, hazard
analysis, and construction safety.

The RTD Procurement Project Manager consults with the appropriate subject matter experts in the Safety,
Legal Services, and Materials Management divisions to ensure that all applicable safety and training
requirements are included in the contract.

4.3.3

Work-Required Training for Employees and Contractors

The Safety Division develops safety policies and procedures for occupational safety modeled on OSHA
guidelines. Regular training sessions are conducted with affected employees based on job hazard analysis.
Annual refresher training is conducted for high-risk tasks and activities.
All employees and contractor personnel who foul or have the potential to foul the tracks (within 10 feet
of centerline of track) must receive OTST prior to beginning their work. Contractors are responsible for
ensuring that their employees complete OSHA-required training prior to performing RTD projects.

4.3.4

Contractor Safety Coordination and Construction Safety

All contractor work on or near RTD rail property is controlled by access permits. Prior to issuing an access
permit, the contractor is required to meet with RTD staff from Capital Engineering and Rail Operations to
describe and coordinate their work. After this initial coordination, the contractor applies for a permit, which
is reviewed and approved by Light Rail Maintenance of Way, Rail Transportation and Safety prior issue by
Light Rail Maintenance of Way. The contractor is bound to the requirements of the permit. All contractors
working with RTD are also bound by contract specifications for the work they are to perform.
The Safety Division has developed two documents for the management of construction safety: the
Construction Safety Guidelines, and the Safety and Security Certification Plan. The Construction
Safety Guidelines presents the requirements for construction projects and follows OSHA construction
requirements and regulations. Contractors are required to follow OSHA construction safety requirements
and requirements of contract specifications and access permits.
The Safety Division conducts construction safety oversight to monitor contractor workplace safety
and conformance to OSHA standards. Oversight includes contractor safety orientation prior to project
commencement, field monitoring, and site safety inspections. Periodic safety meetings are conducted
between RTD and contractors to ensure safe project construction.
The Safety and Security Certification Plan describes the process for project and construction verification.
The plan contains design and procurement specifications, field inspection documentation, equipment
testing requirements, and integrated testing procedures.

4.3.5

Construction Safety Requirements

The construction safety program is developed and managed by Safety Division and the Capital Programs
Department. This program defines construction safety functions and responsibilities and other construction
safety requirements such as safety equipment, documentation, safety personnel, and safety certifiable
items. All contractors’ employees must comply with OSHA rules and the requirements of the construction
safety program, rail services rule books, SOPs, and individual contract agreements with RTD.

RTD has established a training and certification class for rail roadway workers (OTST). All construction
and RTD employees who may work on or near the tracks are required to attend this training annually and
obtain a certification card or sticker to keep on their person.

4.3.6

Training and Certification Training, Courses, Education

RTD maintains electronic training records for the following items: bloodborne pathogens, hazardous
communications, energy isolation, and forklift certification. All safety-related courses that are conducted
in a classroom environment or through computer-based delivery are also maintained electronically by the
Safety Division.
Records for the following training are maintained in employee training records, in paper form, and are
available for review: train operator certification, train operator recertification, controller certification,
controller recertification, equipment certification, lineman’s course, signal certification, and basic/advanced
track principles. These records are available directly from rail department managers. The training
supervisor and management review the training records to determine completion. Most training is done
annually, with all operators and supervisors being trained in the same month.

4.3.6.1 Transit Safety Specialists/Key Staff Certification
The Safety Division recognizes the FTA Transportation Safety Institute (TSI) to administer Transit Safety and
Security Program (TSSP) certification for all transit safety specialists and key operations personnel at RTD.
RTD requires safety and key operations personnel, including bus safety personnel, to participate in the FTA
Public Transportation Safety Certification Training Program (PTSCTP). All RTD employees and contractors
that conduct investigations of hazards must be trained to perform their functions in accordance with the
PTSCTP.
All participants must complete:
●

SMS Awareness (one-hour course; e-learning delivery)

●

SMS Safety Assurance (two-hour course; e-learning delivery)

●

SMS Principles for Transit (20 hours)

Light Rail personnel must complete:

4.4 Local, State, and Federal Requirements
Agency policies include local codes; state, federal, and Safety standards; and other safety initiatives.
Agency polices also include actions adopted by the Board and the management policies on the Hub.

4.4.2 Construction Safety
Construction safety is administered in accordance with contract specifications and applicable federal, state,
and local safety requirements. The program is based on and complies with applicable federal, state, and
local safety codes and regulations. Procedures have been established for the control of operating hazards,
including but not limited to chemicals, noise, cut and abrasion injuries, and strain and sprain injuries.
Contractors are required to comply with these requirements for the safety of their own employees, as well
as to safeguard employees, contractors, passengers, and the public. Agency policies also include actions
adopted by the Board and the management policies on the Hub.
Engineering and project management approve each contractor’s safety program plan and supporting
documentation, with the concurrence of the Safety Division. Particular emphasis is placed on work that may
affect agency operations, customers, facilities, and personnel. All contractors working in the RTD rail rightof-way, or interfacing with Rail Operations, are required to attend OTST. This training covers track access,
right-of-way flagging, and operating procedures. Contractor reviews are conducted to assure compliance
with federal and state law and RTD requirements.

4.4.2.1 Personal Protective Equipment
Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as safety glasses, safety boots, gloves, face shields,
and work uniforms, is required to be used in performing various work by employees. When handling
chemicals, the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) must be referenced to ensure that the proper PPE is worn. This
equipment should be evaluated and approved by the Safety Division.

Issued to:

Light Rail Transportation Controllers/Supervisors
Light Rail Maintenance Supervisors
Safety

Current Issue:

01/17/2020

____________________________________________
Assistant General Manager, Rail Operations

I.

PURPOSE
The investigation of an incident/accident must produce information that leads to
corrective actions that prevent or reduce the number and severity of future
incident/accidents, if possible. The more complete the information, the easier it will
be to take the proper corrective actions.
For purposes of incident/accident prevention, investigations must be for fact finding,
not fault finding. This is not to imply that responsibility may not be fixed where
human error has caused an incident/accident or that persons should be excused from
the consequences of their actions. Rather, the investigation should be concerned only
with the facts.

II.

DEFINITIONS
Field Investigation Team (FIT) Investigation
The Field Investigation Team is a group of representatives from Light Rail Operations,
Safety, Claims, and Media Relations. The FIT is activated as required by the
investigating supervisor on the scene. Generally, the Team will be activated to
investigate incident/accidents that are serious in nature; however, personal injury and
extent of damage will not be the sole criteria. Department Managers are responsible
for providing Control with a current list of representatives for notification.
The investigating supervisor is responsible for requesting activation of the Team.
Light Rail Central Control is responsible for notification of Team members.
Notification of Team members may be delegated by Central Control to other
operations or safety personnel. The Senior Manager of Safety and Environmental
Compliance or designee is responsible for coordination of the investigation. When
activated, the Field Investigation Team will:

forwarded to the Senior Manager of Safety and Environmental Compliance, who will
submit a final report of the Team's findings to the General Manager, Senior
Management, the Executive Safety and Security Committee, and appropriate
agencies indicating most probable cause, contributing factors, conclusions and
recommendations.
Members of the Field Investigation Team are not to become involved in the restoration
of service, but should assure that the scene of the incident/accident is preserved until
the initial investigation is completed. The FIT consists of the following members.


Assistant General Manager, Safety, Security and Asset Management (Chair)



Assistant General Manager, Rail Operations



Senior Manager, Safety and Environment



General Superintendent, Rail Transportation



General Superintendent, LRV Maintenance

V. INVESTIGATION METHOD
Page 7 of 12

Packet Pg. 208

The Supervisor should immediately identify him/herself to the emergency services
personnel at the scene and begin to coordinate activities with these personnel and
the Controller. The Supervisor should be particularly alert for further safety hazards
resulting from the incident/accident such as:


Overhead wire is always to be assumed energized. In the case of a side impact,
the potential for 750V energization to the LRV and the other vehicle exists. This
will occur when skirt damage to the LRV exists. Be sure the pantograph has also
been lowered on all other cars in consist.



Passengers and observers on the right-of-way.



The need for passenger evacuation onto the right-of-way.



The extent of injuries to passengers, employees and other persons.



Passenger protection, including the provision of first aid, if qualified.

Supervisors conducting an investigation should bear in mind that an incident/accident
investigation is a search for facts. The investigator should maintain an open mind and
not jump to conclusions. The primary objectives of an investigation are to:


Gather all the facts which may have contributed to the incident/accident.



Collect all the physical evidence which might have a bearing on the cause of the
incident/accident.



Provide sufficient

Introduction
Implementing the Operational Risk Management (ORM) framework will improve how Denver Regional
Transportation District (RTD) manages risk and represents a shared commitment to an effective
process through a formal, continuous, top-down, data-driven, organizational-wide approach to
manage risk, assure effectiveness of risk controls, and promote ORM in the agency. The ORM process
applies to all risks for the agency, except financial and legal risks, which are covered by the internal
audit function. This framework outlines the tasks for implementing a formal, documented process for
ORM throughout the agency.
This effort demonstrates RTD’s commitment to improving the maturity of its approach to ORM, which
will unify the agency’s management systems and other activities to achieve agency objectives
effectively and efficiently.
Element II of the RTD Transit Agency Safety Plan (TASP) is Risk Management, which describes how
RTD identifies, evaluates, tracks, and mitigates risks and risk in the organization and on the transit
system. The risk management element and the processes undertaken by the agency are identified
and described in sufficient detail to be effectively undertaken throughout RTD. The acceptable risk
level and performance targets are established and documented.
Similar to a Plan – Do – Check – Act (PDCA) process, ORM is designed to be a continual effort to proactively identify and mitigate risk and to improve the data-driven, decisionmaking process within the agency. The management of identified risks is a
vital component of the RTD Operational Management System.
Risk is “the effect of uncertainty on objectives” internal or external to the
RTD system. An unacceptable risk is a condition that may endanger or
seriously harm human life, significantly destruct property or result in system
loss. This includes harm to customers, employees, contractors, equipment,
and to the general public. These risk conditions must be mitigated or
eliminated. Risks may be observed in the operating environment, through
procedures, during system modifications, while undertaking capital projects,
from investigations and audits, or operational changes.
The ORM Framework applies to all RTD employees and obligates everyone to constantly observe risks
in their work areas and report them to their safety committee, through a reporting process or to their
supervisor.
Decisions on risk should be informed to pursue the strategic priorities in the 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan:

Principles/Goals
An integrated ORM Framework applies to the entire organization and demonstrates the inclusion of
risk in decision-making as defined in the Operational Risk Framework.
RTD employees understand risk as “the effect of uncertainty on objectives” and incorporate a
probabilistic approach in decision-making.
The Leadership Team (LT) commits to develop, implement, and utilize a uniform, evidence based,
ORM process that will effectively and efficiently achieve a common purpose, mission, and framework.
The LT is committed to:
•
•
•
•
•

Understanding risk in the context of the probability (likelihood) and severity (consequence) of
events that can or do happen
Using ORM to guide agency actions that support delivery of the agency’s objectives within
fiscal, ethical, regulatory, and other practical constraints
Being transparent about the potential tradeoffs between risk, cost, and performance inherent
in all decisions
Using clearly defined agency strategies, objectives, operational plans, and processes in the
identification, evaluation, mitigation, and acceptance of risk
Making best use of RTD’s limited resources to meet its objectives

Any exceptions to this commitment must be documented as out of compliance and signed by the
General Manager and CEO with copies to the Chief Safety Officer. A copy of the ORM policy is
provided in Appendix A.
The continuous identification, monitoring, and mitigation of risk is key to an effective ORM. The RTD
ORM will be an ongoing process with the continual improvement goals of:
•
•
•

Increasing staff understanding of the process
Increasing use of ORM to make data-driven decisions
Improving quality and consistency of risk evaluation across the agency

1. Identify Risk
Identifying risks is the responsibility of all RTD employees and contractors. Risk identification should
be an ongoing process. Identification methods include, but are not limited to the following:
•
•

Observation, inspection, and interaction of all RTD employees and contractors
Reports from safety committee members, customers, customer service, and field personnel

Administration (FTA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), safety
recommendations, guidance, initiatives, and alerts
Nonconformance Reports and Corrective Action Plans (NCR and CAP)

Risk reporting by RTD employees is conducted through multiple methods. These include:
•
•

Directly reporting to their supervisor, safety committee or union representative
Submitting directly on the Hub, which is the agency’s intranet (click on blue safety person
link)

2. Evaluate Risk

Risk evaluation attempts to define what the risk means to employees, customers and/or the system.
The primary purpose of the risk evaluation process is to determine the elements of and reasons for
the risk with the purpose of eliminating or controlling it. The factors contributing to the risk should
be fully understood and evaluated by the employees or safety committees. Training will be required.
This understanding and evaluation will assist in determining the potential controls to put in place and
the effectiveness of the mitigation efforts.
As part of evaluating accidents and incidents, root cause analysis using the “Five Whys?”
methodology can be used to understand root causes and determine the most effective solutions to
mitigating risks.
Part of the evaluation of risk is to determine potential controls to mitigate the risk. There are five
basic steps to mitigating risk:
•
•
•
•
•

Design for minimum risk
Incorporate control devices
Provide warning devices
Develop procedures and training
Acceptance of residual/remaining risk

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_Exhibits_2023_v5_sml (4694 : 2023 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

16.D.c

Packet Pg. 247

Potential controls, in order of effectiveness, are:
•
•
•
•
•

Elimination – remove the hazard
Substitution – replace of material or a process with another that is considered less hazardous
Engineering Controls – isolate people from the risk
Administrative Controls – training, signage
Personal Protective Equipment – clothing protecting the person

The costs associated with the potential controls must also be estimated or evaluated.

2.1

Assign Risk Owner

The RTD employee responsible for most closely mitigating, monitoring, and measuring the risk will be
identified and added to the Risk Register. The employee should be well informed of the risk, be at
the lowest /closest level of responsibility and have the authority to coordinate funding and or other
resources.

2.2

Safety Committee Structure

When a risk is identified, the local safety committee (e.g., Light Rail, Bus, Commuter Rail,
CyberSecurity, Safety & Environmental) will initiate the review and action. The local safety
committee will screen submittals for the difference between non-substantive complaints and
identification of true risks. The local safety committee will maintain the risk register, assign the risk
owner and work to evaluate, assess and mitigate (if required) the risk. If the risk requires mitigation
that exceeds the funding authority at this level, the risk will be elevated to the next higher-level
safety committee, the Joint Union/Management Safety Committee or ultimately to the Leadership
Safety Committee.
The Leadership Safety Committee is comprised of senior leaders of significantly affected
departments. The Leadership Safety Committee will meet monthly to review, assess progress, and
reallocate priorities of existing risks. Members include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

General Manager and Chief Executive Officer

Chief Administrative Officer
Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
Assistant General Manager, Rail Operations
Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations

Safety Committee structure diagram is provided Appendix B.

3. Assess Risk
Assessing risk is the process of determining the severity of risk and the probability of the risk being
realized. In order to ensure that risk assessments are consistent, it is important to utilize a standard
definition. The detailed severity and probability definitions for various events and departments are
provided in Appendix C.

Severity is a quantitative or subjective measure of the worst credible mishap resulting from personnel
error, environmental conditions, design inadequacies and/or procedural efficiencies for system,
subsystem or component failure or malfunction. Severity is categorized as Catastrophic, Severe,
Serious, Limited, or Negligible.
Probability is defined as the likelihood of the number of times that a specific event will occur during
the planned life expectancy of a system. A risk probability may be derived from the analysis of a
transit system’s operating experience, evaluation of RTD safety historical data, or the analysis of
reliability and failure data. Probability is categorized as Frequent, Probable, Remote, Improbable or
Highly Improbable.

Using the determined severity and probability, the RTD risk assessment matrix is used to determine
the risk index. The risk ratings will be labeled as High, Serious, Medium, Moderate, and Low. The
required action to mitigate the risk will then be evaluated to apply the appropriate control measures
and/or mitigation actions.

RTD has adopted a system for assessing the level of risk to determine what action(s) must be taken
to correct or document the risk. This assessment system has been incorporated into the formal
system safety analysis, which enables the safety committees, as decision makers, to understand the
amount of risk involved in accepting the risk in relation to the cost (schedule, cost, operations) to
reduce the risk to an acceptable level. The required resolution action is based on the determined risk
level.
Risks that have been evaluated and ranked will be mitigated at the lowest feasible level. Mitigation
actions that exceed funding levels authorized at each level, will be elevated to the next higher level
for action.

Mitigation actions to address risks will be
developed based on the evaluation and
assessment by the risk owners or safety
committees of the severity or probability of
risk.

the

Critical risks identified must be controlled or
eliminated so it does not continue to pose a
danger. This may be done in a temporary
manner until a permanent solution is
implemented. The process of controlling,
tracking, and eliminating risks is recorded
the risk register.

5. Monitor Results
5.1

Risk Register

The safety team will assure local risk registers are used to track risks at the departmental level within
RTD. These registers are to be maintained within the department and are reviewed by the local
safety committee on a regular basis. Risks placed on the local register receive their initial and final
risk rating using RTD’s 25 box risk assessment matrix. Management may also present risks to the
local safety committee for risk ratings. Risk ratings may be changed when new information is
received or as a result of further data analysis.
All risk register entries require a mitigation plan (if risk resolution is required), tracking number, brief
description, projected completion date, and an initial hazard rating/initial risk rating (IHR/IRR) using
the RTD Risk Analysis Matrix. Risk Register format example is provided in Appendix D.
If requested, or required for complicated risks, a CAP will be developed by risk owner/department
managers in conjunction with the safety committees. The committees/risk owners will ensure that
the CAP process is followed and properly tracked until it is closed. CAP's may be tracked and sorted
separate from the risk register. When a CAP is closed the risk register will reflect this action with a
closed date.
CAPs include the following information:
•
•
•
•
•

Element of activity identified as deficient
Planned activities to resolve deficiency
RTD department responsible for implementing corrective action
Scheduled completion date for implementation
Estimated cost of implementation

5.2

Monitor and Measure

A regular schedule of reviewing the effectiveness of mitigation actions will be established. For risks
without mitigation measures, a similar evaluation schedule should be established to determine that
the risk remains low.
In addition to the risks, the ORM process will be regularly evaluated to determine effectiveness,
compliance, and potential improvements. Audits (internal and external) are an excellent means of
conducting this evaluation.

6. Report Outcome
RTD risks will be reported in compliance with regulatory requirements and as part of the feedback
loop to increase data-driven decisions and to enhance the confidence in the ORM process.

6.1

Public Utilities Commission (PUC) State Safety Oversight Agency
(SSOA)

Report to the PUC SSOA on a monthly basis those issues and risks required for reporting within the
PUC’s jurisdiction. This reporting will provide status of mitigations and progress towards closing out
CAPs.

6.2

Employees

Report to strengthen the Employee Reporting System and enhance RTD employee confidence in and
use of the ORM process. Reporting can include posting of risk registers with updated mitigation
status.

6.3

Joint Union/Management Safety Committee

Report to the Joint Union/Management Safety Committee on high risks from each local safety
committee, and on mitigation actions requiring additional funding.

6.4

Leadership Safety Committee

Report to the Leadership Safety Committee on high risks from each local safety committee, and on
mitigation actions requiring additional funding.

Executive Summary
In 2016, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) mandated that every federally funded transit agency
in the United States must have a Transit Asset Management Plan in place by October 2018. The FTA
has expressed concern with the sustainability of transit assets due to the backlog of renewals of
approximately $105 billion nationwide (June 22, 2021). The federal Moving Ahead for Progress in the
21st Century (MAP-21) act highlighted Washington’s change focus from construction to longer term
stewardship (2012).
This Regional Transportation District (RTD) Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan is a formal report
that meets the FTA TAM requirements under MAP-21.
A Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan is the cornerstone of asset stewardship. It is the public case
for investment in the assets to justify the use of tax dollars and fares to meet community
requirements. It aims to demonstrate the best use of funding to deliver services now and into the
future.
Accordingly, this document summarizes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The principles RTD uses to make asset decisions aligned to agency priorities
The assets RTD uses in the provision of public transportation
The current state of those assets for which RTD has capital responsibility
How RTD makes asset investment decisions
The proposed capital investment plan for the period 2021-2027
Actions to further improve asset management decision-making
How this plan will be evaluated for continuous improvement

RTD, like all transit agencies, is highly asset-intensive. In the past fifteen years, the agency has spent
approximately $6.4 billion on expansion, including new rail and bus rapid transit lines.
When MAP-21 was passed in 2012, RTD dedicated staff resources to focus on asset management and
began to review data regarding the details of assets RTD owns and manages in its asset inventory as
well as the condition of these assets, using the principle of State of Good Repair (SGR). Though RTD
initially collected this information voluntarily, the FTA now requires this data collection from all
transit agencies.
RTD was among the first transit agencies to declare an intention to meet FTA TAM requirements by
developing an International Standards Organization (ISO) 55000 certified asset management system
(AMS). However, RTD has struggled to make the changes in agency culture necessary to accomplish
this objective. The pursuit of ISO 55000 certification remains instrumental in the agency’s approach
developing an effective and efficient AMS. An improved AMS will yield better decision-making across
the asset portfolio for asset optimization. Further progress towards developing an ISO 55000 and
TAM compliant AMS is anticipated, though it will take great effort in order to transform the agency
into a model of asset management in the transit industry.

By 2017, RTD had put in place the first steps towards an integrated process to prioritize all capital
investment by agency objectives. This has further been refined to categorize all investment proposals
by compliance, renewal, or enhancement, with the intention of funding projects in that order to
ensure good stewardship. This encourages investment in maintaining existing assets before funding
new asset or non-asset projects. In 2020, recognizing a need for improvement in asset information
staff implemented an Asset Information Maturity (AIM) effort to assess the quality of information for
use in decision-making, to formulate plans for AIM improvements as warranted, and to execute the
documented improvement plans.
This process forms the basis for this TAM Plan, along with RTD’s commitment to continue to develop
its asset management practices.
RTD is actively involved in transit asset management thought-leadership, through the American Public
Transportation Association (APTA) and Transportation Research Board (TRB). RTD examples were
used by the FTA in its TAM Facility Performance Measure Reporting Guidebook (U.S. Department of
Transportation, 2018) and the TAM Systems Handbook (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2020). In
addition to transit-specific asset management community involvement, RTD participates more
broadly in asset management, by co-chairing the local chapter of the Global Institute of Asset
Management (IAM) and participating in the planning group for the International IAM. RTD’s TAMP
has been included in the FTA’s resource library as an exemplar of such a plan.
This broad involvement in asset management across industries, as well as deep involvement in
transit-specific asset management leads RTD to believe that a shift in culture is needed in order to
improve the agency’s stewardship of assets using better information and decision tools and achieve
better outcomes in performance, fiscal responsibility, risk management and value creation for the
Region.
RTD’s long-term asset management strategy is to make consistently sound decisions across RTD’s
asset portfolio and asset systems to deliver customer needs in a financially sustainable and safe way,
using the ISO 55000 framework. This effort has led to the implementation of an investment planning
process for planning and budgeting, as well as the goal of achieving ISO 55000 certification.
An ISO 55000 health check, a mid-point review of the entire AMS against the requirements of ISO
55000, was conducted in 2019. The health check identified risks to achieving certification, one of
which was lack of “leadership and commitment.” (AMCL, 2019) Shortly after the health check, then
GM/CEO Genova announced his retirement and in 2020 an interim GM/CEO was hired to be at the
helm of the agency while a search was conducted for a long-term replacement. Though not without
challenges, RTD made progress towards the goal of attaining ISO 55000 certification in 2020.
However, the agency is still well short of being able to seek certification and does not currently have a
target date for doing so. Following a selection of a new GM/CEO in 2020, improvements in RTD’s AMS
are set as goals in the 5-Year Strategic Plan, and work towards eventual ISO 55000 certification can
continue.

The AMS in RTD is being developed in close coordination with the safety management system, with
both informed by a risk-based prioritization approach with the intention of developing that approach
into an enterprise risk framework.
RTD’s mission is to make lives better through connections and its vision is to be the trusted leader in
mobility, delivering excellence and value to our customers and community. (RTD, 2021) The
communities RTD serves should know how the agency invests taxpayer dollars and how decisions are
made regarding the best use of limited resources. This is done through transparency in decision
processes to sustain the condition and performance of the assets.

3. DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS

What tools and
processes does RTD use
to prioritize funding
around those assets
described in its
inventory?

On an annual basis, RTD prepares and updates a six-year Mid Term Financial Plan
(MTFP) which includes projected capital construction and improvements, service levels
and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Part of
the MTFP process includes prioritization of projects into three funding categories:
Compliance, Renewal, and Enhancement.

4. PRIORITIZED LIST OF INVESTMENTS

What is the result or
output of those decision
support tools and
processes?

The two primary lists of projects are created through the MTFP process: Capital Projects
and Capital Maintenance Projects. Each list is subdivided into the three funding
categories noted above.

5. TAM AND SGR POLICY

What are the guiding
principles for asset
management efforts at
RTD?

RTD adopted an asset management policy in June 2014 and most recently updated
April 2021.
The intent of the policy is to improve how RTD manages assets from now on - it is
therefore forward-looking in nature and represents the Agency’s vision and shared
commitment for good Asset Management at RTD. The Asset Management System
applies to the entire organization and directs the short, medium, and long-term plans
for assets to achieve the agency mission of making lives better through connections.

6. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

How is RTD going to
execute the TAM plan?

RTD has chosen ISO 55000 as the framework to build its AMS. As part of that choice,
the agency performed a gap assessment to determine the necessary tasks needed to
achieve ISO 55000 certification.

7. LIST OF KEY ANNUAL ACTIVITIES

What activities does RTD
perform to maintain its
TAM system?

RTD identifies two types of asset management activities: those ongoing asset
management activities performed as part of ‘business as usual,’ and those activities
specific to achieving ISO 55000 certification. TAM activities are the subset of these ISO
activities targeting specific TAM elements.

8. IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES

What resources are
needed to execute RTD
TAM plan activities?

Personnel from across the Agency are involved in asset management activities,
including the General Manager/CEO, the Senior Leadership Team, the Asset
Management Division (AMD), Operations, Capital Programs, Finance, Administration,
Communications, Planning, and General Counsel departments.
The AMD’s in-house expertise enables the agency to employ robust asset management
practices. From 2012 through 2018, the AMD added additional staff in two key areas:
physical asset business analysis and data science.

9. EVALUATION PLAN

What is the Agency
doing to ensure that the
TAM plan delivers the
intended results?

There are two primary areas of the evaluation plan; the TAM Plan itself and ISO 55000.
The current TAM Plan provides the baseline for evaluating the agency’s future plans.
RTD intends to regularly review its asset management maturity, setting maturity targets
in its Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP).
RTD intends to evaluate the degree to which it is meeting the requirements for ISO
55000, and therefore its readiness for an ISO 55001 certification audit, through the
following measures:
• ISO spot checks
• ISO health check
• ISO mock audit
• ISO audit
• ISO surveillance audits

Asset Management Policy

An Asset Management (AM) Policy is a documented commitment to achieving and maintaining a
state of good repair for all capital assets. The FTA has defined state of good repair as “The condition
in which a capital asset is able to operate at a full level of performance” (Transit Asset Management;
National Transit Database, 2016).
RTD’s Asset Management Policy was updated on September 28, 2021. The policy describes a
forward-looking commitment to good asset management practice, intended to pursue investment
optimization across the entire asset portfolio to maximize its value. Asset management performed
according to this policy will result in assets that are in a state of good repair.

2 RTD and its Assets
The Regional Transportation District provides transportation services to 3.08 million people located
within its 2,342 square mile service area, such services include bus, rail, shuttles, paratransit services,
demand responsive microtransit services, and special event services. Though operating a significantly
reduced schedule to match current levels of demand, RTD used these assets to provide nearly 36
Million revenue miles on 143 bus and rail routes, in 2020.

2.1

The RTD Story

The Colorado General Assembly created RTD in 1969. Efforts in early years focused on
regional transportation planning. In 1973, voters approved a 0.5% sales tax initiative to
finance a multi-modal transit system. At this time, RTD acquired privately owned bus
companies, improved service frequencies, and expanded routes in several counties
throughout the metro area. By 1976, ridership had grown to 35 million rides annually.

RTD celebrated its first light rail opening in October 1994. With a fleet of only 11 light
rail vehicles, the 5.3-mile D Line attracted hundreds of thousands of customers when it
began operations with just eleven light rail vehicles. Now, eight light rail lines service 57
stations along seven individually constructed corridors.
In November 2004, voters approved the FasTracks ballot measure for the region-wide
expansion of transit service. The 0.4% sales and use tax continues to fund the FasTracks program
which has grown to include 122 miles of new commuter rail and light rail, 18 miles of bus rapid transit
corridor, and numerous rail and bus stations. The program consists of six new rapid transit corridors
and three existing corridor extensions.

2.2

RTD Service Area

The RTD service area is composed of eight counties including all of Boulder, Broomfield, Denver and
Jefferson counties, large areas of Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas counties, and a small portion of
Weld County.

In 2000, RTD provided approximately 77 million passenger trips. (U.S. Department of Transportation,
2000) By 2019, passenger trips grew to 105 million, a 30% increase in boardings. Over the same
period, per the Colorado State Demographer’s Office, the Denver/Boulder region increased from
approximately 2.4 million residents to approximately 3.2 million residents, a 31% increase (2019).

RTD Assets

RTD is an asset-intensive organization. RTD’s Statement of Net Position notes that capital assets total
nearly $7.6 billion (Regional Transportation District, 2020), of which most is in the scope of TAM as
detailed in this section. Much of this total expenditure resulted in assets in the scope of Transit Asset
Management as detailed in this section.
As assets are operated, their condition degrades over time, and their risk of failure increases. Failures
including those having an impact on safety, can manifest in a variety of ways. Asset condition is
therefore a leading indicator for safety risks, and understanding asset condition today, and how
quickly it might degrade in the future, is an important aspect of good asset, safety and risk
management. Organizations that know their assets’ deterioration rates can also make more
informed decisions on renewal frequencies and their approach to preventive maintenance.
For the purposes of this TAMP, RTD has categorized its assets in accordance with FTA guidelines:
revenue vehicles, equipment, facilities, and infrastructure, using the flowchart depicted in Figure 5
below, adherence to which ensures repeatable results and an improvement in inventory data quality.

RTD’s revenue vehicle fleet is composed of 1,427 buses and 201 light rail vehicles. Sixty-six commuter
rail vehicles are operated by a third-party, Denver Transit Operators (DTO).
Transit vehicles in the agency’s rubber tire fleet include:
•
•
•
•

Standard 40’ fixed-route transit buses with a capacity of 40 passengers
Fixed-route articulated buses with 33% greater capacity than standard buses
Regional intercity coaches, such as the Flatiron Flyer, built for longer trips at highway speed,
which are typically 45 feet long and have a seated capacity of 55 passengers
Cutaways which are made by second stage manufacturers, using the chassis of full size vans,
used to provide on-demand service for eligible passengers with disabilities (Access-a-Ride)
and in areas where ridership does not support fixed route service (FlexRide)

RTD buses are procured from a variety of manufacturers including: Gillig, BYD, New Flyer, MCI,
Goshen, Eldorado, and Startrans. Approximately 50% of standard and articulated fixed route buses
are operated and maintained by RTD, with the operations and maintenance for the remainder
outsourced6 to two external partner companies, First Transit and TransDev. All intercity coaches are
operated and maintained by RTD, and all cutaway buses are operated and maintained by third parties
(Via Transportation, MV Transportation and Evergreen Senior Center).

Light rail vehicles (LRV) are electrically powered using a 750-volt DC overhead catenary system.
Individual vehicles can be coupled together to form up to four cars per consist, with a seated capacity
of 64 per car. LRVs can carry up to 236 passengers per car utilizing the standing room. All light rail
vehicles are manufactured by Siemens and are acquired, owned, operated and maintained by RTD.

Figure 10: Light Rail Vehicle (Siemens SD-160)

All commuter rail vehicles are operated under the FasTracks program, and their ongoing maintenance
is outsourced to a third-party, Denver Transit Operators. RTD will assume ownership at the end of
the contracted period of performance of 30 years. Condition assessments will not be performed on
these assets until such time as RTD assumes capital responsibility for the vehicles.

Figure 11: Commuter Rail Vehicle (Hyundai Rotem)

RTD has historically managed its revenue vehicle inventory based on age: the vehicles are procured,
maintained in a state of good repair for a specified number of years through a preventative
maintenance program, and then replaced. This approach is adopted for revenue vehicles maintained
by third parties, including bus and commuter rail.
Table 3 below presents the total number of revenue vehicles for which RTD has capital responsibility,
along with their Useful Life Benchmark (ULB), which is the expected duration in years that an asset
will remain in service according to RTD’s standards and the average condition based on its age. The
condition range is from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the vehicle is significantly beyond its useful life
benchmark and 5 is considered new. A vehicle that has reached the end of its useful life benchmark
is scored at 2.5 and from that point onwards is considered in backlog.
RTD’s current renewal approach for revenue vehicles is to keep them operating reliably and safely
beyond their useful life benchmark with maintenance intervals and interventions based on cost and
performance trade-offs. Table 3 provides the backlog for each vehicle type. RTD uses the FTA
definition for revenue vehicle backlog, which is the percentage of revenue vehicles that have met or
exceeded their useful life benchmark (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2016).
RTD’s bus fleet has been a focus of renewals, though some transit buses are now considered to be in
backlog. Based on a combination of vehicle performance, condition, and cost of maintaining rather
than replacing vehicles, some transit buses will continue to be operated in backlog.
Table 3 also presents the total initial capital cost 7 of the vehicles in each sub-fleet.

7 In the future, RTD intends to determine the whole-life cost (e.g., capital expense and operating expense) of its assets and
this will be considered for inclusion in a subsequent generation of the TAMP.

Equipment

For the purposes of this TAMP, RTD’s equipment assets include non-revenue vehicles and non-vehicle
equipment costing over $50,000. RTD owns 48 automobiles, four steel wheel non-revenue vehicles
and 378 rubber tire non-revenue vehicles. Non-vehicle equipment consists of various types of
machinery such as non-self-propelled rail tampers, equipment hoists, and storeroom stacking
systems. The current inventory of 67 assets is detailed in Appendix H, though a complete inventory is
in progress. The facilities equipment inventory registry is incomplete, in many cases lacking
information such as expected useful life, cost, in-service dates, unique identifiers and whatever
information does exist is located in disparate resources that may lack controls needed to keep
information current. Current efforts around asset information maturity and the continued
incremental improvements of the AMP are specifically designed to address this information gap. The
gap has been identified, and corrective methods have begun to be implemented. As described in the
summary, there are some areas of the organization that are more engaged in the improvement
efforts.
Equipment is purchased from a variety of manufacturers and is owned, operated and maintained by
RTD.

RTD has historically managed its non-revenue vehicle equipment inventory based on age; the
equipment is procured, maintained in a state of good repair for a specified number of years through
preventative maintenance and then replaced.8 As such, condition scores for non-revenue vehicle
equipment are age-based.
Table 5 below presents the total number of non-revenue vehicle assets, along with their useful life
benchmark (ULB), and a score representing the condition of the equipment based on its age. The
score range is from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the asset is significantly beyond its useful life benchmark
and 5 is considered new. An asset that has reached the end of its ULB is scored at 2.5, and from that
point onwards is considered in backlog. RTD uses the FTA definition for non-revenue vehicle backlog,
which is the percentage of vehicles that have met or exceeded their useful life benchmark. A nonrevenue vehicle that has reached the end of its ULB is scored at 2.5, and from that point onwards is
considered in backlog (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2016).

Facilities

For the purposes of this TAMP, RTD owns:
•
•
•
•

5 administration facilities where RTD administration functions take place
9 maintenance facilities where maintenance work takes place
121 public facilities, which includes stations, buildings and other structures where customers
can board or disembark from an RTD transit vehicle
111 conveyances such as elevators and escalators, installed within facilities. These are treated
here separately based on National Transit Database (NTD) reporting requirements

Administration, maintenance, and public facilities for which RTD has capital responsibility are
operated and maintained by RTD, although some services, such as cleaning and snow removal, may
be contracted to third parties. Conveyance manufacturers include Kone and ThyssenKrupp and
conveyance maintenance is outsourced to third parties.

Figure 16: Bus Maintenance Facility

RTD has historically managed its facilities and their related equipment on a reactive basis, i.e., the
practice has been to maintain or replace the assets when they fail. The more critical facility elements,
such as underground storage tanks and boilers, have redundancy built in to minimize service
interruptions when they fail to perform as designed. RTD fully complies with all regulations relating
to safety inspections for certain facility assets (Regional Transportation District, 2016).

Since 2015, RTD has performed in-house assessments to determine the condition score of individual
elements of each facility for which RTD has capital responsibility. As such, facility condition scores are
assessment-based.

Figure 17: Light Rail Maintenance Facility

Figure 18: Public Facility

The condition score of each of the elements that exist at an administration or maintenance facility is
averaged to provide the condition score of the facility. Currently, each extant facility element is
weighted equally. The following table presents the elements of each facility that are assigned an
individual condition score. Not all facilities have all listed elements.

Conveyance inspections are outsourced to third parties in accordance with applicable legislation and
regulations but are not used to determine condition. These assets are managed on an age-based
approach consistent with regulatory standards. Both preventative and reactive maintenance
activities are performed by third parties, and the activities delivered under these contractual
agreements are monitored by RTD staff to ensure contract adherence and acceptable performance of
the assets.
Table 8 presents the total number of facility assets for which RTD has capital responsibility, along with

operated and maintained by a third party.

Figure 20: Light Rail Vehicle Bridge

Light rail infrastructure is purchased or constructed by a
variety of manufacturers and is owned, operated and
maintained by RTD. All commuter rail infrastructure is
delivered under the FasTracks program and its ongoing
operation and maintenance is outsourced to a third
party, Denver Transit Operators. RTD will assume
ownership for commuter rail infrastructure at the end of
the contracted period of performance (30 years).
Condition assessments will not be performed on these
assets until such time as RTD assumes capital
responsibility.

Figure 21: Track Infrastructure

RTD has historically managed light rail infrastructure assets based on age but has performed
condition assessments of right-of-way light rail infrastructure for three years. In doing so, RTD
determined that age-based condition scores provided similar levels of accuracy as assessment-based
condition scores, and so has stopped performing condition assessments. As such, light rail
infrastructure condition scores are age-based (Regional Transportation District, 2017).
Seventy-seven light rail vehicle bridges are owned and maintained by RTD. Seven light rail vehicle
bridges are owned and maintained by third parties.
Light rail vehicle bridges are inspected once every two years by an independent third-party contractor
per state law. The inspection reports received by the inspection agency describe the condition of
seven bridge elements: abutments, caps, deck, girders/beams, head/wing walls, PPC (pillars, piers,
columns) and railings. The inspection report condition data is turned into an SGR score from 1 to 5
for each element. All the element scores are averaged together to give an SGR score for the bridge
(Regional Transportation District, 2016). As such, condition scores for bridges for which RTD has
capital responsibility are assessment-based. Condition assessments for bridges owned and
maintained by third-parties are not recorded in the TAMP.

Table 13 presents the total number of light rail and directly operated commuter rail vehicle bridges
for which RTD has capital responsibility, along with their EUL and assessment-based condition scores.
Table 14 represents the number, EUL, and age-based score for key directly operated commuter rail
assets.
Table 15 represents the directly operated commuter rail track by type, noting the differences in EUL
between the types and relevant age-based scores.
Tables 16 and 17 represent the FTA performance measure for infrastructure which is the percentage
of guideway directional route miles (DRM) with performance restrictions by light rail and commuter
rail by class, respectively. However, RTD anticipates that the guideway under performance restriction
measure may not be an adequate measure of condition for rail infrastructure assets in the future
(U.S. Department of Transportation, 2017).
There are many reasons why rail infrastructure assets would be placed under a temporary
performance restriction such as routine maintenance, the presence of inspection personnel in the
right of way, or police activity at or near crossings. These reasons provide no indication of the
condition of the assets. Additionally, track assets that are in very poor condition but that exist in a
high-density urban environment may not have a performance restriction because the design speed is
low in such areas. The age of these assets along with physical inspections will likely be more useful
for investment decisions; consequently, RTD also provides age-based condition and backlog scores for
light rail infrastructure assets.
RTD’s first light rail line opened in 1994, assets of that era, with an EUL of 25 years, are currently
shown in backlog in Table 11. However this may not reflect the true condition of the assets. Major
repairs to assets, such as replacement or refurbishment of components, extends the life of those
assets, such improvements have not been recorded in a system of record. The Asset Management
Division is working with light rail maintenance of way to improve asset information and to begin
recording major repairs of assets in a system of record for reporting, compliance, and planning
purposes.
Tables 11, 12, and 13 also present the total initial capital cost for each light rail asset type.
RTD’s first directly operated commuter rail line opened in 2020. The asset information for this line
does not reside in a single system of record. Work was performed to improve inventory for this class
of assets according to the AIM plan authored by the asset class’ designated steward, though those
efforts were not entirely successful. Work will continue in 2022 to improve asset inventory
information. Though assets were capitalized according to RTD’s accounting practices, the level of
granularity at which projects are completed and subsequently capitalized does not always easily lend
the clarity needed for translating a multi-million dollar project line item into individual asset costs.
Additional work to identify costs to facilitate reporting congruent with other asset classes and to
support the inclusion of these assets into the AMP will continue in 2022.

14 In August 2020, all light rail track was remeasured and the DRM for each track segment as well as the total DRM was

updated accordingly (Regional Transportation District, 2020). The performance restrictions for years prior to 2020 are
presented using the metrics that were in place during those periods.

3 Current Capital Investment Decision Process
The capital improvement component of RTD’s fiscal policy states that “On an annual basis, RTD will
prepare and update a six-year Mid-Term Financial Plan including projected capital construction and
improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating
programs.” (Regional Transportation District, 2016)
The MTFP also provides the basis for the agency’s application for federal transit funding through the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG). The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive
federal funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying MTFP projects
are included in the TIP.
In 2021, at the time of reporting, RTD’s Board of Directors has yet to approve an updated MTFP for
the period 2022-2027.
Projects initiated in 2021 and currently underway will continue to be funded. However, funding for
future projects may be approved on as as-needed basis as opposed to the method established in the
Capital Improvement Policy. Since no updated MTFP has been approved at the time of this reporting
and the Capital Improvement Policy been not amended, the following process and list of prioritized
investments is based on the 2021-2026 MTFP.
The 2021-2026 MTFP includes projects funded from the base system’s 0.6% sales and use taxes.
Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2021-2026 are presented separately
in the FasTracks financial plan (Regional Transportation District, 2016).
The process used to prioritize investments for the 2021-2026 MTFP is built upon a legacy project
prioritization process. The process is shown in Figure 22 below.
For some time, RTD has continually improved the sophistication of its investment planning and
prioritization process. The agency has moved from a process that was primarily the product of
professional judgement to a more standardized method of evaluating capital projects. The intent of
this process is to align all investment with the AM Policy, agency objectives, and Strategic Asset
Management Plan.
An important additional element of an investment planning process is an evaluation step that has yet
to be implemented. This step will determine the degree to which projects were completed within
budget and on schedule and whether they accomplished the desired outcome. Stated outcomes will
be part of a required business case that describes the intended effect of the capital project on the
agency objectives. This will better allow RTD to continuously improve its investment prioritization
process.
One key step implemented toward the next generation process is the classification and prioritization
of capital projects based on three categories:

1. Compliance
2. Renewal
3. Enhancement
The goal of this process is asset-focused investments to prioritize sustainable management of existing
assets over expansion of the transit system. An investment planning process will serve as one of
RTD’s decision support tools.

4 List of Prioritized Investments
The output of the current capital investment decision process is a list of prioritized capital projects.
For 2021-2027, the list is separated into two project types and each project type is broken down into
three funding categories. As the agency’s AMP is focused on the renewal and replacement of existing
assets, only the prioritized renewal and replacement needs are reflected in the TAM Plan.

5 Improving Asset Management Capabilities at RTD
As a 52 year old agency, RTD has not experienced the decaying infrastructure or immediate funding
shortages that many older and larger transit systems have. Historically, RTD has had the necessary
funding in place and the professional expertise to maintain its transit assets in a state of good repair
while meeting the growing demand for service. However, as mentioned in the executive summary,
RTD’s backlog of existing assets is growing and will experience swells of assets achieving EUL such as
those from pre-FasTracks expansion activities including the original light rail alignment known as the
Metro Area Circulator (MAC) or Central Corridor, the Southwest light rail alignment, the Southeast
rail alignment that was a component of the T-REX project, and the Central Platte Valley (CPV)
extension. Presently the AMP records reflect a funding need of over $187 million for 2022, which is
largely accounts for the backlog for assets in the scope of TAM. The asset renewal and replacement
needs are expected to be $453M for the 2022-2028 planning period. The actual funding needs are
likely higher due to assets out of scope of TAM, assets that have yet to be recognized in the AMS, and
uncertainty around the infrastructure and facilities needs that result from a lack of controlled and
available asset information on which to formulate data-driven plans.
RTD’s asset management maturity improvement initiative was not initially driven by a growing set of
decaying assets, but rather by the expansion of the asset base in recent years. Beginning with the TREX project and continuing with the current FasTracks project, over the past 15 years RTD has spent
over $6.4 billion on new rail and bus rapid transit service.
The funding for the most recent expansion projects did not make provision for the long-term
maintenance and capital renewal of the new assets. Without a solid, long-term renewal plan in place,
with funding earmarked, the risk of a growing backlog of renewal projects without adequate funding
is too great. A growing backlog for any transit agency increases risk to safety, service, and future
sustainability; it feeds a pattern of expensive reactionary repair and remediation tasks.
RTD’s bold increase in the scope of its transit system requires a more rigorous management process
than in the past if it is to maximize value from the assets. To avoid the asset condition backlog that
plagues some agencies, RTD intends to take the path toward good whole-life asset management
while the assets are relatively new.
RTD is preparing an AMP that addresses future funding needs for existing assets, prioritizing renewals
over enhancements. The original cost of assets is less useful to the agency than projected future
costs. Therefore RTD’s efforts emphasize creating accurate and increasingly precise estimates of the
investments that are needed over the coming budget planning cycle.
The AMP is the combined output of individual Asset Class Strategies that focus on what will need to
be renewed, when it will need to be renewed, and the expected costs of renewals. The AMP will
determine which assets are included for renewal or replacement in the investment prioritization
process. The projected funding needs over the period 2022-2028 are illustrated in the graphs that
follow.

Strategic Asset Management Plan

RTD aims to comply fully with MAP-21 requirements for transit asset management and beyond. It
has developed an overall Strategic Asset Management Plan to summarize its strategy to improve
asset management over the next period.
From 2004, with the publication of BSI PAS-55, and then ISO 55000 in 2014, organizations have been
able to exploit a standardized good practice framework for implementing an aligned AMS.
Typically, organizations begin with a focus on asset information; particularly the inventory of all their
assets and assessing asset condition. This information supports clearer planning, because this allows
the organization to fully assess its assets and their condition. The aim is not just a clear plan to cover
all the assets, however, rather a prioritized and optimized plan based on understanding the risks to
objectives and using this to make the best use of limited resources.
RTD has invested heavily in both its asset inventory and asset condition measures over the past five
years and has begun its transition to an integrated planning process that will optimize its asset base.
The current strategy is to achieve certification to ISO 55000 and to use this as the foundation to align
the management of its assets to the agency purpose and objectives.
In 2017, RTD commissioned an external gap assessment comparing current practices to the ISO 55000
standard. The results of the gap assessment were used to create an Asset Management Roadmap for
the Agency to achieve certification to the ISO standard (AMCL, 2017). The Roadmap is included in
Appendix D.

Key Annual Activities

RTD identifies two types of asset management activity: those ongoing asset management activities
that RTD performs as part of “business as usual,” and those activities specific to achieving ISO 55000
certification. TAM activities are the subset of these targeting the specific TAM elements, and these
are shown in a third section below.

Figure 30: Asset Management Activities

“Business as Usual” Asset Management Activities
As an asset-intensive organization, RTD already performs a number of asset management activities on
a routine basis, and these will continue to improve through the TAM Plan horizon.

Packet Pg. 307

This section summarizes those “business as usual” activities, using the Institute of Asset
Management’s Conceptual Model for Asset Management (2015) to categorize into six main blocks.
This should not be interpreted to imply these ongoing activities are all necessarily well aligned or
integrated at present.

Figure 31: The Institute of Asset Management (IAM) Conceptual Model for Asset Management

The Planning department periodically conducts demand analysis for its transit
service and uses this to support long-term strategic planning for system
optimization, expansion and enhancement. At present, strategic planning for
capital renewals and maintenance volumes is not formally performed, though RTD anticipates the
need to enhance its capabilities in this area through the development of asset class strategies and an
AMP (see next section for details). Although not yet a “business as usual” activity, in undertaking the
development of this TAM Plan, RTD has started on asset management planning.
RTD’s current approach to capital investment decision-making is described in
Section 3, and this activity is performed annually to develop the MTFP.
Operations and maintenance decision-making is performed within each asset
owner group but does not currently formally consider or align with agency objectives.
Ongoing activities include capital project processes for asset acquisition,
which is split between the Capital Programs department for commuter rail
(FasTracks) and facility assets and operations for rail, bus and rail
infrastructure assets. Compliance with appropriate technical standards and legislation is ensured
within the capital projects and operations/maintenance functions, with some basic configuration
management principles applied to in-house engineering designs. Maintenance delivery occurs for
each major asset class and includes preventive and corrective maintenance, along with condition
assessments. Some asset classes have a larger focus on preventative maintenance, while others have
more emphasis on corrective maintenance and maintain assets when they fail. Most maintenance

delivery is performed by staff, with some being outsourced. Asset operations are a significant part of
RTD’s ongoing activities, and includes bus, rail, equipment and infrastructure operations, some of
which are also outsourced. Basic resource management principles are applied to ensure enough
operational resources are available as needed. RTD also performs shutdown and outage
management of its assets to enable maintenance access. As assets develop operating faults, the
agency implements its fault and incident response plans in accordance with agreed methods.
RTD uses several asset information systems to manage its Asset Information,
including Trapeze EAM for asset inventory and maintenance management,
and the Oracle Enterprise Business Suite for related financial information.
Other systems including Bentley Optram and Railroad Software have been
added to address the specific requirements of light rail maintenance of way and directly operated
commuter rail maintenance of way (commonly referred to as North Metro). However, these systems
have not been fully integrated into organization processes.
There are several basic data and information management processes in effect, including regular
reporting to the National Transit Database (NTD), and regular data quality assessment and cleansing
processes for Trapeze EAM information. The Asset Management Division employs a data science and
analytics team to support designated asset stewards with collection, management, and analysis of
non-physical data. This group also performs data assurance tasks on corporate data and performs all
FTA TAM report preparation activities.
The RTD data science and analytics team also administers the asset information maturity (AIM)
process, having designed the framework, administered assessments, and provided significant
consultative guidance in the development of AIM improvement plans and professional support in the
execution of many analytics tasks within the plans.
RTD applies procurement and supply chain management principles for its
outsourced asset management functions. These include the capital delivery
of its FasTracks program, along with some ongoing operations and
maintenance of the assets the program delivers. The operation and
maintenance of approximately half of RTD’s bus services is outsourced to two service providers, and
the maintenance of certain facility assets, such as elevators, is also outsourced.
RTD’s Finance department uses standard accounting practices to perform
asset costing and valuation, including their valuation and deprecation of
assets over time. The Asset Management Division employs an asset
performance manager. Informal stakeholder management principles are
applied for engaging and managing key external stakeholders.

ISO 55000 Activities

In addition to the ongoing asset management activities described above, RTD also has activities
defined as part of its plan towards ISO 55000, or its Asset Management Roadmap.

Transit Asset Management Plan 2021

16.D.c

Page | 48
Packet Pg. 309

The central requirement for ISO 55000 is to design, implement, maintain and continually improve an
Asset Management System based on Plan-Do-Check-Act principles. Once certification is achieved,
ongoing ISO 55000 activities will continue to occur indefinitely to maintain and continually improve
the AMS, while many of the ISO 55000 practices will transition to become “business as usual.”
The roadmap and associated detailed activities are held in the ISO 55000 Gap Assessment and
roadmap report, and a summary is provided below:
5.2.2.1 Design an Asset Management Organization
This includes the implementation of an ISO 55000 compliant AMS: the framework to define and
manage the key elements, including a policy, strategy and risk management framework, with clearly
defined roles and responsibilities.
5.2.2.2 Asset Management Planning
This includes the development of asset class strategies and an AMP as key elements of an investment
planning process.
5.2.2.3 Improve Rigor and Control
This implements improved control over core asset delivery and financial activities, and includes a
project management office for capital projects with a gated process for staged release of funding.
5.2.2.4 Assurance and Performance
The performance management framework is of key importance, as is well as an improved approach
to assessing the root cause of asset failures.
5.2.2.5 Enhance Asset Information
This is centered on the development and implementation of an asset information framework,
including definition of RTD’s information requirements and the strategies employed for meeting
them, along with clear governance for asset information.
5.2.2.6 Learning and Communication
This is to support the embedding of asset management awareness, culture and competencies, and
includes a training needs analysis and a program of appropriate asset management training, as well
as communication to raise awareness of Asset Management throughout the organization, and the
development of an appropriate Asset Management culture.
5.2.2.7 Enabling Activities
This is to support the delivery of the ISO 55000 Roadmap. They include:
•
•
•
•
•

Establishing and empowering an implementation team
Adopting a project management office (PMO) approach to the roadmap
Establishing governance and controls of the roadmap
Monitoring and reviewing progress, with adjustments made as necessary

Resourcing Strategy

This section describes the resourcing strategy and plans to support the annual activities described
above.
Staff resources from across the agency are involved in RTD’s asset management activities, including
the General Manager/CEO, the Senior Leadership Team, the Asset Management Division, and the
Operations, Capital Programs, Finance, Administration, Communications, Planning, and General
Counsel departments.

Business as Usual Asset Management activities

The resourcing strategy for the “business as usual” annual asset management activities will continue
with the current strategy, i.e. resourcing the activities through the agency departments that currently
perform or are involved in them.

Packet Pg. 311

As ISO 55000 and TAM activities become “business as usual” over time, it is anticipated that changes
to the current resources may arise.

ISO 55000 Strategy Activities

ISO 55000 requires the establishment of a functioning, effective, sufficiently resourced management
system for assets. The resourcing strategy is to establish clear accountability and responsibility for
the Asset Management System, with the authority to direct and allocate resources being granted to
the accountable group. The diagram below illustrates the accountability structure and other
contributors.

Figure 32: ISO 55000 Contributing Resource Groups

In late 2011, RTD assigned two employees the task of building an Asset Management Division (AMD).
The Division would eventually be responsible for improving the management of assets and building
an agency-wide AMS.
To ensure the most accurate, non-biased information possible, the Senior Leadership Team
determined the AMD should be independent of the asset delivery functions.
According to Chris Lloyd, asset management leadership and culture expert: “Strategic Asset
Management calls for risk-based decision making, cross-functional working, and long-term thinking. It
needs clarity on competence requirements and accountability and honesty about performance”
(Johnson and Lloyd, 2012).
The AMD was placed alongside the Safety Division, with both reporting to the Chief Safety Officer
(CSO) due to the nexus between asset condition and safety and their management system
frameworks. More details are in Appendix F.
The AMD staff possess a wealth of asset management expertise, as a number of its employees
transferred from other areas of the agency, bringing with them significant knowledge of agency
operations, experience in maintenance of many asset classes, physical asset business analysis, and/or

data science. External hires provided additional subject matter expertise, knowledge, skills, and
abilities.

TAM Activities

The resourcing strategy for the TAM activities is not only to define an accountable executive for all
TAM requirements but to assign TAM responsibilities to the AMD. Supporting resources from other
RTD departments will be utilized and consulted or informed on an as-needed basis. Details of both
the accountable executive and the AMD are in Appendix F.

6 Evaluation Plan
6.1

TAM Plan Evaluation

The TAM Plan will be evaluated on degree of compliance when RTD receives each triennial audit.
However, the plan is intended to do more than meet compliance. It is a statement of intentions and
commitment to deliver the culture, policy, and procedural changes necessary for the improved
efficacy and efficiency of transit agencies that is implied in the regulations.
This TAM Plan provides a baseline for evaluating future TAM Plans produced by the agency. RTD
intends to regularly review its asset management maturity, setting maturity targets in its Strategic
Asset Management Plan. This document will also serve as a basis of comparison to peer agencies,
allowing RTD to learn from other TAM Plans to identify where improvements can be made.
RTD will annually evaluate its performance against the previous cycle’s TAM Plan improvement goals
and agency objectives with documentation and explanation of progress (Regional Transportation
District, 2021). The RTD agency objectives are in Appendix G.

6.2

ISO 55000 Performance Evaluation and Improvement

6.3

ISO 55000 Certification Evaluation

RTD has committed to achieving certification to the asset management standard ISO 55000. This
requires the implementation of a management system for assets, based on Plan-Do-Check-Act
principles with specific elements for performance evaluation and improvement. These are still in
development in RTD and will be described in a future update.
RTD intends to evaluate the degree to which it is meeting the requirements for ISO 55000, and
therefore its readiness for an ISO 55001 certification audit, through the following measures:
1. ISO spot checks – regular detailed reviews of specific elements of the emerging Asset
Management System to identify risks to certification, and implement corrective measures
2. ISO health check – mid-point review of the entire RTD Asset Management System against the
requirements of ISO 55000
3. ISO mock audit – prior to the ISO audit, RTD intends to conduct a “mock audit” to evaluate its
readiness for an actual ISO audit. Results from the mock audit will be used to determine the
appropriate time for the actual audit, along with any gaps that still exist

Accountable Executive – A single, identifiable person who has ultimate responsibility for
carrying out the safety management system of a public transportation agency; responsibility
for carrying out transit asset management practices; and control or direction over the human
and capital resources needed to develop and maintain both the agency's public
transportation agency safety plan, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5329(d), and the agency's
transit asset management plan in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5326.
Asset Information Maturity (AIM) – This consists of a framework, an assessment, AIM plans,
and updates to the Asset Management Accountability Team on progress towards stated
objectives in plans. The framework that includes a six-stage model indicating relative maturity
that are mutually exclusive based on the availability of information, the quality of data in its
utility for decision-making/planning, the presence or absence of a documented
plan/procedure for the development and utilization of data suitable for decisionmaking/planning, whether or not documented plans/procedures are followed and monitored
for adherence, and whether a ‘plan-do-check-act’ cycle of continuous improvement is applied
to tune information and plan quality to achieve organization objectives. The inventory
consists of 24 items based on ISO 55000 clauses 7.5 and 7.6 regarding information and its
control. The plans are signed documents available on the RTD intranet.
Backlog – State of Good Repair backlog is representative of the reinvestment cost to replace
any transit assets whose condition is below the midpoint on TERM’s 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent)
scale, or 2.5.
Base System – Base System refers to RTD’s assets not included in the FasTracks system. The
base system is supported in part by a 0.6% sales and use tax. funded by a 0.6% sales tax prior
to the passage of the FasTracks ballot initiative. Base System funding and FasTracks funding
are tracked separately.
Capital Responsibility – Transit agencies are required to report condition assessments for
assets that they own or jointly own with another entity, that they are responsible for
replacing, overhauling, refurbishing, or conducting major repairs on that asset, or for which
the cost of those activities are itemized as a capital line item in the agency's budget.
CDOT – Colorado Department of Transportation.
Consist – A set of railroad vehicles forming a complete train.
Contracted Service – A contract for services is a formal, legally binding agreement between
RTD and a private company to provide service delivery.
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) – Denver’s metropolitan planning
organization (MPO). https://drcog.org/
Direct operated and purchased services – Direct operated services are those services
provided by RTD staff using RTD assets. Purchased Services are those operated under
contract on behalf of RTD using outside staffing. See also Contracted Service.
Estimated Useful Life (EUL) – The Estimated Useful Life indicates the expected duration in
years that the asset will remain in service under normal operating conditions and
maintenance. This metric is agency-defined as opposed to FTA established Useful Life
Benchmarks. At the end of useful life of the asset, major renewal or replacement is expected.

FasTracks – FasTracks is a ballot initiative that levied an additional 0.4% sales tax for
expansion of the RTD system. FasTracks introduced commuter rail service as well as a Public
Private Partnership (P3) to the system.
ISO 55000 – The international standard covering management of assets of any kind. Prior to
the establishment of this standard, a Publicly Available Specification (BSI PAS-55) was
published by the British Standards Institution in 2004 for physical assets. The ISO 55000
series of Asset Management standards was formalized in 2014 and is composed of three
parts:
o ISO 55000:2014 Asset management – Overview, Principles and Terminology
o ISO 55001:2014 Asset management – Management Systems – Requirements
o ISO 55002:2014 Guidelines for the Application of ISO 55001
MAP-21 – MAP-21, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (P.L. 112-141) was
signed into law by President Obama on July 6, 2012.
Mid-Term Financial Plan or MTFP – A portion of RTD’s total budget not already committed to
specific capital projects and not apportioned to ongoing operations and maintenance that is
evaluated and prioritized through a process described in Section 3 of this document.
National Transit Database – A federal reporting program for transit agencies receiving
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) funding, which serves as a primary repository for all
transit-related data and statistics in the United States. The performance data from the NTD is
used to allocate FTA funding and to report on public transit performance to Congress and
researchers.
Senior Leadership Team (SLT) – The group of Chiefs and Assistant General Managers that
report to the General Manager and CEO. This group is equivalent to the C-Suite in a private
organization.
State of Good Repair – “The condition in which a capital asset is able to operate at a full level
of performance.” (Transit Asset Management; National Transit Database, 2016)
TERM – Transit Economic Requirements model is a tool used by the FTA along with a numeric
code that represents the categorization of assets, as indicated in the TERM-Lite model.
Useful Life Benchmark (ULB) – The Useful Life Benchmark indicates the expected duration in
years that the asset will remain in service under normal operating conditions and
maintenance. This metric is established by the FTA as opposed to the agency-defined
Estimated Useful Life metric. At the end of useful life of the asset, major renewal or
replacement is expected.

Appendix B: SGR Master Condition Rating Definitions for RTD
RTD follows the FTA guidance on condition ratings. This rating is based on how close an asset or
component is to replacement or major overhaul. Scores will not have a greater granularity than a half
point.
An asset is in a State of Good Repair if the score is greater than (2.5). Refer to individual asset group
Inspection Standards Documents for confidence in reliability and specific examples.

Confidence in Reliability = Remaining Useful Life

5.0) New or like new, 95% to 100% confidence in reliability; no visible defects, no damage, cosmetically looks
new. An asset is only new once, after rebuild some old parts are not new and therefore the highest score after
rebuild is (4.5).
4.5) The inspector is 90% to <95% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
4.0) The inspector is 80% to <90% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Shows minimal signs of
wear, no major defects, and some minor defects with only minimal signs of deterioration.
Cosmetic defects/minor wear.
3.5) The inspector is 70% to <80% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
3.0) The inspector is 60% to <70% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Some moderately defective
or deteriorated components; expected maintenance needs. Cosmetically ‘fair’ but all devices are functioning as
designed.

Small repairs or minor refurbishment.

2.5) The inspector is 50% to <60% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
2.0) The inspector is 40% to <50% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Asset near overhaul or
retirement, but in serviceable condition. Asset has increasing number of defects or deteriorated component(s).

Significant or multiple repairs needed.

1.5) The inspector is 30% to <40% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
1.0) The inspector is less than 30% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Asset is in need of major
repair or refurbishment, multiple minor defects or major defects. Evidence of corrosion may be apparent; major
or numerous minor areas of damage or structural issues.
Safety concern, critical damage, close to or time for overhaul or replacement .

Appendix D: TAM Resources
It is anticipated the following specific resources will be required for TAM activities for the duration of
the plan horizon:
•

•

•

Staff resources
o One accountable executive
o Fourteen FTEs from the Asset Management Division, who will split their time
between TAM and ISO 55000 implementation
o FTE requirements for other RTD resources necessary for TAM activities are not
defined in this generation of the TAM Plan
Technology resources: the technologies are used to support asset management across the
agency. RTD’s aim is to use the tools it already owns, rather than invest in new ones at this
time.
o Hardware and software necessary to support:
▪ Multiple source software systems – e.g. Trapeze EAM, Oracle EBS
▪ Data warehouse – provides aggregation and integration of data
▪ Analysis and reporting tools – Power BI, Access, Excel, SPSS and others
Financial resources
o Financial resources necessary to support asset management ‘business as usual’
activities, TAM and ISO implementation. Beyond these, RTD has not defined any
requirement for further resources for this generation of the TAM Plan.

Appendix E: Asset Management Roles and Responsibilities
1. Accountable Executive – a single position with ultimate accountability for Asset Management
and the Asset Management System within RTD.
2. Asset Management Accountability Team (AMAT) – this group has formal accountability
delegated from the Accountable Executive for the delivery, embedding, review and continual
improvement of the Asset Management System. The group is comprised of the Chief
Financial Officer, Chief Operations Officer, Chief Administration Officer, Assistant General
Manager for Capital Programs, Assistant General Manager for Asset Management, Security
and Safety, and Senior Manager of the Asset Management Division.
3. Asset Management Division – the AMD is responsible for the design, delivery, embedding,
review and continual improvement of the Asset Management System’s products, processes
and information, as well as preparing for and undertaking the ISO 55000 certification audit.
It is anticipated that the Asset Management Division will have the following roles and
responsibilities for ISO 55000 during the plan horizon is described in figure 33. The Asset
Management Senior Manager reports to the Chief Safety Officer, which is the Assistant
General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management.
4. Other RTD resources – as needed, other RTD resources will be utilized, consulted or informed
regarding the Asset Management System. This could include operations, maintenance,
finance, human resources, communications, IT, legal and procurement staff. The Asset
Management Accountability Team will allocate these resources directly when within their
reporting line or via a request to other members of the Senior Leadership Team when they
are not.
5. External resources – RTD will also utilize external expertise to develop the internal asset
management competencies of both the Asset Management Division and other RTD resources
involved with the Asset Management System. The alternative to this is to be continually
reliant on an external entity to supply expertise indefinitely. Selecting both an established
asset management framework and interactions with consultants, RTD intends to cultivate an
Asset Management Division capable of acting as an internal consulting service to the agency.
The intention is to ‘own the process, not the product’ as it relates to functions and
competencies that will become annual activities for the AMD. Additional external resources
will also be utilized to deliver aspects of the Asset Management System, specifically the
operations and maintenance of approximately half of the bus fleet.

Light Rail System Description

The RTD light rail system was designed as the fi rst piece of a planned regional rapid transit system. In 1989, the Colorado
Supreme Court declared that the Denver metro area Regional Transportation District was eligible to collect a use tax that
enabled the District to accumulate funding of $67 million for construction of a rail system.
The project was approved by DRCOG (Denver Regional Council of Governments) in 1991. Construction on the initial 5.3-mile
rail system and a functional operations facility began without federal funding or an increase in local taxes in October 1992.
Safety Certifi cation and Construction of the light rail system was completed by the end of September 1994, and the system
opened for revenue service with 11 light rail vehicles on October 7, 1994. Additional lines, facilities, and vehicles were added
in subsequent years with voter support, as detailed below.

I 5.1.1

Scope and Service

Regular service of the light rail system is regulated by timetables. Light rail transit currently carries roughly 40,000
customers daily. Trains operate as one-, two-, three-, or four-car consists. Revenue service is generally available 21 hours
per day.
The Regional Transportation District’s objective is to operate the light rail transit system safely, reliably, and effi ciently and
to integrate light rail operation with bus service for the greatest convenience to the public. This is the means by which the
integration of transportation services could assist the region in meeting clean air standards, alleviating traffi c congestion,
and improving the overall quality of life of the area.
Light rail service operates on the existing 5.3-mile Central Corridor, the 8.7-mile Southwest Corridor, the 1.8-mile Central
Platte Valley Spur, the 19-mile Southeast Corridor, the 12.1-mile West Rail Corridor, the 10.5-mile I-225 Corridor, and the 1.6mile Southeast Rail Extension (SERE). The system has six operating lines: D, E, H, L, W, and R.

I 5.1.2

Organizational Structure

The light rail transit safety specialist’s offi ce is located at the Elati Light Rail Operations and Maintenance center. Thus, the
lines of communication between safety and light rail operations are effective . Key positions with light rail operations are:
•

Assistant General Manager, Rail

•

Deputy Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations

•

Senior Manager, Rail Operations, Planning & Systems

•

Business Program Manager

•

General Superintendent of Light Rail Transportation

Light Rail Corridors

Central Corridor
Passenger service on the Central Corridor Light Rail system began October 7, 1994. The system is operated by Denver’s
Regional Transportation District as part of a fully integrated mass transit system, which includes local bus routes, express
bus routes, regional bus routes, shuttle bus routes, and demand-response service for disabled customers.
The Central Corridor comprises 5.3 miles of trackway with 13 stations, including three ark-n-rRde locations. The Central
Corridor operates at grade level except for one fly-over structure for grade separation at Kalamath and Santa Fe. An initial
fleet of 11 light rail vehicles (LRVs) were procured for the operation of the Central Corridor. Shortly after opening for service,
six additional LRVs were ordered.
The Central Corridor begins at I-25 and Broadway on the southwest end and terminates at 30th Avenue and Downing
Street. The corridor provides direct connections between the I-25 and Broadway Station transfer facility, Broadway
Marketplace, Auraria Campus, Colorado Convention Center, and the 16th Street Mall (Market Street, Civic Center, and Union
Station transit stations), Five Points, and many major hotels and businesses in between.
Major attractions within a short walking distance of the Central Corridor stations or the 16th Street Mall shuttles include the
Denver Center for the Performing Arts complex, federal courthouse, 17th Street Financial District, U.S. Mint, Tabor Center,
State Capitol, Denver Art Museum, Denver Public Library, History Colorado Center, Larimer Square, and Coors Field.
Light rail vehicles are operated manually. Automatic block wayside signals, traffic signals, radio communication, operational
procedures, and train orders govern operators regarding all vehicle movement. Appropriate street traffic signals, speed limit
signage, and wayside signals assist the operator in selecting proper movement sequence and speeds. City operations are
by line of sight. All city street crossings are governed by coordinating adjacent street intersection traffic signals, while the
at-grade crossings at 13th Avenue and at Bayaud are governed by gates with flashers and warning bells. The crossings at
13th Avenue and at Bayaud are jointly used and maintained by Union Pacific Railroad and RTD.
Station platforms are unattended and utilize automated fare equipment for ticket sales and ticket validation. Transit Security
Officers (TSO) monitor the proof of payment honor system. Roving rail supervisors, contracted security officers, and local
police departments provide platform security.
A 2.5-acre yard and the Light Rail Mariposa Facility is located adjacent to the Southern Pacific Railroad switching yard near
6th Avenue at 655 Mariposa Street. Powered switches on the double track mainline provide access to and from yard leads
at either end of the storage yard, allowing access from ladder tracks into the shop. The Light Rail Mariposa Facility includes
a yard for vehicle storage and a maintenance facility for vehicle maintenance and system support maintenance. Central
Control is located on the second floor of the facility and is the operational governing authority for all mainline vehicle
movement. Central Control personnel (controller/supervisors) direct, control, and monitor revenue-service operations
using radio, telephone, and public address communications. Mainline operations are controlled by a schedule timetable
and directed by Central Control in accordance with established operating schedules, rules, and procedures. Controllers
implement all corrective actions necessary to maintain service schedules and to minimize adverse impacts of equipment
failures, emergency situations, or weather-related problems. In addition, some unit repair, facility maintenance, and nonrevenue maintenance occurs at RTD’s District Shops location.
The corridor begins on the south end with I-25 and Broadway Station. I-25 and Broadway station provides a major bus and
light rail transfer point and is a junction for the Southwest, Southeast and Central corridors. From Broadway proceeding
north a short distance is Alameda Station. After leaving Alameda Station, trains pass through Bayaud crossing and then
ascend the Santa Fe/Kalamath flyover structure, returning to grade as the alignment passes the Mariposa facility before
entering 10th and Osage Station. From 10th and Osage, trains pass through the 13th Avenue crossing and then either travel
downtown (Central Corridor) or to the Central Platte Valley (CPV) Corridor. Continuing northeast on the Central Corridor
is Colfax at Auraria Station, which allows direct access to the Auraria Campus via a plaza and a bus transfer point. After
leaving Colfax at Auraria Station, the double track alignment proceeds across Kalamath Street and Speer Boulevard,
crossing a bridge structure over Cherry Creek along Stout Street to Convention Center Station near 14th and Stout streets.

At 14th Street, the inbound track turns east and then north to travel along California Street. The outbound track runs along
Stout Street between 14th and 19th streets. Two passenger stations are located on Stout, one at 16th Street and one at
18th Street. The inbound track along California Street travels in an automobile traffic contra-flow direction from 14th to 19th
streets, servicing the 16th Street and California passenger station located on the 16th Street Mall, then continuing on the
single track northeast bound to the next passenger station, at 18th Street on California.
The alignment turns southeast on 19th Street, where it joins the track to Welton Street and where the double track travels
east on Welton Street to the 20th Street and Welton Station, located between 19th and 20th streets on Welton. The double
track alignment continues as it crosses over to the south side of Welton near 20th Street to 24th Street. Between 24th
and 25th streets, the double track configuration transitions into single track. The single-track alignment is retained as it
continues northeast on Welton and proceeds to the 25th Street and Welton Station, located near 26th Street. Traveling
northeast along the alignment, the trackway approaches the 27th Street mini station located between 27th and 28th
streets, then transitions back into a double track configuration as it enters the 30th Aand Downing northern terminus
station.

Southwest Corridor
The Southwest Corridor opened for revenue service in July 2000. It is an 8.7-mile extension of the Central Corridor light
rail system from I-25 and Broadway in Denver to the end-of-line station at Mineral Avenue and Santa Fe Drive in Littleton. It
includes five light rail stations: Evans, Englewood, Oxford•City of Sheridan, Littleton•Downtown, and Littleton•Mineral. Each
station location has an associated Park-n-Ride, with the exception of Oxford.
The Southwest Corridor is a double track alignment operating in high-speed territory at a maximum speed of 55 mph. The
corridor consists of mixed-use operations including three freight railroad mainline tracks, two light rail tracks, and Santa
Fe Drive on the west side of the corridor. The entire corridor is grade-separated with the exception of a pedestrian-freight
spur crossing at the Evans station. Traditional active grade crossing equipment and signals including warning bells, lights,
and gates control this crossing. The light rail tracks parallel the freight mainline tracks throughout the corridor. To enhance
patron use, the light rail corridor resides on the east side of the freight rail corridor from I-25 and Broadway to Tufts Avenue,
and on the west side of the freight corridor from Tufts Avenue to Mineral Avenue. Two flyover structures accommodate
grade separation between freight railroad and light rail tracks: one near Tufts Avenue, where the east/west transition
occurs; and one near Iowa, where the light rail tracks cross the Iowa freight spur track.
Leaving the I-25 and Broadway station southbound, the tracks cross over Mississippi Avenue on a bridge and continue
south to cross over Iowa Ave on another bridge. Shortly after crossing Iowa Avenue, the alignment rises on the Iowa flyover
structure to pass over a freight rail spur track coming from the mainline on the west side of the light rail tracks. Once the
trackway returns to grade, the tracks pass under Evans Avenue and enter the Evans station. Continuing south from Evans
station, the mainline right of way passes the Elati Operations Facility and yard before crossing a bridge over Dartmouth
Avenue and into Englewood Station. Trains leave Englewood Station southbound and cross the bridge over Hampden
Avenue and continue to Oxford Station. From Oxford Station south, the alignment passes over Oxford Avenue and then
climbs the Tufts flyover structure that transitions light rail from the east side of the freight track mainline to the west side.
Descending off the flyover, the alignment passes over Belleview Avenue on a bridge before entering a below grade cut and
Littleton•Downtown Station. Continuing south from the station, the track climbs from the cut to grade and continues to the
end-of-line Littleton•Mineral Station.
An additional 14 light rail vehicles were added to the existing fleet to accommodate the extension. The light rail vehicles
are Siemens Duewag SD100 and SD160 models, the same used for the Central Corridor. The Mariposa maintenance facility
was expanded to accommodate the fleet size increase. All operational characteristics for the Southwest Corridor are similar
to the existing operational characteristics of the Central Corridor. Since service origination of the Southwest Corridor, 18
additional SD 100s have been placed into revenue service.

16.D.c

Central Platte Valley
The Central Platte Valley (CPV) corridor is approximately 1.8 miles in length, linking the existing Central Corridor light rail
Packet Pg. 333

line at Colfax Avenue to Denver Union Station. This is a double track alignment along the entire corridor, including the CPV
junction.
The CPV corridor begins at approximately Colfax Avenue and Rio Court (the location where the existing Central Corridor
light rail lines curves to the east under the Colfax Avenue viaduct). The alignment generally follows Curtis Street from Colfax
Avenue to west of 5th Street, on the western edge of the Auraria Campus. At this point, the alignment turns north and
parallels 5th Street and enters Auraria West Station. From there, the alignment crosses Walnut Street and enters Empower
Field at Mile High Station. From there the alignment parallels the Consolidated Mainline (freight), to the Ball Arena•Elitch
Gardens Station, then continues north and ends at Denver Union Station. Stations are located at the new administration
building of the Auraria Campus (Auraria West); near the existing “Sports Walk” that serves Empower Field at Mile High
Station near the stadium; at the pedestrian bridge serving Ball Arena and Elitch Gardens; and Denver Union Station.
The alignment has two at-grade crossings: 5th Street and Walnut Street, which include active warning devices for control
and safety considerations to mitigate impacts to traffic and pedestrians in these areas.
During major events, such as professional sports games and concerts at Ball Arena, Coors Field and Empower Field at Mile
High, special service will be provided with trains running as frequently as every four to five minutes between the event
venue and the Southwest and Southeast Corridors. Some of these special event trains may terminate at the I- 25/Broadway
station while other will continue to the Littleton•Mineral and RidgeGate Parkway end-of-line stations.

Southeast Corridor
The Southeast Corridor began revenue service in November 2006. It consists of 21 miles of double-tracked light rail
transit, beginning at the existing Broadway station and ending at RidgeGate Parkway Station. This includes an alignment
along I-225 in the median, from I-25 to Nine Mile Station at Parker Road. There are 16 stations: Louisiana•Pearl; University;
Colorado; Yale; Southmoor; Belleview; Orchard; Arapahoe at Village Center; Dry Creek; County Line; Lincoln; Sky Ridge;
Lone Tree City Center; RidgeGate Parkway; Dayton; and Nine Mile. All facilities, including RTD trains, stations, pedestrian
and bicycle facilities, and other design elements, are in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
With the Southeast Corridor expansion, the Elati Light Rail Operations facility and yard were constructed at 2701 S. Elati
St. This was a necessity to accommodate the more than doubling of light rail vehicles and associated support needs that
accompanied the system expansion. North and south yard leads were cut into the existing Southwest corridor mainline
track just north of Dartmouth on the south and a short distance south of Evans station on the north. In January of 2006, the
Elati facility became the new operations center and the Mariposa facility became a heavy maintenance and repair shop,
while still maintaining the Control Center on the second floor.
The Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) opened for revenue service in May 2019. This extended double track rail service 1.6
miles from the former end-of-line station at Lincoln to the new end-of-line station at RidgeGate Parkway. Two additional
stations, Sky Ridge and Lone Tree City Center, are located on the extension.

Broadway to Colorado
The Southeast Corridor alignment begins with a wye connection south of the existing Broadway station, allowing vehicles
from the Southeast Corridor to access both the Southwest Corridor and existing light rail line to central downtown.
Following the wye tracks, the alignment rises above grade to pass over Broadway on an aerial structure. After crossing
Broadway, the alignment turns to the south along the southbound I-25 on-ramp and drops down to match the grade of I-25
and into Louisiana•Pearl station. This allows the LRT alignment to pass under the cross streets, maintaining a 17-foot vertical
clearance above the top of rail. Through the Narrows (Broadway to University), the alignment parallels I-25 between I-25’s
collector distributor road and Buchtel Boulevard. The tracks generally pass behind the abutment of the highway bridges
through a separate light rail bridge structure and enter University Station.

Colorado to Evans
At Colorado, the alignment follows the Colorado Boulevard off-ramp and travels under Colorado Boulevard in a short tunnel
section. After passing under Colorado, the alignment remains below grade in an open trench section, enters Colorado
Station and again parallels I-25. After leaving the station, it passes under Evans in a tunnel section.

Evans to Union
After passing under Evans, the alignment rises to return to the highway grade, running adjacent to the highway into Yale
Station. At Yale Avenue, the alignment runs along the edge of the Yale ramps and passes over Yale on an aerial structure.
South of Yale, the alignment follows along the west side of I-25 to Hampden Avenue. At Hampden, the alignment enters a
very short tunnel section under Hampden, returns to the I-25 grade on the south side of Hampden, and enters Southmoor
Station.
Continuing south, the alignment passes under Quincy and then travels along the western edge of the I-25/I-225 freeway
interchange. Special track work at this location allows for a wye connection to the light rail alignment located along I-225.
These connecting tracks are primarily at-grade and pass below the I-25/I-225 interchange.

Union to Arapahoe Road
Proceeding south from the I-225 wye connection, the alignment passes under Union Avenue along the west edge of I-25.
After passing under Union Avenue, the alignment continues south into Belleview Station. After leaving the station, it travels
along the ramps and over Belleview on an aerial structure. Continuing south from Belleview, the alignment runs adjacent to
I-25 to Orchard Station, where it again shifts out along the ramps and then over Orchard Road on an aerial structure. South
of Orchard, the alignment returns to the west edge of the highway into Arapahoe at Village Center Station. From the station
continuing south, the alignment rises to pass over the three west side ramps and Arapahoe Road on a long aerial structure.

Arapahoe Road to RidgeGate Parkway
South of Arapahoe Road, the alignment continues adjacent to the I-25 shoulder to Dry Creek Station. From Dry Creek
Station, the alignment travels adjacent to the ramps and over Dry Creek on an aerial structure. After passing Dry Creek,
the alignment returns to the I-25 shoulder to County Line Road, where it rises up to pass over two ramps and County Line
Road on an aerial structure. After passing County Line Road and the ramp in the southwest quadrant of the interchange, the
alignment runs along the west edge of I-25 into County Line Station. South of the station, the alignment enters the C-470/
E470 interchange.
Through the C-470/E470 interchange, the alignment travels under the ramps in short tunnels and over C-470, around the
western side of the interchange ramps and then adjacent to I-25, where it continues south into Lincoln Station. After leaving
Lincoln Station, the alignment continues south and passes over Lincoln Avenue on an aerial structure and then turns east
into Sky Ridge Station. The lone at grade crossing on the Southeast Corridor, Trainstation Circle crossing, is at the south
end of Sky Ridge Station. The alignment then crosses over I-25 on an aerial structure and turns south into Lone Tree City
Center Station. From the station, it continues over RidgeGate Parkway on an aerial structure and into the end-of line-station.

I-225 from I-25 to Parker Road
The alignment along I-225 begins at the I-25/I-225 interchange, where it connects to the I-25 alignment through a wye
connection, allowing light rail vehicles to connect to both the northbound and southbound lines on the I-25 alignment. After
the wye connection, the alignment travels in the I-225 median at the highway grade. The alignment continues in the I-225
median into Dayton Station. From Dayton Station, the alignment continues east into Nine Mile Station at Parker Road.

16.D.c

The corridor operates with similar characteristics as existing corridors, including traction power substations and signal
systems. A SCADA system is included in the Southeast Corridor project and is retrofitted into the existing system.
Additionally, an automatic trip stop system was added to stop trains if they bypass a red signal.
Packet Pg. 335

West Corridor
The West Rail Line is a 12.1-mile light rail transit corridor that began revenue service in April 2013, extending from Denver
Union Station to the Jefferson County Government Center. The alignment runs through Denver, Lakewood, and Golden.
The West Rail Line has 12 stations: Auraria West, Decatur•Federal, Knox, Perry, Sheridan, Lamar, Lakewood•Wadsworth,
Garrison, Oak, Federal Center, Red Rocks College, and Jefferson County Government Center•Golden.
The alignment is double track from Denver Union Station to Federal Center Station and is single track from Federal Center
Station to the Jefferson County Government Center•Golden Station. Total travel time from Denver Union Stationto Jefferson
County Government Center•Golden is 35 minutes. The corridor operates similarly to existing RTD light rail corridors.
Starting from Denver Union Station, the alignment travels to the Ball Arena•Elitch Gardens Station, Empower Field at Mile
High Station, and Auraria West Station.
Departing from the Auraria West Station, the alignment passes through the Central Corridor and CPV junction and curves
south under Colfax Avenue, where it crosses over the Consolidated Main Line (CML) on an aerial structure. The alignment
turns to the west on this structure before returning to grade and passing under I-25. From the I-25 viaduct, it continues west
through the Zuni Street at grade crossing and over the South Platte River on a bridge structure. After it crosses the river, it
passes through the Decatur Street at grade crossing and into Decatur•Federal Station.
From Decatur•Federal Station, the train continues west on the alignment under the Federal Bridge, following Lakewood
Gulch through the Knox Court crossing into Knox Station. Leaving Knox Station, the alignment curves south towards 10th
Avenue, following Dry Gulch and continuing west to the Perry Street crossing and Perry Station. The alignment continues
west through a gated crossing for the bike path at Wolff Street and into Sheridan Station under Sheridan Boulevard.
Departing Sheridan Station, the alignment curves north to run alongside 13th Avenue and west through Harlan crossing into
Lamar Station. Traveling west through the Lamar, Pierce, and Teller crossings, the track then ascends an aerial structure into
the next station, Lakewood•Wadsworth. Leaving Wadsworth station and descending the bridge, the alignment continues
west through Carr Street and Estes Street crossings and into Garrison Station.
Continuing west, the alignment passes through Garrison Street and Independence Street crossings, passes over the Kipling
Street Bridge, then proceeds through the Oak Street crossing into Oak Station.
From Oak Station, the alignment curves south at Quail Street and Collins Avenue crossings and follows Simms Street to the
8th Avenue crossing before passing over 6th Avenue on the 6th Avenue Bridge. It then continues south through the North
Avenue crossing and turns west into Federal Center Station. Some trains turn back here to return to Denver Union Station,
utilizing the pocket track, while others continue to the Jefferson County Government Center•Golden Station.
Departing Federal Center Station and continuing to Jefferson County Government Center•Golden Station, the alignment
curves north and becomes single track prior to passing through the 4th Avenue crossing. The alignment continues to 6th
Avenue, turns west and proceeds through the Union Boulevard tunnel, and continues west along the south side of 6th
Avenue into the Red Rocks College Station, where it splits into double track.
Departing Red Rocks College Station, the alignment becomes single track again and continues west along 6th Avenue. The
alignment curves north and then back west as it crosses the Indiana Street Bridge flyover to the north side of 6th Avenue,
where the alignment continues. It goes through the tunnel under I-70, passes over Colfax on an aerial structure, then
proceeds through the Ulysses Street and Earl Johnson Road crossings before entering one of three tracks at the end-of-line

I-225 Rail Corridor
The I-225 project added 10.5 miles to the light rail system within the city of Aurora, providing key regional connections to
the East and Southeast rail lines. Construction on the full line began in 2013. This light rail line opened for service to the
public in February 2017 as the R Line, and it features eight stations: , Florida, Iliff, Aurora Metro Center, 2nd Ave•Abilene,
13th Ave, Colfax, Fitzsimons, and Peoria. This corridor extends light rail service north from Nine Mile Station to Peoria
Packet Pg. 336

Station, where customers can connect to commuter rail to access Denver International Airport.

I 5.1.4

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)

The RTD Light Rail System includes a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The SCADA system
provides two types of general functions: control over certain system elements from the Central Control Center, and system
monitoring and status information to the Central Control Center. The SCADA system allows light rail controllers certain
capabilities such as remote control to power down sections of the alignment and control over power track switches. It also
provides information to light rail controllers on the status of certain elements of the light rail system and train information.
SCADA information includes train locations, switch alignments, power status, signal status, and a variety of additional
system information.

I 5.1.5

Light Rail Vehicles

The RTD light rail vehicle fleet consists of two models from Siemens: the SD 100 and the SD 160. The vehicles are very
similar and have two main differences. The SD 160 has an AC propulsion system and sliding plug doors, whereas the
SD 100 has a DC propulsion system and bifold doors. An initial fleet of 11 light rail vehicles (LRVs) was procured for the
operation of the Central Corridor. Shortly after opening for service, six additional LRVs were ordered. As ridership grew, so
did the system beyond the Central Corridor, triggering orders of new LRVs. The SD 100 model is the original RTD vehicle,
and there are 49 of these vehicles in the fleet. The SD 160 was originally ordered for the Southeast Corridor extension: 68
were delivered, with an additional 55 vehicles ordered for FasTracks, the first of which arrived in August 2009. An additional
29 SD 160 vehicles were ordered in July 2018. RTD now has a total fleet of 201 vehicles. The LRVs are 6-axle, singlearticulated, double-ended, bidirectional, high-floor vehicles. They are approximately 80 feet in length, 8 feet and 9 inches
in width, and 13 feet high, and they operate on a standard railroad track gauge of 4 feet and 8 ½ inches. They are powered
by 750 volts of direct current from an overhead wire and capable of speeds up to 55 mph. Each vehicle can seat 48 to
56 passengers and accommodate up to 61 additional standing passengers at normal loads. Additional standees may be
accommodated at a crush load capacity. Exhibits shows the vehicle layout and critical exterior measurements to maximize
the level of comfort with which customers are afforded for their trip. In addition, light rail vehicles are equipped with HVAC
and good lighting configuration.

I 5.1.6

Operations

The Operations Control Center, which underwent a major remodel to accommodate the system expansion and SCADA,
governs the operation, control, and dispatch of light rail vehicles. Control maintains contact with the train operators by
means of a radio located in each light rail vehicle cab. Light rail operators also carry a portable radio to be used in case they
have to leave the cab or there is a radio failure. Controllers/supervisors rove throughout the system during operations. Their
role is to provide support and coordination between Central Control and light rail vehicle operators during an emergency
or upset in the system that may require a manual block operation, bus bridge, evacuation, or accident response and
investigation.
Current operations consist of six lines: D, E, H, L, W, and R.. The D Line extends from Littleton•Mineral Station to 18th and
California Station. The E Line extends from RidgeGate Parkway Station to Denver Union Station.. The H Line extends
from Florida Station to 18th and California Station. The L Line is a downtown loop between 14th and Stout streets and
30th•Downing Station. The W Line extends from Jefferson County Government Center•Golden to Denver Union Station.
The R Line extends from RidgeGate Parkway Station to Peoria Station. Typical headways vary from 5 to 15 minutes during
peak operations with increased service operated for special events. Early morning or late night headways on weekends
and holidays are typically 30 minutes.

16.D.c

In the case of an accident or a breakdown of the system, the Control Center controls train movement using a manual block
system. When necessary, bus shuttles are used to move passengers around a trouble area.

I 5.2

Commuter Rail Service

The owner of RTDC, which is the Regional Transportation District (RTD), has a concession agreement with Denver Transit
Packet Pg. 337

Partners (DTP) LLC for the operation and maintenance of the current RTDC commuter rail lines and vehicles. Denver
Transit Operators (DTO), under this agreement, is responsible for performing all services connected with the operation and
maintenance of the concession agreement. The lines operated by DTP comprise the East Corridor (University of Colorado A
Line), Northwest Electrified Segment (B Line), and Gold Line (G Line).
Revenue service began in September 2020 for an additional commuter rail line, North Metro (N Line). RTD employees
perform all operations and maintenance on the N Line.
Denver Union Station is the hub for multiple transportation modes in the Denver metro area. Services operating on the
East Corridor, Northwest Electrified Segment (NWES), Gold Line, and N Line terminate at Denver Union Station, which
also accommodates Amtrak and other heavy rail. The N Line operates out of Denver Union Station. DTO is responsible
for dispatching all commuter rail trains in and out of Denver Union Station and for maintaining the infrastructure within the
station.
The East Corridor (A Line) is a 22.8-mile segment running from Denver Union Station to Denver International Airport with
six intermediate stations. The Northwest Electrified Segment (B Line) extends 5.5 miles north from Denver Union Station
to Westminster. Two B and G Line stations share a portion of the track. The Gold Line (G Line) is an 11.2-mile line that runs
west from Denver Union Station to Ward Road in Wheat Ridge with six intermediate stations.
The Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF), located at 5151 Fox St. in Denver, is the central control center for Denver
Transit Operators (DTO). This facility has a rolling stock maintenance shop, warehouse, administrative offices, and storage
yard, including a car wash.
The North Metro (N Line) has six stations, four of which have pedestrian crossings. This 13.8-mile corridor includes six
highway grade crossings and 11 bridges.
Commuter rail is regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and is subject to FRA rules, regulations, and
inspections. Hours of operation are generally 3 a.m.–1:30 a.m.

I 5.3

Bus Operations System Description

The Regional Transportation District was created by an act of the Colorado General Assembly in 1969 and became an
operating unit on July 1 of that year. The purpose of creating this agency was to provide a regional approach to public
transportation.
On January 1, 1974, RTD began collecting a half percent sales tax and became fully operational. RTD initially inherited 321
buses from Denver Metro Transit.
Many of these vehicles were over 20 years old. Total bus mileage was 9 million miles per year, with fewer than 20 million
customers annually.
Only one maintenance and storage facility existed for buses. There was little or no maintenance capacity for buses in the
small system operating in the District. These systems served several local areas and there was a private Denver-Boulder
bus line.
RTD began building a modern bus fleet and its needed support facilities. In 1975, the six fragmented bus systems that had
provided service to different areas of the District were integrated into a single, unified system. New and improved service
became the focal points for future growth.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_Exhibits_2023_v5_sml (4694 : 2023 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

16.D.c

The improved service included the extension of routes; new local and express routes; more frequent service; new nighttime
service on many routes; increased service to the mountain areas of the District; exclusive bus lanes; and the inauguration
of special service for the elderly and disabled. Meeting special needs made RTD the first transit system in the nation with a
comprehensive bus program to serve the needs of the elderly and disabled. All of these factors led to a significant increase
in ridership.
Packet Pg. 338

To support and encourage new customers, RTD also launched a program to establish Park-n-Ride facilities. Additional bus
maintenance and storage facilities were acquired to accommodate the growing bus fleet.
The 16th Street Mall bus service became operational in 1982. This was the first step in a unique transit concept, which would
pull 50 percent of the buses off downtown streets during peak hours and provide opportunities for additional suburban
service.
In 1994, RTD partnered with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) to add High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV)
lanes from I-25 to US 36, allowing regional and express routes running along US 36 and I-25 to downtown Denver to
bypass congestion around the Turnpike Tangle.
In 2016, RTD began operating the Flatiron Flyer Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service along US 36 and the I-25 HOV lanes,
seamlessly connecting Boulder and Denver. Later that year, RTD began operation of 36 BYD K10MR all-electric buses on
the 16th Street Mall, making it one of the largest electric bus fleets in the nation. The District has evolved into a transit
system that has a service area of 2,342 square miles. It serves 40 municipalities in all or part of eight counties. The system
comprises 148 routes. The fleet currently has 1,011 buses, of which 434 are leased to private carriers. There are currently
four maintenance and storage facilities Districtwide, 77 Park-n-Rides, and six transfer stations.

I 5.3.1

Scope and Service

Regular service of the fixed route bus transit system is regulated by timetables and varies between peak and off-peak
hours, weekends, weekdays, and special events. The bus system transports an average of 200,827 weekday boardings.
Denver Union Station and Civic Center Station are the main transfer stations in the downtown Denver area.

I 5.3.2 Organizational Structure
The bus transit safety specialist’s office is located at RTD headquarters, at 1660 Blake St. in Denver. Key positions within
bus operations are the assistant general manager of bus operations, deputy assistant general manager of bus operations,
general superintendent of bus transportation, , general superintendent of bus maintenance, and general superintendent of
street supervision, Manager of contracted service, and business program manager. All of these key positions have regular
contact with the bus transit safety specialist.

I 5.3.3 Bus Transportation Operations
Dispatch governs the operation, control, and dispatch of buses and other RTD vehicles. Dispatch maintains control with
bus operators by means of two-way radios, standard telephones, and Global Positioning System (GPS). Street Supervisors

mass transit system. This is accomplished by scheduling bus service from three operating divisions with732 full-time and 93
part time bus operators. Service is provided seven days a week over approximately 21 hours of each day.
Street supervisors monitor service and performance of bus operators to ensure the safe, efficient, on-time delivery of
scheduled bus service. The district also provides continuous evaluation of routes, schedules, bus stops, shelters, and
facilities to determine the effectiveness and condition of service and amenities.
Effective, two-way radio communication is provided to all revenue and non-revenue vehicles. Information is received and
relayed to the proper sources to provide assistance and coordination for bus operations. Communication is provided
through the radio system, telephones, and a state-of-the-art tracking system.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2023-2028 Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP)

Committee Meeting Date:
September 13, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
September 28, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2023-2028 Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 2023-2028 MTFP is the six-year financial forecast used as the basis for the development of the
2023 Budget and provides guidance for future year financial planning. The development of this forecast
seeks to balance planned expenditures with anticipated available funding sources in alignment with
RTD’s Strategic Plan. Adoption of the 2023-2028 MTFP by the Board is not a commitment or
appropriation of funding.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s financial position has improved since the Board last approved an MTFP in November 2021. In the
intervening period, RTD has gained additional clarity regarding post-COVID fare revenue and sales and
use tax receipts, approved a three-year collective bargaining agreement, completed two debt
refinancings for interest savings, progressed in refining asset management needs and further
implemented the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan.
2023-2028 MTFP Assumptions
• Fare revenue volatility has moderated during the past year ending June 2022 with the MTFP
assuming up to a 20% decrease in the average fare rate beginning in 2024 in anticipation of
results from the Fare Study and Equity Analysis. Ridership was reforecast based on current trends
and is assumed to grow annually by 1.8%. No fare increase is contemplated in the MTFP
• Sales and use tax projections provided in August 2022 by the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business project a $91.4 million increase over the March 2022 forecast. The increase
is primarily due to strong collections during 2022 and higher inflation, which is driving the prices
of goods higher, tempered by lower year-over-year growth due to forecasted Base System growth
capped at 1.4% after 2024 for TABOR limits. The 1.4% Base System growth assumption
matches the assumptions from Reimagine RTD in which growth was capped at the growth rate of
property taxes in alignment with TABOR revenue growth limits

Federal COVID-19 relief funding apportionments of $202 million for a total of $774 million for the
period 2020-2024
Increase of approximately $30 million annually for increased FTA Section 5307 preventive
maintenance grant funding resulting from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA)/Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)
Operating expense increase of $254 million over the six-year MTFP period for increased service
levels and inflationary increases
Debt service decrease of $129 million over the six-year MTFP period due to debt refinancing for
interest savings
Asset management includes an additional $163 million over the six-year MTFP for state of good
repair needs. The average annual expenditure is $133 million, compared to the long-term
forecasted annual average of $120 million due to the backlog of needs, which is significantly
reduced from the 2021 MTFP
Increase in reserves of $118 million during the six-year MTFP, which results in meeting the
Board-established fiscal policy of maintaining three months’ operating expenses in reserves

Current Outlook
• The 2023-2028 period balances funding sources and uses while strengthening reserves
• Service level increases are based on anticipated demand
• Funding for full asset management backlog plus reserves is maintained for future needs
• Debt service coverage ratio policy of 1.2X is met or exceeded each year
• Reserves of three months’ operating expenses are maintained in each year
• Base System funding continues to supplement FasTracks, however at a lower level due to
decreases in FasTracks debt service requirements
• Limited new projects are included
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2023-2028 MTFP projects balanced funding sources and uses while meeting asset management
needs and fiscal policy requirements for reserves and debt service coverage ratios.

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Bylaws Amendment — Director Informal Meeting Process

Committee Meeting Date:
September 22, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
September 28, 2022

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. V,
Section 3(b). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by RTD Directors Dishell, Guissinger, and Sloan that the Board of Directors amend
Article IV of the Bylaws of the Regional Transportation District to establish a procedure for informal
meetings to engage in discussions of public business with three or more Board members in addition to
regular Board, special Board, Standing committee, and Ad Hoc Committee meetings.
REPRESENTATIVE
Directors Dishell, Guissinger, and Sloan
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The proposal is intended to complement the regular structure of Board meetings by affording Directors
an option to schedule flexible and adaptable meetings when three or more members consider them to be
necessary or desirable. The purposes of such meetings include preparing a matter to bring to the Board,
discussing working relationships with stakeholders and constituents, or considering other matters related
to agency business. The scheduling Directors must provide the meeting agenda, including any materials,
the time, and location of the meeting to the Executive Manager of the Board Office and the Board Chair
at least forty-eight hours prior to the meeting. Notice of the meetings will be posted on the Board’s
online two-week calendar. Written minutes shall be recorded.
Like all Board meetings, the informal meetings will comply with applicable laws, particularly the Colorado
Open Meetings Law and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Board Office staff may not be present and
informal meetings will not be broadcasted via Zoom or video recorded, nor will a written transcript be
prepared.
DISCUSSION
The proposal can encourage useful discussion of nascent issues as well as improve the presently
cumbersome and inefficient process for more-than-three-Director initiatives. If the Bylaw amendments
are adopted, Directors will be authorized to develop agendas and choose locations suitable to the
discussion topic. Blake Street will remain as a location available to Directors who wish to utilize RTD's IT
expertise, security advantages, and meeting spaces. Others may select an alternative venue
commensurate with their anticipation of meeting requirements.

Packet Pg. 384

17.F

The proposed Bylaw amendments add a new Article IV, Section 4, stating:
INFORMAL DIRECTOR MEETINGS
Informal Meetings may be called to engage in discussions of public business by three or more Directors.
The purposes of such meetings may include discussion of a matter to bring to the Board, relationships
with stakeholders and constituents, or other matters related to agency business. No formal action may
be taken. The Directors calling the meeting may set the location and agenda as appropriate to the topic
of the meeting. Written minutes shall be recorded.
Additionally, a new subsection is to be added to Section 8(c): Notice of Meetings.
NOTICE OF MEETINGS
c) The scheduling Directors must provide the meeting agenda, including any materials, the time, and
location of the meeting to the Executive Manager of the Board Office and the Board Chair at least fortyeight hours prior to the meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact is expected.

PREAMBLE

The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created
by the Regional Transportation District Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD
Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly, First
Regular Session, 1969). The District is a

political subdivision of the State of

Colorado, with those powers specifically granted and those reasonably implied from
the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the objects and purposes of the
District.

The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly
conferred by the RTD Act, at § 32-9-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the
internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD Act, while others
are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the
Board. For convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or
other laws, together with those that are adopted under delegated authority, are
combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any omission from
them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty,
or responsibility to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the
RTD Act or other applicable laws as they now exist or may be amended.

PREAMBLE

The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created
by the Regional Transportation District Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD
Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly, First
Regular Session, 1969). The District is a

political subdivision of the State of

Colorado, with those powers specifically granted and those reasonably implied from
the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the objects and purposes of the
District.

The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly
conferred by the RTD Act, at § 32-9-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the
internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD Act, while others
are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the
Board. For convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or
other laws, together with those that are adopted under delegated authority, are
combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any omission from
them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty,
or responsibility to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the
RTD Act or other applicable laws as they now exist or may be amended.

expiration of the Director’s official capacity, shall be indemnified by the
District through insurance against all costs and expenses actually and
necessarily incurred by the Director in connection with the defense of any

the Director’s official capacity as a Director or Officer or after expiration of
the Director’s official term, may be indemnified for all costs of defense and
payments of settlements or judgments for claims of willful and wanton
conduct including punitive damage claims if the Board, by resolution adopted
at an open public meeting and as permitted by the Colorado Governmental
Immunity Act, C.R.S. § 24-10-101 et seq., determines it is in the public
interest and permitted by law to do so. The foregoing right of indemnification

Director Comments to Proposed Amended Bylaws – Director Informal Meeting Process
Director Dishell
•

Last sentence of page 1 of the redline should be revised, “Board Office staff may not be present and as a
result, informal meetings may not be broadcasted via Zoom or video recorded, and a written transcript may
not be prepared.”

•

I don’t want to unintentionally restrict Directors from broadcasting via platforms of their choosing or
recording on Zoom. However, I also do not want to put that burden on staff. It seems to me that it would
make sense if the videos are recorded and provided to staff, which anyone with a Zoom license can do,
they should be uploaded. However, staff should not be required to attend, broadcast, or transcribe the
meetings.

•

Page 10 of bylaws – change must to shall for consistency with rest of bylaws choice of using shall instead
of must.

•

Across the board, instead of 48 hours, two business days for notice.

Director Rivera-Malpiede
•

After reviewing the proposed informal director meetings resolution, I am opposed for the following reasons
1. Logistics: If it is only 24-48 hour notice, will that be enough time for our staff to post the meeting?
2. Since there will be no staff support, will there be a check list to ensure that the location meets the
requirements of an elected official public meeting including is the location ADA compliant, does it have
the capability to have translation and TTY services and can folks listen in other than being there such as
zoom?
3. Will there be a designated board member who will oversee the logistics? Will they do all the leg work
in terms of finding the location, sending out the invitations and the agenda?
4. I am concerned about the sunshine law.
5. I am concerned that some may see this action as a private gathering and not transparent. This will be
a red flag for the media.
6. I fear for the safety as an elected official particularly if meetings are not held at a public facility.
7. What will be the timeline of when the minutes will be presented to the board office? The minutes must
be transparent, accurate and not up for interpretation. Validity of minutes is essential. Random minutes
puts me in a place of concern.
8. I am concerned about what additional staff time might be following up as the custodian of record.
9. What criteria will be used to determine whether or not it is an appropriate subject matter to have in a
meeting such as this?

•

The bylaw changes are fine.

Director Whitmore
•

While I applaud the effort and intent of this proposal, I am a bit uncomfortable with moving it forward. I am
very concerned with the media, public relations fall‐out if these gatherings are reported as private meetings
(even though they are not). We work so hard to acquire positive public relations and positive reporting on
our accomplishments, so I fear this action could easily be misconstrued as private meetings or abuse of
Colorado’s sunshine law.

•

Logistically I am concerned with numerous items such as ADA compliance, security, minute‐taking that
meets appropriate levels and board privacy of personal addresses.

•

While I’m not a “hard no” at this point, I am leaning that way.
