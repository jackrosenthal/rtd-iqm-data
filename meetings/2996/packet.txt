•

Further reduces by $3,000 the amount allocated to each Director’s travel expense budget;
Reduces by $1,000 the amount allocated to each Director’s local expense budget.

If approved, when combined with previous reductions, the expense budgets for each Director other than
the Chair would be set at $3,000 for local expenses and $1,000 for travel expenses; the Chair's
expense budgets would be set at $3,500 for local expenses and $2,500 for travel expenses.
ALTERNATIVES

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. _____, SERIES OF 2020

WHEREAS, RTD’s Board of Directors consists of 15 elected members who serve their
constituents on a daily basis throughout the community, at committee meetings, study
sessions, and Board meetings, and at the legislature; and
WHEREAS, Each fiscal year moneys are allocated to Directors’ expense budgets to allow for
reimbursement of their individual local and travel expenses; and
WHEREAS, The COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on both farebox revenues and
sales and use tax revenues; and
WHEREAS, Though RTD has received a significant amount of funding through the federal
CARES Act, that amount is not enough to offset lost revenues, and further agency-wide
budget reductions for fiscal year 2020 are now warranted; and
WHEREAS, Social distancing requirements, broad travel restrictions, and event cancellations
both locally and nationwide have diminished Directors’ opportunities to travel within their
districts to conduct business and meet with constituents and to travel outside of the state
in the exercise of their duties; and
WHEREAS, At the same time, remote meetings have offered the Directors the ability to
conduct business from home, thus minimizing or eliminating the need to travel to and from
the Blake Street Offices to participate in, and formally vote during, Board and committee
meetings during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic; and
WHEREAS, Due to a projected revenue shortfall in 2020, the Board of Directors approved
Resolution 012, Series of 2019, which reduced the amounts allocated to the Directors for
fiscal year 2020.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that for fiscal year 2020 only, in light of ongoing
financial hardships impacting the agency, the Board hereby reduces the following budget
lines:

Introduction
The following data was collected in response to inquiries
regarding RTD costs, investment, and revenue based on
District geography. It is important to keep in mind that:
• RTD operations are not segregated by county and most
routes operate across multiple counties
• Both costs and revenue are provided and consumed by
residents of other counties and residents outside the District
• RTD’s network is designed with Denver as a primary service
hub which results in a larger share of expenditures being
allocated to the City and County of Denver

DISCUSSION
With the onset of the COVID-19 virus, there was a significant reduction in sales and use tax revenue
and fare box revenue. We have prepared an analysis which is attached regarding three different
possible scenarios regarding revenues for 2020, (Best/ Mid/ Worst Case). These projections have
been prepared with limited information and will most likely change over the coming months as actual
revenue is realized. However, due to the nature of our industry, it is critical that staff make
assumptions so that additional actions that might need to be taken to reduce expenditures occurs
sooner rather than later.
Transit as been fortunate in that Congress passed the CARES Act to assist transit agencies with
operating costs and specifically revenue replacement. The attached analysis takes the CARES Act
funding into account. CARES Act funding is 100% federal and doesn’t expire.
In addition, through the amended budget solicitation process, we have additional expenditures that
have been identified. The largest of these is under administrative. We discovered that we had not
booked the appropriate amounts for the represented health and welfare programs and the lump sum
contribution to the represented pension.
We then identified the overall shortfall under the three revenue scenarios. In addition, we have
identified funding sources to address these shortfalls that the Board may want to consider. In one
of the scenarios, there are some funds projected to be available for use in 2021. Even though there
appears to be funds available at this time, it still might be prudent to consider some additional
reductions as revenues in 2021 are expected to be less favorable than what was presented at the
March 31st Board study session.
Exhibit A details the proposed increases for the administration and operations. Exhibit B details the
proposed increases and decreases in capital projects. Exhibit C details the reductions in both
administration and operating.
In addition, we have calculated the amount that could be saved on a daily basis through the use of
furlough days.
For example, if every employee took five (5) furlough days between now and
st
December 31 you could estimate a savings of $3.7 million ($740,000 x 5).

Packet Pg. 24

1.C.2

A furlough is a mandatory temporary leave of absence from which the employee is expected to
return to work or to be restored from a reduced work schedule. Furloughed employees may be
required to take a certain number of unpaid hours off over a number of weeks, take a specified
number of unpaid days or hours throughout the year, or take a single block of unpaid time off. A
layoff is generally considered a separation from employment due to a lack of work available. The
term "layoff" is mostly a description of a type of termination in which the employee holds no blame.

POLICY REFERENCE
Investment Policy
DISCUSSION
Please find the District’s investment report for the first quarter of 2020 attached.
The U.S. economy and household spending continued to expand at a steady pace during the first two
months of the first quarter of 2020. The U.S. unemployment rate remained low and general inflationary
pressures remained tame. In March, social distancing in response to the novel coronavirus began a sharp
decline in economic activity and cause long term interest rates to move lower.
In response to the corona virus outbreak causing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job
losses, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee reduced the target range for the federal funds rate
to 0.00 to 0.25 percent. The Committee stated that it expects to “maintain this target range until it is
confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum
employment and price stability goals.” This drastic reduction in short term interest rates will likely lead
to lower than expected investment income for RTD in 2020.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance. The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return (yield plus change in market value) on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the
District’s unrestricted portfolio and investment benchmarks were as follows:

Board Meeting Date: May 12, 2020
Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program transitioned to
new rules after December 31, 2019.
DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

Packet Pg. 55

1.D.2

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of May 5, 2020, 9,076 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 5,679 have been approved,
2,300 have been denied and the remaining 1,097 are pending. Of the 2,300 denied, 1,531 were denied
because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65 and older which entitles them to a better discount,
452 were denied because their address was out of District, 49 were denied because it was a duplicate
application, 41 were denied because the applicants were already enrolled, 77 were denied because they
did not respond to requests for additional information, and 150 were denied because they did not meet
the income threshold. Of the 1,097 pending applications, 1,026 lack an uploaded photo, 69 are pending
for eligibility determination by a benefits program that would income-qualify the applicant for LiVE, and 2
are pending because the applicant needs to provide additional information.
We saw a significant drop in applications when the social distancing measures related to the COVID-19
pandemic went into effect. The number of approved applications per week decreased by 59% from an
average of 231 per week in the first two weeks of March to an average of 95 in the following three
weeks and have remained stable since. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 situation, we are seeing a higher
percentage of applicants who apply for LiVE at the same time as they apply for other benefit programs,
or shortly thereafter.
In addition to going live on July 29, 2019, the following actions have been completed:
• LiVE fares are available through RTD’s mobile ticketing application.
• LiVE fares are available on LiVE MyRide smart cards. The cards can be ordered through the
MyRide portal and have been made available for purchase at RTD sales outlets as well as
King Soopers and Safeway stores.
• LiVE airport upgrades are available on buses and from Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs).
• Order forms for LiVE 10-ride tickets have been made available to organizations in the RTD
nonprofit program.
• RTD Operations staff and Security staff have been trained on the LiVE fares and eligibility
requirements.
• Marketing, training, product readiness and communications activities have been deployed.
• Step-by-by step instructions for applications as well as other materials are available
through the RTD LiVE web page. A LiVE Program handout has been created, printed, and
uploaded to the web page. The instructions and handout are available in English and
Spanish.
• The LiVE application process in PEAK is available to applicants in both English and
Spanish.

RTD customer service is answering LiVE program questions and referring customers to the
appropriate parties for assistance.
Denver Human Services is verifying income for those not categorically income-eligible
through public assistance programs.
Denver Human Services is providing LiVE eligibility customer service by phone and e-mail.
RTD staff are performing quality control, making any needed adjustments for uploaded
photos, working with applicants if a better photo is required, and assisting customers
whose cards have been lost or stolen.
The livecard@rtd-denver.com mailbox is active and being utilized to communicate with
customers about photos and cards and to field questions. Community partners can request
printed LiVE handouts through this email address.
A feedback form about the LiVE application experience is available on the RTD website.
RTD staff have promoted the LiVE program and answered questions at community events.
Denver Human Services has provided information about the LiVE Program and application
at community events and to community partners and caseworkers.
RTD hosted live and webinar training by PEAK Outreach (Boulder County) for nonprofit
organizations that are interested in helping their clients apply for LiVE.
RTD has refined the communications plan for LiVE and is expanding outreach and
marketing activities.
The team has identified requirements for PEAK enhancements related to the LiVE
application and application processing.
RTD would like to provide some application help to eligible riders who have barriers to
applying. We envision an application outreach worker helping interested individuals apply
at rotating locations throughout the District, for example homeless shelters. RTD and
Denver Human Services have agreed to pursue this option.
Negotiated the scope for enhancements to the LiVE application and application processing
in PEAK with the State’s software vendor. These enhancements will include revised
verbiage in the LiVE application based on feedback. Due to the pandemic’s impacts on the
RTD budget, this project was put on hold.
RTD kicked off a broader marketing campaign about all fare discounts, including LiVE,
starting with in-vehicle advertising and social media posts.
We worked with Denver Human Services to adjust procedures due to the COVID-19
situation. The LiVE eligibility technicians are processing applications and provide customer
service remotely while the Denver Human Services offices are closed to the public. In
addition to the online application on PEAK, interested individuals have the option of
applying by phone until the offices re-open.

outreach is not currently an option.
Creation of new LiVE informational materials based on feedback by customers, Denver
Human Services, and community-based organizations. This includes a comprehensive
questions & answers document and short videos with basic information, how to apply,
and how to use the program.
On-going communications with organizations in the RTD Nonprofit Program about program
rules, the application process, feedback, and changes due to the COVID-19 situation.
RTD is working with homeless services providers to determine if a temporary LiVE ID card
issued by such organizations would be feasible. This would eliminate the wait time
between the LiVE application and the ability to use the discounted tickets for individuals in
emergency situations.

Finalize and execute the amendment to the intergovernmental agreement with the City and
County of Denver to add the services of an application outreach worker.
Finalize questions for the survey of LiVE customers for feedback on all aspects of the LiVE
program.
RTD will continue to refine communications materials and outreach activities.
The team will use participation and usage numbers as well as feedback from customers,
partner organizations, and RTD staff to consider further enhancements to the program.
This will include re-assessing which fare products are available for LiVE.
