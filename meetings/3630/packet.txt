BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Mobile Ticketing and Account-based Ticketing Contract
Extension

April 16, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
April 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve a two-year contract extension with Masabi, LLC (Masabi) to
continue providing the software and support necessary for the mobile ticketing and account-based
ticketing (ABT) fare collection system.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
In October 2020, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the mobile ticketing contract with
Masabi, 16DH050, to provide the software and support necessary for adding account-based ticketing
(ABT) functionality. Masabi implemented ABT enhancing the RTD Mobile Ticketing app (now branded the
RTD MyRide app) and activating back-office software functionality in its JustRide platform for fare
payment with stored value, CollegePass, EcoPass, and Neighborhood EcoPass. Masabi also implemented
integrations with RTD’s bus computer aided dispatch/automatic vehicle location (CAD/AVL) system, as
well as for the University of Colorado, Boulder and the Auraria Higher Education Center. Use of Masabi’s
JustRide platform for mobile ticketing and ABT has been successful, and Masabi has proven to be a
competent and responsive vendor.
Mobile ticketing is a convenient fare payment method that has proven to be highly popular with RTD
customers. Customers can purchase RTD mobile tickets in the RTD MyRide app and, through
integrations by Masabi, also in the Transit and Uber apps. In addition, employers, organizations, and
event organizers can issue mobile tickets to riders in bulk.
ABT functionality allows customers to use RTD’s services with stored value as well as CollegePass,
EcoPass, and Neighborhood EcoPass. The system processes and stores information by account, while
ensuring Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, and allows for such benefits as:
• Real-time loading and availability of funds and fare payment and account balance information
• Tap-to-ride functionality
• Fare capping (customers are automatically charged the most cost-efficient fare)
• The ability to use barcodes and other fare media in addition to cards
• The ability for multiple customers to use the fund balance in the same account

Packet Pg. 29

15.A

•
•
•

Varied means of loading stored value
More fare offerings and flexibility in changing fares
Less maintenance through utilization of a hosted environment

Employers, colleges, and neighborhoods can manage pass program users, barcodes, and cards in the
Justride system. The Masabi fare collection system is scalable and allows for modifications such as the
recent implementation of fare changes resulting from the 2022-23 Systemwide Fare Study and Equity
Analysis. This system also provides flexibility regarding potential future fare structure changes and
enhancements as well as compatibility with other electronic fare collection systems such as ticket
vending machines, and the capability to integrate with other third-party systems.
The Masabi contract currently requires a fixed monthly payment of $150,000 for ongoing use of the
JustRide platform for mobile ticketing and account-based ticketing and support. These costs are
approximately 4% to 5% of associated fare revenue, which is comparable to costs incurred with other
fare collection providers in the industry. In addition, payment transactions that are completed with a
credit or debit card through the Masabi system also result in an additional cost of approximately 4.7% of
card sales, which is paid to banks and card processing networks such as Visa and Mastercard and
passed through at cost from Masabi to RTD.
DISCUSSION
Staff presented this proposed contract extension as a Discussion Item during the Tuesday, March 12,
2024, Finance and Planning Committee meeting.
A sole-source extension of this contract with Masabi would continue the provision of the JustRide
mobile ticketing and ABT functionality for an additional two years following expiration of the existing
contract in June 2024.
During this two-year period, staff will continue to evaluate RTD’s fare collection systems for potential
enhancements and integrations in a holistic manner and to provide further alignment with RTD’s
Strategic Priorities. This will inform a competitive procurement for mobile ticketing and ABT software
and support, to be implemented at the conclusion of this recommended two-year contract extension.
The extension of this contract will include a 5% increase in the current monthly fixed payment, which
has remained flat for 2022 through 2024, of $150,000 to $157,500 in June 2024 and to $165,375 in
June 2025, in recognition of inflation as well as additional client support that will be provided.
Masabi has performed very well under the current contract by providing excellent customer service,
meeting contractual requirements for system availability and PCI compliance. In addition, Masabi has
been responsive and effective at implementing changes to account for the Zero Fare for Better Air
initiative, the New Year’s Eve Zero Fare offering, and the implementation of the Board-adopted 2024
fares and fare structure. Further, Masabi has assigned a dedicated Account Manager and Customer
Success Manager to RTD.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of this two-year extension is a not-to-exceed amount of $3,874,500 in fixed costs
and an estimated $3,000,000 in card payment processing costs for a total not-to-exceed amount of
$6,874,500. The 2024 Budget approved by the Board in November 2023 includes funding for these
costs.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Allied Universal Security Services Contract Third Option
Year

April 17, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
April 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO), or her designee, to
execute the third and final option year of the existing security services contract with Allied Universal
Security Services (AUS), including amendments discussed below, for a total cost not to exceed
$21,012,715.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Dr. Joel Fitzgerald, Chief of Police and Emergency Management
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The current RTD security model consists of internal police officers, secondary employment police
officers from local jurisdictions, and contracted security officers to provide security for RTD customers,
facilities, and property.
On July 11, 2019, following a comprehensive procurement process, AUS was awarded a three-year
contract with three one-year options to provide system-wide security services. The initial contract term
expired June 30, 2022, and RTD executed the first option year term from July 1, 2022, to June 30,
2023. The second option year was executed from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, following approval
by the Board on May 31, 2023. A third and final option year term would further extend the contract
from July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025.
Some of the services AUS provides under the contract terms include but are not limited to:
•

•

•

Critical infrastructure security at RTD facilities, bus terminals and rail stations
o Security officers currently provide security at Denver Union Station, Civic Center,
Downtown Boulder Station, Blake Street administrative offices and other locations that
experience large groups of customers and employees to provide high visibility and
deterrence to criminal activity
Fare enforcement on rail and bus vehicles
o Security officers conduct daily fare checks and continuously engage in customer education
efforts targeting the importance of paying for public transportation, and issue citations and
warnings to those who are not in compliance with fare requirements
Patrol services at RTD facilities, rail platforms, bus shelters, and Park-n-Rides

Packet Pg. 32

15.B

Security officers are placed in strategic posts to reduce and deter criminal activities and
provide a customer service approach to assisting customers on directions
Enhanced security presence during large-scale events related to an increase in RTD customer
ridership
o Security officers provide assistance with crowd control and with guiding customers to and
from special events that people utilize public transportation to attend
Federally required commuter rail second crewmember duties and responsibilities
o Security officers perform security and fare enforcement functions as well as ensure a
second crewmember is available for commuter rail trains to provide consistent service,
federal safety compliance, and on-time performance
o

•

•

DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the Board authorize the GM/CEO to execute the third and final option year with
AUS to continue providing system-wide security services. During the term of the contract, AUS has
fulfilled the contract requirements to a satisfactory level.
In addition to exercising the final option year, the below contract amendments are recommended.
•
•

•

•

Quarterly reduction of staffing hours beginning in Q2 of the contract option year, resulting in an
overall 31% reduction in contracted security services by June 30, 2025
Addition of security services at RTD facilities:
o East Metro Bus Division
o Elati Light Rail Facility
o Boulder Bus Division
o Platte Street Facility
Increased hourly wage rates for armed and unarmed security services
o Armed Security Services – Transit Security Officer:
Wage level: $27.46 (current rate: $23.87)
Hourly billing rate: $43.72 (current rate: $39.10)
o Unarmed Security Services – Transit Security Specialist:
Wage level: $23.21(current rate: $21.50)
Hourly billing rate: $34.19 (current rate: $31.67)
Establish a direct contact for all issues related to commuter rail security services

The above proposed amendments are anticipated to enhance overall contract performance and coverage
in the final year as RTD continues to shift its resource allocation to increase its internal police force and
decrease its reliance upon contracted security services. Hourly wage increases are supported by market
data and intended to improve recruitment and retention.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence. Specifically:
• The perceived value of RTD in terms of Community Value would be enhanced through:

Packet Pg. 33

15.B

o Recruitment and retention of contracted security personnel to support RTD Police
throughout the service area, yielding a greater sense of employee, customer, and overall
community security
• Increased Customer Excellence would be achieved through the continued ability of RTD Police
Department to deploy unarmed security guards on commuter rail services, thereby improving
system reliability and decreasing delays
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact associated with the adoption of the recommended action is $21,012,715, of which
$10,506,357 will be accounted for within the FY2024 Budget. The remaining funds require
incorporation into the FY2025 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Bylaw Amendment to Change the Name of the Operations
and Safety Committee

April 25, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
April 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to amend Article VI—Committees of the Board, Section 1. (Standing
Committees), paragraph e, to change the name of the Operations and Safety Committee to the
Operations, Safety, and Security Committee. And for the Board of Directors to amend Article IV
(Meetings), Section 2 (Standing Committee Meetings) to reflect the name change.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the February 23, 2024, retreat and later at the March 13, 2024 committee meeting, Board
members and leadership of the Operations and Safety Committee (committee) discussed the idea of
changing the name of the Operations and Safety Committee to include a specific focus on security.
During the March 13, 2024, committee meeting, the committee members came to consensus that they
would support an action moving forward to the Executive Committee in April 2024 to change the name
of the committee accordingly.
A focus on security matters currently exists within the committee’s purview, as the Bylaws define that
the “Operations and Safety Committee is responsible for all operational matters, including all contracted
and non-contracted bus, rail, paratransit, and microtransit services, as well as safety and security
[emphasis added] matters.”
INFORMATION
The Bylaws currently reference the committee in three locations. As such, the following highlighted
changes would be made if approved.
Article VI—Committees of the Board, Section 1. (Standing Committees), e.
Operations, Safety, and Security Committee. The Operations, Safety, and Security Committee is
responsible for all operational matters, including all contracted and non-contracted bus, rail,
paratransit, and microtransit services, as well as safety and security matters.
Article IV—Meetings, Section 2 (Standing Committee Meetings)

Packet Pg. 35

16.C

The Finance and Planning Committee and the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee will be held
on the second Tuesday and the Wednesday immediately following of each month at 5:30 p.m.
Executive Committee meetings will be held at noon on the third Thursday of each month. Performance
Committee and Internal Audit Committee meetings will be scheduled as necessary to fulfill the
committees’ responsibilities.
All Bylaw changes require 10 votes to be approved. If approved the change would take effect at the
conclusion of the Board meeting during which this Recommended Action is approved.
This proposed change, if adopted, aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value and Customer
Excellence by increasing the awareness amongst the public and customer base of RTD’s commitment to
security and a welcoming transit environment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to changing the name of the committee.

Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly,
First Regular Session, 1969). The District is a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, with those powers
specifically granted and those reasonably implied from the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the
objects and purposes of the District.
The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly conferred by the RTD Act, at § 329-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD
Act, while others are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the Board. For
convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or other laws, together with those that are
adopted under delegated authority, are combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any
omission from them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty, or responsibility
to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the RTD Act or other applicable laws as they
now exist or may be amended.
ARTICLE I - DEFINITIONS
The terms “district,” “board,” “director,” “publication,” “mass transportation system,” and other terms defined in
the RTD Act, and used in these Bylaws, shall have the same meaning as in the RTD Act unless the context clearly
indicates a different meaning. “State Audit” as used in these Bylaws means the performance audit conducted by
the Office of the State Auditor in 2009 and 2010 and reported to the state Legislative Audit Committee in March
2010.
ARTICLE II – BOARD OF DIRECTORS
All powers, privileges, and duties vested in or imposed upon the District shall be exercised and performed by and
through the Board, whether set forth specifically or implied in these Bylaws. The Board may delegate to officers
and employees of the District any or all executive, administrative, and ministerial powers.

adopted under delegated authority, are combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any
omission from them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty, or responsibility

2010.
ARTICLE II – BOARD OF DIRECTORS

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Draft Property and Station Naming Policies

March 21, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the January 25, 2024, Board meeting, the Board provided direction to have staff work with
Directors Sloan and Ruscha to review RTD’s current station naming policy, which is comprised of three
prior Board actions (1994, 2003, and 2011), to coalesce that policy into a unified document, and to
propose a means by which the Board could add to an honorary name to an RTD property or station.
A group comprised of Director Sloan, Director Ruscha, Government Relations Officer Michael Davies,
and Board Office Executive Manager Jack Kroll has met three times, in addition to correspondence by
group members via phone and email, since the January 2024 Board meeting. During these discussions
the group reviewed RTD’s current policies and analyzed policies from other transit agencies (Corpus
Christi Regional Transportation Authority, Houston Metro, Los Angeles Metro, Washington Metropolitan
Area Transit Authority). Additionally, the group drafted and revised the attached policies and procedures
for review. The group received additional input from senior staff as well as Director Rosenthal. This item
was tabled at the March 21, 2024 Executive Committee meeting to the April Executive Committee
meeting.
Enclosed with this discussion item, Directors will find a document that coalesces and proposes a few
minor changes to RTD’s Station Naming Policy, as well as a subsidiary document defining the policies
and procedures for the Board to add an honorary name to an RTD property.
DISCUSSION
The group working on the proposed policies and procedures is now seeking the feedback of the
Executive Committee as well as the full RTD Board of Directors on the same. Key elements of the
proposed items are as follows:
•

Updating the universe of RTD property covered under the naming policy to include administrative
buildings and maintenance facilities. Thus, the policies and procedures were revised and/or
drafted to cover the naming of RTD properties and stations

Packet Pg. 77

17.1

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Declaring the primary property or station name will remain wayfinding/geographic identifier and
that honorary names will be secondary to the primary name
Requiring significant local, public input and support in the form of a completed application packet
submitted to the Board via the Board Office before considering an honorary name
Creating a committee comprised of internal and external parties to review proposed honorary
names and issue a recommendation to the Board on whether to adopt the name
Clarifying that the board may waive the costs to external entities of renaming a station or
property
Requiring staff to brief the Board on the costs of updating or adding an honorary name to a
property or station
Emphasizing honorary names may not violate any existing naming agreement
Stating that events as well as groups and organizations could be the source of an honorary name
Requiring the honoree to have contributed significantly to public transit nationally or within the
RTD
Requiring the honoree, if an individual, to have been deceased for a minimum of 10 years before
becoming eligible
Prohibiting former RTD Board Members from receiving the honor

While feedback is welcome on any elements contained or missing in the proposed documents, the group
would especially appreciate feedback on the following:
•
•
•
•

The composition of the review committee and whether there should be Director involvement at
that stage of the process
Whether to require a two-thirds or simple majority vote in order to bestow an honorary name on a
station or property
Whether to develop a rubric for the committee to use in evaluating proposed honorary names
Whether the proposed requirements to submit an honorary naming proposal are too burdensome
or too easy

Next steps in this process are for the Executive Committee and Board to discuss and provide further
feedback to the group. The group will then take that feedback and incorporate it alongside additional
feedback from staff before returning to the Board in April with two recommended actions. The first
recommended action will be to adopt an umbrella Property and Station Naming Policy that coalesces the
input received in this process along with the requirements set forth in the Board’s prior actions in 1994,
2003, and 2011. The second action will be to adopt a subsidiary Honorary Property and Station Naming
Policy with associated procedures.
It should be noted that, in the course of its work, the group identified areas the Board may wish to
explore further once work is concluded on the above. That work would be to: review existing policies
and procedures related to public art on RTD properties and stations; discuss the possibility of creating a
policy and an associated process for enacting a temporary honorary name for an RTD station or
property; and review and discuss holistically the current policy that allows for RTD stations to be eligible
for corporate sponsorships.

Packet Pg. 78

17.1

This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priority of Community Value as RTD approaches naming its
properties and stations in alignment with the goals and desires of the communities in which RTD’s
facilities are located.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
While there is no direct fiscal impact to changing the Board policies discussed above, there would be
significant costs to change the name of any existing RTD property or station.

HONORARY PROPERTY AND STATION NAMING POLICY
ADOPTED: TBD

PURPOSE
The RTD Board of Directors (Board) has the authority to add to any existing or planned property or station a
secondary name to honor an individual, group of individuals, organization, or major event. The act of honoring
in this manner should be rare and used only to recognize those individuals, groups, organizations, or events
which contributed immeasurably to the progress of public transit nationally or within the RTD.
The primary property name shall remain, in accordance with the broader Property and Station Naming Policy, a
wayfinding/geographic identifier.
SCOPE
The policy applies to rapid transit stations, rail stations, park-n-rides, transfer centers, other major passenger
facilities, maintenance facilities, and administrative buildings.
An honorary name may not violate any existing naming agreement.
Sponsorships will not be considered for a station with an honorary name.
AUTHORITY
The Board shall approve any amendments to this policy and associated procedures.
REQUIREMENTS OF AN HONORARY PROPERTY NAME
The following criteria will be evaluated prior to the Board’s consideration:
1. Documented significant contributions to public transit nationally or,
2. Documented significant contributions to public transit within the RTD, or
3. Documented direct connection with a significant event occurring in the vicinity of the property subject to
a potential renaming, and
4. Demonstrated public support for the proposal contained in a completed honorary property name
application (see accompanying procedures), and
5. A review by the Honorary Property Name Proposal Review Committee, and
6. Two-thirds majority vote of the Board is required to approve of any secondary name
The following are not eligible to receive recognition through a honorary property naming:
•
•

Former members of the RTD Board of Directors
Any individual who has not been deceased for at least 10 years

USE OF HONORARY NAME
Honorary names are to be used in conjunction with the primary property name. Honorary names should be
displayed prominently at the property, on signage across the system and, where applicable, in printed/digital
route schedules.
REVOCATION OF AN HONORARY STATION NAME
The Board may remove an honorary name by a majority vote.

POLICY
RTD aims to establish property and station names that are recognizable to our customers as destinations. Per
Board policy passed in 1994 and reaffirmed in 2003 and 2011, RTD stations are usually named for the nearest
street intersections, major cross street, or the name of the geographic location of the area. Names should be
kept relatively short so that they will fit efficiently on destination signs, station signs, maps, and other materials.
RTD staff will work with local governments and stakeholders to develop station/facility names for new stations
that differ from the above policy as long as:
•
•

•

The name is recognizable to the general traveling public
The name does not incorporate any trademarked names with value to the private sector or that have
commercially-viable or valuable benefits (absent compensation to RTD as described under sponsorships
below)
The name does not violate any existing naming agreement

SPONSORSHIPS
RTD may, with Board approval, sell naming rights, via a request for proposals-type process, to RTD stations and
facilities under a multi-year contractual agreement provided:
•
•

•

The core station/facility name must remain as a “location identifier” for the traveling public
To be considered as viable, the sale of naming rights would need to generate positive net revenue to
RTD after fully accounting for RTD’s costs of changing the station/facility name (station signs, maps,
collateral material, recorded announcements, etc.) as well as foregone revenue from other sources
The name does not violate any existing naming agreement

NAME CHANGE COST
Entities proposing name changes under this policy would be required to absorb all associated costs, unless the
Board determines otherwise.
HONORIFIC PROPERTY NAMES
The Board may opt to add, as a secondary name to any RTD station or property, an honorific name. The policy,
procedures, and requirements of which are set forth in the separate, subsidiary Honorary Property and Station
Naming Policy.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Review of 2024 Committee Approved Work Plans

March 26, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
At the January 30, 2024, regular Board meeting, the Board of Directors approved a Bylaw amendment,
which calls for each standing committee of the Board to draft and approve an annual work plan. The
work plans approved by each committee will cover meetings from April 2024 to February 2025.
Annual committee work plans are a useful tool for ensuring the Board and staff collaborate effectively to
accomplish the necessary work of the agency and Board, while providing dedicated space for the Board
to pursue governance/policy objectives and gain further insights into matters of interest to Directors.
Work plans elevate and respect the role of the committees of the Board as some of the most effective
forums for completing the work of the Board.
Subsequently the Finance & Planning, Operations & Safety, Performance, and Executive committees
have each approved a work plan for 2024.
This item was tabled from the March meeting to the April meeting of the Board.
DISCUSSION
The Board is asked to review the work plans and provide any additional input to the committees as those
committees proceed in their work for the balance of 2024.
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the ability of the Board’s standing committees to effectively
govern directly impacts the overall performance of the agency. Organized committee work plans will
ensure RTD’s resources are used efficiently, and that the Board’s policy and governance objectives are
more focused, collaborative, and obtainable.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to the review of the committee work plans.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Citizens Advisory Committee Charter

April 25, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC), created by RTD Board of Directors (Board) in April 2004, is
comprised of 17 members appointed by the Board. Formally established pursuant to the Board’s
Resolution No. 5, Series of 2004, the CAC is tasked with advising the Board and serving as community
liaisons on behalf of RTD. This same Resolution No. 5 referred the FasTracks measure to the ballot for
voter consideration. As such, the initial focus of the CAC was to “monitor and provide input on the
improvements for each corridor contained in the [FasTracks] Plan.”
Subsequently, the Board passed a Recommended Action in December 2005 to “formally establish the
`FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC)’” with a mission to advise the Board regarding the
implementation of the FasTracks Plan and to promote public awareness and understanding of the
project.
As the FasTracks buildout and planning phases progressed, the Board expanded the CAC in December
2008, from an initial membership of 11 to a membership of 17. In January 2016, with the FasTracks
planning phase winding down, the Board removes the phrase “FasTracks” from the name of the
committee and redefined the CAC’s role to provide the Board and RTD with more general advice as
opposed to focusing primarily on the FasTracks project.
Throughout its existence, the CAC’s role has been defined by Recommended Actions adopted by the
Board, as opposed to a centralized document, such as a charter. In August 2023, then CAC Co-Chairs
met with the Board Chair, GM/CEO, and Board Office Executive Manager to engage in a conversation
around the role and purpose of the CAC. From that conversation, the parties collectively committed to
examine the role of the CAC and to bring forward a proposal for the Board to review in 2024. Following
that meeting, the Board Office Executive Manager researched the history of the CAC and drafted a
charter based on the previous Board action in 2016 regarding the CAC as well as concepts discussed
amongst Board leadership, staff, and CAC members. That draft charter was then discussed during a
February 2024 meeting of CAC Co-Chairs, Board Chair, GM/CEO, and Board Office Executive Manager.
The draft charter has been subsequently refined based on input from the aforementioned stakeholders
and has been reviewed and discussed by the CAC on two separate occasions.

17.3

DISCUSSION
The Executive Committee is asked to review the draft charter and offer any insights and feedback. The
draft charter will then be circulated to the full Board for review and input before returning in May 2024
as the subject of a Recommended Action.
The draft charter is built off several concepts contained in the 2016 Board action. Significant changes
include:
•

•
•
•
•

Moving the CAC staff support from the Marketing and Communications team to the Board Office,
and specifically designating the Board Office Executive Manager as the primary liaison with the
CAC
Having the CAC review the Board’s work plans before completing its own work plan
Stating the CAC has the ability to develop operating guidelines subject to the approval of the
Board
Empowering the Chair of the Board to call for recruitment of new CAC members to fill vacancies
Requiring the Board and the CAC to revisit the charter in three years

It should be noted that the CAC will continue to receive significant support from the local affairs
consultant Catalyst, and the Board Office Executive Manger remains in close contact with Catalyst and
the CAC Co-Chairs regarding the planning and production of each CAC meeting.
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Values of Customer Excellence and Community Value by
helping to create a sustainable and focused future for one of RTD’s best conduits for public input.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct fiscal impact associated with the Board’s consideration or approval of a Citizens
Advisory Committee Charter.

Subject:

RTD Citizens Advisory Committee

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors change the
name of the RTD FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee to the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee and
revise the structure accordingly.
BACKGROUND
On April 22, 2004, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 5, Series of 2004, directing, in
part, staff to create a FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC). On Dec.13, 2005, the RTD Board
of Directors approved the structure of the CAC including its mission and function, the duties and roles of
its members, the selection process for members, and organizational and meeting procedures for the
committee. On Dec. 16, 2008, the RTD Board of Directors increased the number of members of the
CAC from eleven to seventeen.
Since its creation in 2005, the mission of the CAC has been to review the progress of the FasTracks
Program in relation to established schedules, budget allocations, DBE goals and quality management
guidelines; to provide region-oriented advice to the Board of Directors on issues related to the
implementation of the FasTracks program; to review and provide comment on the DRCOG SB208
Annual Report; and to promote public awareness and understanding of the voter-approved FasTracks
program and its implementation.
As the District completes more elements of the FasTracks Program, opens five new projects in 2016,
and works to integrate new rail service into existing operations, the issues that input from the CAC
would be relevant and meaningful to the District are increasingly agency-wide.
Therefore, based on the CAC’s individual meetings with board members conducted earlier this year,
input from staff and extensive discussion by the committee, the members of the FasTracks Citizens
Advisory Committee recommend the Board revise the structure for the Citizens Advisory Committee as
follows:
Regional Transportation District
Citizens Advisory Committee
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) is made up of residents
and business persons from around the region. Members are appointed by RTD Board of Directors and
volunteer their time to advise the District on a range of issues that affect citizens and impact the region.
Committee Role
