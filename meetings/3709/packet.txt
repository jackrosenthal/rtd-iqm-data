October 17, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
October 22, 2024

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the attached Director Orientation, Onboarding, and Continuing
Education Policy.
REPRESENTATIVES
Michael Guzman, Secretary
Troy Whitmore, Director, District K
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board of Directors fully supports the education and development of its members. This support is
reflected in the Board’s Bylaws, Governance Manual, and Expense and Reimbursement Policy, which
each reference concepts related to continuous training, development, and education of Board members.
While the concepts of education, training, and development of Directors are touched upon in the above
documents, there is no single unifying Board policy on training expectations for new or continuing Board
members. The lack of a unifying policy was flagged by the Office of the State Auditor (OSA), which
recommended, in its Fiscal Governance Performance Audit of RTD released on Monday, August 5, 2024,
that the Board develop a policy to ensure timely onboarding for incoming Directors and ongoing training
for all Board members. RTD agreed to develop a policy related to onboarding, orientation, and continuing
education (draft policy) and implement it by December 2024.
OSA’s recommendation aligned with the work the Board had begun during the Thursday, June 20,
2024, Executive Committee meeting, in which the Committee provided consensus support for the Chair
to select two Directors to partner with the Board Office to develop a draft policy. Subsequently, Chair
Erik Davidson asked Secretary Michael Guzman and Director Troy Whitmore to engage in the
development of the draft policy with assistance from the Board Office.
To develop the draft policy, the project collaborators met with and sought feedback from relevant
resources. Board Office staff have met with Secretary Guzman and Director Whitmore three times and

Packet Pg. 6

1.3.1

collaborated further via email. The draft policy was also shared with the General Manager and CEO
(GM/CEO) for her input and feedback. The Board Office consulted with industry peers by way of the
American Public Transportation Association’s (APTA) APTA Connect discussion portal for further input
and reviewed notes from the July 2024 APTA Transit Board Administrators Seminar session on new
board member onboarding. Additionally, Secretary Guzman leaned heavily on research he conducted
across the national transit landscape for a presentation on board member orientation, onboarding, and
training he delivered during the Latinos in Transit annual Leadership Summit held in Portland, Oregon in
September 2024.
This discussion item was introduced as a discussion item during the Thursday, September 19, 2024,
Executive Committee meeting. Directors in attendance provided feedback during the meeting.
Subsequently, the Board Office circulated the draft policy to the full Board via email, and several
Directors responded with additional feedback. That feedback was then incorporated into the version
coming before the Board for action.
DISCUSSION
The draft policy details expectations for Directors, orientation objectives, onboarding objectives, training
topics, training methods, training resources, tours of RTD property, training schedule, staff
responsibilities, board responsibilities, and feedback and evaluation processes.
Should the Board adopt the draft policy, the Board Office will begin collaborating with the GM/CEO as
well as staff subject matter experts to set the 2025 training schedule for incoming Directors. Likewise,
the Board Office will prepare and distribute both an assessment survey for Directors and a survey to
RTD’s subject matter experts to assist in identifying topics for continuing education for Directors in
2025. During the November Executive Committee meeting scheduled for Thursday, November 21, 2024,
staff anticipates the Executive Committee will discuss the results of the aforementioned surveys to
establish the Board’s continuing education topics for 2025.
This recommended action aligns with the Strategic Priority of Community Value, as Board member
training and development leads to more effective representation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact associated with the adoption of the draft policy.

DIRECTOR ORIENTATION, ONBOARDING,
AND CONTINUING EDUCATION POLICY
ADOPTED: TBDOctober 22, 2024
I.

PURPOSE

To set forth guidelines for the orientation, onboarding, new Director training and Director continuing education
(collectively called "training") of Directors to ensure they receive and nurture a common understanding of the
agency's critical elements to make informed policy and governance decisions.
II.

SCOPE

This policy applies to all members of the Board of Directors, and sets expectations for the Board Office, General
Manager and CEO, as well as subject matter experts on RTD’s staff..
III. EXPECTATIONS OF DIRECTORS
Directors must each individually take the initiative and responsibility for their own respective training. Their
active participation is integral to the agency’s governance and oversight. This includes attending all training,
being punctual, prepared, and actively engaged.
Training calendars will be circulated in advance to facilitate Directors meeting their obligation to attend and
actively participate in training sessions.
Per the Board’s Expense and Reimbursement Policy, all Directors have access to and are strongly encouraged to
use funds to travel to and attend conferences focused on continuing education for transit board members. New
Directors are particularly encouraged to attend the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) Transit
Board Member and Administrator (TBM/TBA) Seminar and the APTA Legislative Conference in the first two years
of their term, as these events provide crucial insights into governance best practices and valuable transit industry
networking opportunities.
The Board recognizes that Directors are elected and, as such, may come to the Board with varying levels of skills
and knowledge. The Board will actively work to identify opportunities for its collective knowledge and talent to
grow, identify Directors willing and able to develop relevant skills and expertise on behalf of the Board and invest
in their subsequent development.
IV. ORIENTATION
The following activities and sessions will help orient new Directors to RTD and their roles on the Board.
Welcome by General Manager and Chief Executive Officer (GM/CEO): Shortly after their election, each
new Director will have the opportunity to meet one-on-one with the GM/CEO. These meetings are intended to
help develop a positive working relationship and provide a broad orientation to RTD, ensuring that new Directors
are well-prepared for their roles.
Introduction to RTD by Leadership Team: The GM/CEO Executive Office will coordinate a cohesive crossmatrix departmental overview introduction of members of the Leadership Team. This introduction will highlight

the RTD website, a comprehensive resource that includes trip planning webpages related to fares, schedules,
NextRide, Trip Planner, service alerts, parking, RTD’s transit services (bus, light rail, commuter rail, paratransit,
[i.e., ADA complementary service branded Access-a-Ride and supplemental and premium paratransit service
branded, Access-on-Demand], micro-transit, [branded FlexRide], and RTD’s Partnership Program), service
changes, and customer care.

V.

ONBOARDING OBJECTIVES

Onboarding will focus on helping new Directors understand their roles and responsibilities as Board Members
and provide them with a baseline understanding of the agency.

with the Executive Manager of the Board Office, will inform each Director of their expectations, and introduce
them to their roles and responsibilities, fiduciary duties, policy/governance, oversight of the GM/CEO, supervision
of the Executive Manager of the Board Office, two-way advocacy role, Board Bylaws, Board Operating Guidelines,
the roles of the Board’s standing committees, Director expectations, best practices for constituent engagement,

duties and obligations, Board Office administration, expense accounts and reporting, agency responses, Director
travel, and RTD provided technology set-up.
VI. NEW DIRECTOR TRAININGS AND TRAINING TOPICS
The current list of training topics is based on previous Director onboarding sessions and feedback from Directors
and staff Subject Matter Experts. The list includes topics critical to the Board’s policy decision-making. Topics
may be combined with similar or complementary issues to capture efficiencies and synergies in the training
program. Each bolded training topic is followed by a list of subtopics to be covered in the training.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Monthly Government Relations Report – October 2024

October 17, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2024 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board-adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections.
It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and federal elected
officials. To achieve these goals, Board members and staff must be proactive in educating and informing
the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared goals.
In furtherance of the program, the agency’s Government Relations Officer coordinates and develops
strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve as a point of contact
for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable government relations highlights at the federal, state, and local levels since
the last Executive Committee meeting held on Thursday, September 19, 2024. This report was prepared
on October 7, 2024, and will be updated verbally as needed during the Executive Committee meeting
scheduled for Thursday, October 17, 2024.
Federal
On September 26, 2024, President Biden signed a Continuing Resolution passed by Congress to fund
federal programs and departments through December 20, 2024. Congress is not likely to resume work
or negotiate another funding bill until after the general election on Tuesday, November 5, 2024.
On Saturday, October 4, 2024, RTD, the City and County of Denver, and the City of Aurora celebrated
the groundbreaking and grant funding by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) for the East Colfax

Packet Pg. 19

1.5.1

Bus Rapid Transit Project (project) through the FTA’s Capital Investment Grant Program. The grant
award of $150 million for project construction, which was graciously supported by members of
Colorado’s Congressional Delegation who represent the project area, is the maximum allowed under
federal law for the grant category and represents the largest discretionary grant award anywhere in the
State of Colorado out of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also referred to as the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law.
State
General Manager and CEO Johnson and Chair Davidson presented in accordance with RTD’s statutorily
required update to the Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) on Wednesday, September
25, 2024. Topics covered during the presentation included an agency overview; the 2023-24 Strategic
initiatives of Back to Basics, People Power, and Welcoming Transit Environment; community and
paratransit survey results; the agency’s financial outlook; RTD’s performance dashboard; rail and transit
funding coordination; and legislative requests.
During the September 25, 2024, TLRC meeting, the committee voted to advance five bills for
introduction during the 2025 regular legislative session. Three of the bills involve policy related to public
transportation. A brief summary of each bill is included herein. RTD staff has no immediate concerns
related to the TLRC approved bills.
1. Increase Transportation Mode Choice Reduce Emissions – This bill requires the Colorado
Department of Transportation (CDOT) to conduct a mode choice assessment and establish
targets to increase the use of travel modes that promote the reduction of greenhouse gases, as
well as other goals. RTD is defined in the bill as a subject transit provider and is required to
develop a mode choice implementation plan that aligns with CDOT’s targets.
2. Railroad Investigative Report Confidentiality - The bill repeals the requirement that investigative
reports of railroads made for the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in the Department
of Regulatory Agencies be kept confidential and gives the CPUC authority to create rules making
certain ongoing investigations and security information confidential.
3. Paratransit Services – The bill requires RTD and other providers of paratransit in Colorado to
coordinate with local emergency management, ensure fare collection is comparable to the fixedroute system, and conduct an impact analysis and public outreach process if paratransit services
are reduced.
Local
At the local level, staff continues to actively arrange engagement opportunities with local municipal
partners. On Monday, September 2, 2024, RTD staff held a region-wide Subregional Service Council
(SSC) meeting. SSC meetings are attended by transportation staff representing the municipalities and
counties that RTD serves. The September 2 meeting provided an opportunity for attendees to engage in
discussion on a range of issues and for staff to answer questions from SSCs representatives.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Draft Legislative and Government Relations Program

October 17, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
As part of the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, staff initiated a process to develop and implement an annual
Legislative and Government Relations Program. The Board of Directors approved the agency’s first
Legislative and Government Relations Program in October 2021. The Legislative and Government
Relations Program is adopted by the Board of Directors annually and serves as a guiding document for
Government Relations staff, and external advocates, to pursue goals related to legislation and policy
matters. Additionally, the Legislative and Government Relations Program serves as an organizing
document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to provide an avenue for Board-adopted
policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
DISCUSSION
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative and Government Relations Program are
designed to make lives better through connections. It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to
the region’s local, state, and federal elected officials. To achieve the adopted goals, RTD must be
proactive in education and inform the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities
available to advance shared goals. Equally important is building trust through partnership that fits within
the framework of RTD’s financial forecast. The 2025 Draft Legislative and Government Relations
Program, included as Attachment A to this Board report, outlines priority actions on a variety of issues
that staff believe are achievable through advocacy and collaboration.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
While enacted legislation may create a financial impact on RTD, the Board’s approval of this document
has no immediate financial impact on the agency.

2025 Legislative and Government Relations Program
PURPOSE
To establish a set of Board-approved legislative and advocacy policies that benefit the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) and assist in guiding staff’s actions and efforts during the 2024 legislative
session that support the priorities and success outcomes of the agency’s adopted 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan.
STRATEGY
Developing and maintaining relationships with myriad stakeholders is central to RTD’s strategic
approach to government relations. Staff will work to communicate, educate, inform and partner with
the agency’s Congressional delegation, the Governor’s Office, the state General Assembly delegation,
and local elected officials to advocate for Board approved policies.
Additionally, staff will continue to work with its industry associations – such as the America Public
Transportation Association (APTA), the Colorado Association of Transit Agencies (CASTA), regional
transportation management organizations/associations (TMOs/TMAs), Chambers of Commerce, and
other stakeholder organizations – to partner and collaborate on shared goals to advance and seek
support for legislative positions approved by the Board. Specifically included within this strategy is staff’s
collaboration with the Board of Directors to utilize relationships to advance policies. Lastly, tactics
included in the Legislative Program will be guided and informed by the priorities set forth in the agency’s
Board-approved 2021-2026 Strategic Plan – Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, Financial Success.
EXECUTION PLAN
Contained herein are specific priorities and actions that outline areas of focus for the 2024 Legislative
and Government Relations Program. Beyond the actions listed in this program, specific legislative
matters are likely to arise that warrant consideration by the Board of Directors.
To allow staff flexibility for consideration of items to be changed, added, or deleted as a result of
legislation introduced during the legislative session, the recommended change must be presented to the
Board as part of the Executive Committee or another committee deemed appropriate by the General
Manager/CEO and Board Chair. If time does not allow for an item to be agendized for a committee
meeting for discussion by the Board, RTD will remain neutral on the legislation in question.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Proposed Bylaw Amendments to Update Descriptions of
the Executive and Performance Committees

October 17, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVES
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Executive Committee approved its 2024 work plan during the committee meeting held on Thursday,
March 21, 2024. The work plan called for the Executive Committee to review its role as described in the
Bylaws in September 2024. However, that conversation was delayed to allow for further time to
develop proposed amendments to the description of the Performance Committee in response to the
Office of the State Auditor’s (OSA) Fiscal Governance Performance Audit. These changes are now being
brought forward together for the Board’s review and discussion.
The Fiscal Governance Performance Audit, released on Monday, August 5, 2024, contained a number of
recommendations for RTD. Recommendations 6 and 7 relate to the Performance Committee, and RTD’s
responses to those recommendations indicated the Board would consider a Bylaws amendment to clarify
the Board’s role in both receiving updates related to the agency’s strategic plan and approving certain
changes to the strategic plan.
DISCUSSION
The committee is asked to review and discuss the proposed descriptions of the Executive and
Performance committees in the attached redline and final draft versions of the Board’s Bylaws.
Following the Committee’s discussion, the Board Office will solicit further input from the Board via
email. The final proposed Bylaw amendments will return to the Executive Committee in November 2024
as a Recommended Action. To be adopted, proposed amendments to the Bylaws must receive an
affirmative vote of 10 or more Directors.
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value and Customer Excellence, as
clarifying the roles of the Board’s committees allows the Board to more efficiently accomplish its work
on behalf of the community and customers RTD serves.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The proposed bylaw amendments do not have a financial impact.

PREAMBLE
The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created by the Regional Transportation District
Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly,
First Regular Session, 1969). The District is a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, with those powers
specifically granted and those reasonably implied from the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the
objects and purposes of the District.
The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly conferred by the RTD Act, at § 329-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD
Act, while others are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the Board. For
convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or other laws, together with those that are
adopted under delegated authority, are combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any
omission from them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty, or responsibility
to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the RTD Act or other applicable laws as they
now exist or may be amended.
ARTICLE I – DEFINITIONS

First Regular Session, 1969). The District is a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, with those powers
specifically granted and those reasonably implied from the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the
objects and purposes of the District.
The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly conferred by the RTD Act, at § 329-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD
Act, while others are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the Board. For
convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or other laws, together with those that are
adopted under delegated authority, are combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any
omission from them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty, or responsibility
to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the RTD Act or other applicable laws as they
now exist or may be amended.
ARTICLE I – DEFINITIONS
The terms “district,” “board,” “director,” “publication,” “mass transportation system,” and other terms defined in
the RTD Act, and used in these Bylaws, shall have the same meaning as in the RTD Act unless the context clearly

the Office of the State Auditor in 2009 and 2010 and reported to the state Legislative Audit Committee in March
2010.
ARTICLE II – BOARD OF DIRECTORS
All powers, privileges, and duties vested in or imposed upon the District shall be exercised and performed by and
through the Board, whether set forth specifically or implied in these Bylaws. The Board may delegate to officers
and employees of the District any or all executive, administrative, and ministerial powers.

Committee Meeting Date:
Bank Signature Authorization

September 13, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
September 28, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization to authorize
certain staff members to sign payments exceeding certain thresholds regarding checks, automated
clearing house payments, and wire transfers and to remove the requirement that Board Officers provide
wet signatures for certain payments.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Throughout RTD’s procurement, invoicing and payment processes, several internal budgetary controls
serve to prevent incorrect payments including a robust approval process that must conform with the
Board appropriated budget.
Signature authorizations for certain large payments are one such control. Payment thresholds have been
established that require specific signatures for these payments to be processed by the Accounts Payable
Division and RTD’s commercial bank, currently Wells Fargo.
Board approval is currently necessary to designate which individuals may sign these payments and to
authorize them to do so. Current practice requires a signature from an authorized staff member as well
as a Board Officer for payments of $100,000 and above. This requires a Board Officer to provide wet
signatures for these payments at least once a week.
Budgetary controls prevent the issuance of payments without explicit prior authorization; by definition,
spending authority for any pending payment that currently requires Board Officer signature has already
been granted, either under the Board’s authority or that of the General Manager and CEO GM/CEO,
meaning that a wet signature is in essence perfunctory.
Wells Fargo relies on a positive pay system in which requests for disbursements by customers must
match payment files received from RTD in order to avoid fraud. Wells Fargo does not review payment
requests for correct signatures or the number of signatures but does require authorized signatories to
complete a separate Wells Fargo form “signature card” for their record of authorized individuals.

Packet Pg. 75

Attachment: Bank Signature Authorization (5016 : Proposed Bylaw Amendments to Update Descriptions of the Executive and Performance

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Currently, the Accounts Payable Division processes approximately 400 checks, Automated Clearing
House (ACH) transfers and wire payments each week, of which approximately 10 such transactions
require a wet signature from a Board Officer under current practices.
In order to obtain a wet signature from a Board member, this process requires that the Accounts Payable
Division send these payment requests from the District Shops facility to the Blake Street offices twice a
week to obtain signatures, which necessitates additional administrative efforts and record-keeping and
can result in delayed payment to vendors.
DISCUSSION
Aligned with the Strategic Priority of Financial Success, RTD takes very seriously the management of all
financial resources, this Recommended Action seeks Board approval to remove the requirement for Board
Officer signatures for checks, ACH transfers and wire payments.
Best practices for payment authorization are included in RTD’s internal control process. Obtaining
additional signatures from Board creates additional burdens for staff as well as for the Board member
who must travel to the Blake Street offices to provide payment signatures.
Both Wells Fargo and Plante Moran, RTD’s external auditor, have independently confirmed that requiring
a second signature from a Board Officer is a highly uncommon practice and does not enhance controls.
In approving this Recommended Action, the Board duly authorizes the GM/CEO, the Chief Financial
Officer, the Chief Operations Officer, and the Chief Administrative Officer to continue to approve
payments within their designated signing authority.
Any future change to the staff positions authorized as bank signatories requires Board approval.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of this Recommended Action.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Meeting Calendar

October 17, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Each fall, the Executive Committee reviews the Board’s meeting calendar for the following year.
DISCUSSION
Except as described herein, pursuant to the meeting schedule outlined in the Board Bylaws, standing
committee meetings will be held the second Tuesday and Wednesday of each month, regular Board
Meetings will be held on the fourth Tuesday of each month, and no standing committee or Board
meetings will be scheduled for August or December of a given year.
Exceptions to the standard meeting cadence are as follows:
•
•
•
•
•

•

In January, the first meeting of the year, a Special Board Meeting, will be held on Tuesday,
January 7th, shifting the regular meeting cycle to begin the third week of the month.
In April, in consideration of Passover, the Executive Committee and Board Meeting has been
pushed back to the fourth and fifth weeks of the month.
In May, in consideration of the Monday, May 26th Memorial Day Holiday, the Board Meeting will
be held on Wednesday, May 28th.
In July, a tentative mid-year retreat date has been scheduled for Saturday, July 26th.
In September, in consideration of the 2025 APTA TRANSform Conference and Rosh Hashanah,
the Executive Committee and Board Meeting has been pushed back to the fourth and fifth weeks
of the month respectively.
To accommodate the Thanksgiving holiday, the regular November Board meeting will be held on
first Tuesday in December, which is Tuesday, December 2nd.

While other potential scheduling conflicts exist between the Board’s meeting calendar and the proposed
scheduling of large-scale transit industry conferences, such as the APTA Mobility Conference and the
APTA Transit Board Member/Board Support Conference, the timing of such events is anticipated to
allow for full Director and agency leadership participation in most instances.

Packet Pg. 87

1.5.4

The calendar, once finalized, will demonstrate the agency’s commitment to meet the RTD Strategic
Priorities of Community Value and Employee Ownership.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the Executive Committee’s review of the 2025 Board
meeting calendar.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Investment Policy

October 8, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
October 22, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2025 Investment Policy
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Each year staff presents the proposed Investment Policy for the upcoming fiscal year in accordance with
Fiscal Policy requirements. The Investment Policy may be amended by the Board at any time.
The purpose of the Investment Policy is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment of RTD’s operating funds, debt proceeds and reserve funds.
The primary objectives of RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2)
sufficient liquidity to meet known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield to achieve a market rate of
return. Although RTD must legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised
Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1), this Investment Policy is more conservative in order to achieve the
Strategic Priority of Financial Success.
The most recent modification to the Investment Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in
October 2023 for the 2024 fiscal year.
DISCUSSION
Staff has identified minor grammatical changes to the Investment Policy as shown in the attached. This
2025 Investment Policy has also been reviewed by legal counsel as well as RTD’s municipal advisor to
ensure adherence to state statutes and efficient investment management. No other changes have been
identified at this time.
Staff is performing analyses regarding the efficacy of the application of the current state statutory
requirements regarding allowable investments for governmental agencies to determine if there are
opportunities that could provide material improvements to RTD’s ability to garner improved investment
returns while maintaining safety of principal.

Packet Pg. 90

2.17.A

In addition, staff is considering alternatives regarding the accounting for investment income associated
with federal funds that would effectively segregate them from other investment income for purposes of
mitigating impacts from TABOR revenue growth limitations in 2025.
As this research is finalized, staff will return to the Board with any recommended changes to the Fisal
Policy and/or Investment Policy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this action item.

2025 INVESTMENT POLICY

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District.
2. SCOPE
This investment policy applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of RTD
(collectively, the Portfolio).
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through Board-approved bond resolutions or indentures
of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated for
investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Subject: 2025 Investment Policy
Page 2

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value
of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
•

Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD, thereby
reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open market prior
to maturity

The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification and
purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard to
insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of
the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual investments
as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses are
inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

3.2 Liquidity

2.17.A.a

Subject: 2025 Investment Policy
Page 3

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market
price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will
hereinafter be referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation
by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees

and investment officials shall disclose to the GM/CEO any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any material
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.

Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(NRSROs) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating category
(AA) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2 and
Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is downgraded below
the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio, the CFO will review
the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates of
indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 100%
of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum maturity for
investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities: Obligations, participations or other
instruments of any Federal agency, instrumentality or United States government-sponsored
enterprise as described in CRS 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an “Agency” or “Agencies”). Such
securities shall be rated in one of the two highest rating categories (as described above in
the Credit Criteria section) by at least two NRSROs. No more than 75% of the Portfolio
may be invested in Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities, with no more than 25%
being invested in a single issuer. Subordinate debt of any issuer is not authorized. The

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment precludes
pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices. However,
fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where securities
may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to reinvest
proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,
the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When

Attachment: RTD 2025 Investment Policy (5003 : 2025 Investment Policy)

No more than 50% of the Portfolio may be invested in repurchase agreements and no more
than 10% may be invested with a single counterparty. The maximum maturity for a
repurchase agreement shall be limited to 90 days.

2.17.A.a

Subject: 2025 Investment Policy
Page 8

purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in
the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.
6.3 Portfolio Duration

6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized
to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from
those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary
dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody
With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment

Attachment: RTD 2025 Investment Policy (5003 : 2025 Investment Policy)

The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.

2.17.A.a

Subject: 2025 Investment Policy
Page 9

All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Staff will include an annual listing of investments held and investment returns within the Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report.
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the average maturity of the investment
portfolio.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return, commensurate
with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the composition of the
Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various indices may be used to
monitor investment performance.
The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash equivalents)
is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the
designated performance benchmark is the ICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns which
may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this Policy
“bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of participation or
other financial securities issued by RTD.

Attachment: RTD 2025 Investment Policy (5003 : 2025 Investment Policy)

8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy, denoting
any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

20254 INVESTMENT POLICY

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of RTD
(collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through Board-approved bond resolutions or indentures
of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated for
investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Attachment: RTD 2025 Investment Policy - Red Line (5003 : 2025 Investment Policy)

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 20254

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Subject: 20254 Investment Policy
Page 2

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value
of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD, thereby
reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open market prior
to maturity

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification and
purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard to
insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of
the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual investments
as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by law."

Attachment: RTD 2025 Investment Policy - Red Line (5003 : 2025 Investment Policy)

•

RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses are
inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will
hereinafter be referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls

Attachment: RTD 2025 Investment Policy - Red Line (5003 : 2025 Investment Policy)

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market
price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation
by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating
category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and
Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is
downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio,
the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to
sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates of
indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 100%
of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum maturity for

program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the GM/CEO any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any materiallarge
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.

2. Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities: Obligations, participations or other
instruments of any Federal agency, instrumentality or United States government-sponsored
enterprise as described in CRS 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an “Agency” or “Agencies”). Such

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment precludes
pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices. However,
fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where securities
may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to reinvest
proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.

Attachment: RTD 2025 Investment Policy - Red Line (5003 : 2025 Investment Policy)

No more than 50% of the Portfolio may be invested in repurchase agreements and no more
than 10% may be invested with a single counterparty. The maximum maturity for a
repurchase agreement shall be limited to 90 days.

6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,

Subject: 20254 Investment Policy
Page 8

the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in
the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.

The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized
to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from
those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary
dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody
With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.

Attachment: RTD 2025 Investment Policy - Red Line (5003 : 2025 Investment Policy)

6.3 Portfolio Duration

For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.

7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Staff will include an annual listing of investments held and investment returns within the Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report.
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the average maturity of the investment
portfolio.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return, commensurate
with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the composition of the
Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various indices may be used to
monitor investment performance.
The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash equivalents)
is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the
designated performance benchmark is the ICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns which
may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this Policy
“bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of participation or
other financial securities issued by RTD.

Attachment: RTD 2025 Investment Policy - Red Line (5003 : 2025 Investment Policy)

8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL

any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Fiscal Policy

October 8, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
October 22, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2025 Fiscal Policy.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Fiscal Policy establishes the financial control framework and governance of the Agency financial
resources for that year. Staff presents the proposed Fiscal Policy annually for the Board’s consideration
for the upcoming fiscal year. Once approved by the Board of Directors, it may be amended by the Board
at any time.
The most recent modification to the Fiscal Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in October
2023 for the 2024 fiscal year. The Fiscal Policy determines the parameters within which the Proposed
Annual Budget is developed as well as parameters within which financial activities are performed.
Proposed changes to the Fiscal Policy are recommended to the Board to address current and emerging
issues including those that result from regulatory, compliance, or legislative changes, audit
recommendations, as well as Board-directed changes, or changes addressing fiscal sustainability, best
practices or other requisite sources.
Staff presented a 2025 Fiscal Policy discussion item to the Finance and Planning Committee on May 14,
2024, and again on July 23, 2024, which provided initial proposed modifications for Board
consideration.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this Recommended Action is to approve the recommended modifications to the Fiscal
Policy for 2025.
Recognizing that the Board approved a TABOR ballot initiative on June 25, 2024, for the November 5,
2024, General Election seeking voter approval for continuation of the existing TABOR exemption,
modifications to the 2025 Fiscal Policy contemplate that TABOR revenue growth limitations will be in
effect beginning in 2025. Should voters approve the TABOR ballot initiative on November 5, 2024, staff
will subsequently propose additional 2025 Fiscal Policy modifications as a result.

Packet Pg. 116

2.17.B

Preliminary recommendations for modifications to the Fiscal Policy are included in the attached
presentation and red-line draft 2025 Fiscal Policy document. These recommendations include the
following:

Fund Balance Policies
o Enhancing the policy documentation regarding the FasTracks Internal Savings Account

Forecast (FYFF) approved by the Board during the monthly Board meeting held on September 23, 2024,
and will be included in the 2025 Proposed Budget, which will be presented to the Finance and Planning
Committee on October 8, 2024, as a discussion item and presented on November 12, 2024, as a
recommended action.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP)

October 9, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
October 22, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) in
accordance with the requirements set forth in 49 CFR Parts 674 and 673 and 4 CCR 723-7, Rule 7345.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Sky Mott, Manager, Safety Management Systems Program Development, Safety and Environmental
Compliance
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires operators of public transportation systems receiving
federal funds through Urbanized Area Formula Grants to develop a Public Transportation Agency Safety
Plan (PTASP). This plan must include the processes and procedures necessary for implementing a Safety
Management System (SMS).
While the FTA maintains regulatory authority over PTASP compliance, the Colorado Public Utilities
Commission (CPUC), as the designated State Safety Oversight Agency, has primary responsibility for
enforcing program standards under both federal and state law. CPUC regulations mandate that the
agency update its PTASP annually, and the CPUC is responsible for approving the PTASP and certifying
to the FTA that it complies with current requirements.
DISCUSSION
The revisions to the 2025 PTASP as compared to the 2024 Board-approved version are:
• Updated Joint Labor-Management Safety Committee and GM/CEO approval prior to Board of
Directors review and approval as required by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)
• Three year rolling average and numerical target for safety performance indicators as reported to
the National Transit Database as required by the BIL
• New Risk Reduction Program and Risk-Based Inspection Program as required by newly
promulgated 49 CFR 673 and 4 CCR-723-7
• Notable continuity with:
o The 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, including mission, vision, values, and strategic priorities
o Current agency structure
o Line management accountability
o Cross-organizational coordination

Packet Pg. 133

2.17.C

o

Incorporation of Roadway Worker Protection (RWP) as required by newly promulgated 49
CFR 673

In approving this PTASP and associated exhibits, the agency complies with federal and state regulatory
requirements.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact related to the adoption of the 2025 PTASP.

Policy

The first element of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) is Safety Policy. This, in its most
simple form, is the safety policy developed, approved, and signed by the Regional Transportation District
(RTD), a multimodal agency comprising bus, light rail, commuter rail, and special services in the Denver
metro area. This element also describes the agency’s commitment to safety; its objectives, safety goals,
and the organizational structure established; and plans written to obtain these goals and objectives.
In August 2021, the RTD Board of Directors adopted a new strategic plan that looks toward the next five
years of the agency’s future. The document — against which all initiatives, projects, and priorities are
measured — serves as a blueprint for success and outlines the intentionality the agency will bring with its
redefined mission: We make lives better through connections.
The strategic plan was developed by General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson and RTD’s
executive leadership team in concert with the agency’s 15-member Board of Directors. It establishes four
strategic priorities — community value, customer excellence, employee ownership, and financial
success — that serve as functional pillars to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure overall performance.
Development of the PTASP was completed in accordance with the strategic plan; Title 49 Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) Parts 672, 673, and 674; and Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) State Safety
Oversight (SSO) Program Procedures and Standards.
The agency has adopted a Safety Management System (SMS) approach to administering safety throughout
the organization. SMS is flexible and scalable and consists of four elements:
SMS Element

Description

Safety Policy

Definition of safety policies, procedures, and organizational structure

Safety Risk Management

Formal process for management of hazards to an acceptable level of risk

Safety Assurance

Establishment of process measures, assessments, and controls to assess the
effectiveness of risk control strategies

Safety Promotion

Safety training and risk communication practices to promote a culture of safety

1.1.2

Authority

RTD is a special transportation district and political subdivision of the state of Colorado and is authorized
under Colorado Revised Statutes Title 32, Article 9. As such, the district has its own taxing authority and
operates within the counties of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, Jefferson, and
Weld. The agency is governed by its elected Board of Directors and managed by the GM/CEO, who
develops and implements a comprehensive and integrated PTASP. To that end, the GM/CEO, by signature
authority of the district’s Safety Policy Statement, has authorized the RTD chief safety officer (CSO) to
develop and implement a PTASP as an operating document of the agency for the operations of light rail,
bus and paratransit.

Packet Pg. 145

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) recognizes the CPUC as the state safety oversight agency for RTD.
CPUC is FTA’s certified state safety oversight agency (SSOA), working cooperatively to regulate RTD’s light
rail transit, by ensuring compliance with state and federal requirements, regulations, and guidance,
as applicable.
The FTA functions as both a funding administrator and as a federal regulator as defined by 49 CFR Parts
670, 672, 673, and 674. The FTA conducts regular reviews of the SSOA, to determine the SSO’s and RTD’s
compliance to the FTA’s general requirements. RTD’s light rail service is regulated by the FTA and CPUC.

1.1.3

Policy Statement

As the accountable executive for all operations and activities, I will ensure that resources are available to
make the SMS robust and successful. Executive leadership will take steps to prevent workplace incidents,
injuries, and illnesses and will provide support of safety program initiatives. The agency will consider
employee suggestions for achieving a safer, healthier workplace; keep informed about workplace safety
and health hazards; and regularly review the agency’s safety programs.
The agency is committed to:
●

Integrating safety management among the primary responsibilities of all managers and employees

●

Clearly defining accountabilities, expectations, and responsibilities for the delivery of SMS
performance for all levels of staff

●

Collaborating with the Joint Labor Management Safety Committee to identify safety risks and
mitigations

●

Supporting the SMS with appropriate human and financial resources

●

Developing an organizational culture that fosters safe practices, and encourages effective
employee safety reporting and communication

●

Enhancing hazard identification, analysis, and safety risk evaluation activities, including an
employee safety reporting program, to eliminate or mitigate the safety risks resulting from all
activities to a level of safety as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP)

●

Complying with federal, state, and agency safety-related requirements, rules, and standards

●

Ensuring that all staff are provided with appropriate safety-related information, equipment, and
training

●

Establishing and measuring our safety performance against realistic, data-driven safety
performance indicators and targets

●

Continuously improving safety performance through management processes that ensure
appropriate actions are taken and ensure effectiveness

●

Ensuring externally supplied systems and services meet the agency’s safety
performance standards

Managers and supervisors are responsible for communicating this policy to employees supervising
and training workers in safe work practices. They are expected to reinforce safe work, behaviors,
and compliance with agency safety rules and work to eliminate hazardous conditions. Managers and
supervisors will lead safety efforts by example.

All employees are expected and encouraged to participate in safety activities, including reporting hazards,
unsafe work practices, near misses, and accidents immediately to their supervisor or a safety committee/
department representative.
Disciplinary action will not be taken against an employee who acts to prevent an injury or who reports any
accident, incident, near miss, concern, or hazard to any level of management. All employees are required
to abide by the standards and procedures set forth in the SMS policy and the PTASP. Behaviors such as
illegal activity, negligence, acts of willful misconduct, or undue care and attention shall be considered
outside the scope of this policy.
The SMS Program is managed under my authority by the CSO, who has direct access to me. All levels of
management and all employees are accountable for the delivery of the highest level of safety performance,
starting with the General Manager and CEO.

2.17.C.a

The overall consideration in the development of the agency’s PTASP is to provide safe and reliable
movement of customers throughout the transit system. Customers and the general public must be
confident that the RTD transit system is a safe system. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to design,
construct, operate, and maintain a system that aims to reduce recognized hazards as much as practicable
with the safety of employees, customers, and the general public in mind. The agency’s objectives will be
met by drawing information from system observation, local and state codes, federal guidelines, and specific
agency requirements into an SMS to ensure a safe transportation system.
The agency will track the following Safety Risk Reduction Program performance measures as required by
the National Public Transportation Safety Plan:
●

Fatalities (total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode)

●

Injuries (total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode)

●

Major Safety Events (total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by
mode)

●

System Reliability (mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode)

Agency Safety Policies

Guided by the principles contained in this PTASP, the CSO, under the direction of the GM/CEO, develops,
reviews, and updates safety and risk control policies, processes, and procedures. These policies set the
framework for guiding the SMS. All agency safety policies are available on the intranet.

1.2.3

Integrating Safety into All Aspects of RTD

The objective of the SMS is the continual improvement of processes and operations to maximize safety to
the highest practicable level. This effort is undertaken by providing continual opportunities for employees
to be reminded of safety, incorporate safe practices into their operations, and supply each employee with
multiple means to identify potential hazards.
The agency accomplishes this through safety training, safety moments at meetings, safety committee
meetings, weekly safety messages, safety campaigns, identification and mitigation of hazards, and
proactive reviews and inspections to identify potential hazards.
Within different departments, multiple means of incorporating safety concerns or representation
are presented. As examples:
● Safety and Environmental Compliance representative is a part of Planning Department
meetings to plan for safety in new projects at the earliest opportunity
●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative participates in Transit Oriented Development
meetings to identify and raise safety concerns

●

In new construction projects, safety is considered in the Design and Construction Meeting, System
Safety Working Group, Activation Committee and/or other processes where relevant

●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative is in the Technology Advisory Group
regarding the selection and implementation of new technology programs

●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative works with Communications for signage,
vehicle wraps, handouts, billboards, advertisements, and social media to maximize safety
messages to the community

●

Safety is incorporated into training in divisions, such as Roadway Worker Protection, Safety
Management System, and Security/Incident Command Structure training

●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative reviews procurements that involve safetysensitive products or services and ensures proper safety language is in all contracts

RTD Board of Directors and Executive Leadership

RTD was created by the Colorado General Assembly in 1969 for the purpose of providing a public mass
transportation system for residents of the district. The agency began operations in 1972. A 15-member
elected Board of Directors is the legislative body for the agency and determines all questions of overall
governance and policy. The Board of Directors appoints the GM/CEO, who is ultimately responsible for safety.
The GM/CEO has full charge of the acquisition, construction, maintenance, and operations of the system
and facilities of the agency, and of the administration of business affairs. The GM/CEO supervises executive
leadership, including chief officers and AGMs. Included among these officers is the chief operations
officer (COO), who is responsible for bus, rail and paratransit operations. The Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division has the responsibility for agency safety. The Safety and Environmental Compliance
Division reports monthly to the GM/CEO.
The following activities ensure that safety goals and objectives are achieved:
●

Perform timely review of accident and incident investigation summary reports to identify trends and
recommend corrective action to minimize loss

●

Review reports of system standard operating procedures (SOPs) and rules for compliance with
established guidelines

●

Review summary reports regarding periodic equipment and facility inspections, and system
hazard analysis

●

Promote safety awareness by incorporating customer and employee involvement

1.3.2

Management — Key Role in Safety Overview

The SMS will be incorporated into every aspect of transit services, by rail and bus service managers. Safe
operations of the bus and rail divisions are the responsibility of the AGMs. Each department has an AGM or
chief officer, who, along with senior managers, managers, and supervisors, is responsible for implementing
policies and procedures for safe operations. The AGMs of the rail and bus divisions have charged their
management teams to effectively manage safety; to develop safety programs, plans, procedures, training,
policies and rules to govern safety; and to fully comply with the PTASP. Bus and rail maintenance facilities
are staffed with a Manager of Maintenance responsible for the safe operation of their employees within
the facility and are supported by Shift Supervisors and maintenance workers. The agency models policies,
procedures, and processes for occupational safety and health on Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) regulations.
Supervisors’ responsibilities place them at the forefront of safety efforts. A significant portion of their duties
is monitoring, ensuring, and emphasizing safety performance and rules compliance and promoting a strong
safety climate. All employees are charged with adhering to safety, but supervisors are the key to improved
safety-related behavior and positive safety outcomes. Supervisors have the responsibility to monitor safety
compliance of their employees and ensure employees understand their job functions and the associated
safety requirements.
Safety and health are managed at all levels of staff. All employees are trained in safety and job duties, and
are given responsibility for their own safety, as well as the safety of the individuals with whom they work.
All employees have the responsibility to halt an operation or stop work if it is deemed to be unsafe. System
safety processes emphasize open and consistent dialogue between leaders and subordinates to increase

Climate/Geography

The Denver metro region normally has a semi-arid continental climate with four well-defined seasons.
Summers are characterized by hot, dry weather, but the high temperatures are usually not oppressive
since the relative humidity is generally low and the nights usually cool. August is the hottest month, with
temperatures reading 90-100 degrees Fahrenheit. Winters are cold but usually not severe. The average
annual snowfall is less than 65 inches at Denver International Airport, but much higher amounts fall in
foothill locations. Precipitation is generally light during the summer and early fall but may be heavy in the
spring when storms from the Pacific Ocean move through the area more frequently than any other season
of the year.
The agency’s transit services extend throughout the Front Range area at a width of approximately 60
miles between Pine Junction and Denver International Airport. The north-south coverage area ranges from
Longmont to Lone Tree, a distance of 70 miles. Service areas include the foothills situated along the Front
Range of the Rocky Mountains. Elevations range from approximately 4,850 feet above sea level to greater
than 9,000 feet above sea level in the foothills.

2.17.C.a

Continuous improvement is defined by the FTA as a process by which a transit agency examines safety
performance to identify safety deficiencies or deficiencies in the agency’s performance against Safety Risk
Reduction Program performance targets and carries out a plan to address the identified
safety deficiencies.
The Leadership Safety Committee and the JLMSC meet regularly throughout the year to review the current
performance of the agency against the safety performance targets and the strategic plan objectives and to
take action to address any safety deficiencies that are identified.
The agency will use the management review cycle (annual PTASP update), Joint Labor Management Safety
Committee review cycle, along with performance data for the SMS to identify and prioritize continuous
improvement of each process. Leadership, from the accountable executive to managers, is involved in this
management review cycle. This method is consistent with SMS principles and allows for the resourcing and
prioritization of SMS efforts.

1.6 SMS Documentation and Records
Documentation and recordkeeping pertinent to each component or subcomponent of SMS is described
in the relevant section of the SMS. This subcomponent will also include changes for the management of
new or revised safety requirements from regulations or otherwise, such as the introduction of minimum
standards for safety. In addition, this subcomponent includes safety data and analyses, delivered to and
used by management for safety-related decision-making.

1.7.1

Emergency Preparedness and Response

The ability to respond quickly and in an organized manner is vital to the continuation of transit service
during a special event, emergency, or recovery from a catastrophic incident, including, but not limited to,
the following:
●

Earthquake

●

Fire

●

Flooding

●

Hazardous material spill

●

Medical emergency

●

Severe weather

●

Pandemic

●

Transit-related accidents

●

Acts of violence

●

Acts of terrorism

The Emergency Operations Base Plan (EOBP) provides a flexible framework for districtwide emergency
management (See Exhibit for Plan). Each mode (light rail, commuter rail, fixed-route and on-demand
bus) will develop and update its specific emergency response plan. These plans detail activities and
responsibilities for personnel. This plan, along with the safety program documents and SSP, describes
coordination of the following emergency preparedness/management activities:
●

Incident management – management of an emergency event or incident is based on the principles
of National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the Incident Command System (ICS). NIMS
principles allow emergency response agencies to communicate with field supervisors and/or
Transit Police Communications

●

Coordination with external agencies – the Chief of Police and Emergency Management is
principally responsible for the coordination of incident management resources with various
emergency service agencies to provide for effective interaction between RTD and those agencies.
Liaising with law enforcement agencies is primarily the responsibility of the CSO, with assistance
from the Chief of Police and Emergency Management with assistance from the CSO

●

Emergency response planning and mitigation – the agency establishes a Fire Life Safety
Committee (FLSC) for each new rail extension or significant transit facility project. The
committee comprises safety and security staff; RTD operations, maintenance, and engineering
representatives; and police, fire, emergency medical, and other area emergency response agency
representatives. The committee reviews transit system designs and recommends fire protection,
life safety and security measures, and procedural response and training needs related to the new
extension or facility project

●

Emergency planning – As a critical transportation provider in the Denver metropolitan area, the
agency is a member of the Regional Emergency Management and the Continuity of Operations
Plan (COOP) and Urban Area Security Initiative. It is the agency’s intent to collaborate with regional
emergency management agencies responsible for emergency preparedness, response, recovery,
and mitigation planning and coordination among the counties and cities in the metropolitan
area, emergency response agencies, utility companies, and other critical groups. The agency,

15

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_FINAL_DIGITAL (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.7 Emergency Preparedness and Response

Packet Pg. 159

with assistance from the FLSC, has developed emergency management operating plans and
procedures to address a wide range of emergency incidents and events, including criminal activity,
earthquakes, fire at transit stations and along the rights-of-way, hazardous materials releases,
medical emergencies, severe weather, terrorism, transportation mishaps, and other emergency
situations occurring within the transit system
●

Emergency preparedness exercises – A minimum of one emergency tabletop or field exercise
across different RTD modes will be planned and conducted annually to ensure the adequacy of
emergency plans and procedures. These may include readiness of personnel to perform under
emergency conditions; effective coordination between RTD and emergency response agencies;
and coordination of regional emergency exercises that are facilitated through use of Tera software
or other means. All exercises are followed by after-action analyses and reports to document
lessons learned and actions needed to improve the agency’s emergency operations capabilities

●

Emergency response training – Frontline RTD transportation and maintenance personnel
will undergo emergency response training to ensure full understanding of their roles and
responsibilities during an emergency incident. The level of training will be based on their
anticipated role during the incident. At a minimum, training is provided on the emergency plans
and procedures that the employee may be required to implement. Training to familiarize fire,
rescue, and other emergency service personnel with special transit system requirements is
coordinated through the FLSC, Transit Police and Emergency Management Department, and Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division staff, with assistance from the Bus and Light Rail Divisions,
as appropriate.

1.7.2

Public Health Emergency Management and Response

The agency will identify mitigations or strategies to minimize the exposure of the public, personnel
and property to hazards and unsafe conditions, and consistent with the guidelines of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or a state or local public health authority, will minimize exposure to
infectious diseases and comply with the CDC and state and local public health orders during public health
emergencies or pandemics.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The second element of the PTASP is risk management process, which addresses how the agency identifies,
assesses, tracks, and mitigates hazards and risk in the agency and on the transit systems for light rail, bus
and paratransit. Tolerable risk levels, performance targets, and mitigation measures are established.

2.1 Risk Management Program
2.1.1

Risk Management

Effective risk management helps the agency serve its customers, employees, and the district by ensuring
that the agency provides excellence in:
●

Community Value

●

Customer Excellence

●

Employee Ownership

●

Financial Success

Executive leadership is committed to:
●

Understanding risk in the context of the frequency (likelihood) and severity (consequence) of
events that can or do happen to guide agency actions that support delivery on the agency’s
objectives within fiscal, ethical, regulatory, and other practical constraints

●

Transparency regarding the tradeoffs between risks, costs, and performance inherent in all decisions

●

Using clearly defined agency strategies, objectives, operational plans, and processes in the
identification, evaluation, mitigation, and acceptance of risk

●

Optimizing limited resources to meet objectives

2.1.2

Hazard Management

Chiefs/AGMs play a key role in the hazard management process and ensure that the process has been fully
integrated within their departments. Chiefs/AGMs also ensure that the following elements of the hazard
management process are present in their departments:
●

Ensure employees can report hazards to management in person or using the electronic hazard
reporting form via the intranet

●

Ensure hazards are placed on a local hazard log for tracking and documentation

●

Represent management, or select designee to represent management, on a local/site committee

●

Ensure each hazard has been assigned to a specific individual/point of contact

●

Packet Pg. 163

2.1.3

Hazard Log / Risk Register

Local site senior managers, managers, and supervisors, along with TSSs, ensure that local hazard logs are
used to track hazards at the departmental level within RTD. These logs are to be maintained within the
department and are reviewed by the local safety committee on a monthly basis. Hazards placed on the
local log receive their initial and final hazard ratings using the Risk Assessment Matrix. These individuals
may give hazards their initial rating when hazards are received and final ratings when they are closed.
This same group may also present hazards to the local safety committee for hazard ratings or employ the
Safety and Environmental Compliance Division for assistance in rating hazards. Hazard ratings may be
changed with new information or as a result of data analysis.
When a hazard is identified as needing mitigation that requires cost or changes beyond that of the local
safety committee or department abilities, the hazard will be elevated to the corresponding Safety and
Environmental Compliance Division Hazard Logs and be reviewed by the SSWG. The SSWG represents key
department managers that can make decisions, employ multiple disciplines, and can influence higher level
budgeted solutions.
TSSs are responsible for the maintenance of hazard logs / risk register. They ensure that hazards meeting
defined criteria are entered into the appropriate category within the hazard reporting system for accurate
record keeping. Hazard rating should be developed with input from the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division, local site senior managers, managers, and supervisors. The following are specific
hazards that are identified and mitigated at the agency level:
●

Unacceptable or undesirable hazards (high and serious hazards)

●

Hazards identified from reviews from outside agencies (CPUC, FTA, OSHA)

●

Hazards identified from accident investigations

●

Hazards with significant property damage

●

High-potential events as determined by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division

2.1.4

Corrective Action Plan (CAP)

CAPs are used for hazards that meet certain criteria:
●

Hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B (high risk), or 1C, 2C, 3A, 3B (serious risk)

●

Findings of noncompliance from internal safety reviews or safety reviews or audits by regulatory
agencies (CPUC, FTA, OSHA)

●

Corrective action resulting from accident investigations

●

High-potential events as determined by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division

In the following instances, CAPs must receive prior approval by the CPUC before mitigation activities
may begin:
●

Hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, or 2B (high risk)

●

Findings from regulatory agencies resulting in non-conformance (CPUC, FTA)

●

Accident investigations requiring corrective action

For testing or reviews of industrial hygiene that potentially exceed Permissible Exposure Limits for hazards
that do not meet the Unacceptable Risk Assessment Codes of 1A, 2A, 1B, or 2B (high risk), SSOA staff will
review and preliminarily approve the CAP before safety risk mitigation activities are implemented.
If an emergency corrective action must be taken immediately to ensure safety, the SSOA must be notified
of the issue immediately, and the agency must follow up with the SSOA for subsequent review and
approval of the corrective action within five business days.
The SSOA will review and provide final approval of all CAPs on a quarterly basis.
CAPs are assigned a specific tracking number by the Electronic Hazard Reporting System and are linked
with their associated hazard. CAPs must contain at a minimum:
●
●

The action(s) to be taken to minimize, control, correct, or eliminate the risks and hazards identified
A person of responsibility for the corrective action

●

A proposed completion date

●

Plan approval when applicable

CAPs are developed by department managers/designee in conjunction with the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division will facilitate the CAP process is
followed and properly track CAPs until closed.

2.1.5

Hazard Process Overview

The hazard process includes all facilities, light rail, and bus systems. The hazard management flowchart
lays out an overall description of how hazards are identified, evaluated, analyzed, controlled or eliminated,
tracked, and reported to leadership and CPUC.
●

TSSs are the primary points of contact for the hazard management process

●

Safety committee members for rail and bus will be able to identify, evaluate, and analyze hazards

●

The TSSs will assist in entering identified hazards into the electronic hazard reporting system

●

The TSS facilitate development of mitigations for each unacceptable and undesirable hazard entry,
identify a point of contact or owner of the hazard, and place this information within the hazard
reporting system for tracking purposes

●

CAPs may also be identified as a result of an incident and investigation

●

Safety committee members also participate in the evaluation and control or elimination of the hazard

●

Hazards must be mitigated at the lowest level possible. However, when a hazard is identified as
having a mitigation that involves multiple departments or requires cost or changes beyond the
safety committee or department abilities or budgets, the hazard is elevated to the SSWG. The
SSWG will represent key department managers, have the capability to employ multiple disciplines,
and can influence higher level budgeted solutions.

●

Recommendations/results from contractor or internal review, testing, or industrial or environmental
sampling results requiring corrective actions will be placed in the hazard log for follow up and
possible need for retesting for compliance with Safety or Environmental requirements. If mitigation
or control of a hazard is not achieved through the SSWG, the hazard mitigation process may be
elevated to the Leadership Safety Committee.

2.1.5.1

Hazard Identification

Identifying hazards is the responsibility of all employees and contractors. The continuous identification,
monitoring, and mitigation of hazards is key to an effective safety program.
Hazard identification methods include, but are not limited to:
●

Observation, inspection, and interaction with all employees and contractors

●

Review of reports from safety committee members, customers, and customer service and field personnel

●

Evaluation of accidents, incidents, and near misses, to include data trends and projections

●

Conducting Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) of a design or new construction

●

Conducting safety certification, system integration testing, pre-revenue testing, system
modification, configuration management verification, and inspection processes

●

Conducting Operation Hazard Analysis (OHA) of revenue operations

●

Review of internal and external safety reviews, inspections, observations, defects, findings,
observations, violations, and reviews

●

Review of controller logs, daily operating clearances/bulletins, and training feedback

●

“Lesson learned” inputs

●

Review of applicable regulatory codes and standards

●

Review of NTSB, FTA, OSHA safety recommendations, guidance, initiatives, and alerts

●

Review of Nonconformance Reports, Corrective Action Reports

●

Review of data and information provided by the SSOA

The Hazard Management Flow Chart (in the attached document as Exhibit E.6) will be followed by
employees in identifying and correcting hazards at the employee/supervisor level. Actions will be taken to
move the hazard to the safety committee and beyond if necessary.

2.1.5.2 Hazard Investigation, Assessment, and Analysis
The agency is currently developing and refining a database where events and observed hazards can
be tracked and analyzed for leading indicators of potential hazards. This will allow management to be
proactive in correcting hazards.
Safety concerns are identified and corrected at the lowest level as soon as practicable. Safety concerns
that are not eliminated at this level are reported to a supervisor or a TSS. Reported concerns will be
assessed by a TSS and/or safety committee to determine if a safety hazard exists and assign an initial
hazard rating. Hazards will be evaluated and risks will be ranked to ensure prioritization for elimination or
control as described in the ORM framework.

2.17.C.a

Packet Pg. 166

2.1.5.3 Causal Factor, Analysis and Event Evaluation
Hazards are investigated following the Event Notification, Reporting and Investigation Policy and Procedure
to determine causal and contributing factors of an event, or hazard, for purpose of preventing recurrence
and mitigating risk. Hazards originating from events are reviewed by TSSs, managers and supervisors, and
respective safety committees. A third-party expert may assist with an investigation if deemed necessary.
The level of investigation and the methodology used will be determined based upon
risk assessments.
HIGH risk hazards (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B) that receive an unacceptable initial hazard analysis made by
management, a safety committee, or a TSS receive immediate attention/control. A high rating requires
corrective action. Hazards that receive a high rating will be elevated from the local hazard log to the
electronic hazard reporting system.
SERIOUS hazards (1C, 2C, 3A, 3B) that are undesirable may require corrective action and decisions by
management. Hazards that receive a serious hazard rating will remain on the local hazard logs no more
than 45 days before being moved to the appropriate Safety and Environmental Compliance Division log.
MEDIUM (1D, 1E, 2D, 3C, 4A, 4B, 5A) hazards may be acceptable with review and documentation by
management.
MODERATE (2E, 3D, 4C, 5B) hazards are acceptable with review.
LOW (3E, 4D, 4E, 5C, 5D, 5E) hazards do not require review and are acceptable.

2.1.5.4 Hazard Reporting Threshold to Colorado Public Utilities Commission
The agency will notify CPUC of all identified hazards in the light rail system during monthly/quarterly
reporting. The agency will notify CPUC in a timely manner of all hazardous conditions that affect the
immediate safety of the light rail system. At a minimum, the agency notifies CPUC not later than 24 hours
from time of discovery or the determination of the risk assessment code, according to the notification
procedures in the CPUC standard, of the rating of the hazardous conditions as High or Serious and set
forth in the transit agency’s Hazard Identification/Resolution Matrix:
●

1A (Catastrophic/Frequent)

●

2A (Severe/Frequent)

●

1B (Catastrophic/Probable)

●

2B (Severe/Probable)

●

1C (Catastrophic/Remote)

The agency is responsible for assigning severity/probability ratings to hazardous conditions.

The agency will include in its hazard log and hazard management process hazardous conditions, incidents,
occurrences, and events, including:
●

Incidents involving individuals working in the RTD-controlled right-of-way that are investigated by the
agency

●

Malfunctions of safety-critical systems that could result, or have resulted, in catastrophic or singlepoint failure

●

Broken or missing safety-critical equipment, infrastructure, or systems that could result, or have
resulted, in employee or customer injury, or damage to the agency property

Exposed energized electrical conductors or equipment that can be contacted by customers or employees

●

Employee or customer electric shock

2.1.5.5 Operational Risk Assessment Matrix
Assessing risk is the process of determining the severity of risk and the probability of the risk being
realized. To ensure risk assessments are consistent, it is important to use a standard definition.
Severity is a quantitative or subjective measure of the worst credible mishap resulting from personnel
error, environmental conditions, design inadequacies and/or procedural efficiencies for system,
subsystem or component failure or malfunction. Severity is categorized as Catastrophic, Severe, Serious,
Limited, or Negligible.
Probability is defined as the likelihood of the number of times that a specific event will occur during
the planned life expectancy of a system. A risk probability may be derived from the analysis of a transit
system’s operating experience, evaluation of safety historical data, or the analysis of reliability and failure
data. Probability is categorized as Frequent, Probable, Remote, Improbable or Highly Improbable.

Using the determined severity and probability, the risk assessment matrix is used to determine the risk
index. The risk ratings will be labeled as High, Serious, Medium, Moderate, or Low. The required action to
mitigate the risk will then be evaluated to apply the appropriate control measures and/or mitigation actions.

The required resolution action is based on the determined risk level.
Risks that have been evaluated and ranked will be mitigated at the lowest feasible level. Mitigation actions
that exceed funding levels authorized at each level will be elevated to the next higher level for action.

2.1.5.6 Hazard Control and Tracking
Safety critical hazards that have been identified must be controlled or mitigated so that the hazard does
not continue to pose a danger. This may be done in a temporary manner if the hazard is controlled. The
process of controlling and tracking hazards is recorded on the hazard log, which is generated from the
electronic hazard reporting system. The portions of the hazard log applicable to the light rail system are
discussed monthly with the CPUC.
Depending upon the risk ranking, hazard log entries may require a mitigation plan or CAP, tracking number,
brief description, projected completion date, and an initial hazard/risk rating (IHR/IRR) using the Risk
Assessment Matrix.
CAPs include:
●

Element of activity identified as deficient

●

Planned activities to resolve deficiency

●

Department responsible for implementing corrective action

●

Scheduled completion date for implementation

2.17.C.a

Packet Pg. 169

Hazard log entries with their associated CAP are reviewed regularly by the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division, safety committees, and CPUC. They are periodically reviewed by senior
management. CAPs may be tracked and sorted from the hazard log. When a CAP is closed, the hazard
log will reflect this action and a closed date.
Individual CAP files are stored by tracking number.

2.1.5.7 Hazard Resolution
Hazard resolution refers to the methods and processes to identify mitigation strategies necessary to
reduce the likelihood and severity of the consequences associated with an identified hazard to the lowest
level practicable. Hazard resolution is not synonymous with hazard elimination. In a transit environment,
some hazards are impossible to eliminate and others are highly impractical to eliminate. Reduction of risk
to the lowest practical level can be accomplished in a variety of ways, from protective and warning devices
to special procedures. The hierarchy of controls will be followed to achieve a tolerable risk level:
1.

Elimination – remove the hazard

2. Substitution – replacement of material or a process with another that is considered
less hazardous
3.

Engineering Controls – isolate people from the risk

4.

Administrative Controls – training, signage

5. Personal Protective Equipment – clothing protecting the person

2.1.5.8 Hazard Tracking
Each CAP developed for hazards or findings from investigations or deficiencies will be submitted to
CPUC for review and approval. The CAP form is automatically assigned a tracking number and placed
on the hazard log with its identified hazard. Upon completion of the corrective action, the Safety and
Environmental Compliance Division will submit to CPUC as required. The completed CAP is formally
adopted by receiving CPUC’s signature. The hazard log will then be updated to show the status of the
identified hazard with its CAP as “CLOSED.”
The agency will monitor all CAPs and provide CPUC with quarterly updates on the hazard log.
Internally, the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division will coordinate with the appropriate
department to develop a mitigation plan and fill out the appropriate form for the identified hazard. The form
will be assigned a tracking number by the electronic hazard reporting system and placed on the hazard log
with the corresponding hazards for tracking purposes.

2.1.5.9 Ongoing Reporting to Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)
A TSS will review the current status and identify any issues with the resolution action and dates. The
portions of the hazard log applicable to the light rail system, at a minimum, are provided monthly to the CPUC.
All hazards identified and rated as unacceptable hazardous conditions will be separately tracked and
reported to CPUC with a determination of an unacceptable hazardous condition, along with the CAPs for
each unacceptable hazardous condition found.
The CPUC notifies the agency in writing of its acceptance or rejection of the CAP and in accordance with
procedures specified in the CPUC program standard. The CAP form requires a CPUC electronic or wet
signature approval, indicating the assigned resolution and completion of the CAP.

2.1.6

Pre-Job Safety Briefings

Employees who perform infrequent tasks (less than once every three months) or high-risk job tasks (e.g.,
working at heights, energy isolation, confined space, hoisting and rigging) are required to discuss job tasks
and identified hazards that are associated with those tasks or job steps during pre-job briefings.

RTD will comply with CPUC RBI procedures attached in Exhibit 21. RTD will provide access to CPUC with
and without advance notice. Access will be dependent on the necessary safety training and requirements
to safely access facilities, including, but not limited to, on-track safety training, use of personal protective
equipment, facility awareness, lockout tagout training, and accompaniment of an RTD employee with
appropriate communication devices.
RTD will provide data to CPUC at regular intervals as required by 4 CCR 723, including upcoming PMs and
construction projects.
Prior to inspections, CPUC will notify the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division (CSO and assigned
TSS) and associated facility contact. Notification for inspections will be provided at least 24 hours in
advance. For inspections without advance notice, advance notice will be provided to ensure appropriate
RTD staff will be available to accompany CPUC staff. CPUC will notify the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division and associated Transportation, Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance, Maintenance of Way,
or Capital Program department location at least one hour prior to arriving. CPUC staff will notify the proper
supervisor or staff member at the facility and participate in job briefings and job hazard analysis before
beginning the inspection.
Safety hazards identified during the inspection will be communicated to the appropriate supervisor for
resolution. Hazards that cannot receive immediate attention will be managed through the formal hazard
resolution process.

2.3.1

Risk Reduction Program Management

The Risk Reduction Program is a subset of RTD’s overall risk management processes. Within the
Operational Risk Management process, risks related to vehicular and pedestrian safety events involving
transit vehicles, assaults on transit workers, missed safety performance target, will fall within the scope of
the Risk Reduction Program.
Risks and associated mitigations are identified through the Safety Committees as mentioned above in
Operational Risk Management. Mitigations will consider visibility improvements such as retrofits to vehicles
in revenue service and specifications for future procurements, and deployment of assault mitigation
infrastructure and technology on transit vehicles and in transit facilities.
Once mitigations are agreed upon within the JLMSC, they will follow the agency’s asset management
planning process to plan for appropriate resource allocation. Implementation of mitigations will follow
procurement processes described in Section 3.1.5.4.

2.3.2

Safety Set-Aside

Rail transit agencies must allocate specific resources (funds, personnel, equipment, etc.) dedicated to
ongoing initiatives or future projects that are reasonably likely to assist the agency in meeting the safety
performance target in the future. This allocation of 0.75% of the Federal Transit Administration Section
5307 Urbanized Area Formula Program (5307) funds, independent from the 1% security fund, is required by
49 CFR 673 to ensure effective implementation and continuous improvement of the SMS.
Projects and initiatives will be identified as a part of the Risk Management Program and Risk Reduction
Program, which is implemented in collaboration with the JLMSC. Business case for projects and initiatives
will be reviewed for likelihood to assist the agency in meeting safety performance targets and approved by
the Leadership Safety Committee. Allocation of the funds and project implementation will follow the asset
management planning and procurement processes. The projects and initiatives will be tracked and drawn
from the safety set-aside 5307 funds during the fiscal year. Unused funds will be reviewed periodically and
will be retained for ongoing initiatives or future projects that are reasonably likely to assist the agency in
meeting the safety performance targets.
The Leadership Safety Committee will receive and consider safety risk mitigations recommended by the
JLMSC. If safety risk mitigations identified within the Risk Reduction Program are not implemented, a
written statement explaining the decision will be provided. Updates on the Risk Reduction Program and
performance targets will be provided in the annual updates to the Board of Directors.
Annually, project initiatives will be evaluated to identify effectiveness in short-term impacts on Risk
Reduction Program performance targets.
The safety set-aside funding process is a critical aspect of 49 CFR 673, ensuring that rail transit agencies
allocate sufficient resources to develop, implement, and maintain a robust safety management system. By
doing so, agencies can effectively manage safety risks, comply with regulatory requirements, and promote
a culture of safety within their operations.

Packet Pg. 174

2.17.C.a

The agency operates over an eight-county district along Colorado’s Front Range area. These activities
have the potential to affect local waterways, soil, air, wildlife, vegetation, and human health. RTD’s Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division strives to exceed all state, federal, and local municipality regulatory
requirements to limit the district’s impact to the local environment. The following management procedures
detailed below are in place to ensure this goal is met.

2.4.1

Management of Hazardous Materials

For any hazardous chemical used or stored in the workplace, the agency must submit an annual Tier II
chemical inventory report to their State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning
Committee, and local fire department via the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Tier II Submit
software by March 1 of each year. The information is made available to the public under the Emergency
Planning and Community Right to Know Act. Tier II Submit software is updated yearly by the EPA and
completed by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division.
Over 2,000 listed hazardous materials and 600 extremely hazardous chemicals are subject to reporting
under EPA rulemaking. Reporting requirements have been limited by quantity.
Common hazardous materials used by the agency that are subject to reporting include:
●

Diesel fuel

●

Gasoline

●

New and used oil

●

Antifreeze (ethylene glycol)

●

Lead acid batteries (sulfuric acid)

The agency uses many hazardous chemicals contained in cleaning agents, solvents, adhesives, paints, and
aerosols. These materials are described in the product specific Safety Data Sheet (SDS) forms.
Secondary containment, oil water separators, regular inspections, stormwater best management practices,
and leak detection systems are utilized to help identify and remediate spills.

2.4.2

Chemical Product Approval Program

A product approval process is in place to ensure that all materials arriving on-site have been approved by
the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division for use. The process starts when the division or group
requesting a new product contacts the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division by email with a copy
of the SDS and a completed Product Approval Evaluation Form. If the material is acceptable for use, the
SDS will be placed into the electronic storage database for employees to view via intercompany websites
(e.g., Trapeze or the Hub). If the requested material is not approved, an alternative product that is less
harmful to human health or the environment may be suggested.
All employees and contractors directly responsible for safety as well as each employee who works with
hazardous materials receives training on proper storage/handling of chemical products, appropriate use of
personnel protection equipment, compliant disposal of unused materials, and how to locate SDSs.

Packet Pg. 175

2.4.3

Management of Hazardous Waste

District Shops is a small quantity generator of hazardous waste. All other facilities are categorized as very
small quantity generators of hazardous waste. Hazardous wastes can be generated by:
●

Discarding a hazardous material (e.g., oil-based paint, solvents, thinner contaminated rags)

●

Using a product (e.g., batteries, fluorescent lamps, HID lamps, electronic waste, aerosol dregs)

The EPA and Colorado Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division regulate the generation of
hazardous wastes.
Hazardous wastes are to be stored in closed containers and accumulated in satellite accumulation areas
or the Central Accumulation Storage Building at District Shops. Waste containers are labeled and located
near where the waste is generated. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division is responsible
for properly identifying hazardous waste, labeling waste containers, performing internal inspections,
inventorying monthly generation amounts, mitigating spills, training employees, preparing off-site
shipments for disposal, recordkeeping, and collaborating with regulatory agencies during audits.
Personnel that add or remove hazardous waste from containers are required to receive compliance training
that is equivalent to their job duties and measured through routine performance-based internal inspections.
Safety and Compliance personnel that arrange hazardous waste shipments are required to receive training
in EPA’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) site compliance and maintain Department
of Transportation (DOT) ground shipper certifications prior to receiving authorization to sign uniform
hazardous waste shipping manifests. Electronic manifests, individual site information, and notifications
are stored electronically on the EPA information system RCRAInfo. Safety and Environmental Compliance
personnel have access to the RCRAInfo database and use this tool to submit and view required compliance
documentation to the Colorado Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division.

2.4.4

Underground and Aboveground Storage Tank Management

The agency is the owner of 32 regulated storage tanks throughout the district ranging from 1,000 to
48,000 gallons of diesel, gasoline, and lube oil. Storage tank systems are regulated by the Colorado
Division of Oil and Public Safety (OPS). Common components of tank systems include underground
piping, secondary containment, leak detection systems, overfill protection equipment, and automatic tank
gauging. These components are monitored daily for functionality, regulatory compliance, product inventory,
and release detection. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division collaborates with the Capital
Programs and Bus Operations department to arrange OPS required compliance testing, inspections, and
certifications for tank systems.
Spill Prevention Control and Counter Measure Plans (SPCC) that are certified by a licensed Professional
Engineer (PE) are in place at RTD facilities that store over 42,000 gallons of petroleum products in
underground storage tanks (UST).
Each of the six facilities that utilize underground storage tank systems to fuel vehicles has onsite
B-operators (Facilities Maintenance Supervisors) that oversee day-to-day operations and maintenance,
an A-operator (Manager, Facilities Maintenance Operating Facilities) that direct B-operators in their work,
and a listed facility contact (Manager, Environmental Compliance) that collects required compliance
documentation and is the liaison between the agency and OPS for audits, site characterization reporting,
and general inquiries at all six facilities. All three of these positions require OPS approved A- or B-operator
training through an approved training provider.

Packet Pg. 176

Safety and Environmental Compliance personnel are required to download and store compliance
documentation from the InSite360 Veeder-Root remote monitoring system at a minimum of every
30 calendar days. Abnormalities in the tank system are reported to the local B-operator and the tank
compliance contractor for resolution. Compliance reports that are run include tank tightness testing, liquid
sensor reports, and alarm history.

2.4.5

Stormwater Management

To comply with the provisions of the Colorado Water Quality Control Division (WQCD), the agency has
historically held a number of stormwater discharge permits for operating maintenance divisions, rail
corridors, stations, construction activities, and the Tunnel 16 Groundwater Treatment Facility. These permits
authorize the discharge of stormwater from these locations to the local waterways provided that the
agency and its contractors follow the requirements listed on each set of Colorado Discharge Permit System
(CDPS) issued documents. Common CDPS requirements include:
●

Illicit discharge detection and elimination procedures are in place

●

Construction site runoff controls are in place before and after project completion

●

Good housekeeping activities are continually practiced, monitored, and improved if needed

●

Internal training is conducted annually to help employees recognize and report illicit discharges

●

Proper storage and containment systems are in place for hazardous materials

●

Conducting internal inspections and collaborating with facility personnel to correct findings

●

Numeric or practiced-based effluent limitations are being met

●

Annual reporting is completed accurately and submitted to WQCD

CDPS issued permits historically held by the agency include:
●

COR900000 Light Industrial Activity (operating facilities)

●

COR070000 Non-Standard Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (rail corridors/stations)

●

COG318000 Discharge from Long-term Remediation Activities (Tunnel 16 GWTP requires monthly
submissions of Discharge Monitoring Reports through EPA’s NetDMR System)

●

COR400000 Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction Activities (East Metro
UST replacement)

2.4.6

Stationary Source Air Emission Management

Operating maintenance divisions that use boilers, paint booths, outdoor fueling stations and parts washing
units that exceed Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment established thresholds are
regulated by the Colorado Air Pollution Control Division (APCD). The Safety and Environmental Compliance
Division is responsible for gathering fuel, natural gas, and paint consumption throughput from these
sources and must be prepared to submit inventoried data to APCD upon request. Air Pollution Emission
Notifications must be submitted prior to operating systems that exceed APCD thresholds and renewed
every five years or before that time if significant alterations have occurred or will occur.

●

Not allowing visible emissions to exceed 20% opacity during normal operation

●

Supplying diesel fuel to the boilers that contain less than 0.5% sulfur by weight

●

Ensuring the units are maintained in a manner to follow the manufacturer’s operating recommendations

2.4.7

Industrial Hygiene

The agency is in a continual cycle of renovation, repair, construction, and demolition of current facilities.
Safety and environmental considerations for these projects include:
●

Identification and abatement of asbestos and lead paint, and other contaminants present in
building materials that are to be disturbed

●

Proper identification, monitoring, and disposal of contaminated groundwater and soils

●

Removal of hazardous wastes that a previous facility owner may have left behind

The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division uses a third-party environmental consulting firm in
most cases to identify, mitigate, and prepare required reports for these activities. These environmental
consulting services can often be very expensive and time consuming. Identifying and addressing the need
for these environmental services at the inception of new projects is helpful in avoiding project delays, cost
increases, and non-compliance issues with regulatory agencies.
The agency’s facilities and properties may encounter industrial hygiene (IH) issues throughout their life span
that include:
●

Mold evaluations

●

Presence of air contaminants

●

Environmental site assessments

●

Site characterization reports

●

Visual emission opacity readings

Facilities throughout the district require routine IH evaluations that include:
●

Laboratory testing of 27 individual oil water separators at six different facilities

●

Preparation of monthly discharge monitoring reports (Tunnel 16 GWTF)

●

Groundwater sampling and annual reporting to OPS for the Platte Bus Maintenance Facility

2.4.8

Emergency Spill and Biological Waste Response

The agency serves an eight-county district of over 3 million people and uses a large amount of petroleum
and chemical products on a day-to-day basis. The agency frequently has a need for additional spill and
biological response assistance due to accidents, incidents, and crime.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_FINAL_DIGITAL (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

2.17.C.a

Packet Pg. 178

The agency uses multiple emergency spill and biological cleanup contractors for situations that involve:
●

Chemical releases that are beyond the capabilities of staff and resources

●

Biological spill cleanup situations

●

Unforeseen situations that are beyond the scope of personnel work duties

●

Spills that reach storm water drains or local waterways

●

Mold and asbestos remediation

These contracted service providers are approved and funded through the RTD Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division. On-track safety training is provided to emergency clean-up contractors via RTD’s
learning management system.
The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division is responsible for reporting spills that exceed state and
federal established thresholds to the appropriate regulatory agency.

2.4.9

Management of Petroleum Contaminated Debris

Due to the large amount of petroleum contaminated rags, wipes, pads, and absorbents that the agency
historically generates at local maintenance facilities, it has been a long-standing best management
practice to separate most of this material from normally occurring trash throughout the facilities. Operating
facilities are equipped with specialized containers (mini-boxes) that are lined with thick cubic-yard-size
polyurethane tote bags that are manifested, sealed, and picked out of the mini-boxes by boom trucks and
taken separately offsite to avoid comingling with normal outgoing refuse. The contents of the mini-boxes
are profiled through a vendor-supplied customer database that also stores shipment details. The debris is
verified to be non-RCRA hazardous waste through periodic sampling and analytical lab reporting through
which the RTD Safety and Environmental Compliance Division has vetted. Pickup requests are called in by
local Storeroom Supervisors or RTD Safety and Environmental Compliance personnel.

ASSURANCE

The third element of the PTASP is Safety Assurance, which describes how the agency will monitor,
measure, and review its processes to ensure it remains in compliance with established standards.
These processes, safety performance targets, and reports provide assurance to leadership that the
organization and system are functioning at an acceptable level of safety. The reviews, inspections, rules
checks, and compliance verification procedures are described, required schedules set, and acceptable
measures established.

3.1 Internal Safety Review Process
Internal safety reviews (ISR) and inspections are critical components of an integrated system safety
program. As such, internal safety reviews are conducted semiannually to ensure compliance with the
SMS and that the plan is effectively implemented. Facilities are inspected monthly for occupational safety
issues and local fire codes. Written reports of each review are prepared and distributed once the ISR is
completed. Senior leaders will discuss safety reviews, evaluate the effectiveness of the SMS, recommend
corrective action if necessary and ensure timely implementation and follow up. An internal light rail review
report is compiled each year in January and submitted to the CPUC by Feb. 15. The report documents
the review findings for the year, including the results of internal reviews performed during the previous
year; a summary of required corrective actions taken, if any; and provision for follow-up to ensure timely
implementation and to determine effectiveness of the SMS. The annual audit report will be accompanied
by a formal letter of certification signed by the GM/CEO indicating that the agency is in compliance with
its SMS. If areas of deficiency are identified, the GM/CEO will identify the activities the agency will take to
achieve compliance. Documentation of inspection and reviews are maintained.
As part of the ISR program, all departments are subject to review. The CSO is responsible for and has
complete authority to conduct ISRs. Two reviews are conducted annually, one in the summer and one in
the winter. Within a three-year period, all PTASP elements are reviewed for compliance with the plan and
CPUC requirements. The sixth review cycle, which is in the last quarter of the third year, is reserved to
review and revise the audit process to ensure that all elements are completed and that the program meets
CPUC requirements.
The agency will notify the CPUC of an upcoming review cycle at least 30 days prior to the start of the
safety review.
An opening conference may be scheduled with the departments subject to safety review. At the opening
conference, checklists are distributed, discussed, and reviewed for accuracy, and a schedule is set.
The actual ISR consists of interviews with key personnel, documentation review and observation of
activities to assess compliance and understanding of rules, training and procedures. After completion
of the onsite activities, the checklists are completed, and a written draft report is developed. The draft
report may include recommendations or findings. Recommendations are defined as suggestions to
make improvements, while findings are defined as documented deficiencies in the implementation of
established programs, rules or procedures. The draft report is distributed for review and comment to
the affected parties. A final report is completed and distributed to all parties. Recorded findings require
the development of a CAP. The annual ISR report prepared and submitted to the CPUC will include an
evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the SMS.

Packet Pg. 183

Recommendations from previous review cycles will be reviewed and evaluated in subsequent cycles.
Findings will be tracked under the CAP process of placing all findings on a tracking spreadsheet and the
subsequent quarterly corrective action plan progress reports will be filed with the CPUC.
The agency has 30 days to respond to the draft report, including an opportunity to correct any findings.

3.1.1

Field Inspections/Co-op Walks

The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division conducts periodic field inspections/co-op walkthroughs. Maintenance facilities are inspected monthly to ensure compliance with occupational safety
regulations and common fire safety practices. Any deviations from required activities or identified safety
hazards are resolved through a formal reporting process.

3.1.2

Hazard and Accident Investigation, Notification, Reporting,
and Corrective Action Plans

Formal investigations shall be conducted for all reportable events. All hazards and accidents are
investigated according to the Event Notification, Reporting and Investigation Policy and Procedure.
All reportable transit events, as defined in 4 CCR 723-7-7348 and 7350, will be tracked and evaluated by
the CSO and the affected chief/AGM. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division will oversee
event investigation activities with the CPUC and will provide as much advance notice as practicable to
notify the CPUC of an accident investigation. When investigating an accident as defined in 4 CCR 7237-7347, the agency will give prior sufficient telephone or email notice to CPUC staff of the times that an
accident investigation team will convene to conduct interviews, inspections, examinations, or tests to
determine the cause of the accident.

Collect, Analyze, and Report Safety Management System Data,
and Maintain Records

SMS data is collected through a variety of sources including near miss information, accident investigation
reports, ISRs, safety committee meetings, occupational injury reports, incident reports, use of an accident
matrix, system monitoring including testing and inspection records and the hazard management program.
This safety data will be analyzed and used for development of key safety performance indicators and
targets. The agency reports the following to National Transit Database (NTD):
●

Fatalities – total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

Injuries – total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

Safety events – total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

System reliability – mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode

These safety performance measures are used to select improvement targets for these four measures
and for light rail, bus and paratransit to encourage improvements and monitor the safety performance of
delivering transit services. In addition, the agency selects additional performance measures and targets,
both leading and lagging, to ensure continual improvement of the SMS. The agency communicates safety
performance information internally using various methods of communication, including electronic message
boards, committee meetings, newsletters, and team/crew meetings to keep employees informed of SMS
initiatives, risks and performance.
The agency will make its safety performance measures improvement and targets available to applicable
state agencies (e.g., the Colorado Department of Transportation) and metropolitan planning organizations
(currently Denver Regional Council of Governments). To the maximum extent practicable, the agency will
coordinate with the external entities in the selection of external entity safety performance targets.
The safety data collected will be analyzed for potential safety impacts. Identified areas of concern are
reported to appropriate personnel in the form of specific project reports and memos. Records of system
safety data are maintained in the office of the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division for a minimum
of three years. Certain information, such as safety certification backup documentation, is maintained by the
document control process managed by the Capital Programs Department. In addition to safety, the Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division maintains data and documentation of activities required by
the SMS.

3.1.4

System Modifications or Major Repairs

New facility equipment modifications and retrofits are reviewed and approved by the RTD engineering
group and the technical support staff. Review may also take place by the RTD Infrastructure Change
Review Committee. Non-infrastructure changes will follow the non-infrastructure change process.

3.1.5

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modifications Hazard Resolution

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are included in the risk management program
process as described in section 2. This process is facilitated by the Safety and Environmental Compliance
Division and performed jointly by the Capital Programs, Bus Operations, Rail Operations, and Safety
and Environmental Compliance divisions. New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are
ultimately reviewed, approved, and documented.

3.1.5.1

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification Review

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are reviewed and approved by the Capital
Programs Department and Bus Operations, Rail Operations, and Safety and Environmental Compliance
divisions. This review is conducted to ensure that new equipment, expansions, and modifications safely
and operationally integrate into the existing system.

3.1.5.2 New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification Acceptance
Operational readiness of new equipment and system expansions is verified through the equipment
acceptance and safety and security certification process. The Bus Operations and Rail Operations divisions
perform rigorous equipment and integration testing as part of the vehicle and equipment acceptance
process. Once complete, new vehicles and equipment are formally accepted by the Bus Operations
and Rail Operations divisions. This information is presented and approved by the Safety and Security
Certification Program and described in section 3. The Safety and Security Certification Program provides
an identification, design, review, and verification process for system expansions and modifications.
Certification process completion is verified by sign-off from the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division.

3.1.5.3 Exceptions to Established Design Criteria
The agency has a process to request variances to design criteria. All variances go through three levels
of review. Level 4 and above exceptions to design criteria are approved only by the acceptance of the
CSO and the GM/CEO. If appropriate, the design criteria may be amended or modified to accommodate
acceptable modifications. The AGM of Capital Programs is responsible for the maintenance and distribution
of the design criteria. The design criteria will be reviewed prior to new corridor construction.

3.1.5.4 Procurement Procedures
Procurement of equipment and materials is controlled by the Procurement Standards Manual. Each
procurement requires the development of detailed specifications assembled by the requesting manager.
Levels of review are built into the procurement process depending upon the scope of the procurement.
As the scope of the procurement increases, so does the level of review. Minor procurements require
authorization from the Contracting and Procurement Division and the division manager of the requesting
division. Major procurements, such as light rail- or bus construction-related projects or procurement of
buses or light rail vehicles (LRVs) vehicles, are subject to the following review process.
The Operations Department and technical support staff develop detailed specifications through the
design process. These specifications are subject to several internal reviews at varying levels of design and
personnel from other transit agencies, where relevant. In addition to procurement specifications, the safety
and security certification review process described in Section 3 governs construction.

Management of Change (MOC) comprises multiple streams of change that will consist of change
identification, risk assessment and impact analysis, review and approval, implementation, and training and
communication.
The overall MOC process is managed by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division in
collaboration with associated responsible parties for various streams of change. Changes will be reviewed
and approved by a committee of relevant stakeholders who will evaluate potential impacts and provide
approval to proceed if risks level is acceptable.
MOC per federal requirements is currently beginning to be integrated into procedures. Infrastructure
changes will be managed through the Infrastructure Change Review (ICR) process, which is managed
by the Capital Programs Department. The ICR process coordinates physical changes, before they are
implemented in the existing operating environment. Formal Project Management Plans are prepared for
large projects.
Representatives from each involved department and personnel from the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division are represented in the ICR and MOC processes. When changes are made to existing
structures or facilities, it is critical that affected personnel, the public or other groups be notified of changes
that might have potential safety or security impacts. Affected personnel are invited to participate in project
meetings and coordinate any changes. Additional training may be required. Operations and maintenance
procedures, bulletins or SOPs may need to be developed. Engagement and Communications Department
personnel assist with communications to outside agencies or affected groups. An essential element of
communications must take place after the project is completed. Any observed negative or hazardous
impacts of physical changes must be reported to the chief engineer or CSO, as soon as possible, so that
hazards may be assessed and included in the hazard resolution process.
MOC process also applies to existing bus and light rail services systems, vehicles, facilities, and equipment
that may not require formal safety certification, but may have safety impacts.

3.2.1

Safety and Security Certification

Safety and security certification programs will follow Safety and Security Certification Policy and associated
Framework to ensure that safety and security concerns and hazards are addressed prior to the initiation
of light rail and bus operations for new corridors, system extensions, rehabilitation, or modification or
replacement of equipment where new risks are introduced. The agency uses the FTA Handbook for Transit
Safety and Security Certification to develop the requirements for each safety and security certification
program. An individual safety and security certification plan is developed for each new corridor. Certain
projects might have a scaled certification proportional to potential risks introduced. For modifications or
rehabilitations, safety and security certification is addressed through the preparation of safety and security
certification forms applicable to the scope of work. If equipment is procured as part of a new maintenance
facility. LRVs undergo a formalized commissioning acceptance process owned by the manufacturer under
the supervision of Light Rail Operations.
The safety and security certification program has the following goals:
●

Verify that acceptable safety and security levels are met or exceeded through various phases of
the project’s lifecycle

●

Document the verification of safety and security standards

●

Provide consistency for project certification

Quality Assurance

Capital projects have a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) function built into the design and
construction of the project. Specific personnel are responsible for QA/QC activities. In general, QA/QC
activities in large projects follow standard industry practice and are subject to review by the FTA and
others. Quality control during construction projects is a requirement of the contractor and submitted in the
quality plan prior to initiation of construction. The agency retains qualified inspectors and testing firms to
provide quality assurance by document submittal reviews and periodic testing of materials throughout
the project.
Received goods are required to be compared to items ordered, lot numbering or other certifications
as required on safety critical items. Where applicable, receiving personnel ensure that lot number
documentation is provided before materials are received or accepted. Periodically, purchasing personnel
or TSSs will randomly sample hardware, slings, lifting devices, and other devices for compliance with
specifications. Items will also be functionally tested periodically to ensure they meet standards.

3.3.1

Reports and Data Analysis

The results of various operational tests, including periodic efficiency checks, are compiled, and reviewed
at least quarterly by the general superintendent of Light Rail Transportation, or designated manager. A
written form of the review will be retained by Light Rail Operations and available upon request of the Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division and during ISRs. An annual report summarizing the previous
year’s results of the operational tests, including a trend analysis of the available data, is retained by Light
Rail Operations and provided during ISRs and on request from the Safety and Environmental Compliance
Division for further review and trend analysis.

3.3.1.1

Enforcement Violations

Rule violations are addressed through the agency’s management process, which includes coaching,
retraining, and formal discipline that may result in termination. Additionally, all accidents and incidents
are reviewed by supervisors and the Safety Division to determine if rules have been violated. RTD will
determine if revisions, changes, or additions are necessary to the rules and SOPs.

3.3.1.2 Risk Management
A TSS may incorporate violation trends or deficiencies for any rule or procedure into the risk management
program for resolution. Risks unresolved by the Rail Safety Committee (RSC) or the Bus Safety Committee
(BSC) are escalated based on the ORM Framework for further tracking, review, resolution, and/or
correction. Noncompliant review findings determined to be hazardous are documented in the hazard log. A
date of observation, description of the hazardous condition, corrective action required, and implementation
date are tracked until the hazardous condition is corrected. (See section 2 for further information.) The
Safety and Environmental Compliance Division conducts ongoing and regular observations and reviews to
determine the effectiveness of the rule compliance program.

3.3.2

SMS Policies, Procedures, and Processes

The agency has adopted policies, procedures, processes, training materials and employee rule books to
establish requirements and expectations for safe operations, maintenance and construction for the agency.
These are reviewed periodically and updated as necessary according to the following guidelines: prior
to revenue service of a system expansion, new bus route, or new corridor; or as recommended by the
ISR process. A committee consisting of controller/supervisors, operators, and TSSs performs the review.
Recommended SOP changes are reviewed and approved by the chief/AGM of the affected
division/department.

management system per equipment manufacturer guidelines and recommendations, and as required
by local, state and federal regulations. A Maintenance Supervisor identifies upcoming PM inspections
and assigns the work to their crew for completion. Inspectors use checklists to identify potential physical
hazards, unsafe equipment, unsafe acts and policy and procedural deficiencies with the facility or
equipment being inspected. Completed inspection reports and checklists are returned to the supervisor
for review. Each department is responsible for maintaining inspection and repair records to confirm the
inspection process.

3.4.2.1 MOW (Line, Signal, and Rail Maintenance) Standards and Procedures
Line and signal technicians use a Maintenance of Way plan, which includes track safety standards,
electrical standards, SOPs and internal work instructions that outline specific testing and maintenance
procedures modeled after Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations. These are in accordance with
49 CFR Parts 233-236.
Right-of-way rail maintenance uses a maintenance plan, RTD Maintenance of Way Track Safety Standards,
to maintain the track modeled to be in accordance with FRA regulations 49 CFR Part 213. The standard
outlines all aspects of proper maintenance and inspections regarding track.

3.4.3

Tracking and Resolving Hazards Identified During Inspections

Most safety hazards and concerns are resolved immediately by employees and/or supervisors, and
require no formal tracking process. Safety-critical hazards that cannot receive immediate attention are
forwarded to the appropriate supervisor and will be reported to the manager of safety or safety committee.
An observed safety critical hazard that cannot be corrected in a timely manner will be entered into the
hazard log for tracking purposes and mitigations will be managed in accordance with the risk management
process in section 2. A CAP, responsible person, and completion date will be assigned where warranted.
Follow-up inspections will verify that the hazard has been resolved.

3.4.4

Railroad Bridge Safety Management Program

The Railroad Bridge Safety Management Program and Light Rail Transit Bridge Management Manual have
been developed and implemented to minimize damages and identify and repair deficiencies in bridges
carrying the agency traffic, to safeguard their ability to carry the agency traffic, and to minimize risk of
human casualties.

Maintenance

Maintenance and service of all vehicles, equipment, and facilities is established using manufacturer
manuals, codes, standards, and established procedures as guidelines. Maintenance is performed at a level
of readiness that ensures safe, efficient, and reliable service. The agency maintains data to track scheduled
maintenance of vehicles and equipment.
Safety critical equipment that does not meet established requirements is withdrawn from service.
Vehicles or equipment involved in an accident are removed from service if there is reason to suspect that
equipment failure contributed to the cause of the accident. Vehicles or equipment are returned to service
only after they are determined that no defects could have contributed to the accident and if the equipment
is deemed safe for service. The agency has established procedures to ensure rapid deployment, recovery,
and return to service in the event of an emergency.
Effective maintenance is an indispensable prerequisite to safe and efficient operations. The Bus and Light
Rail divisions have standards that make safety and reliability the primary objectives of the system. These
goals are met through the incorporation of preventive and repair maintenance programs for all aspects of
the system. The Light Rail Vehicle (LRV) Maintenance Plan addresses incorporates the following principles:
●

Preventive maintenance programs will be cost-effective in minimizing service failures

●

Changes in preventive maintenance programs may be expected periodically as experience is
gained on the equipment maintained

●

Preventive maintenance goals and policies will not be altered due to time constraints or as a costreduction measure in times of financial stress

●

Effective maintenance procedures require much record-keeping and information storage/retrieval

●

The technical sophistication of the LRV, and the tracking of a large, expensive inventory, place a
heavy responsibility on the information capabilities of the light rail vehicle maintenance group

The Bus Fleet Maintenance Plan addresses the following areas:
●

Maintenance division goals and objectives

●

Contingency bus fleet

●

Maintenance management system

●

Preventative maintenance program

●

Wheelchair lift preventative maintenance program

●

Quality control program

●

New bus inspection procedure

●

Maintenance bulletins

●

SOPs

The agency conducts internal and contracted maintenance activities so that the system is safely and
efficiently maintained. The maintenance practices also use existing transit operations, and in many
instances, will share organizational services, personnel, and equipment.

3.6.1

Drug and Alcohol Program

The agency maintains an employee drug and alcohol program in compliance with DOT and FTA
regulations. The program includes criteria for random testing of safety sensitive personnel and testing for
cause, either accident related or from observed behavior. The Human Resources Department manages this
program, which is subject to frequent review by the FTA.
Drug and alcohol testing and information about drug and alcohol abuse is included in the Drug and Alcohol
Policy. Training on this policy is required for each new hire and provided during orientation and through
self-guided educational video. The program is administered by the Manager of HR DOT Compliance who
verifies compliance with the program and oversees training. Revisions to the program are distributed to all
employees.
GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT
The agency is dedicated being a trusted leader in mobility, delivering excellence and value to its
community and customers and to providing a healthy, safe, and satisfying work environment for employees.
The agency and the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001 agree that employees must be able to
work in a drug- and alcohol-free work environment. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect
the rights and privacy of all employees. The employer has the right and duty to protect its employees,
customers, and the public from the adverse effects of drug abuse and alcohol misuse. It is not the intent of
the employer to restrict employees’ on-the-job conduct.
A successful drug and alcohol program must address the safety implications of drug abuse and alcohol
misuse and must also institute proper procedures and controls guaranteeing accurate alcohol and drug
testing results, while preserving confidentiality and focusing on rehabilitation through an effective
employee assistance program.
It is the responsibility of all employees to report to work not under the influence of alcohol or controlled
substances. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect and respect employees’ rights and privacy.
To meet these goals and comply with legal requirements, the agency has implemented this policy to:
●

Detect drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through testing

●

Encourage employees to obtain treatment and rehabilitation for drug and alcohol problems

●

Deter drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through random testing, education, training, and
discipline

●

Enforce the goal of a drug- and alcohol-free work environment through appropriate discipline

Drug and alcohol abuse can have profound effects on the health, work, and personal life not only of
the abuser, but also the abuser’s family, friends and the public at large. Employees should be aware of
the signs and symptoms of drug or alcohol problems, and of available methods of intervening when a
substance abuse problem is suspected.
Many elements of this policy are required by federal regulations covering persons in safety-sensitive
job classifications.
Employees wishing to review federal regulations on drug and alcohol use may contact the Manager of DOT
Compliance.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_FINAL_DIGITAL (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

3.6 Drug and Alcohol Program

Packet Pg. 199

To the extent that any elements of this policy may conflict with federal or state regulations as they may
be amended or revised in the future, the regulations shall take precedence. Employees are expected
to review, be familiar with, and obey this policy and all laws concerning drug and alcohol use and
testing. All existing and new employees must receive at least 60 minutes of training on the effects and
consequences of prohibited drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment and the signs
and symptoms that may indicate prohibited drug use.
Compliance with this policy, including participation in the drug and alcohol testing program, is a required
condition of employment.

3.6.2

Applicability

3.6.2.1 Categories of Employees
This policy applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive employees, volunteers and contractors
and are referred to in this policy as “employees” unless otherwise noted. This policy applies to all
employees while on agency property to perform their duties or while performing any work-related
business. Visitors and vendors are expected to adhere to this policy while on agency property.
In addition to being subject to all other elements of this policy, employees who perform “safety sensitive
functions” for RTD, as that term is defined in federal regulations 49 CFR Part 40 as amended and Part
655, are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other specific requirements set forth in this
policy. Generally, a safety-sensitive function occurs when an employee is performing, ready to perform, or
immediately available to perform any duty related to the safe operation of public transportation.
The following are safety-sensitive functions:
●

Operation of a revenue service vehicle, whether or not such vehicle is in revenue service

●

Controlling dispatch or movement of a revenue service vehicle

●

Maintaining revenue service vehicles or equipment used in revenue service

●

Operating a non-revenue-service vehicle when required to be operated by a holder of a
Commercial Driver’s License

●

Carrying a firearm for security purposes

The agency reviews the actual duties performed by employees in all job classifications to determine
which employees perform safety-sensitive functions and determines which job functions may require
the performance of safety-sensitive duties. An analysis will be performed if any new job classifications
are developed, or current job description changes, to determine if the job should be considered safetysensitive by querying the policy.

4.1 SMS Implementation Activities
4.1.1

SMS Implementation

The agency implements the SMS through the active involvement of both executive leadership, line
management, and frontline transit workers. This collaborative approach ensures that all elements of the
SMS are effectively integrated into daily operations and maintenance activities. Leadership is responsible
for establishing safety policies, coordinating with JLMSC to set Safety Risk Reduction Program performance
targets, and providing resources, while line management oversees the execution of these policies and
ensures compliance. This collaborative effort is aimed at achieving the desired safety outcomes, such as
reducing incidents, enhancing overall safety performance and safety culture.

4.1.2

Committees and Working Groups

The agency supports SMS implementation through established committees and working groups. These
committees and working groups are coordinated by leadership and line management and focus on specific
areas such as bus and light rail operations and maintenance services. These committees and working
groups help maintain a continuous improvement cycle within the SMS framework to foster a proactive
safety culture across the agency.

4.1.2.1

Joint Labor - Management Safety Committee

The purpose of the Joint-Labor Management Safety Committee is to reduce safety risks; to reduce the
number and rate of accidents, injuries, and assaults on transit workers at RTD and its contractors (the
System); and for the oversight of the safe operation of the System within the communities it serves.
Responsibilities for the JLMSC are described in Section 1.3.3.

4.1.2.2 Management of Change/Infrastructure Change Review
(MOC/ICR) Committee
MOC control within the agency will be managed through the ICR process for physical infrastructure
changes during design, construction, or modification. The ICR process is managed for the agency by the
Capital Programs Department. The MOC process is managed by the Chief Engineer and the CSO. MOC
management consists of the ICR process during design and construction, and the Non-Infrastructure MOC
process during operations. The Non-Infrastructure MOC process is managed by the CSO.

functions of the Bus Operations Division and Light Rail Division. The committee meets monthly to update
and mitigate hazards within their facilities and on their systems.
BSCs are formed for the Transportation and Maintenance groups within District Shops, Platte, East Metro,
and Boulder divisions. The BSCs and RSC are facilitated by the Safety and Environmental Compliance
Division’s delegate, usually a TSS. The committees consist of up to any manager within the division,
and one or more employees from the following areas, which may include, but is not limited to: Street
Operations, Bus Operations, Bus Maintenance, Facilities Maintenance, Health and Wellness, Transit
Security, and any other unique area (e.g., Treasury).
RSC consists of up to any manager within the division, and one or more employees from the following
areas, which may include, but is not limited to: Operations, Vehicle Maintenance, Field Supervisors,
Facilities Maintenance, Health and Wellness, Transit Security, and any other unique area.
The ATU 1001 appoints bargaining unit employees to the BSC and RSC as needed to serve as safety
representatives from the ranks of each department.
Committee members are granted an opportunity to speak, and to present safety issues to the BSC or RSC,
through an open communication process.
Most safety issues are resolved within the parameters of the BSC and RSC. Issues not resolved in the BSC
or RSC, or safety critical hazards, will be elevated to the next higher-level safety committee, such as the
Joint Labor-Management Safety Committee, or ultimately to the Leadership Safety Committee.
Safety Committee actions include the following:
●

Review employee reported hazards and issues brought forward to the committee

●

Review risk register

●

Reviewing facility and operations system safety issues identified by members, staff, reviews,
or inspections

●

Assigning responsibility for correcting hazards

●

Reviewing open items for completion

●

Reviewing effectiveness of mitigations

●

Ensure safety and regulatory rule compliance (e.g. FTA, CDOT, OSHA)

4.1.2.4 Fire and Life Safety Committee (FLSC) (Large Scale Projects Only)
The FLSC serves as a liaison between project safety and local police, fire, and emergency response
agencies. Safety and Environmental Compliance Division’s delegate, usually a TSS. Members include local
police, fire, and emergency medical services staff, and supervisors within the Safety, Bus Operations, and
Rail Operations divisions.
The FLSC coordinates inspections and drills to verify the fire and life safety and security emergency
response, and familiarization and compliance with the system. Drills are initiated during the activation

4.1.2.5 System Safety Working Group (SSWG)
The SSWG comprises subject matter experts from relevant departments to enhance safety processes and
ensure compliance within the transit system. The group will function as a body for identifying, analyzing,
and mitigating hazards that exceed the scope of individual departments or local safety committees. This
group reviews systems or issues with the perspective of looking for hazards, identifying risk to:
●

Design or engineer problems out of the system

●

Correct through SOP

●

Mitigate with personal protective equipment

●

Eliminate the risk/hazard

The SSWG may not change the scope of the project but may make decisions that relate directly to the
remediation of specific hazards. To this end, it is best for the SSWG to be included early on in the design
phase of a project.
The SSWG will collaborate with relevant departments for Safety and Security Certification as defined within
the Safety and Security Certification Policy and Framework.

4.1.2.6 Investigation Team
This team comprises staff from various departments that have a role in the development of a CAP or
mitigation singular resulting from events, occurrences, accidents, and incidents. This process will follow the

4.2.1

Employee Safety Training, Certification, Verification, and Performance Testing

Employees receive formal training and certification for the work they perform according to their job
classification. The categories of safety-related work requiring training and certification are Rail and
Bus Operators and Maintainers. The specific programs are discussed below. However, each training
and certification program contains classroom and hands-on training and written exams. Certification
documentation, including tests and test scores, is maintained in employee files and is subject to review
during the internal safety review program.
Except for the on-track safety training program required of contractors working on or near RTD rail
property, the agency does not train or certify contractors or employees of contractors. The on-track safety
training program is required of contractors prior to issuance of an access permit to work near or on RTD
rail property. The program is usually instructed in a train-the-trainer format allowing contractors to train
their own personnel. Compliance with this program is verified through in-field observation and examination
of contractor training cards. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division maintains a log of all
contractors trained under the program.
Regarding performance testing (to include operational tests and efficiency checks), any operating or
maintenance rule is subject to verification and compliance. Compliance with rules, training, and certification
requirements is verified in several ways. Rail and bus operators are frequently observed in the field
by supervisors and Safety and Environmental Compliance Division personnel; however, a supervisor
must discuss an observed rule violation with the operator as soon as practicable. In addition to ongoing
monitoring and observation, rail and bus operators are subject to formal ride checks in which supervisors,
usually anonymously or covertly, observe operators according to predetermined criteria or a checklist.
These ride checks are documented, reviewed with the operator, and maintained in the operator’s
employee file. These records are subject to verification during the ISR process. Any trend or issue
discovered during system monitoring, observation, and ride checks is reported to divisional leadership and
the CSO for inclusion in the operational risk management risk register.
Bus, rail, and facility maintainers also receive direct supervision, including observation and verification of
their maintenance activities. Each piece of work that is assigned to a maintainer is reviewed and approved
for correctness by their immediate supervisor through the work order process. When a Maintainer
completes a work assignment, the direct supervisor verifies and approves the work through observation
and signature approval on the work order. The maintainer will enter in the enterprise asset management
system that the work is complete, and the direct supervisor will verify and approve the work, then accept
that the work was properly completed in the enterprise system. Maintenance activities are also observed
during the ISR process. Supervision is assessed during the ISR program by the review of documentation
and compliance with schedules. If issues are discovered, they are reported as recommendations or
findings in the review report. Review findings are referred for inclusion in the hazard
management program.

4.2.2

Light Rail Operator Certification

Light Rail operators must complete a course based upon light rail SOPs and rules prior to certification.
Written tests and practical examinations are administered, and operators must score 100% on the Hands
Bells Signals test with a cumulative final examination score of 80% to pass. A minimum of three weeks is
spent in the LRV in actual operation with a revenue instructor. Competency standards are established in
the “Regional Transportation District Light Rail Training Quality Manual” (see Exhibit XVI and section 4.3,
Light Rail Operator Training).

Every maintenance employee has an opportunity to receive up to 40 hours of annual refresher training
relating to their responsibilities. Recertification occurs every two years. Maintenance personnel must again
demonstrate passing scores on a written exam and a hands-on practical exam.

4.2.6

Bus Operator Training

Bus operators must complete a nine-week training program, which includes obtaining a class B
Commercial Driver’s License with a P2 (passenger vehicle more than 26.001 lbs.) endorsement and
meeting the Entry-Level Driver Training federal guidelines. Training consists of six weeks of classroom and
behind the wheel training, and three weeks of on-the-job revenue training. This training program covers
rules and SOPs before entering revenue service. Participants must pass a series of eight written tests with
a minimum score of 75% before moving to revenue training. Prior to entering service, operators must pass
a final drive examination with a minimum correct score of 75%.

4.2.7

Bus Operator Recertification

Bus operators undergo annual refresher training of no less than eight hours. The general timing is
quarterly, and training sessions topics include, defensive driving, safe driving evaluation, vehicle inspection,
basic control skills, road testing, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Additional training includes
de-escalation, training on new equipment, and major changes in procedures. Training after an extended
absence from work is progressive, depending upon time away from driving. This training covers the topics
from the active operator sessions and includes an additional safe driving refresher.

Training and Certification for Employees and Contractors

All employees receive training to become familiar with SMS. The training topics include:
●

SMS overview

●

Safety reporting

●

Risk management

●

Safety assurance practices

●

Employee roles and responsibilities

Employees and contractor personnel, whether construction or service contractors, are required to follow
with applicable rules and SOPs as well as local, state, and federal safety regulations. Contractors are
required to comply with specific safety or environmental laws that apply to their work.
The project manager consults with the appropriate subject matter experts in the Safety Environmental
Compliance, Legal Services, and Contracting and Procurement Divisions to ensure that all applicable safety
and training requirements are included in the contract.

4.3.3

Work-Required Training for Employees and Contractors

The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division develops safety policies and procedures for
occupational safety modeled on OSHA guidelines. Regular training sessions are conducted with affected
employees based on job hazard analysis. Annual refresher training is conducted for high-risk tasks
and activities.
All employees and contractor personnel who foul or have the potential to foul the tracks (within 10 feet
of centerline of track) must receive OTST prior to beginning their work. Contractors are responsible for
ensuring that their employees complete OSHA-required training prior to performing projects.

4.3.4

Contractor Safety Coordination and Construction Safety

All contractor work on or near agency light rail property is controlled by access permits. Prior to issuing an
access permit, the contractor is required to meet with staff from Capital Engineering and Rail Operations
to describe and coordinate their work. After this initial coordination, the contractor applies for a permit,
which is reviewed and approved by Light Rail Maintenance of Way, Rail Transportation and Safety and
Environmental Compliance prior issuance by Light Rail Maintenance of Way. The contractor is bound
to the requirements of the permit. All contractors working with the agency are also bound by contract
specifications for the work they are to perform.
Key documents guiding the management of construction safety are: the Construction Safety Guidelines,
and the Safety and Security Certification Policy and Framework. The Construction Safety Guidelines
presents the requirements for construction projects and follows OSHA construction requirements and
regulations. Contractors are required to follow OSHA construction safety requirements and requirements of
contract specifications and access permits.

The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division conducts periodic construction site visits to monitor
contractor workplace safety and conformance to OSHA standards. Visits include contractor safety
orientation prior to project commencement, field monitoring, and site safety inspections. Periodic safety
meetings are conducted between the agency and contractors to ensure safe project construction.
The Safety and Security Certification Policy and Framework describes the process for project and
construction verification, which includes design and procurement specifications, field documentation,
equipment testing requirements, and integrated testing procedures.

4.3.5

Construction Safety Requirements

The construction safety program is developed and managed by the Safety and Environmental Compliance
Division and the Capital Programs Department. This program defines construction safety functions and
responsibilities and other construction safety requirements such as safety equipment, documentation,
safety personnel, and safety certifiable items. All contractors’ employees must comply with OSHA rules and
the requirements of the construction safety program, rail services rule books, SOPs, and individual contract
agreements with the agency.
The proposed construction methodology is reviewed during project planning. The contractors are
responsible for ensuring that work is performed in a safe manner. Emphasis is placed on work that may
affect agency operations, customers, facilities, and personnel. All contractors working in the agency rail
right-of-way or interfacing with rail operations are required to attend OTST. This training covers track
access, right-of-way flagging, and operating procedures. Contractor reviews are conducted to ensure
compliance with federal and state laws and agency requirements.
The agency has established a training and certification class for rail roadway workers (OTST). All
construction and agency employees who may work on or near the tracks are required to attend this
training annually and obtain a certification card or sticker to keep on their person.

4.3.6

Training and Certification Records

The agency maintains training and certification records for safety related training.
Records for the following training are maintained in employee training records and are available for review:
train operator certification, train operator recertification, controller certification, controller recertification,
equipment certification, lineman’s course, signal certification, and basic/advanced track principles.
These records are available directly from light rail department managers. The training supervisor and
management review the training records to determine completion. Most training is done annually, with all
operators and supervisors being trained in the same month.

4.3.6.1 Transit Safety Specialists/Key Staff Certification
The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division recognizes the FTA TSI to administer Public
Transportation Safety Certification Training Program (PTSCTP) certification for all TSS and key operations

Recordable Injury

A work-related injury or illness must be recorded if it results in one or
more of the following in accordance with the OSHA regulation 29 CFR
Part 1904 requirements:
x
x

SCAT

Serious Injury

Death
Days away from work
Restricted work or transfer to another job
Medical treatment beyond first aid
Loss of consciousness
A significant injury or illness diagnosed by a physician or other
licensed health care professional
Systematic Cause Analysis Technique (SCAT) is a widely used
methodology for structured analysis of incidents. It is an analysis process
that explores root cause based on five predefined categories to
determine causation of an event. The analysis directs the user to
potential causes and guidance towards a management system structure
for actions for improvement.
Any injury which:
x

Why Tree

5.0

Requires hospitalization for more than 48 hours, commencing
within seven days from the date the injury was received
x Results in a fracture of any bone (except simple fractures of
fingers, toes, or noses)
x Causes severe hemorrhages, nerve, muscle, or tendon damage
x Involves any internal organ
x Involves second- or third-degree burns, or any burns affecting
more than five percent of the body surface
Systematic and iterative method of exploring cause and effect
relationships through the logic of evaluating “why” the effect occurred
for an unlimited number of times until the root cause of the event is
identified.

Event Investigation
x Note: Events required to be reported to the CPUC and the facts discovered
during the investigation are considered privileged and highly confidential
x Investigate and gather facts to identify causal factors of events to reduce or
eliminate systemic causes and to prevent future events
x The manager has accountability to own/delegate, coordinate and ensure an
event investigation occurs
x The investigation owner, as defined by event type in the Event Investigation
and Notification Determination Table, may delegate investigation to the
appropriately trained individuals to conduct the investigation. The
Investigation Owner may have to coordinate with other functional groups to
ensure resource availability.
x The investigation owner or designee will schedule a post event meeting within
72 hours of the event, to include:
x General Superintendent or designee
x Assigned Transit Safety Specialist
x Business Program Manager or designee
x Investigator
x The purpose of the 72 hours post event meeting is to determine whether all
necessary information has been gathered to complete a causal analysis
including contributing factors It will also determine the level of post event
investigation necessary and establish future meetings to ensure appropriate
Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) are developed and implemented. It will also
determine the level of investigation necessary and establish future meetings
to ensure appropriate CAPs are developed and implemented
x The next step in the process is to determine whether there is a need to identify
other suitable persons from within the agency to assist in the investigation
process
x Note: basic, medium, and high-level investigations shall be conducted
if the event/incident meets any of the criteria defined in Section 2.3
and the attached Event Investigation and Notification Determination

Event Investigation Methodology
x

The higher of the actual or potential event severity determination level is used
to determine the type of investigation methodology to be applied

x

The Investigation Owner must specify the level of investigation required in
accordance with the Event Investigation and Notification Determination Table,
and it is the responsibility of the investigation team, to use that methodology

x

There are three levels of investigation methodology to be used as follows:
o Basic Level Investigation: Investigation level to be completed for an
event with an actual or potential consequence level of moderate or low
using the basic reporting framework through the application of the “5
Whys” methodology
o Medium Level Investigation: Investigation level to be completed for an
event with an actual or potential consequence level of medium using
the event investigation methodology, “5 Whys” methodology or
Systematic Cause Analysis Technique (SCAT)
o High Level Investigation: Investigation level to be completed for an
event with an actual or potential consequence level of high or serious
using SCAT or Why Tree which is defined in the event investigation
training program
 Where a High Level Investigation is required the investigation
owner should consider legal consultation with respect to the

o Note: The causal factors determination is a systematic approach to
identify and eliminate the failures that prevent a business from
achieving its goals (e.g. zero injuries, on-time performance, reliability,
meeting cost objectives, etc.)
o The application of the appropriate investigation methodology will
assist with the identification of causal and contributing factors of
failures at the people, equipment, materials, environment and
management systems levels and puts in place corrective measures to
address these causes resulting in improved, sustainable performance
Recommend Corrective and Preventive Actions
x

Once the causal factors determination has been completed and the causal and
contributing factors determined, the next step for the investigation team is to
develop CAPs to address the causal factors discovered and identify
opportunities to strengthen systems and processes. In doing this, it is
important for the investigator/investigation Team to:
o Organize conclusions sequentially, preferably in chronological order or
in logical sets
o Base conclusions on the facts and results from subsequent analysis of
the facts
o Include only substantive conclusions that bear directly on the event
o Keep conclusions as succinct as possible
o Link conclusions to applicable management systems
o Recommend effective mitigations for CAPs based on the hierarchy of
control to eliminate the hazard or change behaviors
o Collaborate with responsible and affected parties

x

It is the responsibility of the Investigation Team to document their conclusions
and CAP to strengthen systems and processes

The Investigation Team is to identify and recommend corrective and preventative
actions. The aim is to eliminate hazards, change behaviors and, where this cannot
be achieved mitigation methods or controls must be in place to reduce risk to an
acceptable level. In determining corrective actions, it is essential for the
Investigator/Investigation Team, to consider the effects of hazards such as:
x

Probability

Impact on the agency

When the investigation is completed, a copy of the investigation report must be
provided to the Investigation Owner and impacted groups for review.
Note: Depending upon the nature of the event, legal review may be required
before authorization is granted to communicate the findings and outcomes of the
investigation to entities external to RTD.
2.8

Investigation Review
Once the investigation is completed by the Investigation Team, it is the
responsibility of the investigation owner to:
x

Review the quality and content of the investigation with a member of
the safety team

x

Identify and determine whether the causal factors have been
established

x

Determine whether the recommended corrective or preventative
actions address the identified causal factors, appropriate to the risk

x

Determine whether other parties need to be involved in the review

x

Review the recommended corrective or preventative actions and
ensure tasks are assigned to the appropriate personnel with
reasonable timeframes in an action tracking system

Note: It is essential that when corrective actions are assigned, a realistic due date
is set in consultation with the person(s) to whom the action is assigned.

Implementing the Operational Risk Management (ORM) framework will improve how Denver Regional
Transportation District (RTD) manages risk and represents a shared commitment to an effective
process through a formal, continuous, top-down, data-driven, organizational-wide approach to
manage risk, assure effectiveness of risk controls, and promote ORM in the agency. The ORM process
applies to all risks for the agency, except financial and legal risks, which are covered by the internal
audit function. This framework outlines the tasks for implementing a formal, documented process for
ORM throughout the agency.
This effort demonstrates RTD’s commitment to improving the maturity of its approach to ORM, which
will unify the agency’s management systems and other activities to achieve agency objectives
effectively and efficiently.
Element II of the RTD Transit Agency Safety Plan (TASP) is Risk Management, which describes how
RTD identifies, evaluates, tracks, and mitigates risks and risk in the organization and on the transit
system. The risk management element and the processes undertaken by the agency are identified
and described in sufficient detail to be effectively undertaken throughout RTD. The acceptable risk
level and performance targets are established and documented.
Similar to a Plan – Do – Check – Act (PDCA) process, ORM is designed to be a continual effort to proactively identify and mitigate risk and to improve the data-driven, decisionmaking process within the agency. The management of identified risks is a
vital component of the RTD Operational Management System.
Risk is “the effect of uncertainty on objectives” internal or external to the
RTD system. An unacceptable risk is a condition that may endanger or
seriously harm human life, significantly destruct property or result in system
loss. This includes harm to customers, employees, contractors, equipment,
and to the general public. These risk conditions must be mitigated or
eliminated. Risks may be observed in the operating environment, through
procedures, during system modifications, while undertaking capital projects,
from investigations and audits, or operational changes.
The ORM Framework applies to all RTD employees and obligates everyone to constantly observe risks
in their work areas and report them to their safety committee, through a reporting process or to their
supervisor.
Decisions on risk should be informed to pursue the strategic priorities in the 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan:

Principles/Goals
An integrated ORM Framework applies to the entire organization and demonstrates the inclusion of
risk in decision-making as defined in the Operational Risk Framework.
RTD employees understand risk as “the effect of uncertainty on objectives” and incorporate a
probabilistic approach in decision-making.
The Leadership Team (LT) commits to develop, implement, and utilize a uniform, evidence based,
ORM process that will effectively and efficiently achieve a common purpose, mission, and framework.
The LT is committed to:
x
x
x
x
x

Understanding risk in the context of the probability (likelihood) and severity (consequence) of
events that can or do happen
Using ORM to guide agency actions that support delivery of the agency’s objectives within
fiscal, ethical, regulatory, and other practical constraints
Being transparent about the potential tradeoffs between risk, cost, and performance inherent
in all decisions
Using clearly defined agency strategies, objectives, operational plans, and processes in the
identification, evaluation, mitigation, and acceptance of risk
Making best use of RTD’s limited resources to meet its objectives

Any exceptions to this commitment must be documented as out of compliance and signed by the
General Manager and CEO with copies to the Chief Safety Officer. A copy of the ORM policy is
provided in Appendix A.
The continuous identification, monitoring, and mitigation of risk is key to an effective ORM. The RTD
ORM will be an ongoing process with the continual improvement goals of:
x
x
x

Increasing staff understanding of the process
Increasing use of ORM to make data-driven decisions
Improving quality and consistency of risk evaluation across the agency

x
x

Directly reporting to their supervisor, safety committee or union representative
Submitting directly on the Hub, which is the agency’s intranet (click on blue safety person
link)

2. Evaluate Risk
Risk evaluation attempts to define what the risk means to employees, customers and/or the system.
The primary purpose of the risk evaluation process is to determine the elements of and reasons for
the risk with the purpose of eliminating or controlling it. The factors contributing to the risk should
be fully understood and evaluated by the employees or safety committees. Training will be required.
This understanding and evaluation will assist in determining the potential controls to put in place and
the effectiveness of the mitigation efforts.
As part of evaluating accidents and incidents, root cause analysis using the “Five Whys?”
methodology can be used to understand root causes and determine the most effective solutions to
mitigating risks.
Part of the evaluation of risk is to determine potential controls to mitigate the risk. There are five
basic steps to mitigating risk:

Elimination – remove the hazard
Substitution – replace of material or a process with another that is considered less hazardous
Engineering Controls – isolate people from the risk
Administrative Controls – training, signage
Personal Protective Equipment – clothing protecting the person

The costs associated with the potential controls must also be estimated or evaluated.

2.1

Assign Risk Owner

The RTD employee responsible for most closely mitigating, monitoring, and measuring the risk will be
identified and added to the Risk Register. The employee should be well informed of the risk, be at
the lowest /closest level of responsibility and have the authority to coordinate funding and or other
resources.

2.2

Safety Committee Structure

When a risk is identified, the local safety committee (e.g., Light Rail, Bus, Commuter Rail,
CyberSecurity, Safety & Environmental) will initiate the review and action. The local safety
committee will screen submittals for the difference between non-substantive complaints and
identification of true risks. The local safety committee will maintain the risk register, assign the risk
owner and work to evaluate, assess and mitigate (if required) the risk. If the risk requires mitigation
that exceeds the funding authority at this level, the risk will be elevated to the next higher-level
safety committee, the Joint Union/Management Safety Committee or ultimately to the Leadership
Safety Committee.
The Leadership Safety Committee is comprised of senior leaders of significantly affected
departments. The Leadership Safety Committee will meet monthly to review, assess progress, and
reallocate priorities of existing risks. Members include:

Potential controls, in order of effectiveness, are:

Assessing risk is the process of determining the severity of risk and the probability of the risk being
realized. In order to ensure that risk assessments are consistent, it is important to utilize a standard
definition. The detailed severity and probability definitions for various events and departments are
provided in Appendix C.


Packet Pg. 323

Severity is a quantitative or subjective measure of the worst credible mishap resulting from personnel
error, environmental conditions, design inadequacies and/or procedural efficiencies for system,
subsystem or component failure or malfunction. Severity is categorized as Catastrophic, Severe,
Serious, Limited, or Negligible.
Probability is defined as the likelihood of the number of times that a specific event will occur during
the planned life expectancy of a system. A risk probability may be derived from the analysis of a
transit system’s operating experience, evaluation of RTD safety historical data, or the analysis of
reliability and failure data. Probability is categorized as Frequent, Probable, Remote, Improbable or
Highly Improbable.

Using the determined severity and probability, the RTD risk assessment matrix is used to determine
the risk index. The risk ratings will be labeled as High, Serious, Medium, Moderate, and Low. The
required action to mitigate the risk will then be evaluated to apply the appropriate control measures
and/or mitigation actions.

RTD has adopted a system for assessing the level of risk to determine what action(s) must be taken
to correct or document the risk. This assessment system has been incorporated into the formal
system safety analysis, which enables the safety committees, as decision makers, to understand the
amount of risk involved in accepting the risk in relation to the cost (schedule, cost, operations) to
reduce the risk to an acceptable level. The required resolution action is based on the determined risk
level.

Risks that have been evaluated and ranked will be mitigated at the lowest feasible level. Mitigation

5. Monitor Results
5.1

Risk Register

The safety team will assure local risk registers are used to track risks at the departmental level within
RTD. These registers are to be maintained within the department and are reviewed by the local
safety committee on a regular basis. Risks placed on the local register receive their initial and final
risk rating using RTD’s 25 box risk assessment matrix. Management may also present risks to the
local safety committee for risk ratings. Risk ratings may be changed when new information is
received or as a result of further data analysis.
All risk register entries require a mitigation plan (if risk resolution is required), tracking number, brief
description, projected completion date, and an initial hazard rating/initial risk rating (IHR/IRR) using
the RTD Risk Analysis Matrix. Risk Register format example is provided in Appendix D.
If requested, or required for complicated risks, a CAP will be developed by risk owner/department
managers in conjunction with the safety committees. The committees/risk owners will ensure that
the CAP process is followed and properly tracked until it is closed. CAP's may be tracked and sorted
separate from the risk register. When a CAP is closed the risk register will reflect this action with a
closed date.
CAPs include the following information:

Monitor and Measure

A regular schedule of reviewing the effectiveness of mitigation actions will be established. For risks
without mitigation measures, a similar evaluation schedule should be established to determine that
the risk remains low.
In addition to the risks, the ORM process will be regularly evaluated to determine effectiveness,
compliance, and potential improvements. Audits (internal and external) are an excellent means of
conducting this evaluation.

6. Report Outcome
RTD risks will be reported in compliance with regulatory requirements and as part of the feedback
loop to increase data-driven decisions and to enhance the confidence in the ORM process.

6.1

Public Utilities Commission (PUC) State Safety Oversight Agency
(SSOA)

Report to the PUC SSOA on a monthly basis those issues and risks required for reporting within the
PUC’s jurisdiction. This reporting will provide status of mitigations and progress towards closing out
CAPs.

6.2

Employees

Report to strengthen the Employee Reporting System and enhance RTD employee confidence in and
use of the ORM process. Reporting can include posting of risk registers with updated mitigation
status.

6.3

Joint Union/Management Safety Committee

Report to the Joint Union/Management Safety Committee on high risks from each local safety
committee, and on mitigation actions requiring additional funding.

6.4

Leadership Safety Committee

Report to the Leadership Safety Committee on high risks from each local safety committee, and on
mitigation actions requiring additional funding.

2.17.C.b

In 2016, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) mandated that every federally funded
transit agency in the United States must have a Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan in
place by October 2018. This iteration of RTD’s TAM Plan is the first required revision to the
TAM Plan under the prescribed schedule.
Thus the 2022 TAM Plan is the first required plan update since the introduction of the TAM
final rule. Each TAM plan has a four-year horizon, conforming to section 625.29 of Title 49.
TAM requirement nine mandates agencies to continually improve asset management
capabilities and to detail efforts to improve in the TAM Plan (Table 2). For this iteration of the
TAM Plan, the most notable improvement in asset management maturity has come by way of
actions from the General Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson (GM/CEO) and Chief Financial
Officer Doug MacLeod (CFO). Together they have affirmed, through policy and
communication, the intention to make the agency Asset Management Plan (AMP) the sole
funding mechanism for non-emergency asset renewals and replacements. Further, the
GM/CEO and CFO have indicated that the AMP itself shall be improved by refining Asset
Information Maturity (AIM) to provide data and resulting information for decision-making. By
asserting that the AMP is the sole mechanism for asset renewals and replacements and
communicating that this process shall be a data-driven exercise, the GM/CEO and CFO have
the effect of making good asset management practice a required part of receiving funding for
renewals. As such, it is expected that RTD will have better alignment between the letter and
spirit of TAM regulation and agency practice. This work is also part of RTD’s Strategic Plan
and assures that TAM practice is aligned to agency goals and considered in the landscape of
objectives.
Though progress towards improving RTD’s asset management maturity and capabilities is
proceeding, it is apparent that RTD cannot achieve ISO 55000 certification within its current
capability and resources within the four-year timeframe of this plan. Though ISO 55000 has
been a central theme of prior agency TAM Plans, more fundamental issues concerning AIM
and Asset Management System (AMS) maturity need to precede an intention to seek ISO
55000 certification. It is the intention of the agency to utilize aspects of the ISO 55000
framework to design, implement, maintain, and continually improve a functioning, effective,
adequately resourced AMS, based on plan-do-check-act principles.
RTD’s Accountable Executive, the GM/CEO, established an Asset Management Accountability
Team (AMAT) that has been charged with the responsibility of developing an AMS that is
compliant to regulation and advances the Strategic Plan. AMAT is made up of the Chief
Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Operations Officer (COO), Chief Administrative Officer (CAO),
and Assistant General Manager (AGM), Capital Programs. Though it has been communicated
in many forums that RTD would pursue ISO 55000, including prior TAM Plans, consensus and
commitment to the pursuit of ISO 55000 certification was not reached among the AMAT
members. As a result, the agency has been unable to identify a roadmap to certification and
decide upon a target date for improvements to be completed.

Executive Summary

Page | 4

Packet Pg. 341

AMAT has been able to identify subordinate objectives, including an Asset Information
Maturity (AIM) improvement roadmap to address the information needs for a compliant AMS.
As such, AMAT has established three progressive improvement goals within AIM to guide
activities. These are:
x Incremental improvements to AMP
x Develop and use whole-life cost (WLC) models in decision-making
x Create an “Optimized AMP” that utilizes cost, performance, and risk in data-driven
asset investment decisions
Led by the Safety Division, the agency has also made progress in developing an Operational
Risk Framework (ORF) that will be incorporated into the AMS. The ORF was developed to
satisfy requirements for the agency’s Safety Management System (SMS) and will serve as a
critical common link between the AMS, SMS, and potentially other management systems and
agency activities. The ORF is based on the ISO and American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) standards for risk management frameworks. It defines risk as “the effect of
uncertainty on objectives,” and utilizes the dimensions of frequency and severity to classify
hazards and identify the required actions to mitigate or accept risks according to the defined
and documented risk appetite of the agency. This important milestone will shape the
agency’s approach to asset management and will be incorporated into the AMS via the AIM
improvement efforts. It is expected that the ORF will become an important aspect of the
decision support tools required under section three of the TAM standard to produce the list of
prioritized investments required in TAM section four. (Table 2)
At the level of the Asset Stewards, those identified as having asset responsibility in the
agency, and the Asset Management Division (AMD), those responsible for administering
aspects of the AMS described in Appendix E other incremental improvements to the AMP
have been achieved, including improvements in equipment inventory highlighted in section
2.3.2 of this plan Initial work toward WLC models has been completed. In particular, one
WLC model is indicated to have been used in evaluating asset investment requests. The
organization has not made substantive progress toward developing cost, performance and
risk measures that are used as inputs in the TAM required decision support tools and
investment prioritization process. (Table 2)
A TAM plan is the cornerstone of asset stewardship. It is the public case for investment in the
assets to justify the use of tax dollars and fares to meet community requirements. It aims to
demonstrate the best use of funding to deliver services now and into the future. While the
agency has identified the need to take a different tack on developing a TAM-compliant AMS,
the agency is still committed to honoring the letter and spirit of the TAM regulation and the
laws from which the regulation is derived. This document communicates this commitment for
the agency, its planning partners, regulators including the FTA, and the communities that
RTD serves. Accordingly, this document summarizes:

RTD’s mission is to make lives better through connections, and its vision is to be the trusted
leader in mobility, delivering excellence and value to customers and community (RTD, 2021).
The communities RTD serves should know how the agency invests taxpayer dollars and how
decisions are made regarding the best use of limited resources. This is accomplished in part
through transparency in decision-making processes to sustain the condition and performance
of the assets.
The following table summarizes the agency’s response to each aspect of the TAM regulation.

3. DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS

What tools and
processes does RTD
use to prioritize
funding around those
assets described in its
inventory?

On an annual basis, RTD prepares and updates a six-year Mid-Term Financial
Plan (MTFP) that includes projected capital construction and improvements,
service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and
operating programs. The Asset Management Plan (AMP) is the input of asset
renewal and replacement needs into the MTFP. In RTD’s Financial plans,
approximately $120M annually is planned to fund asset renewal and
replacement needs for at least the period of this plan.

2.17.C.b

What is the result or
output of those
decision support tools
and processes?

The result of the decision support tools and processes described is the Asset
Management Plan. The prioritized AMP is the result of the prioritization process.
The funded/unfunded AMP is the intersection of the prioritized list of needs and
the funding allocated to replacements and renewals. The funded items are
included in the MTFP and budgets, while the unfunded items are retained in the
AMP and considered in future process iterations.

5. TAM AND SGR POLICY

What are the guiding
principles for asset
management efforts at
RTD?

RTD adopted an asset management policy in June 2014 and most recently
updated in August 2022. The intent of the policy is to improve how RTD
manages assets henceforth - it is therefore forward looking in nature and
represents the agency’s vision and shared commitment for good asset
management. The AMS applies to the entire organization and directs the short,
medium, and long-term plans for assets to achieve the agency mission of
making lives better through connections.

6. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

How is RTD going to
execute the TAM Plan?

RTD has identified a framework that is intended to move the agency from a
system reliant on judgement, perception and intuition to one that will be data
driven. A focus on improvements to asset information and incremental
improvements to the AMP to achieve that desired state. Processes around the
AMP are well defined and are completed annually.

7. LIST OF KEY ANNUAL ACTIVITIES

What activities does
RTD perform to
maintain its TAM
system?

RTD identifies two types of asset management activities: those ongoing asset
management activities performed as part of ‘business as usual,’ and those
activities specific to improving the AMS. TAM activities are the subset of these
activities targeting specific TAM elements.

8. IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES

What resources are
needed to execute
TAM plan activities?

Personnel from across the agency are involved in asset management activities,
including GM/CEO, the Leadership Team, the Asset Management Division (AMD),
and Operations, Capital Programs, Finance, Administration, Communications,
Planning, and General Counsel departments.
The AMD’s in-house expertise enables the agency to employ robust asset
management practices. A reduction-in-force associated with the COVID-19
pandemic resulted in the loss of some positions within the AMD, and a shift in
emphasis from ISO 55000 certification to more fundamental AMS improvements
has somewhat changed the structure of the AMD.

What is the Agency
doing to ensure that
the TAM plan delivers
the intended results?

The current TAM plan provides the baseline for evaluating the agency’s future
plans. RTD intends to regularly review its asset management maturity, setting
maturity targets in its Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP).
RTD intends to evaluate the degree to which it is meeting the requirements of
TAM and the agency’s strategic needs through the following measures:
x Measures identified in the Strategic Plan
x Assessments of adherence to the AMP process
x Regular AIM assessments and associated AIM improvement plans

1 Introduction
1.1 Background
On June 29, 2012, Congress passed the MAP-21 act. In accordance with section 20019 of this
law, the FTA established mandatory standards for all transit providers. The final implemented
regulation was published in the Federal Register on July 26, 2016, with an effective date of
October 1, 2016 (Transit Asset Management; National Transit Database, 2016). As illustrated
in Table 2, RTD is a Tier I Agency, meaning all TAM requirements apply to the agency.
The FTA requirements for a TAM Plan are as follows:

1.7 Asset Management Policy
An Asset Management (AM) Policy is a documented commitment to achieving and
maintaining a state of good repair for all capital assets. The FTA has defined state of good
repair as “The condition in which a capital asset is able to operate at a full level of
performance” (Transit Asset Management; National Transit Database, 2016).
RTD’s Asset Management Policy was updated on August 11, 2022. The policy describes a
forward-looking commitment to good asset management practice, intended to pursue
investment optimization across the entire asset portfolio to maximize its value. Asset
management performed according to this policy will result in assets that are in a state of
good repair.
The latest version of the Asset Management Policy is included on pages 13 and 14 of this
document. This document is included as evidence of compliance with TAM requirement five
(5), and is the documented executive-level expectations for asset management in the
agency.

The Regional Transportation District provides transportation services to 3.08 million people
located within its 2,342 square mile service area, such services include bus, rail, paratransit
services, demand-responsive microtransit services, and special event services. Though
operating a reduced schedule, RTD used these assets to provide over 46 million revenue
miles across all modes in 2021.

2.1 The RTD Story
The Colorado General Assembly created RTD in 1969. Efforts in early years
focused on regional transportation planning. In 1973, voters approved a 0.6%
sales tax initiative to finance a multi-modal transit system. At this time, RTD
acquired privately owned bus companies, improved service frequencies, and
expanded routes in several counties throughout the metro area. By 1976,
ridership had grown to 35 million boardings annually.
RTD celebrated its first light rail opening in October 1994. With a fleet of only
eleven light rail vehicles, the 5.3-mile line attracted hundreds of thousands of
customers when it began operations. Now, eight light rail lines service 57 stations
along seven individually constructed corridors.
In November 2004, voters approved the FasTracks ballot measure for the regionwide expansion of transit service. The 0.4% sales and use tax continues to fund the
FasTracks program, which has grown to include 122 miles of new commuter rail and light
rail, 18 miles of bus rapid transit corridor, and numerous rail and bus stations. The program
consists of six new rapid transit corridors and three existing corridor extensions.

2.2 Service Area
The agency’s service area is composed of eight counties including all of Boulder, Broomfield,
Denver and Jefferson counties, large areas of Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas counties, and a
small portion of Weld County.

In 2000, RTD provided approximately 77 million passenger trips. (U.S. Department of
Transportation, 2000) By 2019, passenger trips grew to 105 million, a 30% increase in
boardings. Over the same period, per the Colorado State Demographer’s Office, the
Denver/Boulder region increased from approximately 2.4 million residents to approximately
3.2 million residents, a 31% increase (2019). Unsurprisingly, due in large part to the COVID19 pandemicthe agency experienced a severe decline in ridership in 2020, resulting in

approximately 52 million boardings for the year. (U.S. DOT, 2021) In 2021, the agency
reported approximately 49 million passenger boardings in as of yet unpublished National
Transit Database (NTD) submission. While ridership appears to be recovering, it is unclear
when utilization of RTD’s assets by customers will return to pre-pandemic levels.

2.3 RTD Assets
RTD is an asset-intensive organization. RTD’s Statement of Net Position notes that capital
assets total nearly $9.3 billion, excluding accumulated depreciation (Regional Transportation
District, 2021), of which most is within the scope of TAM as detailed in this section.
As assets are operated, their condition degrades over time, and their risk of failure increases.
Failures, including those having an impact on safety, can manifest in a variety of ways. Asset
condition is therefore a leading indicator for safety risks, and understanding asset condition
today, and how quickly it might degrade in the future, is an important aspect of good asset,
safety, and risk management. Organizations that understand their assets’ deterioration rates
can also make more informed decisions on renewal frequencies and their approach to
preventive maintenance. RTD’s commitment to improve AIM to support decision-making is
expected to include data on the frequency and severity of assets in accordance with the ORF.
For the purposes of this TAM Plan, RTD has categorized its assets in accordance with FTA
guidelines: revenue vehicles, equipment, facilities, and infrastructure, using the flowchart
depicted in Figure 5 below, adherence to which ensures repeatable results and an
improvement in inventory data quality.

RTD’s revenue vehicle fleet is composed of 1,454 buses, 201 light rail vehicles and 66
commuter rail vehicles. The operation and maintenance of bus vehicles is shared between
the agency and third-party contractors. The light rail vehicle fleet is exclusively operated and
maintained by the agency. The operation of sixty-six commuter rail vehicles is shared
between RTD and a third-party, Denver Transit Operators (DTO) and all maintenance
activities on the commuter rail vehicles are performed by DTO.
Transit vehicles in the agency’s rubber tire fleet include:

Standard 40’ fixed-route transit buses with a seated capacity of approximately 40
passengers, including battery electric bus (BEB) assets
Fixed-route articulated buses with 33% greater capacity than standard buses
Regional intercity coaches, such as those used for Flatiron Flyer service, built for
longer trips at highway speed, which are typically 45 feet long and have a seated
capacity of 55 passengers
Cutaways which are made by second stage manufacturers, using the chassis of fullsize vans, used to provide on-demand service for eligible customers with disabilities
(Access-a-Ride) and in areas where ridership does not support fixed route service
(FlexRide)

In service RTD buses have been procured from a variety of manufacturers including: Gillig,
BYD, New Flyer, MCI, Goshen, Eldorado, and StarTrans. Approximately 50% of standard and
articulated fixed route buses are operated and maintained by RTD, with the operations and
maintenance for the remainder outsourced3 to two external partner companies, First Transit
and TransDev. All intercity coaches are operated and maintained by RTD. All cutaway buses
are operated and maintained by third parties (Via Transportation, MV Transportation and
Evergreen Senior Center).

Light rail vehicles (LRV) are electrically powered using a 750-volt direct-current overhead
catenary system. Individual vehicles can be coupled together to form up to four cars per
consist, with a designed seated capacity of approximately 64 per car. LRVs can carry up to an
estimated 236 passengers per car utilizing the standing room. All light rail vehicles are
manufactured by Siemens and are acquired, owned, operated and maintained by RTD.

All of the Hyundai Rotem commuter rail vehicles maintenance is outsourced to DTO. RTD will
assume responsibility at the end of the contracted period of performance of 30 years.
Condition assessments will not be performed on these assets until such time as RTD assumes
additional responsibility for the vehicles.

Figure 11: Commuter Rail Vehicle (Hyundai Rotem)

RTD has historically managed its revenue vehicle inventory based on age: the vehicles are
procured, maintained in a state of good repair for a specified number of years through a
preventative and repair maintenance program, and then replaced. This approach is adopted
for revenue vehicles maintained by third parties, including buses and commuter rail vehicles.
Table 3 below presents the total number of revenue vehicles for which RTD has capital
responsibility, along with their Useful Life Benchmark (ULB), which is the expected duration
in years that an asset will remain in service according to RTD’s standards and the expected
condition based on its age. The condition range is from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the vehicle
is significantly beyond its useful life benchmark and 5 is considered new. A vehicle that has
reached the end of its useful life benchmark is scored at 2.5 and from that point onwards is
considered in backlog. (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2016). The percentage of
vehicles in backlog within each type is also presented. Table 3 also presents the total initial
capital cost4 of the vehicles in each sub-fleet. In the AMP, and certain budgeting and financial
tools, costs other than the total initial capital cost are used, such as the expected
replacement value in the plan year.
RTD’s bus fleet has been a focus of renewals, though some buses are now considered to be
in backlog. Based on a combination of funding availability and subject matter expert
judgements, some transit buses will continue to be operated in backlog.
Regarding the ULB for LRVs, RTD is presently re-evaluating the 40-year ULB that was
approved by FTA. There are several factors that differ from what was expected when the 40year ULB was proposed. Several key components have gone out of production or will soon
go out of production. The cost of some parts that are custom replacements for parts that
have ceased production by the original manufacturer is quite high and would lead to
increases in the WLC of the LRVs that are not manageable. Until that formal evaluation can

4 In the future, RTD intends to determine the WLC (e.g., capital expense and operating expense) of its assets and this will be
considered for inclusion in a subsequent generation of the TAMP.

take place and be submitted for review by FTA, RTD will continue to use the approved 40year ULB until such time as the process for restoring the 31-year ULB has been completed.
RTD’s LRVs vary in age, and only the oldest trains model year 1993 (eleven units) and 1996
(six units) SD-100 series would be evaluated for retirement in the near future with a shift
from the approved 40-year ULB to the standard 31-year ULB utilized by most agencies. This
represents only seventeen vehicles of the total 201 vehicle fleet and would not be expected
to affect RTD’s ability to deliver light rail service within the scope of the period of the TAM
Plan. This approach of using WLC modeling for making asset renewal decisions is a first for
RTD and is expected to set the tone for future asset renewals in the future.

Significant improvements in equipment asset information have been made since the last
iteration of the TAM plan. The TAM Systems guidance was helpful in improving the agency’s
understanding of current and future expectations of equipment information in the TAM
framework. (U.S.DOT, 2020) While the present TAM requirements indicate equipment
inventories must contain assets that cost $50,000 or more, RTD’s Accounting department
defines an asset as an asset of $5,000 or more with at least a one-year useful life. Capital
asset tags are assigned to equipment assets noted as being an asset in the Fixed Financial
Assets (FFA) register managed by Accounting. Additionally, assets in the equipment class
have importance significant enough to be managed in Trapeze Enterprise Asset Management
(EAM) system. Assets managed in this way are deemed to have special importance to
continued service delivery. At least one of the three criteria above must be met in order for
equipment to be considered an asset in the AMP. Presented in this plan are those assets
included in the AMP and which need to be described in sections three and four of the TAM
requirements. Were the agency to only report on the decision tools and the prioritized list of
investments with the $50,000 threshold, the explanation of what has and will occur would be
incomplete. Given a desire to ensure alignment of agency activities, and to provide
transparency in agency processes, the equipment inventory information presented in this
TAM Plan is guided by the requirements for the AMP, which staff believes to exceed the
requirements outlined in the TAM regulations.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

2.17.C.b

In order to improve the AMP, the AMD worked closely with asset stewards across the agency
to conduct physical inventories of assets. This is viewed as a step forward in improving

information maturity for assets in this class. Expanding both the number of items included
and the quality of the information therein. It is expected that this effort will facilitate
improved management of equipment assets in the future. In addition, RTD will be able to
share more information on equipment assets with its planning partners in the TAM Plan.
Equipment information will continue to include non-revenue vehicles in a manner conforming
to the three NTD categories, which are automobiles, truck and other rubber tire vehicles, and
steel wheel vehicles. Asset information for non-revenue vehicles has been more mature than
for other equipment assets, so no change in how the non-revenue vehicle assets has
occurred for this iteration of TAM reporting. These assets have long been included in the AMP
process.
The inventory of non-revenue vehicle equipment is found in Table 5. This provides detail on
the 48 automobiles, four steel wheel non-revenue vehicles, and 377 rubber tire non-revenue
vehicles in this equipment group. Additional information includes the initial capital cost of the
assets along with the useful life benchmark (ULB), and a score representing the condition of
the equipment based on its age. The score range is from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the asset
is significantly beyond its useful life benchmark and 5 is considered new. An asset that has
reached the end of its ULB is scored at 2.5, and from that point onwards is considered in
backlog. RTD uses the FTA definition for non-revenue vehicle backlog, which is the
percentage of vehicles that have met or exceeded their useful life benchmark. A non-revenue
vehicle that has reached the end of its ULB is scored at 2.5, and from that point onwards is
considered in backlog (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2016).

equipment is procured, maintained in a state of good repair for a specified number of years
through preventative maintenance and repair, and then replaced.5 As such, condition scores
for non-revenue vehicle equipment are age-based. However, the agency has departed from
planning for age-based renewals of assets in this category while an examination of the
utilization and utility of these assets is underway. Until such time as a new means for
evaluating the utilization and performance of assets in this class, and particularly vehicles
used primarily for administrative purposes, it is the expectation that few renewals will take
place within this class of equipment and vehicles will be knowingly operated in backlog.

Non-vehicle equipment is purchased from a variety of manufacturers and is owned, operated
and maintained by RTD. Non-vehicle equipment consists of various types of machinery used
indirectly in the provision of public transportation services. There is a broad range of assets
reflected in Table 6, from in-plant equipment, to parts management equipment, to
landscaping equipment. A more detailed equipment asset inventory can also be found in
Appendix H. Non-vehicle equipment information gathering exercises are expected to continue
uncovering assets for inclusion into the AMP and TAM Plan within the four-year horizon of
this plan.
Non-vehicle equipment represents a wide variety of assets and are not managed in a uniform
way. While the efforts to improve inventory have yielded results, additional information on
non-vehicle equipment assets will need to be matured in order to develop an effective
management strategy by equipment type. Additional information on ULBs and/or EULs will
also need to be developed to ensure the accuracy of equipment lifespan estimates collected
from third-party resources to ensure that RTD is using the equipment in a manner similar to
those used in establishing the ULB. Strategies other than age-based approaches will require
additional maturity, such as collecting and utilizing data on engine hours in replacement
planning. Within the period of this plan, it is expected that the inventory will further increase
and that an age-based approach to management will be the most common method employed
for asset replacement.

Five administration facilities where RTD administration functions occur
Nine maintenance facilities where maintenance work occur
121 public facilities, which includes stations, buildings and other structures where
customers can board or alight from an RTD transit vehicle
114 conveyances such as elevators and escalators, installed within facilities (these are
treated here separately based on NTD reporting requirements)

Administration, maintenance, and public facilities for which RTD has capital responsibility are
operated and maintained by RTD, although some services, such as cleaning and snow
removal, may be contracted to third parties. Conveyance manufacturers include Kone and
ThyssenKrupp, and conveyance maintenance is outsourced to third parties.

Figure 16: Bus Maintenance Facility

RTD has historically managed its facilities and their related equipment on a reactive basis,
i.e., the practice has been to maintain or replace the assets when they fail. The more critical
facility elements, such as underground storage tanks, can have redundancy built in to
minimize service interruptions when they fail to perform as designed.
Since 2015, RTD has performed in-house assessments to determine the condition score of
individual elements of each facility for which RTD has capital responsibility. As such, facility
condition scores are assessment-based. This is based on the Transit Economic Requirements
Model (TERM) scale and is utilized for both TAM and NTD reporting.

Conveyance inspections are outsourced to third parties in accordance with applicable
legislation and regulations but are not used to determine condition. These assets are
managed on an age-based approach consistent with regulatory standards. Both preventive
and reactive maintenance activities are performed by third parties, and the activities
delivered under these contractual agreements are monitored by RTD staff to ensure contract
adherence and acceptable performance of the assets.
Table 8 presents the total number of facility assets for which RTD has capital responsibility,
along with their EUL and a score representing the condition of the asset. The table provides
backlog for each asset, for which RTD uses the FTA definition for facilities backlog, the

Infrastructure
RTD’s rail infrastructure can most easily addressed in three parts, directly operated light rail,
third party operated commuter rail, and directly operated commuter rail.
RTD owns light rail infrastructure including grade crossings, catenary wire segments, track,
relay cases, switches, and substations, as well as light rail vehicle bridges, and commuter rail
alignments operated and maintained by a third party.

Figure 20: Light Rail Vehicle Bridge

Light rail infrastructure is purchased or constructed
by a variety of manufacturers and is owned,
operated, and maintained by RTD. RTD has
historically managed light rail infrastructure assets
based on age but did perform condition
assessments of select light rail infrastructure for
three years. In doing so, RTD determined that agebased condition scores provided similar levels of
accuracy as assessment-based condition scores,
and so has stopped performing condition
Figure 21: Track Infrastructure
assessments. As such, light rail infrastructure
condition scores are age-based (Regional Transportation District, 2017).
Seventy-seven light rail vehicle bridges are owned and maintained by RTD. Seven light rail
vehicle bridges are owned and maintained by third parties. Light rail vehicle bridges are
inspected once every two years by an independent third-party contractor per state law.
Defects noted in inspections are then addressed through a combination of in-house and
contracted resources, as determined by RTD staff. Though inspection data is obtained from
the third-party the inspection methodology does not conform to the TERM scale. Condition
assessments for bridges owned and maintained by third parties are not recorded in the
TAMP. As a result, the agency relies on age-based scores to communicate the condition of
assets to planning partners.
All commuter rail infrastructure is delivered under the FasTracks program. The operation of
the A, B, and G lines, as well as all commuter rail electrical power substations is outsourced
to DTO. RTD will assume ownership for these commuter rail infrastructure assets at the end
of the contracted period of performance (30 years from inception). Condition assessments
will not be performed on these assets until such time as RTD assumes capital responsibility.
In 2020, RTD opened a directly operated commuter rail line, the N Line. This directly
operated commuter rail infrastructure added to the diversity of RTD’s rail assets and is noted

Tables 11 and 12 present the total number of light rail infrastructure assets for which RTD
has capital responsibility, along with their EUL and age-based condition and backlog scores.
Table 13 presents the total number of light rail and directly operated commuter rail vehicle
bridges for which RTD has capital responsibility, along with their EUL and assessment-based
condition scores.
Table 14A represents the number, EUL, and age-based score for key directly operated
commuter rail assets.
Table 14B represents the original directly operated commuter rail assets as reflected in the
Fixed Financial Assets records.
Table 15 represents the directly operated commuter rail track by type, noting the differences
in EUL between the types and relevant age-based scores.
Tables 16 and 17 represent the FTA performance measure for infrastructure which is the
percentage of guideway directional route miles (DRM) with performance restrictions by light
rail and commuter rail by class, respectively. However, RTD anticipates that the guideway
under performance restriction measure may not be an adequate measure of condition for rail
infrastructure assets in the future (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2017).
There are many reasons why rail infrastructure assets would be placed under a temporary
performance restriction such as routine maintenance, the presence of inspection personnel in
the right of way, or police activity at or near crossings. These reasons provide no indication
of the condition of the assets. Additionally, track assets that are in very poor condition but
that exist in a high-density urban environment may not have a performance restriction
because the design speed is low in such areas. The age of these assets along with physical
inspections will likely be more useful for investment decisions; consequently, RTD also
provides age-based condition and backlog scores for light rail infrastructure assets.
RTD’s first light rail line opened in 1994; assets of that era, with an EUL of 25 years, are
currently shown in backlog in Table 11. However, this may not reflect the true condition of
the assets. Major repairs to assets, such as replacement or refurbishment of components,
renews the life of those assets, such improvements have not been reliably recorded in a
system of record. The Asset Management Division is working with Light Rail Maintenance of
Way and Capital Programs Department to improve asset information and to begin recording
major repairs of assets in a system of record for reporting, compliance, and planning
purposes.

information resources. The costs are commensurate with the level of the capital program,
which are not easily disambiguated to the level of the asset counts by type. To present the
best currently available estimates, directly operated commuter rail assets are presented
separately in tables 14A and 14B. While the information presented in this plan is believed to
be accurate, further refinements are expected to support improvements to the AMP for these
assets.

3 Current Capital Investment Decision Process
The capital improvement component of RTD’s fiscal policy states that “On an annual basis,
RTD will prepare and update a six-year Mid-Term Financial Plan including projected capital
construction and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the
capital and operating programs.” (Regional Transportation District, 2016)
The MTFP also provides the basis for the agency’s application for federal transit funding
through the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional
Council of Governments (DRCOG). The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the
region that receive federal funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the
qualifying MTFP projects are included in the TIP.
The current renewal and replacement capital investment decision process begins with the
agency AMP. The AMP is a process, as well as a product (Fig. 22) The AMP begins with
information from systems of record, primarily Trapeze EAM and the Fixed Financial Assets
list, but also includes ad-hoc resources such as manual inventories in spreadsheets and

Packet Pg. 370

Capital Programs initiatives not tied to specific assets. This collection of information is used to
create an “Initial AMP” which is prepared for asset stewards. The asset stewards then assess
the age-based information and apply their judgement to determine whether to accept or
modify the results of the initial AMP, this is known as the validated AMP. This stage is also
where asset stewards augment information on “fact sheets” that are prepared by the AMD
using the information from the system(s) of record with additional information which will
assist other stewards in appropriately prioritizing the funding requests among other requests.
The prioritized AMP is the result of the annual evaluation of information from the validated
AMP requests by a panel of asset stewards. Each fall the Asset Management Working Group
(AMWG) is convened where asset stewards use the information available to them in the
validated AMP stage to prioritize requests. This results in the prioritized list of investments
shown in Table 20. The prioritized AMP is then compared to available funding for asset
renewals and replacements. Funded requests become part of the budget in the MTFP and the
remainder of the renewal and replacement requests remain in the AMP process for
consideration in future iterations of that process. The AMP process is illustrated in Figure 22
and the relationship of each AMP cycle to the MTFP is shown in Figure 23.

4 List of Prioritized Investments
The output of the current capital investment decision process is a list of prioritized capital
projects. For 2022-2028, the requested renewal and replacement needs are shown in Tables
20A-20G. For ease of presentation, each year of prioritized investments is presented
separately.
Reflecting the annual budget cycle only items in the approved budget are truly funded,
though funds are planned for asset renewals and replacements in the scope of this TAM Plan.
As the agency’s AMP is focused on the renewal and replacement of existing assets, only the
prioritized renewal and replacement needs are reflected in the TAM Plan. Other investments
such as those required to comply with laws, regulations, and legal judgements are
considered obligatory and are addressed outside of the AMP prioritization process.

As an agency with a 53-year history, RTD has not experienced the decaying infrastructure or
immediate funding shortages that many legacy and larger transit systems have. Historically,
RTD has had the necessary funding in place and the professional expertise to maintain its
transit assets in a state of good repair while meeting the growing demand for service.
However, as mentioned in the executive summary, RTD’s backlog of existing assets is
growing and will experience swells of assets achieving their respective EULs, such as those
from pre-FasTracks expansion activities including the original light rail alignment known as
the Metro Area Circulator (MAC) or Central Corridor, the Southwest light rail alignment, the
Southeast rail alignment that was a component of the T-REX project, and the Central Platte
Valley (CPV) extension. The asset renewal and replacement needs are expected to be $453M
for the 2022-2028 planning period (Figure 25). Presently the AMP records reflect a funding
need of over $187 million for 2022, which is largely accounts for the backlog for assets in the
scope of TAM. (Figure 26) The actual funding needs are likely higher due to assets out of
scope of TAM, assets that have yet to be recognized in the AMS, and uncertainty around the
infrastructure and facilities needs that result from a lack of controlled and available asset
information on which to formulate data-driven plans. The known unfunded needs by asset
type are summarized in Figure 27.
RTD’s asset management maturity improvement initiative was not initially driven by a
growing set of decaying assets, but rather by the expansion of the asset base in recent
years. Beginning with the T-REX project and continuing with the current FasTracks project,
over the past 16 years RTD has invested over $6.4 billion on new rail and bus rapid transit
service.
The funding for the most recent expansion projects did not make sufficient provision for the
long-term maintenance and capital renewal of the new assets. Without a solid, long-term
renewal plan in place, with funding earmarked, the risk of a growing backlog of renewal
projects without adequate funding is too great to be unaddressed. In 2022, the agency
identified funding needs over a long-range planning horizon and determined that funding of
at least $120 million annualized would be required to address the state of good repair needs.
A growing backlog for any transit agency increases risks to safety, service, and future
sustainability; it feeds a pattern of expensive reactionary repair and remediation tasks. The
AMP process and available funding are tools to ensure the future viability of the assets and
position the agency for providing value to the customers and community the agency serves.
RTD is preparing an AMP that addresses future funding needs for existing assets, prioritizing
renewals over enhancements. The original cost of assets is less useful to the agency than
projected future costs. Therefore, RTD’s efforts emphasize creating accurate and increasingly
precise estimates of the investments that are needed over the coming budget planning cycle.
Improvement in AIM will facilitate the agency’s ability to forecast costs, estimate performance
consequences, and understand risk to achieving strategic objectives.

The AMP will determine which assets are included for renewal or replacement in the
investment prioritization process. The projected funding needs over the period 2022-2028 are
illustrated in the graphs that follow.

5.1 Strategic Asset Management Plan
RTD aims to comply fully with MAP-21 requirements for transit asset management and
beyond. It has developed an overall Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP) to summarize
its strategy to improve asset management over the next period.
From 2004, with the publication of BSI PAS-55, and then ISO 55000 in 2014, organizations
have been able to exploit a standardized good practice framework for implementing an
aligned AMS. This approach to utilizing an existing asset management framework is a best
practice and is still a focal point for the SAMP.

Typically, organizations begin with a focus on asset information, particularly the inventory of
all their assets and assessing asset condition. This information supports clearer planning,
because this allows the organization to fully assess its assets and their condition. The
intended result is not just a clear plan to cover all the assets but is rather a prioritized and
optimized plan based on understanding the risks to objectives and using this to make the
best use of limited resources.
RTD has invested heavily in developing improved inventories and processes to deliver the
AMP, with a particular emphasis on improving inventory information which includes what the
assets are, but also their in-service date, EUL, and cost to round out information needed for
generating an AMP. As discussed elsewhere in this plan, information improvements to
facilitate decision-making for assets is also addressed in the goals set by AMAT and reported
in the SAMP.
The current strategy is to focus on continued improvement of the AMP through AIM
improvement initiatives, utilizing principles of good asset management and tools derived from
ISO 55000 standards, though the agency will not seek certification within the four-year scope
of this TAM Plan. The SAMP is due to be revisited and it is expected that the adjustments
from being focused on ISO 55000 certification to an approach more centered on fundamental
activities that improve the AMP by enhancing AIM.

5.2

Key Annual Activities

RTD identifies two types of asset management activity: those ongoing asset management
activities that RTD performs as part of “business as usual,” and those activities specific to
furthering the development and improvement of the AMP. TAM activities are the subset of
these targeting the specific TAM elements, and these are shown in a third section below.
“ usiness as Usual” Asset Management Activities
As an asset-intensive organization, RTD already performs a number of asset management
activities on a routine basis, and these will continue to improve through the TAM Plan
horizon.
This section summarizes those “business as usual” activities, using the Institute of Asset
Management’s Conceptual Model for Asset Management (2015) to categorize into six main
blocks. This should not be interpreted to imply these ongoing activities are all necessarily well
aligned or integrated at present.

Figure 31: The Institute of Asset Management (IAM) Conceptual Model for Asset Management

The Planning department periodically conducts demand analysis for its
transit service and uses this to support long-term strategic planning for
system optimization, expansion and enhancement. At present, strategic
planning for capital renewals and maintenance volumes is not formally performed, though
RTD anticipates the need to enhance its capabilities in this area through the development of
asset class strategies and an AMP (see next section for details). Although not yet a “business
as usual” activity, in undertaking the development of this TAM Plan, RTD has embarked on
asset management planning.
RTD’s current approach to capital investment decision-making is
described in Section 3, and this activity is performed annually to
develop the MTFP. Operations and maintenance decision-making is
performed within each asset owner group but does not currently formally consider or align
with agency objectives.
Ongoing activities include capital project processes for asset
acquisition, which is split between the Capital Programs Department for
commuter rail and facility assets and the Operations Department for
rail, bus and rail infrastructure assets. Maintenance delivery occurs for
each major asset class and includes preventive and corrective maintenance, along with
condition assessments where warranted. Some asset classes have a larger focus on
preventative maintenance, while others have more emphasis on corrective maintenance and
maintain assets when they fail. Most maintenance delivery is performed by staff, with some
being outsourced. Asset operations are a significant part of RTD’s ongoing activities, and
includes bus, rail, equipment and infrastructure operations, some of which are also
outsourced. Improved asset information and a focus on aligning to strategic objectives will
facilitate more effective resourcing strategies that ensure the resources to meet strategic

objectives are allocated. RTD also performs shutdown and outage management of its assets
to enable maintenance access. As assets develop operating faults, the agency implements its
fault and incident response plans in accordance with agreed methods.
RTD uses several asset information systems to manage its Asset
Information, including Trapeze EAM for asset inventory and
maintenance management, and the Oracle Enterprise Business Suite
for related financial information. Other systems including Bentley
Optram and Railroad Software have been added to address the specific requirements of light
rail maintenance of way and directly operated commuter rail maintenance of way (commonly
referred to as North Metro). However, these systems have not been fully integrated into
organization processes.
There are several basic data and information management processes in effect, including
regular reporting to the NTD, and regular data quality assessment and cleansing processes
for Trapeze EAM information. The Asset Management Division employs a data science and
analytics team to support designated asset stewards with collection, management, and
analysis of non-physical data. This group also performs data assurance tasks on corporate
data and performs all FTA TAM report preparation activities.
The RTD data science and analytics team also administers the asset information maturity
(AIM) process, having designed the framework, administered assessments, and provided
significant consultative guidance in the development of AIM improvement plans and
professional support in the execution of many analytics tasks within the plans.
RTD applies procurement and supply chain management principles for
its outsourced asset management functions. These include the capital
delivery of its FasTracks program, along with some ongoing operations
and maintenance of the assets the program delivers. The operation
and maintenance of approximately half of RTD’s bus services is outsourced to two service
providers, and the maintenance of certain facility assets, such as elevators, is also
outsourced.
RTD’s Finance department uses standard accounting practices to
perform asset costing and valuation, including their valuation and
deprecation of assets over time. Integration of the ORF into AIM
improvement plans, in the renewal/replacement requests and more
broadly into other operational plans is expected within the period of this TAM Plan.

Asset Management System Activities
In addition to the ongoing asset management activities described above, RTD also has
activities defined as part of its 2021–2026 Strategic Plan. The strategic plan identifies the
objective to “[d]esign, implement, maintain and continually improve a functioning, effective,
adequately resourced management system for all physical assets, based on plan-do-checkact principles,” and to “[c]reate and manage the asset management plan to provide a

These strategic objectives presently require improvements in AIM to enhance the AMS and
AMP, and therefore much of the AMD’s resources are aimed at delivering information
maturity improvements over the scope of this TAM Plan.

5.2.2.1 Design an Asset Management Organization
This includes the implementation of an AMS that meets the agency’s strategic needs: the
framework to define and manage the key elements, including a policy, strategy and risk
management framework, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities.

5.2.2.2 Asset Management Planning
This includes the development of asset class strategies and an AMP as key elements of an
investment planning process.

5.2.2.3 Improve Rigor and Control
This implements improved control over core asset delivery and financial activities and
includes improved information to aid in accurate and precise financial planning to meet the
agency’s strategic needs, not limited to those items with a particular asset management
focus in the strategic plan.

5.2.2.4 Assurance and Performance
In order to deliver on the AMAT goal of achieving an Optimized AMP, an improved
performance management framework aligned to measure those things most critical to
delivery of the agency’s strategic plan will be required. It is not anticipated that a unified
organization-wide asset performance framework will be delivered within the scope of this
four-year TAM Plan. However, improved asset performance measures may be a component
of AIM initiatives in the coming years.

5.2.2.5 Enhance Asset Information
This is centered on the development and implementation of an AIM framework, including
definition of RTD’s information requirements and the strategies employed for meeting them,
along with clear governance for asset information. Without changes in organizational
structure, it is not anticipated that a unified, organization-wide asset register will be delivered
within the scope of this four-year TAM Plan.

5.2.2.6 Learning and Communication
This is to support the embedding of asset management awareness, culture and
competencies, and includes a training needs analysis and a program of appropriate asset
management training, as well as communication to raise awareness of asset management
throughout the organization, and the development of an appropriate asset management
culture.

including the GM/CEO, the Leadership Team, the Asset Management Division, and the
Operations, Capital Programs, Finance, Administration, Communications, Planning, and
General Counsel departments.

usiness as Usual Asset Management activities
The resourcing strategy for the “business as usual” annual asset management activities will
continue with the current strategy, i.e. resourcing the activities through the agency
departments that currently perform or are involved in them.

Asset Management System Activities
The 2021-2026 Strategic Plan requires the establishment of a functioning, effective,
sufficiently resourced management system for assets. The resourcing strategy is to establish
clear accountability and responsibility for the Asset Management System, with the authority
to direct and allocate resources being granted to the accountable group. The diagram below
illustrates the accountability structure and other contributors.

Figure 32: ISO 55000 Contributing Resource Groups

In late 2011, RTD assigned two employees the task of building an Asset Management
Division (AMD). The Division would eventually be responsible for improving the management
of assets and building an agency-wide AMS.
To ensure the most accurate, non-biased information possible, the Leadership Team
determined the AMD should be independent of the asset delivery functions.

The AMD was recently placed in the Finance department to facilitate greater alignment to
supporting the agency’s financial planning needs through delivery of the AMP processes and
products. More details are in Appendix F.
The AMD staff possess a wealth of asset management expertise, as a number of its
employees transferred from other areas of the agency, bringing with them significant
knowledge of agency operations, experience in maintenance of many asset classes, physical
asset business analysis, and/or data science. External hires provided additional subject
matter expertise, knowledge, skills, and abilities.

TAM Activities
The resourcing strategy for the TAM activities is not only to define an accountable executive
for all TAM requirements but to assign TAM responsibilities to the AMD. Supporting resources
from other agency departments will be utilized and consulted or informed on an as-needed
basis. Details of both the accountable executive and the AMD are in Appendix E.

6 Evaluation Plan
6.1

TAM Plan Evaluation

The TAM Plan will be evaluated on degree of compliance when RTD receives each triennial
audit.
However, the plan is intended to do more than meet compliance. It is a statement of
intentions and commitment to deliver the culture, policy, and procedural changes necessary
for the improved efficacy and efficiency of transit agencies that is implied in the regulations.
This TAM Plan provides a baseline for evaluating future TAM Plans produced by the agency.
RTD intends to regularly review its asset management maturity, setting maturity targets in its
SAMP. This document will also serve as a basis of comparison to peer agencies, allowing RTD
to learn from other TAM Plans to identify where improvements can be made.
RTD will annually evaluate its performance against the previous cycle’s TAM Plan
improvement goals and agency objectives with documentation and explanation of progress
(Regional Transportation District, 2021).

Accountable Executive – A single, identifiable person who has ultimate
responsibility for carrying out the safety management system of a public
transportation agency; responsibility for carrying out transit asset management
practices; and control or direction over the human and capital resources needed to
develop and maintain both the agency's public transportation agency safety plan, in
accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5329(d), and the agency's transit asset management plan
in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5326.
Asset Information Maturity (AIM) – This consists of a framework, an assessment,
AIM plans, and updates to the Asset Management Accountability Team on progress
towards stated objectives in plans. The framework that includes a six-stage model
indicating relative maturity that are mutually exclusive based on the availability of
information, the quality of data in its utility for decision-making/planning, the
presence or absence of a documented plan/procedure for the development and
utilization of data suitable for decision-making/planning, whether or not documented
plans/procedures are followed and monitored for adherence, and whether a ‘plan-docheck-act’ cycle of continuous improvement is applied to tune information and plan
quality to achieve organization objectives. The inventory consists of 24 items based
on ISO 55000 clauses 7.5 and 7.6 regarding information and its control. The plans are
signed documents available on the RTD intranet.
Backlog – State of Good Repair backlog is representative of the reinvestment cost to
replace any transit assets whose condition is below the midpoint on TERM’s 1 (poor)
to 5 (excellent) scale, or 2.5 for assets using age-based replacement or renewal
strategies including rolling stock, equipment, and infrastructure. For facilities,
condition inspections resulting in a score of 3 or less on the TERM scale shall be
considered to be in backlog.
Base System – Base System refers to RTD’s assets not included in the FasTracks
system. The Base System is supported in part by a 0.6% sales and use tax. Base
System funding and FasTracks funding are tracked separately.
Capital Responsibility – Transit agencies are required to report condition
assessments for assets that they own or jointly own with another entity, that they are
responsible for replacing, overhauling, refurbishing, or conducting major repairs on
that asset, or for which the cost of those activities is itemized as a capital line item in
the agency's budget.
CDOT – Colorado Department of Transportation.
Consist – A set of railroad vehicles forming a complete train.
Contracted Service – A contract for services is a formal, legally binding agreement
between RTD and a private company to provide service delivery.
Data Driven Decisions - The process of making organizational decisions based on
actual and verifiable data rather than intuition or observation alone. The approach
includes problem solving where a well-defined set of actions are driven by decisions
which are further driven by insights (extracted from data) using sound methods.
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) – Denver’s metropolitan
planning organization (MPO). https://drcog.org/

Direct operated and purchased services – Direct operated services are those
services provided by RTD staff using RTD assets. Purchased Services are those
operated under contract on behalf of RTD using outside staffing. See also Contracted
Service.
Estimated Useful Life (EUL) – The Estimated Useful Life indicates the expected
duration in years that the asset will remain in service under normal operating
conditions and maintenance. This metric is agency-defined as opposed to FTA
established Useful Life Benchmarks. At the end of useful life of the asset, major
renewal or replacement is expected.
FasTracks – FasTracks is a ballot initiative that levied an additional 0.4% sales tax
for expansion of the RTD system. FasTracks introduced commuter rail service as well
as a Public Private Partnership (P3) to the system.
ISO 55000 – The international standard covering management of assets of any kind.
Prior to the establishment of this standard, a Publicly Available Specification (BSI PAS55) was published by the British Standards Institution in 2004 for physical assets. The
ISO 55000 series of Asset Management standards was formalized in 2014 and is
composed of three parts:
o ISO 55000:2014 Asset management – Overview, Principles and Terminology
o ISO 55001:2014 Asset management – Management Systems – Requirements
o ISO 55002:2014 Guidelines for the Application of ISO 55001
Leadership Team (LT) – Agency leaders who hold the title of Chiefs and/or Assistant
General Managers that lead departments and/or operating modalities
MAP-21 – MAP-21, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (P.L. 112141) was signed into law by President Obama on July 6, 2012.
Mid-Term Financial Plan or MTFP – A portion of RTD’s total budget not already
committed to specific capital projects and not apportioned to ongoing operations and
maintenance that is evaluated and prioritized through a process described in Section 3
of this document.
National Transit Database – A federal reporting program for transit agencies
receiving Federal Transit Administration (FTA) funding, which serves as a primary
repository for all transit-related data and statistics in the United States. The
performance data from the NTD is used to allocate FTA funding and to report on
public transit performance to Congress and researchers.
State of Good Repair – “The condition in which a capital asset is able to operate at
a full level of performance.” (Transit Asset Management; National Transit Database,
2016)
TERM – Transit Economic Requirements model is a tool used by the FTA along with a
numeric code that represents the categorization of assets, as indicated in the TERMLite model.
Useful Life Benchmark (ULB) – The Useful Life Benchmark indicates the expected
duration in years that the asset will remain in service under normal operating
conditions and maintenance. This metric is established by the FTA as opposed to the
agency-defined Estimated Useful Life metric. At the end of useful life of the asset,
major renewal or replacement is expected.

Appendix B: SGR Master Condition Rating Definitions for
RTD
RTD follows the FTA guidance on condition ratings. This rating is based on how close an
asset or component is to replacement or major overhaul. Scores will not have a greater
granularity than a half point.
An asset is in a State of Good Repair if the score is greater than (2.5). Refer to individual
asset group Inspection Standards Documents for confidence in reliability and specific
examples.
Confidence in Reliability = Remaining Useful Life
5.0) New or like new, 95% to 100% confidence in reliability; no visible defects, no damage, cosmetically
looks new. An asset is only new once, after rebuild some old parts are not new and therefore the highest
score after rebuild is (4.5).
4.5) The inspector is 90% to <95% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
4.0) The inspector is 80% to <90% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Shows minimal
signs of wear, no major defects, and some minor defects with only minimal signs of deterioration.
Cosmetic defects/minor wear.
3.5) The inspector is 70% to <80% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
3.0) The inspector is 60% to <70% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Some
moderately defective or deteriorated components; expected maintenance needs. Cosmetically ‘fair’ but
all devices are functioning as designed.
Small repairs or minor refurbishment.
2.5) The inspector is 50% to <60% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
2.0) The inspector is 40% to <50% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Asset near
overhaul or retirement, but in serviceable condition. Asset has increasing number of defects or
deteriorated component(s).
Significant or multiple repairs needed.
1.5) The inspector is 30% to <40% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
1.0) The inspector is less than 30% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Asset is in need
of major repair or refurbishment, multiple minor defects or major defects. Evidence of corrosion may be
apparent; major or numerous minor areas of damage or structural issues.
Safety concern, critical damage, close to or time for overhaul or replacement.

Technology resources: the technologies are used to support asset management
across the agency. RTD’s aim is to use the tools it already owns, rather than invest in
new ones at this time.
o Hardware and software necessary to support:
 Multiple source software systems – e.g. Trapeze EAM, Oracle EBS
 Data warehouse – provides aggregation and integration of data
 Analysis and reporting tools – Power BI, Access, Excel, SPSS and
others
Financial resources
o Financial resources necessary to support asset management ‘business as

Appendix E: Asset Management Roles and
Responsibilities
1. Accountable Executive – a single position with ultimate accountability for Asset
Management and the Asset Management System within RTD. This is the General
Manager and Chief Executive Officer.
2. Asset Management Accountability Team (AMAT) – this group has formal
accountability delegated from the Accountable Executive for the delivery, embedding,
review and continual improvement of the Asset Management System. The group is
comprised of the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operations Officer, Chief Administration
Officer, and Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs.
3. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) – reporting directly the Accountable Executive, the
CFO chairs AMAT. This position is critical to developing an asset management culture.
In this role the CFO ensures the alignment of asset management initiatives to
strategic objectives. By having a robust understanding of agency needs, this
individual can guide the agency in the development, implementation and maintenance
of an AMS that enhances agency capabilities. This individual also ensures adequate
resourcing for the AMS overall, and the AMD.
4. Asset Management Division – the AMD is responsible for the design, delivery,
embedding, review and continual improvement of the Asset Management System’s
(AMS) products, processes and information. The AMD manages the AMP and AIM
initiatives. The Asset Management Senior Manager reports to the Chief Financial
Officer.
5. Other RTD resources – as needed, other RTD resources will be utilized, consulted
or informed regarding the AMS. This could include operations, maintenance, finance,
safety, human resources, communications, IT, capital programs, legal, and
procurement staff. The AMAT will allocate these resources directly when within their
reporting line or via a request to other members of the Leadership Team when they
are not.
6. External resources – RTD will also utilize external expertise to develop the internal
asset management competencies of both the AMD and other RTD resources involved
with the AMS. The alternative to this is to be continually reliant on an external entity
to supply expertise indefinitely. By having actions guided by both an established asset
management framework and interactions with consultants, RTD intends to cultivate
an AMD capable of acting as an internal consulting service to the agency. The
intention is to ‘own the process, not the product’ as it relates to functions and
competencies that will become annual activities for the AMD. Additional external
resources will also be utilized to deliver aspects of the AMS, specifically the operations
and maintenance of approximately half of the bus fleet and a large portion of the
commuter rail system.

I 5.1

Light Rail System Description

The RTD light rail system was designed as the ﬁrst piece of a planned regional rapid transit system. In 1989, the Colorado
Supreme Court declared that the Denver metro area Regional Transportation District was eligible to collect a use tax that
enabled the District to accumulate funding of $67 million for construction of a rail system.
The project was approved by DRCOG (Denver Regional Council of Governments) in 1991. Construction on the initial 5.3-mile
rail system and a functional operations facility began without federal funding or an increase in local taxes in October 1992.
Safety Certiﬁcation and Construction of the light rail system was completed by the end of September 1994, and the system
opened for revenue service with 11 light rail vehicles on October 7, 1994. Additional lines, facilities, and vehicles were added
in subsequent years with voter support, as detailed below.

I 5.1.1

Scope and Service

Regular service of the light rail system is regulated by timetables. Light rail transit currently carries roughly 40,000
customers daily. Trains operate as one-, two-, three-, or four-car consists. Revenue service is generally available 21 hours
per day.
The Regional Transportation District’s objective is to operate the light rail transit system safely, reliably, and efficiently and
to integrate light rail operation with bus service for the greatest convenience to the public. This is the means by which the
integration of transportation services could assist the region in meeting clean air standards, alleviating traffic congestion,
and improving the overall quality of life of the area.
Light rail service operates on the existing 5.3-mile Central Corridor, the 8.7-mile Southwest Corridor, the 1.8-mile Central
Platte Valley Spur, the 19-mile Southeast Corridor, the 12.1-mile West Rail Corridor, the 10.5-mile I-225 Corridor, and the 1.6mile Southeast Rail Extension (SERE). The system has six operating lines: D, E, H, L, W, and R.

I 5.1.2

Organizational Structure

The light rail transit safety specialist’s office is located at the Elati Light Rail Operations and Maintenance center. Thus, the
lines of communication between safety and light rail operations are effective. Key positions with light rail operations are:
•

Assistant General Manager, Rail

•

Deputy Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations

•

Senior Manager, Rail Operations, Planning & Systems

•

Business Program Manager

•

General Superintendent of Light Rail Transportation

•

Manager of Rail Service Delivery

•

Manager of LRV Operator Training

•

Manager of LRT Operations

•

General Superintendent of Infrastructure

•

Manager of Light Rail Maintenance of Way

•

General Superintendent of Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance

•

Manager of Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

Light Rail Corridors

Central Corridor
Passenger service on the Central Corridor Light Rail system began October 7, 1994. The system is operated by Denver’s
Regional Transportation District as part of a fully integrated mass transit system, which includes local bus routes, express
bus routes, regional bus routes, shuttle bus routes, and demand-response service for disabled customers.
The Central Corridor comprises 5.3 miles of trackway with 13 stations, including three ark-n-rRde locations. The Central
Corridor operates at grade level except for one ﬂy-over structure for grade separation at Kalamath and Santa Fe. An initial
ﬂeet of 11 light rail vehicles (LRVs) were procured for the operation of the Central Corridor. Shortly after opening for service,
six additional LRVs were ordered.
The Central Corridor begins at I-25 and Broadway on the southwest end and terminates at 30th Avenue and Downing
Street. The corridor provides direct connections between the I-25 and Broadway Station transfer facility, Broadway
Marketplace, Auraria Campus, Colorado Convention Center, and the 16th Street Mall (Market Street, Civic Center, and Union
Station transit stations), Five Points, and many major hotels and businesses in between.
Major attractions within a short walking distance of the Central Corridor stations or the 16th Street Mall shuttles include the
Denver Center for the Performing Arts complex, federal courthouse, 17th Street Financial District, U.S. Mint, Tabor Center,
State Capitol, Denver Art Museum, Denver Public Library, History Colorado Center, Larimer Square, and Coors Field.
Light rail vehicles are operated manually. Automatic block wayside signals, traffic signals, radio communication, operational
procedures, and train orders govern operators regarding all vehicle movement. Appropriate street traffic signals, speed limit
signage, and wayside signals assist the operator in selecting proper movement sequence and speeds. City operations are
by line of sight. All city street crossings are governed by coordinating adjacent street intersection traffic signals, while the
at-grade crossings at 13th Avenue and at Bayaud are governed by gates with ﬂashers and warning bells. The crossings at
13th Avenue and at Bayaud are jointly used and maintained by Union Paciﬁc Railroad and RTD.
Station platforms are unattended and utilize automated fare equipment for ticket sales and ticket validation. Transit Security
Officers (TSO) monitor the proof of payment honor system. Roving rail supervisors, contracted security officers, and local
police departments provide platform security.
A 2.5-acre yard and the Light Rail Mariposa Facility is located adjacent to the Southern Paciﬁc Railroad switching yard near
6th Avenue at 655 Mariposa Street. Powered switches on the double track mainline provide access to and from yard leads
at either end of the storage yard, allowing access from ladder tracks into the shop. The Light Rail Mariposa Facility includes
a yard for vehicle storage and a maintenance facility for vehicle maintenance and system support maintenance. Central
Control is located on the second ﬂoor of the facility and is the operational governing authority for all mainline vehicle
movement. Central Control personnel (controller/supervisors) direct, control, and monitor revenue-service operations
using radio, telephone, and public address communications. Mainline operations are controlled by a schedule timetable
and directed by Central Control in accordance with established operating schedules, rules, and procedures. Controllers
implement all corrective actions necessary to maintain service schedules and to minimize adverse impacts of equipment
failures, emergency situations, or weather-related problems. In addition, some unit repair, facility maintenance, and nonrevenue maintenance occurs at RTD’s District Shops location.
The corridor begins on the south end with I-25 and Broadway Station. I-25 and Broadway station provides a major bus and
light rail transfer point and is a junction for the Southwest, Southeast and Central corridors. From Broadway proceeding
north a short distance is Alameda Station. After leaving Alameda Station, trains pass through Bayaud crossing and then
ascend the Santa Fe/Kalamath ﬂyover structure, returning to grade as the alignment passes the Mariposa facility before
entering 10th and Osage Station. From 10th and Osage, trains pass through the 13th Avenue crossing and then either travel
downtown (Central Corridor) or to the Central Platte Valley (CPV) Corridor. Continuing northeast on the Central Corridor
is Colfax at Auraria Station, which allows direct access to the Auraria Campus via a plaza and a bus transfer point. After
leaving Colfax at Auraria Station, the double track alignment proceeds across Kalamath Street and Speer Boulevard,
crossing a bridge structure over Cherry Creek along Stout Street to Convention Center Station near 14th and Stout streets.

At 14th Street, the inbound track turns east and then north to travel along California Street. The outbound track runs along
Stout Street between 14th and 19th streets. Two passenger stations are located on Stout, one at 16th Street and one at
18th Street. The inbound track along California Street travels in an automobile traffic contra-ﬂow direction from 14th to 19th
streets, servicing the 16th Street and California passenger station located on the 16th Street Mall, then continuing on the
single track northeast bound to the next passenger station, at 18th Street on California.
The alignment turns southeast on 19th Street, where it joins the track to Welton Street and where the double track travels
east on Welton Street to the 20th Street and Welton Station, located between 19th and 20th streets on Welton. The double
track alignment continues as it crosses over to the south side of Welton near 20th Street to 24th Street. Between 24th
and 25th streets, the double track conﬁguration transitions into single track. The single-track alignment is retained as it
continues northeast on Welton and proceeds to the 25th Street and Welton Station, located near 26th Street. Traveling
northeast along the alignment, the trackway approaches the 27th Street mini station located between 27th and 28th
streets, then transitions back into a double track conﬁguration as it enters the 30th Aand Downing northern terminus station.

Southwest Corridor
The Southwest Corridor opened for revenue service in July 2000. It is an 8.7-mile extension of the Central Corridor light
rail system from I-25 and Broadway in Denver to the end-of-line station at Mineral Avenue and Santa Fe Drive in Littleton. It
includes ﬁve light rail stations: Evans, Englewood, Oxford•City of Sheridan, Littleton•Downtown, and Littleton•Mineral. Each
station location has an associated Park-n-Ride, with the exception of Oxford.
The Southwest Corridor is a double track alignment operating in high-speed territory at a maximum speed of 55 mph. The
corridor consists of mixed-use operations including three freight railroad mainline tracks, two light rail tracks, and Santa
Fe Drive on the west side of the corridor. The entire corridor is grade-separated with the exception of a pedestrian-freight
spur crossing at the Evans station. Traditional active grade crossing equipment and signals including warning bells, lights,
and gates control this crossing. The light rail tracks parallel the freight mainline tracks throughout the corridor. To enhance
patron use, the light rail corridor resides on the east side of the freight rail corridor from I-25 and Broadway to Tufts Avenue,
and on the west side of the freight corridor from Tufts Avenue to Mineral Avenue. Two ﬂyover structures accommodate
grade separation between freight railroad and light rail tracks: one near Tufts Avenue, where the east/west transition
occurs; and one near Iowa, where the light rail tracks cross the Iowa freight spur track.
Leaving the I-25 and Broadway station southbound, the tracks cross over Mississippi Avenue on a bridge and continue
south to cross over Iowa Ave on another bridge. Shortly after crossing Iowa Avenue, the alignment rises on the Iowa ﬂyover
structure to pass over a freight rail spur track coming from the mainline on the west side of the light rail tracks. Once the
trackway returns to grade, the tracks pass under Evans Avenue and enter the Evans station. Continuing south from Evans
station, the mainline right of way passes the Elati Operations Facility and yard before crossing a bridge over Dartmouth
Avenue and into Englewood Station. Trains leave Englewood Station southbound and cross the bridge over Hampden
Avenue and continue to Oxford Station. From Oxford Station south, the alignment passes over Oxford Avenue and then
climbs the Tufts ﬂyover structure that transitions light rail from the east side of the freight track mainline to the west side.
Descending off the ﬂyover, the alignment passes over Belleview Avenue on a bridge before entering a below grade cut and
Littleton•Downtown Station. Continuing south from the station, the track climbs from the cut to grade and continues to the
end-of-line Littleton•Mineral Station.
An additional 14 light rail vehicles were added to the existing ﬂeet to accommodate the extension. The light rail vehicles
are Siemens Duewag SD100 and SD160 models, the same used for the Central Corridor. The Mariposa maintenance facility
was expanded to accommodate the ﬂeet size increase. All operational characteristics for the Southwest Corridor are similar
to the existing operational characteristics of the Central Corridor. Since service origination of the Southwest Corridor, 18
additional SD 100s have been placed into revenue service.

Central Platte Valley
The Central Platte Valley (CPV) corridor is approximately 1.8 miles in length, linking the existing Central Corridor light rail
line at Colfax Avenue to Denver Union Station. This is a double track alignment along the entire corridor, including the CPV
junction.
Packet Pg. 421

The CPV corridor begins at approximately Colfax Avenue and Rio Court (the location where the existing Central Corridor
light rail lines curves to the east under the Colfax Avenue viaduct). The alignment generally follows Curtis Street from Colfax
Avenue to west of 5th Street, on the western edge of the Auraria Campus. At this point, the alignment turns north and
parallels 5th Street and enters Auraria West Station. From there, the alignment crosses Walnut Street and enters Empower
Field at Mile High Station. From there the alignment parallels the Consolidated Mainline (freight), to the Ball Arena•Elitch
Gardens Station, then continues north and ends at Denver Union Station. Stations are located at the new administration
building of the Auraria Campus (Auraria West); near the existing “Sports Walk” that serves Empower Field at Mile High
Station near the stadium; at the pedestrian bridge serving Ball Arena and Elitch Gardens; and Denver Union Station.
The alignment has two at-grade crossings: 5th Street and Walnut Street, which include active warning devices for control
and safety considerations to mitigate impacts to traffic and pedestrians in these areas.
During major events, such as professional sports games and concerts at Ball Arena, Coors Field and Empower Field at Mile
High, special service will be provided with trains running as frequently as every four to ﬁve minutes between the event
venue and the Southwest and Southeast Corridors. Some of these special event trains may terminate at the I- 25/Broadway
station while other will continue to the Littleton•Mineral and RidgeGate Parkway end-of-line stations.

Southeast Corridor
The Southeast Corridor began revenue service in November 2006. It consists of 21 miles of double-tracked light rail
transit, beginning at the existing Broadway station and ending at RidgeGate Parkway Station. This includes an alignment
along I-225 in the median, from I-25 to Nine Mile Station at Parker Road. There are 16 stations: Louisiana•Pearl; University;
Colorado; Yale; Southmoor; Belleview; Orchard; Arapahoe at Village Center; Dry Creek; County Line; Lincoln; Sky Ridge;
Lone Tree City Center; RidgeGate Parkway; Dayton; and Nine Mile. All facilities, including RTD trains, stations, pedestrian
and bicycle facilities, and other design elements, are in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
With the Southeast Corridor expansion, the Elati Light Rail Operations facility and yard were constructed at 2701 S. Elati
St. This was a necessity to accommodate the more than doubling of light rail vehicles and associated support needs that
accompanied the system expansion. North and south yard leads were cut into the existing Southwest corridor mainline
track just north of Dartmouth on the south and a short distance south of Evans station on the north. In January of 2006, the
Elati facility became the new operations center and the Mariposa facility became a heavy maintenance and repair shop,
while still maintaining the Control Center on the second ﬂoor.
The Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) opened for revenue service in May 2019. This extended double track rail service 1.6
miles from the former end-of-line station at Lincoln to the new end-of-line station at RidgeGate Parkway. Two additional
stations, Sky Ridge and Lone Tree City Center, are located on the extension.

Broadway to Colorado
The Southeast Corridor alignment begins with a wye connection south of the existing Broadway station, allowing vehicles
from the Southeast Corridor to access both the Southwest Corridor and existing light rail line to central downtown.
Following the wye tracks, the alignment rises above grade to pass over Broadway on an aerial structure. After crossing
Broadway, the alignment turns to the south along the southbound I-25 on-ramp and drops down to match the grade of I-25
and into Louisiana•Pearl station. This allows the LRT alignment to pass under the cross streets, maintaining a 17-foot vertical
clearance above the top of rail. Through the Narrows (Broadway to University), the alignment parallels I-25 between I-25’s
collector distributor road and Buchtel Boulevard. The tracks generally pass behind the abutment of the highway bridges
through a separate light rail bridge structure and enter University Station.

Colorado to Evans
At Colorado, the alignment follows the Colorado Boulevard off-ramp and travels under Colorado Boulevard in a short tunnel
section. After passing under Colorado, the alignment remains below grade in an open trench section, enters Colorado
Station and again parallels I-25. After leaving the station, it passes under Evans in a tunnel section.

Evans to Union
After passing under Evans, the alignment rises to return to the highway grade, running adjacent to the highway into Yale
Station. At Yale Avenue, the alignment runs along the edge of the Yale ramps and passes over Yale on an aerial structure.
South of Yale, the alignment follows along the west side of I-25 to Hampden Avenue. At Hampden, the alignment enters a
very short tunnel section under Hampden, returns to the I-25 grade on the south side of Hampden, and enters Southmoor
Station.
Continuing south, the alignment passes under Quincy and then travels along the western edge of the I-25/I-225 freeway
interchange. Special track work at this location allows for a wye connection to the light rail alignment located along I-225.
These connecting tracks are primarily at-grade and pass below the I-25/I-225 interchange.

Union to Arapahoe Road
Proceeding south from the I-225 wye connection, the alignment passes under Union Avenue along the west edge of I-25.
After passing under Union Avenue, the alignment continues south into Belleview Station. After leaving the station, it travels
along the ramps and over Belleview on an aerial structure. Continuing south from Belleview, the alignment runs adjacent to
I-25 to Orchard Station, where it again shifts out along the ramps and then over Orchard Road on an aerial structure. South
of Orchard, the alignment returns to the west edge of the highway into Arapahoe at Village Center Station. From the station
continuing south, the alignment rises to pass over the three west side ramps and Arapahoe Road on a long aerial structure.

Arapahoe Road to RidgeGate Parkway
South of Arapahoe Road, the alignment continues adjacent to the I-25 shoulder to Dry Creek Station. From Dry Creek
Station, the alignment travels adjacent to the ramps and over Dry Creek on an aerial structure. After passing Dry Creek,
the alignment returns to the I-25 shoulder to County Line Road, where it rises up to pass over two ramps and County Line
Road on an aerial structure. After passing County Line Road and the ramp in the southwest quadrant of the interchange, the
alignment runs along the west edge of I-25 into County Line Station. South of the station, the alignment enters the C-470/
E470 interchange.
Through the C-470/E470 interchange, the alignment travels under the ramps in short tunnels and over C-470, around the
western side of the interchange ramps and then adjacent to I-25, where it continues south into Lincoln Station. After leaving
Lincoln Station, the alignment continues south and passes over Lincoln Avenue on an aerial structure and then turns east
into Sky Ridge Station. The lone at grade crossing on the Southeast Corridor, Trainstation Circle crossing, is at the south
end of Sky Ridge Station. The alignment then crosses over I-25 on an aerial structure and turns south into Lone Tree City
Center Station. From the station, it continues over RidgeGate Parkway on an aerial structure and into the end-of line-station.

I-225 from I-25 to Parker Road
The alignment along I-225 begins at the I-25/I-225 interchange, where it connects to the I-25 alignment through a wye
connection, allowing light rail vehicles to connect to both the northbound and southbound lines on the I-25 alignment. After
the wye connection, the alignment travels in the I-225 median at the highway grade. The alignment continues in the I-225
median into Dayton Station. From Dayton Station, the alignment continues east into Nine Mile Station at Parker Road.

The corridor operates with similar characteristics as existing corridors, including traction power substations and signal
systems. A SCADA system is included in the Southeast Corridor project and is retroﬁtted into the existing system.
Additionally, an automatic trip stop system was added to stop trains if they bypass a red signal.
Packet Pg. 423

West Corridor
The West Rail Line is a 12.1-mile light rail transit corridor that began revenue service in April 2013, extending from Denver
Union Station to the Jefferson County Government Center. The alignment runs through Denver, Lakewood, and Golden.
The West Rail Line has 12 stations: Auraria West, Decatur•Federal, Knox, Perry, Sheridan, Lamar, Lakewood•Wadsworth,
Garrison, Oak, Federal Center, Red Rocks College, and Jefferson County Government Center•Golden.
The alignment is double track from Denver Union Station to Federal Center Station and is single track from Federal Center
Station to the Jefferson County Government Center•Golden Station. Total travel time from Denver Union Stationto Jefferson
County Government Center•Golden is 35 minutes. The corridor operates similarly to existing RTD light rail corridors.
Starting from Denver Union Station, the alignment travels to the Ball Arena•Elitch Gardens Station, Empower Field at Mile
High Station, and Auraria West Station.
Departing from the Auraria West Station, the alignment passes through the Central Corridor and CPV junction and curves
south under Colfax Avenue, where it crosses over the Consolidated Main Line (CML) on an aerial structure. The alignment
turns to the west on this structure before returning to grade and passing under I-25. From the I-25 viaduct, it continues west
through the Zuni Street at grade crossing and over the South Platte River on a bridge structure. After it crosses the river, it
passes through the Decatur Street at grade crossing and into Decatur•Federal Station.
From Decatur•Federal Station, the train continues west on the alignment under the Federal Bridge, following Lakewood
Gulch through the Knox Court crossing into Knox Station. Leaving Knox Station, the alignment curves south towards 10th
Avenue, following Dry Gulch and continuing west to the Perry Street crossing and Perry Station. The alignment continues
west through a gated crossing for the bike path at Wolff Street and into Sheridan Station under Sheridan Boulevard.
Departing Sheridan Station, the alignment curves north to run alongside 13th Avenue and west through Harlan crossing into
Lamar Station. Traveling west through the Lamar, Pierce, and Teller crossings, the track then ascends an aerial structure into
the next station, Lakewood•Wadsworth. Leaving Wadsworth station and descending the bridge, the alignment continues
west through Carr Street and Estes Street crossings and into Garrison Station.
Continuing west, the alignment passes through Garrison Street and Independence Street crossings, passes over the Kipling
Street Bridge, then proceeds through the Oak Street crossing into Oak Station.
From Oak Station, the alignment curves south at Quail Street and Collins Avenue crossings and follows Simms Street to the
8th Avenue crossing before passing over 6th Avenue on the 6th Avenue Bridge. It then continues south through the North
Avenue crossing and turns west into Federal Center Station. Some trains turn back here to return to Denver Union Station,
utilizing the pocket track, while others continue to the Jefferson County Government Center•Golden Station.
Departing Federal Center Station and continuing to Jefferson County Government Center•Golden Station, the alignment
curves north and becomes single track prior to passing through the 4th Avenue crossing. The alignment continues to 6th
Avenue, turns west and proceeds through the Union Boulevard tunnel, and continues west along the south side of 6th
Avenue into the Red Rocks College Station, where it splits into double track.
Departing Red Rocks College Station, the alignment becomes single track again and continues west along 6th Avenue. The
alignment curves north and then back west as it crosses the Indiana Street Bridge ﬂyover to the north side of 6th Avenue,
where the alignment continues. It goes through the tunnel under I-70, passes over Colfax on an aerial structure, then
proceeds through the Ulysses Street and Earl Johnson Road crossings before entering one of three tracks at the end-of-line

I-225 Rail Corridor
The I-225 project added 10.5 miles to the light rail system within the city of Aurora, providing key regional connections to
the East and Southeast rail lines. Construction on the full line began in 2013. This light rail line opened for service to the
public in February 2017 as the R Line, and it features eight stations: , Florida, Iliff, Aurora Metro Center, 2nd Ave•Abilene,
13th Ave, Colfax, Fitzsimons, and Peoria. This corridor extends light rail service north from Nine Mile Station to Peoria
Station, where customers can connect to commuter rail to access Denver International Airport.
Packet Pg. 424

I 5.1.4

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)

The RTD Light Rail System includes a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The SCADA system
provides two types of general functions: control over certain system elements from the Central Control Center, and system
monitoring and status information to the Central Control Center. The SCADA system allows light rail controllers certain
capabilities such as remote control to power down sections of the alignment and control over power track switches. It also
provides information to light rail controllers on the status of certain elements of the light rail system and train information.
SCADA information includes train locations, switch alignments, power status, signal status, and a variety of additional
system information.

I 5.1.5

Light Rail Vehicles

The RTD light rail vehicle ﬂeet consists of two models from Siemens: the SD 100 and the SD 160. The vehicles are very
similar and have two main differences. The SD 160 has an AC propulsion system and sliding plug doors, whereas the
SD 100 has a DC propulsion system and bifold doors. An initial ﬂeet of 11 light rail vehicles (LRVs) was procured for the
operation of the Central Corridor. Shortly after opening for service, six additional LRVs were ordered. As ridership grew, so
did the system beyond the Central Corridor, triggering orders of new LRVs. The SD 100 model is the original RTD vehicle,
and there are 49 of these vehicles in the ﬂeet. The SD 160 was originally ordered for the Southeast Corridor extension: 68
were delivered, with an additional 55 vehicles ordered for FasTracks, the ﬁrst of which arrived in August 2009. An additional
29 SD 160 vehicles were ordered in July 2018. RTD now has a total ﬂeet of 201 vehicles. The LRVs are 6-axle, singlearticulated, double-ended, bidirectional, high-ﬂoor vehicles. They are approximately 80 feet in length, 8 feet and 9 inches
in width, and 13 feet high, and they operate on a standard railroad track gauge of 4 feet and 8 ½ inches. They are powered
by 750 volts of direct current from an overhead wire and capable of speeds up to 55 mph. Each vehicle can seat 48 to
56 passengers and accommodate up to 61 additional standing passengers at normal loads. Additional standees may be
accommodated at a crush load capacity. Exhibits shows the vehicle layout and critical exterior measurements to maximize
the level of comfort with which customers are afforded for their trip. In addition, light rail vehicles are equipped with HVAC
and good lighting conﬁguration.

I 5.1.6

Operations

The Operations Control Center, which underwent a major remodel to accommodate the system expansion and SCADA,
governs the operation, control, and dispatch of light rail vehicles. Control maintains contact with the train operators by
means of a radio located in each light rail vehicle cab. Light rail operators also carry a portable radio to be used in case they
have to leave the cab or there is a radio failure. Controllers/supervisors rove throughout the system during operations. Their
role is to provide support and coordination between Central Control and light rail vehicle operators during an emergency
or upset in the system that may require a manual block operation, bus bridge, evacuation, or accident response and
investigation.
Current operations consist of six lines: D, E, H, L, W, and R.. The D Line extends from Littleton•Mineral Station to 18th and
California Station. The E Line extends from RidgeGate Parkway Station to Denver Union Station.. The H Line extends
from Florida Station to 18th and California Station. The L Line is a downtown loop between 14th and Stout streets and
30th•Downing Station. The W Line extends from Jefferson County Government Center•Golden to Denver Union Station.
The R Line extends from RidgeGate Parkway Station to Peoria Station. Typical headways vary from 5 to 15 minutes during
peak operations with increased service operated for special events. Early morning or late night headways on weekends
and holidays are typically 30 minutes.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

2.17.C.b

In the case of an accident or a breakdown of the system, the Control Center controls train movement using a manual block
system. When necessary, bus shuttles are used to move passengers around a trouble area.

I 5.2

Commuter Rail Service

The owner of RTDC, which is the Regional Transportation District (RTD), has a concession agreement with Denver Transit
Partners (DTP) LLC for the operation and maintenance of the current RTDC commuter rail lines and vehicles. Denver
Packet Pg. 425

Transit Operators (DTO), under this agreement, is responsible for performing all services connected with the operation and
maintenance of the concession agreement. The lines operated by DTP comprise the East Corridor (University of Colorado A
Line), Northwest Electriﬁed Segment (B Line), and Gold Line (G Line).
Revenue service began in September 2020 for an additional commuter rail line, North Metro (N Line). RTD employees
perform all operations and maintenance on the N Line.
Denver Union Station is the hub for multiple transportation modes in the Denver metro area. Services operating on the
East Corridor, Northwest Electriﬁed Segment (NWES), Gold Line, and N Line terminate at Denver Union Station, which
also accommodates Amtrak and other heavy rail. The N Line operates out of Denver Union Station. DTO is responsible
for dispatching all commuter rail trains in and out of Denver Union Station and for maintaining the infrastructure within the
station.
The East Corridor (A Line) is a 22.8-mile segment running from Denver Union Station to Denver International Airport with
six intermediate stations. The Northwest Electriﬁed Segment (B Line) extends 5.5 miles north from Denver Union Station
to Westminster. Two B and G Line stations share a portion of the track. The Gold Line (G Line) is an 11.2-mile line that runs
west from Denver Union Station to Ward Road in Wheat Ridge with six intermediate stations.
The Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF), located at 5151 Fox St. in Denver, is the central control center for Denver
Transit Operators (DTO). This facility has a rolling stock maintenance shop, warehouse, administrative offices, and storage
yard, including a car wash.
The North Metro (N Line) has six stations, four of which have pedestrian crossings. This 13.8-mile corridor includes six
highway grade crossings and 11 bridges.
Commuter rail is regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and is subject to FRA rules, regulations, and
inspections. Hours of operation are generally 3 a.m.–1:30 a.m.

I 5.3

Bus Operations System Description

The Regional Transportation District was created by an act of the Colorado General Assembly in 1969 and became an
operating unit on July 1 of that year. The purpose of creating this agency was to provide a regional approach to public
transportation.
On January 1, 1974, RTD began collecting a half percent sales tax and became fully operational. RTD initially inherited 321
buses from Denver Metro Transit.
Many of these vehicles were over 20 years old. Total bus mileage was 9 million miles per year, with fewer than 20 million
customers annually.
Only one maintenance and storage facility existed for buses. There was little or no maintenance capacity for buses in the
small system operating in the District. These systems served several local areas and there was a private Denver-Boulder
bus line.
RTD began building a modern bus ﬂeet and its needed support facilities. In 1975, the six fragmented bus systems that had
provided service to different areas of the District were integrated into a single, uniﬁed system. New and improved service
became the focal points for future growth.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

2.17.C.b

The improved service included the extension of routes; new local and express routes; more frequent service; new nighttime
service on many routes; increased service to the mountain areas of the District; exclusive bus lanes; and the inauguration
of special service for the elderly and disabled. Meeting special needs made RTD the ﬁrst transit system in the nation with a
comprehensive bus program to serve the needs of the elderly and disabled. All of these factors led to a signiﬁcant increase
in ridership.
To support and encourage new customers, RTD also launched a program to establish Park-n-Ride facilities. Additional bus
maintenance and storage facilities were acquired to accommodate the growing bus ﬂeet.
Packet Pg. 426

The 16th Street Mall bus service became operational in 1982. This was the ﬁrst step in a unique transit concept, which would
pull 50 percent of the buses off downtown streets during peak hours and provide opportunities for additional suburban
service.
In 1994, RTD partnered with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) to add High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV)
lanes from I-25 to US 36, allowing regional and express routes running along US 36 and I-25 to downtown Denver to
bypass congestion around the Turnpike Tangle.
In 2016, RTD began operating the Flatiron Flyer Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service along US 36 and the I-25 HOV lanes,
seamlessly connecting Boulder and Denver. Later that year, RTD began operation of 36 BYD K10MR all-electric buses on
the 16th Street Mall, making it one of the largest electric bus ﬂeets in the nation. The District has evolved into a transit
system that has a service area of 2,342 square miles. It serves 40 municipalities in all or part of eight counties. The system
comprises 148 routes. The ﬂeet currently has 1,011 buses, of which 434 are leased to private carriers. There are currently
four maintenance and storage facilities Districtwide, 77 Park-n-Rides, and six transfer stations.

I 5.3.1

Scope and Service

Regular service of the ﬁxed route bus transit system is regulated by timetables and varies between peak and off-peak
hours, weekends, weekdays, and special events. The bus system transports an average of 200,827 weekday boardings.
Denver Union Station and Civic Center Station are the main transfer stations in the downtown Denver area.

I 5.3.2 Organizational Structure
The bus transit safety specialist’s office is located at RTD headquarters, at 1660 Blake St. in Denver. Key positions within
bus operations are the assistant general manager of bus operations, deputy assistant general manager of bus operations,
general superintendent of bus transportation, , general superintendent of bus maintenance, and general superintendent of
street supervision, Manager of contracted service, and business program manager. All of these key positions have regular
contact with the bus transit safety specialist.

I 5.3.3 Bus Transportation Operations
Dispatch governs the operation, control, and dispatch of buses and other RTD vehicles. Dispatch maintains control with
bus operators by means of two-way radios, standard telephones, and Global Positioning System (GPS). Street Supervisors
also carry portable radios in the event of a system failure. Street Supervisors rove throughout the system during operations.
Their role is to provide support and coordination between dispatch and bus operators during an emergency, accident
response and investigation, rerouting, or other bus-related issues.
Bus transportation Operations is responsible for providing safe, reliable, and efficient service to all areas served by our
mass transit system. This is accomplished by scheduling bus service from three operating divisions with732 full-time and 93
part time bus operators. Service is provided seven days a week over approximately 21 hours of each day.
Street supervisors monitor service and performance of bus operators to ensure the safe, efficient, on-time delivery of
scheduled bus service. The district also provides continuous evaluation of routes, schedules, bus stops, shelters, and
facilities to determine the effectiveness and condition of service and amenities.
Effective, two-way radio communication is provided to all revenue and non-revenue vehicles. Information is received and
relayed to the proper sources to provide assistance and coordination for bus operations. Communication is provided
through the radio system, telephones, and a state-of-the-art tracking system.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

2.17.C.b

The District also monitors bus service provided by private contractors, which operate approximately 58% of RTD’s ﬁxed
route service. Assistance is provided to customers at transit centers, transfer stations, and customer care. The District also
coordinates special community events planning. In the event of a transit emergency, Dispatchers and street supervisors will
coordinate bus activities.

I 5.3.4 Standard Operating Procedures and Employee Rule Book
Bus operations are strictly governed by policies and procedures outlined in the Trailblazer. Standard rules of conduct and
procedure are necessary. The rules outlined in this document have been adopted for the requirements of RTD’s operations
and are considered necessary for rendering a quality level of service to customers. The Trailblazer is a comprehensive
manual with procedures and guidelines for every aspect of bus operations, including the performance code; passenger
relations and interaction; ADA requirements; personnel practices; operating procedures; emergency and legal procedures;

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
The Regional Transportation District's (RTD) Emergency Operations Plan (EOP), including all
annexes and appendices, provides a comprehensive, flexible framework for system-wide
emergency management affecting the agency and is effective as of the date signed by the
General Manager and CEO.
The EOP addresses the roles and responsibilities of emergency management of RTD
departments, as well as partner agencies, and provides a link to federal, state, local, territorial,
tribal, and private organizations and resources that may be called upon to assist and participate
in response to incidents that occur throughout RTD’s service area.
The EOP was developed using recognized state and federal guidance that includes: Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Target Capabilities List; FEMA Core Capabilities;
FEMA’s National Preparedness Frameworks; the National Incident Management System (NIMS);
FEMA’s Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101; FEMA CPG 201; the Colorado
Emergency Management Program Guide; and relevant laws and authorities pertinent to
emergency management in Public Transportation.
The EOP is designed to minimize the disruption of the agency’s core function by establishing a
system of collaboration during times of significant disruption. To meet this goal, it is imperative
that RTD, partner, and stakeholder agencies, and their personnel prepare, train, exercise,

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Recognizing that significantly disruptive events can occur anytime and have far-reaching
impacts, RTD has developed the following Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) to guide response
activities and ensure effective and efficient coordination. The EOP enhances the agency’s ability
to help prevent, prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate against all hazards that
threaten RTD and its customers, employees, resources, equipment, and surrounding
environment.
RTD’s service area is exposed to a number of hazards, discussed later in this document and
within the hazard-specific plans in Annexes G-N. The EOP includes information for the
preparation, response, recovery, and mitigation for an all-hazards approach to emergency
management. In addition, the Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP, 2023) identifies systems to
maintain the operations of RTD despite disruption and may be a useful reference during
emergencies. Further, the Cybersecurity Incident Response Procedure (CIMP, 2022) outlines
how RTD will respond to a malicious attack upon its information technology infrastructure and is
included in this document as Annex . This document also incorporates Functional Annexes
(Annex A-F) supplied by each group: Bus Operations, Commuter Rail Operations, Light Rail
Operations, Paratransit, Capital Programs, and Transit Police.
The EOP utilizes emergency management principles such as a whole community planning
process and will incorporate partnerships with governmental entities and the private sector.
Emergency management principles are designed to include individuals with access and
functional needs, such as mobility challenges, Limited English Proficiency as well as any agerelated need.
RTD will activate the EOP when the agency must respond to an emergency that requires
coordination across transit modes and agency functions and with local, state, federal, territorial,
and tribal governmental entities. In addition, RTD may activate the EOP to coordinate support
for a pre-planned event.
The EOP addresses the roles and responsibilities of departments within RTD, as well as partner
agencies, and provides a link to federal, state, local, territorial, tribal, and private organizations
and resources that may be called upon to assist and participate in response to incidents that
occur throughout the locations that may default to this EOP pursuant to Colorado Revised
Statute 24-33.5-707.

Introduction

Packet Pg. 466

2.17.C.b

RTD Emergency Operations Plan

The purpose of the EOP is to establish the necessary framework to support a coordinated
response to all incidents across the agency and RTD’s service area as it relates to RTD service
including federal, state, and local governmental entities as well as private sector organizations.
It assigns roles and responsibilities for all RTD departments and divisions for preparedness and
response activities before, during, and after an emergency. It also provides for the systematic
integration of additional emergency resources but does not replace other federal, state, or
national emergency operations plans or procedures. Further, it does not remove responsibility
for each functional group (bus operations, light rail, commuter rail, paratransit, transit police,
and capital programs) within RTD to develop their own procedures, policies, and standard
operating procedures for managing emergencies.
The EOP is comprised of a base plan and supporting annexes, appendices, policies, and
procedures. The base plan establishes the structure and provides guidance for a timely and
coordinated response, internal communications, information gathering, information sharing,
decision-making, and roles and responsibilities for coordinating incident operations. The
annexes, appendices, procedures, and policies provide the tools that support the
implementation of the base plan. The EOP is drafted to be adaptable to any situation in which
RTD responds to an emergency regardless of the level of severity and outlines how to prevent,
prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the potential hazards identified within RTD’s
service area.
Further, this plan prescribes the activities to be taken by RTD’s Leadership Team and public
safety leadership to protect the lives of customers, employees, property and environment in the
event of a natural, human-caused, or technological emergency, including acts of terrorism.

Scope
This plan applies to all agency operations within the service area and all staff and property
owned by the agency.
Each department and division listed in the EOP is responsible for understanding its own
emergency authority and procedures when implementing the provisions of the EOP.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
RTD was created in the General Assembly of the State of Colorado in 1 6 by Chapter 231
Laws of Colorado 1 6 , currently codified part 1 of article of title 32, Colorado Revised
Statutes to provide mass transportation to the inhabitants of the region. RTD is governed by a
15-member, publicly elected Board of Directors, with each Director representing approximately
200,000 constituents within their respective district.
RTD operates in eight counties with coverage of the entirety of Denver, Broomfield, and
Jefferson counties and partial coverage in Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Douglas, and Weld
counties. These counties contain 40 municipalities. RTD’s service area covers 2,342 square
miles populated by more than three million people.
RTD’s operates bus, light rail, commuter rail, and paratransit services. Rail operates on fixed
alignments with RTD owning or leasing rights of way. Three of the four commuter rail
alignments are operated by Denver Transit Operators/Partners. All light rail, and the N Line of
commuter rail are entirely operated by RTD. Bus service is provided through fixed route and ondemand service, accomplished with roughly 50 percent of buses operated by contractors. Fixed
routes are reviewed three times annually to make adjustments for changing landscape and
efficiency. Paratransit is entirely on-demand with all service delivery provided by contractors.
There are ,750 bus stops along 140 bus routes, 113 miles of rail service including 78 stations
along 10 rail lines, and 6 Park-n-Ride facilities. Denver Union Station (DUS) is the central hub
of the system, with A, B, G, and N commuter rail and E and W light rail lines terminating there.
Amtrak trains are also dispatched into DUS.
The agency includes the Transit Police and Emergency Management Department, which
enforces RTD policies and procedures and protects the safety and security of RTD customers
and employees. This is the only department within RTD with traditional first response
responsibilities.
RTD’s service area includes Denver International Airport, which is the third busiest passenger
airport in the world in 2022 and a critical resource for the provision of emergency supplies. The
airport is serviced by the A Line commuter rail service, which connects the airport to DUS, as
well as AB1, AT/ATA, 104L, 145 , and 16 L buses. In addition, the service area includes
portions of interstates 70, 76, 25, and 225. Major thoroughfares also include E-470, US 6, US
36, US 285, and US 287/I-70 Business Corridor.
Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railway and Union Pacific railroads are the main freight rail
operators in the service area, at times running parallel to RTD rail.
RTD also participates in the North Central Region/Urban Area Security Initiative (NCR/UASI) to
coordinate preparedness activities with the surrounding counties and municipalities.
The lands within RTD’s service area were historically inhabited by indigenous people of the
KLQRQR¶HLQR¶ELLWR¶RZX¶ Arapaho), 7VpVWKR¶H Cheyenne),2þKpWKLâDNyZLƾ (Sioux), and 1~X
DJKDW‫ݛ‬Y‫ݛ‬S‫( ࡮ݛ‬Ute) Tribes. These tribes are still thriving with active governing bodies and
cultural celebrations both within the service area and in the reservations they were forcibly
removed to in surrounding states.

2.17.C.b

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
RTD’s service area is vulnerable to a number of natural, technological, and human-caused
threats and hazards. A high-level threat and hazard identification and risk assessment was
conducted utilizing available information about past events, future trends due to changing
climate, and assessment about predicted impacts from various staff across the agency
representing all departments. The assessment was derived from a survey asking
representatives from across the agency as selected by the Leadership Team to rank hazards by
likelihood, impact, and resilience. Responses from all sources were aggregated and a matrix
created to rank hazards into high, moderate, and low significance to RTD. Those of interest are
presented below:

Critical Facilities and Infrastructure Summary
The sole energy provider for RTD’s service area is cel Energy. Power is provided for facilities
both public and private and for the provision of power for rail service and the agency’s subfleet
of battery electric buses.
Light rail alignments are served by 64 substations along the alignments that convert power
from 13,200 V AC to 850 V DC, which is provided through the Overhead Catenary System
(OCS). Where possible these substations are fed by diverse energy grids and there is resiliency
of the system in such that the loss of one to two substations would not adversely impact service
delivery.
Commuter rail alignments are served by two substations, Sundown and Argo. These substations
supply power at 25 kV AC through the OCS. The entire commuter rail system is able to function
drawing power from a single substation.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan

Planning Assumptions
x RTD is not the primary public safety agency with jurisdiction at its locations throughout
the service area and will collaborate with local police, fire, and emergency medical
personnel to conduct critical life-safety response operations to save lives, reduce or
treat injuries, and to protect property and the environment
x RTD, the communities within the service area, and state governmental agencies have
effective prediction and warning systems in place allowing RTD to anticipate certain
emergency situations that may impact the agency
x When anticipating or in response to an emergency situation, the General Manager and
CEO (GM/CEO) and Chief of Transit Police and Emergency Management are responsible
for taking action, including the activation of this plan, to mitigate impacts, save lives,
protect property and the environment, assist survivors, and restore services and
facilities
x RTD board members, GM/CEO, the Leadership Team, which consists of the agency’s
chiefs and assistant general managers, supervisors, represented and non-represented
employees, and partners are familiar with the EOP, understand their roles and
responsibilities under the EOP, maintain appropriate plans, policies, and procedures to
carry out those responsibilities; and maintain a state of readiness. Day-to-day functions
that do not contribute directly to emergency operations may be suspended for the
duration of an emergency/disaster. Resources that would normally be required for
those daily functions may be redirected to tasks in support of the emergency response
x RTD will use its own resources in response to an emergency or disaster. Once agency
resources are exhausted (or near exhausted), requests for assistance will be made
x A large-scale emergency or disaster may overwhelm available agency resources, leading
to the need for support from local/mutual aid jurisdictions, private sector partners, state
agencies, and the federal government
x When resources of RTD are fully committed and mutual aid from communities within
the service area is exhausted, the Colorado Department of Homeland Security and
Emergency Management (CDHSEM) may coordinate the provision of additional
assistance to address unmet needs
x Disaster support from federal agencies may take at least 72 hours to arrive
x Facilities required to file Tier II hazardous materials reports develop, coordinate, and
provide copies of emergency plans annually to the relevant jurisdiction’s LEPC, fire
department and/or other state departments and agencies as applicable and required by
codes, laws, regulations or requirements

RTD Emergency Operations Plan

x Individuals with pets will bring their pets with them when they evacuate. Those with
livestock or other farm animals will take appropriate measures to safeguard their
animals via sheltering or evacuation as appropriate
x RTD and its response partners will need to provide additional/enhanced assistance to
individuals with access and functional needs, including but not limited to children,
elderly, those with limited English proficiency, and individuals with disabilities and/or
chronic conditions

Concept of Operations
The concept of operations describes the sequence and scope of emergency response. The
Transit Police and Emergency Management Department has the primary responsibility for
coordinating emergency management activities under the auspices of RTD. These activities
support the following priorities:
x Minimize injury and loss of life
x Minimize property damage
x Minimize adverse environmental and economic impact
x Maintain the highest level of service possible to maintain consistency throughout
emergency conditions
x Provide for the needs of survivors
Plan Activation
The EOP and its associated Annexes will be executed in whole or in part as directed by the GM/
CEO, the Chief of Transit Police and Emergency Management, or their designees in response to
an existing or an impending emergency. This plan may also be activated under the following
circumstances:

x At the time of an actual disaster or emergency
x When a community that RTD serves has declared a local state of emergency
x When the Governor of Colorado has declared an emergency for areas within RTD’s
service area
x When a Presidential Declaration of an Emergency or Disaster is issued for areas within
RTD’s service area
Phases of Emergency Management
RTD’s Emergency Management Program addresses all phases of emergency management for all
types of incidents, including mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

x In the event that an evacuation of a community within RTD’s service area, or any part
thereof, is ordered, the majority of the evacuees will utilize their own transportation
resources to evacuate. However, a percentage of the population does not have access
to transportation and will require transportation assistance

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Prevention
Prevention includes those capabilities necessary to avoid, prevent, or stop a threatened
or actual act of terrorism. Unlike other mission areas, which are all-hazards by design,
Prevention core capabilities are focused specifically on imminent terrorist threats,
including on-going attacks or stopping imminent follow-on attacks.
RTD Transit Police and Emergency Management Department has primary responsibility for the
prevention of terrorist or other criminal activities as it relates to the agency and its operations.
This is accomplished by close coordination with federal, state, and local law enforcement
agencies to share information about potential threats to the agency and communities within its
service area as well as conducting active video surveillance. Each individual within RTD supports
this effort by reporting indicators of terrorism, violent extremism, or other malicious actors to
RTD Transit Police and Emergency Management Department.

Protection
The protection mission relates to the ability to secure and protect people, critical infrastructure,
and vital interests against human-caused and natural events. This can include activities such as
the securing of facilities, the IT network, or hardening of the supply chain.

Mitigation
The goal of mitigation is to prevent future loss by reducing or eliminating risk. Mitigation
activities like the recovery and preparedness phases of emergency management can occur
before or after an emergency. The goals of pre-emergency mitigation activities are to reduce
the chances of an emergency happening or reducing the damage suffered from unavoidable
emergencies. The goal of post-emergency mitigation is to reduce the impact of future hazards
and is a part of the recovery process.

Response
Response is the actual provision of emergency services during a crisis including the coordination
and management of resources to support emergency response operations. These activities help
to reduce casualties and damage and to speed recovery. Response activities include resource
and logistical coordination, addressing immediate life safety issues, stabilization of the incident,
and public information.
RTD responds to emergencies by activating the EOP; activating the EOC; coordinating with
public, private, and NGO partners as needed; coordinating and managing resources in support
of emergency response, and preparing for recovery activities.

Recovery

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

From the National Preparedness Goal 2nd Edition published by FEMA (2015):

Recovery activities may be both short-term and long-term, ranging from conducting damage
assessments, removing debris, restoring essential utilities such as water and power, restoring
IT infrastructure and services, and restoring revenue service through repairing or replacing
damaged vehicles, facilities, or rail. Recovery may also incorporate mitigation measures

Organization and Assignment of Roles and Responsibilities
RTD will participate in planning, training, and exercise activities with federal, state, and local
partners to familiarize first responders with the systems, vehicles, and infrastructure they may
encounter while performing their duties. This includes participation on the NCR/UASI
Emergency Management Coordination Group.
When state or local EOCs are activated, RTD will provide a representative to liaise between the
agency and the jurisdiction for resource needs related to the emergency activation. RTD will
also notify partner agencies of RTD EOC activations and request representation as needed from
local communities.

Direction, Control, and Coordination
National Incident Management System (NIMS)
RTD’s emergency management organization is structured in accordance with NIMS and ICS.
NIMS integrates existing processes and methods into a unified national framework for incident
management. This framework forms the basis for interoperability and compatibility that enable
a diverse set of public and private organizations to conduct effective incident management
operations.
It does this through a core set of concepts, principles, procedures, organizational structures
(ICS, multi-agency coordination, and joint information systems), terminology, and standards
requirements applicable to a broad community of NIMS users. To ensure interoperability and
compatibility, NIMS is based on an appropriate balance of flexibility and standardization. It
provides a consistent and flexible national framework within which government and private
entities at all levels can work together to manage domestic incidents, regardless of their cause,
size, location, or complexity.
Incident Command System (ICS)
Emergency management and incident response in RTD is coordinated using the ICS. ICS
enables effective incident management by integrating a combination of facilities, equipment,
personnel, procedures, and communications operating within a common organizational
structure. ICS is used to organize both near-term and long-term operations for a broad
spectrum of emergencies, from small to complex incidents, both natural and manmade. ICS is

available to the IC.
All activity undertaken under the EOP shall be coordinated using ICS and NIMS in accordance
with Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 5.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

In ICS, the IC is able to appoint individuals into leadership positions to support specific areas of
the response:

27
Packet Pg. 484

2.17.C.b

RTD Emergency Operations Plan

First responders will establish Incident Command when they are on scene. RTD will always
defer authority to first responders while they are on-scene but will establish consistent
communication in a liaison function to provide information about RTD vehicles, facilities, and
response procedures. Information is to be shared freely with first responders as it becomes
available. When possible, the individual who would assume Incident Command after first
responders leave should be the liaison with First Response Incident Command.
In the event of an emergency/disaster occurring on an RTD revenue vehicle, the operator or
conductor will begin the event as the IC. They will notify their appropriate dispatch or control
center and their street/field supervisor of the event. When the supervisor arrives on-scene, the
supervisor will take over as Incident Command. An appropriate transfer of command must
always take place when a new incident commander assumes command.
In the event of an emergency/disaster occurring at an RTD-owned facility, the highest ranking
or most qualified facilities maintenance staff present will begin the event as the IC. They will
notify their appropriate dispatch or control center and their facilities maintenance manager of
the event. When the Facilities Maintenance Manager arrives on-scene they may choose to
assume Incident Command, or to leave the current IC in charge. An appropriate transfer of
command must always take place when a new incident commander assumes command.
The IC has the authority to request resources to facilitate response, including (but not limited
to):

x On-scene presence of Emergency Management Specialist
x Trained individuals to staff command staff and general staff roles (Public
Information Officer, Liaison Officer, Safety Officer, Operations Chief, Logistics
Chief, Planning Chief or Finance/Administration Chief)
x Activation of the Mobile Command Post
x Trained staff to fill any necessary operations, logistics, planning, or
communication roles
x Activation of the Emergency Operations Center
x Vehicles, parts, and other materials to maintain or restore safe conditions or
safe operation
All Street Supervisors for bus service, all Field Supervisors for rail, and all sworn Police Officers
will be expected to maintain the following trainings from FEMA or an appropriate local training
agency:
• IS 100-Introduction to Incident Command System
• IS 200-Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response
• IS 700-An Introduction to the National Incident Management System
• IS 800-National Response Framework, An Introduction

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

Incident Command
Single Incident Commander - Most incidents involve a single incident commander. In these
incidents, a single person commands the incident response and is the decision-making
authority. The on-scene IC has tactical control of and authority over all resources at the scene.

28
Packet Pg. 485

2.17.C.b

• ICS 300-Intermediate ICS for Expanding Incidents
These trainings will give the supervisors and sworn police officers the competency to work
within ICS and integrate with other local response agencies to preserve life safety, reduce
damage to property and reduce impact to the environment. From the time of this policy being
adopted or from promotion to a relevant supervisor position, individuals will have six months to
complete all trainings.
Unified Command
A Unified Command involves two or more individuals sharing the authority normally held by a
single IC. A Unified Command acts as a single entity. It is important to note that in Unified
Command the command representatives will appoint a single Operations Section Chief.
An example when Unified Command may be used would be an intentional, malicious derailment
of a train, where Transit Police and Rail Supervisors will work together to make decisions
regarding the response.
Transfer of Command
Responsibility can be transferred during an incident for several reasons. As the incident grows
a more qualified person may be required to take over as IC to handle the ever-growing needs
of the incident. Or this may occur in reverse; when an incident reduces in size, the command
can be passed down to a person with less experience, but who is still qualified to run the nowsmaller incident. Other reasons to transfer command include jurisdictional change if the incident
moves to a different location or area of responsibility, or the normal turnover of personnel due
to extended incidents. The transfer of command process always includes a transfer of command
briefing, IC to IC, with the objective to give a complete picture of all events and considerations
that may impact the response and decision-making abilities of the new IC. This briefing may be
oral, written, or a combination of both. A transfer of command is posted and announced on all
radio and communication networks, especially with notification to the EOC.
Incident Coordination and/or Response Structures
Various types of operational support facilities are established in the vicinity of an incident,
depending on its size and complexity, to accomplish a variety of purposes. RTD may operate
one or more of the following incident coordination and/or response facilities during an
emergency or disaster:

Incident Command Post (ICP)
An ICP is the field location where the IC operates, onsite response is directly coordinated, and
onsite resource needs are identified and communicated. There is only one ICP for each incident
or event, but it may change locations during the event. The ICP may be located in a vehicle, the
Mobile Command Post, or within a building. The ICP will be positioned outside of the incident
scene and the potential hazard zone but close enough to the incident to maintain a visual

presence and command status. The on-scene IC has tactical control of and authority over all
resources at the scene.
The RTD EOC serves as the central point for coordination of the agency’s emergency
management and response activities. The EOC does not usurp the responsibility or authority of
the IC but instead supports incident command while mobilizing resources, tracking costs,
planning for future needs, providing decision making support and liaising with the Leadership
Team/Policy Group as needed. Like Incident Command, the EOC is scalable and flexible.
RTD has designated a primary and secondary EOC, which can be activated as necessary:
Primary EOC:

District Shops
Mezzanine Training Rooms
1 00 31st St
Denver, CO 80216

Secondary EOC:

711 Building
Ste 10
711 W 31st Ave
Denver, CO 80202

The EOC may also be activated in a virtual or hybrid stance using an RTD-approved platform.
Identified and trained EOC representatives will be invited to the Virtual EOC (VEOC) channel
and will participate in the discussions as activated on an event by event basis.
The Emergency Management Specialist will serve as the EOC Manager and has the authority
and responsibility for managing the EOC and the agency’s emergency management organization
during an emergency or disaster. The EOC Manager has the authority to make all routine
decisions and is charged with advising the Leadership Team and the General Manager and CEO
when major decisions need to be made. The EOC Manager serves as a liaison with the local
jurisdictions’ emergency management agencies as well as state and federal agencies.
EOC Goals
The following are the general goals for the emergency operations center. These goals can be
adjusted by the EOC Manager in coordination with the General Manager and CEO, Chief of
Transit Police and Emergency Management, and the IC, when the EOC is activated.
x Obtain and maintain situational awareness of the incident and ensure responders
have a common operating picture
x Establish an incident planning cycle
x Manage resources (people, places, things) including tracking the status of
requests, the status and utilization of resources, and planning for the
demobilization of resources
x Procurement of emergency supplies
x Establish a seamless transition from response into recovery operations
x Assess and document impacts from events for recovery process

Activation Level Three (Watch): The EOC activates to activation level three (AL-3) when
only public safety staff from Transit Police and Emergency Management are needed to closely
monitor a developing incident or threat. At AL-3, the EOC will begin gathering situation
awareness information, but emergency coordination is largely left to the routine processes and
procedures maintained by each department or division.
Activation Level Two (Partial): The EOC is activated to activation level two (AL-2) when
some, but not all, EOC positions are needed to manage an emergency. The EOC Manager is
responsible for determining which positions are needed to meet the agency’s needs. The
following are examples of triggers for when an AL-2 activation may be appropriate:
• A request for EOC activation from an IC
• An incident resulting in 10 or more serious injuries or fatalities
• A credible threat of terrorism or mass violence as determined by RTD-PD, local
jurisdiction police department or the Colorado Information Analysis Center
• A forecast from the National Weather Service of a blizzard warning or a prediction of
major flooding or wildfire with significant impact
• A significant disruption in service requiring off-scene coordination of resources to
provide information or resources.

EOC Staffing
The EOC will be staffed utilizing a hybrid ICS/departmental model. Representatives are
expected to be knowledgeable individuals with authority to make emergency-related decisions
for their department/division. Lists of EOC representatives will be maintained by the leadership
of each discipline expected to maintain staff prepared to report to the EOC and be able to
provide this list to the Emergency Management Specialist every six months and upon request.
Each mode of transit, bus, light rail, commuter rail, and paratransit, must maintain at least
three trained EOC representatives. This allows for relief if the EOC must be activated on a 24hour basis as well as providing coverage if one of the two primary EOC representatives are
unable to report for duty for any reason.
The following lines of service must also have trained EOC representatives, with the exact
number noted below:
x RTD Transit Policeџ Three
x Safety and Environmental ComplianceџThree, to be trained to fill roles such as safety
officer and safety EOC liaison
x Safety, Security and Complianceџ Two

x Capital Programs and FacilitiesџThree
x PlanningџTwo trained as Planning Section Staff
x Operations Service DeliveryџTwo trained as Planning Section Staff
x FinanceџTwo
x Human ResourcesџTwo
x General CounselџTwo
Depending upon the event triggering the activation, additional roles may be assigned outside of
a representative’s normal work. This is to be expected in emergencies, especially those where
an on-scene ICS structure is not in place.
EOC Activation
The EOC will be activated at the request of the General Manager and CEO, Chief Operations
Officer, Chief of Police and Emergency Management, the Emergency Management Specialist, or
IC or any of the above position’s designees. Upon request, the Emergency Management
Specialist/EOC Manager will determine the appropriate level of activation and required
representatives.
Notification of EOC activation will be sent to trained representatives and Leadership Team using
ReadyOp over text and call. Only one representative will be asked to go to the EOC unless
otherwise noted.

Long-term relocation of RTD facilities or staff

Members of the Policy Group are not required to staff the EOC and will be requested to appoint
another representative to the EOC in the event they are present, to allow proper delegation and
accomplishment of EOC objectives.
EOC Table of Organization
Following is a sample of what role each department’s representatives may be asked to fill in an
emergency. This is not prescriptive and may be adjusted depending upon the event triggering
the activation. Leadership of each section may or may not be assigned based upon complexity
of staffing or the event.
Representatives working in the EOC will be asked to liaise between their departments and the
EOC and while staffing the EOC are acting outside of their steady-state role and hierarchy.

Information Collection, Analysis and Dissemination
Situational Awareness
There are five elements that are the backbone of good situational awareness:
x
x
x
x
x

Define the information requirements
Determine how to gather information
Decide who will analyze that information
Determine how that information will be shared
Choose the technology that will help communicate and manage the information

During the initial period of an emergency, efforts should be focused on gaining an
understanding of the situation and establishing incident priorities. A well-defined, operational
information collection capability is essential. Information collection provides situational
awareness to leadership and promotes informed decision-making. The agency has designated a
process to collect, analyze and disseminate information during an emergency to both internal
and external response partners as well as the public.
Information Collection
Information will be collected from a variety of sources. EOC Manager or their designee at the
EOC will be charged with collecting information. The following list contains examples of
potential sources of operational information:
x Revenue Vehicle Operators, Via Communications Centers
x On-scene responders (street/field supervision, facilities staff, etc.)

Information Analysis
After information has been collected, it must be analyzed to determine its credibility and
operational relevance. The EOC Manager or their designee will analyze information that is
received and prepare intelligence reports for leadership.
Dissemination
Message dissemination is categorized into internal messaging and public messaging. Internal
messaging refers to messages crafted for responders, employees, contractors, and partners,
while public messaging refers to messages crafted for public dissemination.
Internal Messaging
EOC Manager or his/her designee in the EOC will assist in conveying information as necessary
to responders, RTD departments and other partners. Additionally, EOC Manager or their
designee will maintain and update the Incident Action Plan (IAP), which will contain critical
information and intelligence updates.
Within two hours of an emergency event, the EOC Manager will brief the Policy
Group/Leadership Team with details for the event and response.

Public Messaging
Various methods of public information dissemination are available. The decision to use a
particular medium will be based on the urgency and the intended audience. Some methods of
distribution include:

x

Communications
Communications are an important component of response and recovery operations. The ability
of emergency management/response personnel from different disciplines, jurisdictions,

35
Packet Pg. 492

2.17.C.b

organizations, and agencies to work together depends greatly on their ability to communicate
with each other. To effectively transmit and receive information, emergency response partners
supporting the community must have access to all available forms of communication. This
section outlines the types of equipment/systems available for internal, external and public
communication. Operational communications systems and capabilities, and effective
communications, are essential to the success of any emergency operation. The community
maintains and operates the below communications systems to ensure effective and operation
communications between municipal personnel and with other jurisdictions.
Communications between community agencies occur through the use of several types of
communications equipment including radios, cellular and landline phones, email, and satellite
phones. In addition, the State of Colorado uses WebEOC to provide situational awareness.
The radio system RTD uses is supported by the State and is utilized by first responders across
the region and State. This is an 800 MHz system and has redundant towers in the Denver
Metro Area. All radio talk groups have access to MetroNET, which is the mutual aid channel in
the Denver Metro Area. RTD’s system is segregated into bus operations, rail operations,
transit police, and some single channels available for support services such as treasury
maintenance. There is only one encrypted channel available and it is on the police talk group.
Bus operations is set up to facilitate on-demand communication, where all other channels are
push-to-talk. The radio system is maintained by IT’s Mobile Technologies group.
In addition, RTD’s Emergency Management Specialist sends situational awareness updates for
events that may require emergency coordination.
Alert and Notification
RTD utilizes service alerts to inform customers and the public about disruptions to the system.
This is predominantly sent via app alerts and emails for registered users on selected routes of
importance to the individual. The organization also communicates with the public via news
releases and media advisories.
Customer Care is also a point of contact for the public to make requests via phone or online
communications. These are on-demand communications available 6 a.m. – 8 p.m. Monday
through Friday and a.m. – 6 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.
Notification of ey Leaders

When an emergency requires the notification of key community officials, Emergency
Notification will be done using the Emergency Notification Procedure (RTD-EM-PRC0001).
Further updates will be made using:

EOC Communications

RTD’s EOC is equipped with, maintains and is capable of operating, the following
communication systems: Computers with Microsoft Teams, cameras, microphones,
Outlook, telephones, and radio.
RTD conducts periodic communications tests to ensure that its systems are operational,
and its personnel are capable of operating the systems. More particularly, Emergency
Management Specialist conducts an emergency communication test on a semiannual
basis.
Public Warning
Public warning is accomplished using the following methods as appropriate:
x Service alerts
x RTD website notifications
x Public information displays
x Public announcement systems
Public Information Officer (PIO)

The PIO has roles and responsibilities as identified in the Crisis Communications Plan
which includes:
x Determine or create proper message content
x Select appropriate communication method
x Disseminate public warnings after receiving written approval from the EOC
Manager or their designee
During non-emergency times, information regarding emergency plans and actions to be
taken by the public, in the form of public information and education materials, will be
provided to the public via newsletters, brochures, and RTD’s website and social media
platforms.
During an emergency, the potential for dissemination of false or misleading information
is high. This can lead to operational difficulties for responders and confusion among
the public. Misleading information can be produced from several sources. RTD will
establish a media monitoring and rumor control section in the EOC and staffed by
Communications and Engagement staff.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Finance and Administration Matters
During an emergency, certain employees may be reassigned to complete alternate duties that
differ from their regular day-to-day responsibilities. Department administration will coordinate
with Human Resources to manage incidents and ensure staffing levels are appropriate. In
general, RTD job descriptions for non-represented employees include an ‘other duties as
assigned’ or ‘other duties as required’ clause that can be activated for emergencies. This may
require approval of the Policy Group when not previously identified in this document.
Worker’s Compensation
Worker’s compensation claims are administered by the Risk Management Division according to
Colorado Revised Statutes C.R.S. 8-40-101, et seq. Even in an emergency employees should be
encouraged to file a workers’ compensation claim to ensure they receive appropriate medical
care and lost wage benefits related to on-the-job injuries.
Insurance and Financial Liability
RTD is self-insured for tort liability up to the limits specified under the Colorado Governmental
Immunity Act and has additional insurance policies in place to support the financial recovery of
the organization. For this reason, it is important to coordinate with the Risk Management
Division to ensure proper record-keeping and investigative processes are followed. These
policies include excess workers compensation, crime, fiduciary, cybersecurity, excess liability,
property and railroad liability insurance.
Timekeeping
Tracking employee time spent on emergency operations can be an important aspect of
determining disaster costs and opportunities for reimbursement by the federal government
through FTA or FEMA. RTD maintains the same timekeeping policies during regular operations
and emergency operations, but salaried employees should use Workday to log any applicable or
qualified hours worked, especially those above 40 hours/week. There may be a specific code
assigned for disaster operations hours worked.
Represented employees will use ronos or TIES for their timekeeping needs, according to their
steady state timekeeping policies. If for some reason Workday, ronos, or TIES are unavailable,
employees are to track hours manually and appropriate Finance Department staff shall make
necessary adjustments as the systems become available.
Records Retention
Records retention during emergencies is conducted using the same policies and procedures in
place during regular operation. The Records Management Procedure and Records Retention
Schedule Policy, created and maintained by the Information Management and Governance
Division can be found on the agency’s intranet, i.e., “The Hub.” Records to be retained during
and after an emergency include personnel hours, equipment costs, expenditures/procurement,
costs incurred by RTD, etc. in compliance with RTD policies and procedures and C.F.R. Title 44,

Emergency Procurement and Spending
RTD uses any existing contracts first to make purchases and secure goods and services for
emergency requirements. If such a contract is not available, the EOC Manager and the
Emergency Management Specialist each has authority to spend up to 25,000 by use of an RTD
Purchase Card (P-Card) for emergency purchases if it is not possible or practicable to initiate a

Emergency Contracting
Emergency and post-disaster contracts will be managed by the Contracting and Procurement
Division. Allowing emergency contracting during an emergency is an important way to avoid
lengthy contract bidding processes and speed up response and recovery efforts; however, it
should be carefully managed in order to prevent RTD and the taxpayers from potentially
overpaying for goods and services by failing to facilitate appropriate competition for taxpayer
funded contracts. More detailed information about emergency contractors can be found in the
Procurement Standards Manual or its successor document.

Plan Development and Maintenance
EOP Coordination
This EOP will be promulgated every three years. The reviews, revisions, updates, and changes
made to the plan will begin with the Emergency Management Division of the RTD-PD, which will
then elevate the plan as needed if signatures are required for the changes to the plan. If any
necessary plan changes originate outside the Emergency Management Division, the need for
updates will be communicated to the appropriate department via email to ensure version
control and accountability.

purchase requisition (PR) for the emergency purchase. These purchases require emergency
justification and supporting documentation, consistent with the Procurement Standards Manual
or its successor document. Purchase authorizations above this limit must be approved by the
Policy Group.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
The Emergency Management Division of RTD-PD is tasked with maintaining, distributing, and
updating this EOP. Revisions to this EOP will be coordinated by the Emergency Management
Division that will also review and approve any proposed revisions.
EOP Updates
Plan maintenance includes updating and revising the plan to reflect all changes, testing the plan
periodically, and ensuring that all personnel remain up to date on their roles and responsibilities
as outlined in the plan. If any issues emerge, situations change, gaps become apparent, and/or
requirements change, the plan must be updated to reflect these and remain usable, compliant
and current. The EOP will be reviewed annually, after any exercises, following any changes in
requirements, and/or after actual incidents, as necessary.

EOP Reviews and Updates
This EOP is continuously monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness, and will be updated
after the following:

x
x
x
x

Purpose
The purpose of this Annex is to define the actions and roles necessary for the Bus
Operations Division to participate in a coordinated response within the framework of the
EOP . This Annex provides guidance to groups within the Bus Operations
department/division with a general concept of potential emergency assignments before,
during, and following emergency or disaster situations.
Bus Operations Division is responsible for delivery of all RTD rubber-tired transit
services, except paratransit. RTD bus operations consists of nine operational divisions,
described in Characteristics and five organizational groups within RTD:
1. Contracted Servicesџ responsible for overseeing the delivery of all RTD rubbertired services delivered by RTD's contracted transit service providers, including
fixed-route and demand responsive services.
2. Maintenanceџresponsible for maintaining RTD's directly operated rubber-tired
fleet, including transit vehicles and support services.
3. Street Operations: responsible for the coordination and supervision of all bus
services in operation.
4. Transportationџ responsible for the training of RTD bus operators and the
delivery of RTD directly operated bus services.
5. Administrationџ responsible for administrative duties and high-level decisionmaking for all divisions of Bus Operations.
Bus Operations oversees more than 150 Local, Regional and Skyride routes and serve
10,000 bus stops throughout the service area. The RTD bus system operates 365 days
a year, 24 hours a day. Bus operations addresses the unique needs and challenges of
all individuals by facilitating accessibility, mobility, and community involvement through
RTD programs and services. The Bus Operations fleet consists of more than 1,000
transit vehicles, 300 non-licensed vehicles, such as lawnmowers, and 450 licensed
support vehicles operating out of four RTD divisions and five private contracted
divisions. Of the five contracted divisions, four are fixed-route contactors one private
contractor operates RTD’s FlexRide service in 24 areas throughout the District.
Scope
The Bus Operations Division will provide scheduled and demand response bus service to
the public, leveraging necessary human and physical resources. Bus operations will, to
the degree possible, support other operations divisions, including rail, to provide
auxiliary services, such as bus bridges, during rail emergencies or outages. Bus
operations will continue to maintain and support the support services fleet, which
extends to all departments in the agency. This Annex applies to all staff, equipment,
subdivisions, and operations of the Bus Operations department and associated divisions
and primarily describes the department’s emergency actions.

While the vast majority of bus operations employees are located at one of the above
facilities, some administration staff are also located at RTD’s headquarters (1660 Blake
St. Denver, CO, 80202). Administrative staff includes the Assistant General Manager
and Deputy Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, Business Program Manager,
Data Analyst II, and Business Support.
The Transportation subdivision has oversight of the three operating facilities - Platte,
East Metro and Boulder - and the Bus Operator Training Subdivision. The transportation
subdivision has managers, assistant managers, lead division supervisors, and division
supervisors at each operating facility, with a general superintendent leading the
subdivision. There are currently nearly 700 full-time and 100 part-time bus operators
directly employed by the agency.
The Maintenance subdivision works with other subdivisions throughout the department,
ensuring that they have buses and support equipment needed to meet RTD's mission to
Make Lives Better through Connections. Bus maintenance consists of four facilities:
District Shops, Platte, East Metro, Boulder. Maintenance operations is managed by the
General Superintendent of Maintenance, the Assistant General Superintendent of
Maintenance, division managers, assistant division managers, supervisors, engineering,
quality control, and trainer positions.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

Street operations oversees the daily processes of the OCC (Dispatch) and Street
Supervision. They work closely with external agencies throughout the service area to
maintain an efficient and reliable transit network. The Street Operations subdivision is
managed by the General Superintendent and Assistant General Superintendent of Street
Operations and supported by Street Supervision, Dispatch, Station Starters, Sign
Maintainers, and Sign Fabricators.
Street operations supervises the coordination, preparation, and update of all detours
affected by special events, emergencies, or service disruptions. Street operations also
works closely with law enforcement, jurisdictions, and municipalities for on-street
activities and detours affecting bus operations. Street Operations also coordinates
emergency response with the RTD Office of Emergency Management.
The Contracted Services Group is managed by the Senior Manager of Contracted
Services and serves as the liaison between RTD personnel and the private contractor
personnel. Private contractors operate approximately half of RTD fixed-route service,
and all FlexRide (demand response) service. In addition, contracted services plans all
special services and ensures that adequate personnel (both RTD and private
contractors) are available to provide the service. Contracted services also serves as the
conduit for service related partnerships throughout the District.
Equipment used across all divisions typically consists of radio handhelds for field
communications, supervisor vehicles for field assignments and emergency response,
buses and associated support systems, such as CAD/AVL, for providing transit service to
customers, non-revenue vehicles for management and other staff.
Planning Assumptions
This Annex is a supplementary document to the RTD Emergency Operations Base Plan.
The RTD EOP will also include hazard specific Annexes to identify the actions to be
taken for a specific risk, hazard, or emergency. This Annex will remain at an all-hazards

Emergency Equipment on Fixed-Route Revenue Vehicles
Each diesel bus holds between 75-182 gallons of diesel fuel. The Mall Shuttle subfleet
consist of battery electrified buses and the batteries are between 2 2-330 kWh Lithium
Iron Phosphate compound.
All transit buses are all equipped with:
x Fire extinguisher
x Emergency triangles
x Strap chains/snow chains/snow socks or auto chains depending on bus type
In the event of an emergency, operators use on-board radio systems to contact
Dispatch. This system also has a backup “fallback” feature in the event the main system
is down. Buses are also equipped with cameras to provide additional security. Buses
procured and accepted into the fleet buses have a live look-in AV system, where transit
police can view and talk to operators and customers on the bus remotely.
Forty-foot transit buses have the ability to dump the air from exterior compartment
below the operator’s window. By dumping the vehicle air system it will release the front
doors. Coach buses can dump the air from the compartment below the operator’s
window. This is in place if the system fails electronically or if the batteries are dead.
All safety equipment is inspected every 6,000 miles and mid-year inventory is
conducted at East Metro, Platte, and Boulder Divisions.
Annex Development and Maintenance
It is the responsibility of the Bus Operations Division to develop or update internal SOPs
to ensure its own operations capabilities. The AGM, Bus Operations will coordinate the
planning of all bus operations related to emergency operations.
The Bus Operations Division also is committed to testing and continuous improvement
of this plan and will participate in exercises on a two-year cycle unless a real-world
event or emergency makes doing so unrealistic. After each exercise or emergency, the
Bus Operations Division will participate in the AAR process and will implement
improvement plan items as relevant.
This Annex will be updated after any emergency or exercise from which the AAR
identifies necessary changes and every three years on the same cycle as the revision of
the EOP Base Plan.

Annex B: Commuter Rail
Purpose
The purpose of this Annex is to define the actions and roles necessary for the
Commuter Rail Division to participate in a coordinated response within the framework of
the RTD EOP. This Annex provides guidance to groups within the Commuter Rail
Division with a general concept of potential emergency assignments before, during, and
following emergency or disaster situations.
Scope
This Annex applies to all staff, equipment, subdivisions, and operations of the
Commuter Rail Division and primarily describes the division’s emergency actions.
Situation Overview
Characteristics

The Commuter Rail Operations subdivision is responsible for timely and safe rail services.
RTD commuter rail currently operates the N Line on 13.75 commuter rail system miles of
track, 365 days a year with six rail stations and operates 365 days a year.
Commuter rail operations services and maintains all track, signals, overhead catenary
system (OCS), and right of way access for the N Line. In addition, commuter rail
maintains all certifications for train engineers, conductors, dispatchers, signal
maintainers, track maintainers, communications, OCS maintainers and rail
laborers. Safety procedures and practices are continuously reviewed to ensure safety
of employees and customers.
Commuter Rail Operations consists of four subdivisions:
Rail Administration
Provides the overall management for commuter rail operations. This subdivision
includes all budgeting, fiscal planning and monitoring, capital project planning,
performance monitoring, data analysis and overall reporting, educational development,
regulatory compliance, and safety/quality assurance through internal
assessments/audits. Oversight and technical expertise are provided for corridor rail
construction projects.
Commuter Rail Transportation (CRT)
Responsible for providing safe and reliable daily service to the customer base and
provides special services for events. The OCC provides 24/7 coverage, serves as a
command-and-control facility and is the main location from which all aspects of the

RTD Emergency Operations Plan

Maintenance of Way (MOW) and Infrastructure
Responsible for the maintenance of the agency's rail right of way including traction
power substations, OCS, signal systems, track, and track right of way such as rail beds
and structures.
Commuter Rail Oversight
Commuter Rail Contract Services (aka Oversight) oversees the Concessionaire
Agreement (CA) with DTP and its operator DTO, which operates the A, B, and G lines
through the CA with RTD. Oversight oversees operations and maintenance delivery to
ensure the Eagle 3P Concessionaire is meeting contractual requirements as well as
regulatory requirements. The oversight team provides support to the commuter rail
lines and interfaces with all responsible members performing operation and
maintenance.

To provide additional context to commuter rail operations, described below is the
commuter rail systems and equipment components to maintain rail system operations.
WIMA
The WIMA
system provides system monitoring and status information
to OCC. WIMA information includes train locations, speed, positive train control, and a
variety of additional system information.
Commuter Rail Vehicles
The fleet consists of 66 individual Hyundai Rotem units also referred to in this document
as Electro-Mechanical Units (EMU), using a 25 OCS. All vehicles are maintained by DTO
at the commuter rail maintenance facility located at 5151 Fox Street, Denver, CO.
CR Maintenance Facility
The commuter rail facility located at 8215 Steele Street, Commerce City, CO is
where general maintenance, repair and rolling stock storage for the N Line occur.
Operations
OCC governs the operation, control, and dispatch of commuter rail vehicles.
Dispatch maintains contact with the train engineers and conductors by means of radios
located in each commuter rail vehicle cab. Commuter rail engineers and conductors also
carry a portable radio to be used while outside of the cab or in case of cab radio
failure. Field supervisors rove throughout the system during operations. Their role is to
provide support and coordination between Dispatch and commuter rail vehicle engineers
and conductors during an emergency or upset in the system that may require a manual
block operation, bus bridge, evacuation, or accident response and investigation.
Current operations consist of one line:

OCS – Overhead Catenary
OCS for the commuter rail system is the overhead catenary wire. Approximately
25,000 volts AC is fed to the overhead catenary wire. Contact between the overhead
wire and the Commuter Rail Vehicle (CRV) is through the CRV pantograph located on the
top of the CRV. For all incidents or maintenance involving the OCS, the pantograph
should be lowered to remove electrical hazard from the CRV.
Grade Crossings
The system has 4 Grade crossings: 13 pedestrian rail-grade crossings at stations and 36
highway-rail grade crossings. Nearly all the highway-rail grade crossings will be in quiet
zones and most crossings feature:
x
uad gates or concrete medians
x Loop detectors to prevent vehicles from becoming trapped between the gates
x Advanced preemption closed circuit television pedestrian treatments
o Many locations include gates
o Tactile warning strips with truncated domes
Pedestrian crossings are protected with a combination of flashing signals, audible bells,
and ancillary ‘another train approaching’ signs. These warning devices will be controlled
with fixed approach audio frequency track circuits.
Signals and Train Control
Commuter rail uses a traditional cab-signaling Automatic Train Control system in
conjunction with a Positive Train Control (PTC) overlay system. There are wayside signals
only at interlockings. The PTC system uses Wabtec’s Interoperable Electronic Train
Management System to meet FRA requirements in accordance with the 2008 Rail Safety
Act including:
• Prevention of train-to-train collisions
• Enforcement of over-speed limits (including civil, routing, temporary)
• Prevention of incursions into established work zone limits
• Prevention of movements over switches set in the wrong direction (in
interlockings and hand throw switches)
The PTC system uses a combination of fiber and wireless communication technologies
deployed in a redundant manner to provide a robust, reliable and highly-available system.

Commuter rail operations has three operating facilities, which are active 24 hours a day,
365 days a year, these facilities include:

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

N Line – Denver Union Station to 124th Station in Thornton
In the case of an accident or breakdown of the system, the controller will monitor
movement and control train movement using a manual block system. When necessary,
buses are used in a bridging procedure to move customers around a trouble area.

Annex C: Light Rail Operations
The purpose of this Annex is to define the actions and roles necessary for the Light Rail Operations
Group to participate in a coordinated response within the framework of the RTD EOP. This Annex
provides guidance to groups within the Light Rail Operations Group with a general concept of
potential emergency assignments before, during, and following emergency or disaster situations.

Scope
This Annex applies to all staff, equipment, subdivisions, and operations of the Light Rail
Operations Group and primarily describes the group’s emergency actions.

Situation Overview
Characteristics
The Light Rail Operations (LRO) subdivision is responsible for providing safe and reliable train
service. RTD light rail currently operates six light rail lines providing approximately 60 light rail
system miles (double track) with 57 rail stations and operates 365 days a year.
LRO services and maintains 201 Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) and maintains all track, signals,
overhead catenary system, and right of way access. In addition, light rail maintains all
certifications for train operators, electro mechanics, signal/traction power maintainers, track
maintainers and rail laborers. Safety procedures and practices are continuously reviewed to
ensure safety.
RTD Light Rail Operations consist of four subdivisions:

Light Rail Administration (LRA)
Provides the overall management for light rail operations. This group includes all departmental
budgeting, fiscal planning and monitoring, capital project planning, performance monitoring, data
analysis and overall reporting, educational development, regulatory compliance, and
safety/quality assurance through internal assessments/audits. Project management is provided
for all rail vehicle procurements. Oversight and technical expertise are provided for corridor rail
construction projects.

Light Rail Transportation (LRT)
Responsible for providing safe and reliable service, and provides alternated schedules for events
such as the Denver Broncos, Colorado Rockies, large concerts, etc. The OCC provides 24/7
coverage, serves as a command-and-control facility and is the main location from which all
aspects of the system are controlled, and operational decisions are made regarding scheduled
and emergency operations.

Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance (LRVM)
Maintains all certifications for light rail mechanics and is responsible for ensuring the maintenance
and cleanliness of the district’s rail fleet. In addition to preventive maintenance, accident repairs,
electrical/electronic diagnostics, service and cleaning of the vehicles, this group provides

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
emergency and road call response for vehicle recovery, component overhauls and rebuilds, as
well as all body shop functions including body, paint, glass, and upholstery work.
Responsible for the maintenance of the district's rail rights of way to include traction power
substations, OCS, signal systems, track, and track rights of way such as rail beds and structures.
In addition, the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) group provides oversight of
the fiber optics and information technology to function and maintain the SCADA system that
enables staff to visually track and control the vehicles and wayside equipment, such as substations
and track switches, in the district's rail corridors.
To provide additional context to light rail operations, below describes the different light rail
systems and equipment components to maintain rail system operations.

Light Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
The SCADA system provides two types of general functions: control over certain system elements
from the Central Control Center; and system monitoring and status information to the Central
Control Center. The SCADA system allows light rail controllers certain capabilities such as remote
capability to power down sections of the alignment and control over power switches. It also
provides information to the light rail controllers on the status of certain elements of the light rail
system. SCADA information includes train locations, switch alignments, power status, signal
status and a variety of additional system information.

Light Rail Vehicles
The RTD light rail vehicle fleet consists of two models from Siemens: the SD 100 and the SD
160. The vehicles are very similar and have two main differences. The SD 160 has an AC
propulsion system and sliding plug doors where the SD 100 has a DC propulsion system and bifold doors. The SD 100 model is the original RTD vehicle and there are 4 vehicles in the
fleet. The SD 160 was originally ordered for the Southeast Corridor extension: 68 were delivered
with an additional 55 vehicles ordered for FasTracks plus an additional order of 2 , the first of
which arrived in August 200 with delivery ending in 2020. RTD now has a total of 201 revenue
service vehicles.

LRT Maintenance Facility
The Mariposa facility is a heavy maintenance and overhaul facility for cars and major components.
The Elati facility is the operational facility with a capacity of 201 light rail vehicles. Mariposa is
also used for some vehicle storage and pull-out activity to accommodate future expansion.

Operations
OCC governs the operation, control, and dispatch of light rail vehicles. Control maintains contact
with the train operators by means of radio located in each light rail vehicle cab. Light rail
operators also carry a portable radio to be used while outside of the cab or in case of cab radio
failure. Controller/supervisors rove throughout the system during operations. Their role is to
provide support and coordination between OCC and light rail vehicle operators during an

H Line, 18th and California to Florida
L Line, 16th & Stout to 30th – Downing
R Line, Peoria to RidgeGate Parkway
W Line, Union Station to Jeffco Government Center

In the case of an accident or breakdown of the system, the controller will monitor movement and
control train movement using a manual block system. When necessary, buses are used in a
bridging procedure to move passengers around a trouble area.

System Power – Traction Power Substations and Overhead Catenary
System power for the light rail system includes two critical elements: traction power substations
(TPSS) and the overhead catenary wire. TPSSs are located approximately one mile apart along
the light rail alignment. Approximately 13,200 volts AC is fed to the TPSS. The TPSS converts
this feed to a nominal 750 volts DC and supplies the 750 volts DC to the overhead catenary
wire. Contact between the overhead wire and the LRV is through the LRV pantograph located
on the top of the LRV.
For incidents involving no damage to the overhead wire and no significant damage to the side
or top of the LRV, the incident can most likely be managed without removing power, i.e.,
without shutting down TPSS and without lowering the pantograph. For incidents with major
LRV damage, the pantograph should be lowered to remove electrical hazard from the LRV. If
an incident involves damage to the overhead wire or if the overhead wire and pantograph are
entangled, power should be removed in one of two ways: utilize emergency shut off located in
locked box on nearest TPSS, or request power removal from light rail OCC.
Light rail operations has four RTD operating facilities, which are active 24 hours a day, 365 days
a year, these facilities include:

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Annex D: Paratransit Services
The purpose of this Annex is to define the actions and roles necessary for the Paratransit
Division to participate in a coordinated response within the framework of the RTD Emergency
Operations Plan. This Annex provides guidance to groups within the Paratransit Division with a
general concept of potential emergency assignments before, during, and following emergency
or disaster situations.
The Paratransit Division is responsible for executing American with Disabilities Act of 1 0
(ADA) complementary paratransit services, branded Access-a-Ride. Access-a-Ride is a shared

established under the guidelines provided by the Federal Transit Administration. Trips on
Access-a-Ride may be used for any purpose. Reservations must be made one to seven days in
advance. There is no same-day Access-a-Ride service.
That said, RTD does support a same day user side subsidy program referred to as Access-onDemand. RTD subsidizes a portion of every on-demand trip requests which are scheduled by
the customer and directly with local transportation network companies and cab companies. The
participating vendors are Uber, Lyft, Metro Transportation and zTrip. For the purposes of this
report, Access-on-Demand will not be referenced as these vendors would not be in a position to
help during an emergency.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
A detailed review of each of these vendors are available in Appendices to this Annex A-C.

This Annex is a supplementary document to the RTD Emergency Operations Base Plan. The
RTD EOP will also include hazard specific Annexes to identify the actions to be taken for a
specific risk, hazard or emergency. This Annex will remain at an all-hazards level of planning
and shall identify the roles and responsibilities of the Paratransit Division and all subdivisions
thereof.

Organization and Assignment of Responsibilities
The primary role of the Paratransit Division is to liaise between the contractors and RTD to
prepare for, mitigate against, respond to, and recover from emergencies or disasters. The
positions described above shall participate according to their normal job responsibilities and as
assigned by the Senior Manager of Paratransit or their designee

Concept of Operations
The Paratransit Division shall participate in the larger ICS and will send qualified representatives
to the EOC upon request of the EOC Manager. The Senior Manager and Manager of Paratransit
Services shall be trained as incident commanders and will have the authority to make decisions
on scene.
The Paratransit Safety and Training Compliance Officer and Coordinator, Paratransit Eligibility
Program shall be trained as EOC representatives and will have access to leaders for any
decisions that need to be escalated but shall also have knowledge about available resources
and the authority to commit department resources. The priority of tasks will be determined
jointly with the EOC Manager in accordance with the overall planning effort for the emergency
or event.
The division will evaluate damage to facilities, mobilize staff and resources, prioritize restoration
of services based on resources available, and coordinate with other RTD departments/divisions.
The paratransit department will ensure that its subdivisions keep logs of actions taken and
information received.

Direction, Control, and Coordination
The Senior Manager of Paratransit Services will be responsible for overall direction of Paratransit
Division and shall coordinate with their EOC representative to facilitate information exchange
and resource management. If the Senior Manager of Paratransit Services is unavailable, the
chain of succession identified in the Continuity of Operations Plan will be followed, which is
duplicated here:
Manager of Paratransit Services
Paratransit Safety & Training Compliance Officer
Paratransit uality Control Supervisor

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

Planning Assumptions

Communication
First and foremost, all emergencies related to the Access-a-Ride service exclusively will be
relayed to the General Manager and CEO, Chief Operations Officer, and Chief Communications

70
Packet Pg. 527

2.17.C.b

and Engagement Officer by way of email and phone, when applicable. All emergencies which
are bought to the division’s attention for the purpose of providing assistance, will be
communicated to each participating service provider once the nature of the emergency and
required resources are identified. Communications to each service provider will begin by phone
and followed up with an email of understanding outlining the emergency and required
resources. In addition, for those events outside of the contractors’ or division’s ability to
address, Emergency Management will be brought in to coordinate.

Administration, Finance, and Logistics
The paratransit division shall be responsible for maintaining records on:

x Staffing levels and hours worked by employees on account of the
emergency/disaster.
x Damage incurred on relevant equipment/facilities/infrastructure as a result of the
emergency.
x Objectives of division when responding to emergencies and log of relevant
actions taken to accomplish.
This information will be provided to the EOC upon request.

Emergency Equipment on Revenue Vehicles
There are a total of 343 revenue service paratransit vehicles. Emergency equipment found on
these vehicles include:

1. Two-way radio
2. Fire extinguisher
3. Emergency first aid kit
4. Triangles
These vehicles are also equipped with various accessible features, such as:

1. Wheelchair Ramps and Lifts
Finally, each of the vehicles can hold up to 55 gallons of unleaded gasoline fuel.

Annex Development and Maintenance
It is the responsibility of the paratransit division to develop or update internal Standard
Operating Procedures to ensure its own operations capabilities. The Manager of Paratransit will
coordinate the planning of all Paratransit operations related to emergency operations.
The paratransit division also is committed to testing and continuous improvement of this plan
and will participate in exercises on a consistent basis, unless a real-world event or emergency
makes doing so unrealistic. After each exercise or emergency, the paratransit division will
participate in the After-Action Review process and will implement improvement plan items as
relevant.

Transdev has established an employee alarm system. Transdev uses the radio system, email,
and word of mouth.
Because we use a communication system as an alarm system, all emergency messages have

76
Packet Pg. 533

2.17.C.b

procedures precludes the Plan Administrator's authority in determining whether employees
should remain inside or evacuate.

Our emergency evacuation procedures and assignments are designed to respond to many
potential emergencies that require them, including:
Facility fires, Earthquakes, flooding that affects the facility’s safety and Chemical releases.
Employees need to know what to do if they are alerted to a specific emergency. After an alarm
is sounded to evacuate, employees should take the following steps:
Immediately evacuate their area to the designated rally point. Supervisors/shift leaders should
verbally inform any and all staff to evacuate.
Management and Supervisory personnel must perform facility sweeps to account for all
employees, visitors, contractors, or other persons know to have been in the facility during and
immediately following the evacuation.
Once evacuated, employees are to head toward their designated exterior or safe area, where a
head count will be performed, and further instructions given. Following is a list of exterior
refuges/safe zones:

Procedures to Account for Employees
Trained evacuation personnel assist in safe and orderly evacuation for all types of emergencies
that require evacuation. Once evacuation is complete, they conduct head counts. The
employees selected are trained in the complete workplace layout and the various alternative
escape routes from the workplace. Before leaving, these employees check rooms and other
enclosed spaces in the workplace for employees who may be trapped or otherwise unable to
evacuate the area. A report on the status of any persons unaccounted for should be given
immediately to emergency services upon their arrival. A list of trained personnel appears

Training
Transdev’s Plan Administrator reviews the Emergency Action Plan at the following times with
each employee covered by the plan:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Initially when the plan is developed,
whenever a new employee is hired,
whenever the employee is assigned initially to a job,
whenever an employee's responsibilities or designated actions under the plan change,
whenever new equipment, materials, or processes are introduced into the workplace,
whenever the layout or design or the facility changes, and
whenever the plan is changed.

The training includes the following:
Review of the plan, mock emergencies, and evacuation drills.
The information in this plan is not intended for casual reading but is intended to get the
appropriate message across. We present the material for training in the following manner:
•
•
•

Safety Meetings,
Senior Staff Meetings
Initial Training

The contents of this plan are communicated through a briefing delivered by supervisors
followed by a demonstration.
The contents of this plan are communicated through a presentation followed by a drill.
Transdev Services, Inc. performs drills for the following emergencies:
Any and all evacuation alarms. These drills are held at least annually.
After a drill, the Plan Administrator judges the effectiveness of the plan and reviews any
employee input concerning the drill. Employees performing the drill may identify something that
did not follow procedure or was ineffective. For example, they may discover doors that would
not open; they may enter storage closets instead of exiting; they may get lost and confused or
they may carry a suspicious package through the facility. These are the types of things the Plan
Administrator needs to hear about after a drill. That way, they can be addressed before a real
emergency.

Annex E: Capital Programs
The purpose of this Annex is to define the actions and roles necessary for the Capital Programs
Department to participate in a coordinated response within the framework of the RTD
Emergency Operations Plan. This Annex provides guidance to subdivisions within Capital
Programs with a general concept of potential emergency assignments before, during, and
following emergency or disaster situations.
RTD and its departments must plan for multiple emergency situation ranging from loss of track,
power, facilities, office space or major road detours. It is the responsibility for every
department/division to develop contingency plans.
The objective of this Annex is to elaborate on the Capital Programs Department role in meeting
the agency’s mission during times of emergency. The primary objective of Capital Programs is
to provide key personnel for restoring business functions at affected facilities and continue
providing critical services required for transit operations in an environment that is threatened,
diminished, or incapacitated.

Scope
This Annex applies to all staff, equipment, divisions/subdivisions, and operations of the Capital
Programs department and primarily describes the department’s emergency actions.

Situation Overview
Characteristics
Capital Programs is responsible for RTD’s transit system physical modifications and maintenance
for operational, and administrative buildings (Park-n-Rides, Stations, elevators and RTD owned
Real Property). A, B, and G Commuter Rail Lines and Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility are
maintained by Denver Transit Operators, under a concession agreement will RTD. Routine
maintenance of RTD operated rail alignments are by the respective rail maintenance groups.
Capital Programs undertakes larger projects that are beyond the capabilities of Rail
maintenance.
In addition to maintaining these assets, the daily maintenance duties include janitorial services,
groundskeeping, snow removal, contracted services, and implementation of a systematic
preventative maintenance programs. Capital Programs primary mission is to maintain RTD’s
infrastructure to support the Operations Department in transporting customers safely. The
secondary mission is to support the infrastructure needs of the rest of the agency. The district
wide maintenance needs are handled by three main subdivisions with support from Real
Property:

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
The engineering division is responsible for planning and engineering the extension, modification,
and major repairs of the RTD transit system. This division plans, and designs, improvements for
bridges, Park-n-Rides, Roadways, and Track work. Professional staff with special capabilities
contribute towards these efforts including: Architecture, Landscape, Urban Design, Civil,
Drainage, Lighting, Roadway, Structural, and Utilities.

Facilities
The facilities division is responsible for inspection and maintenance for all RTD operated
buildings. Specifically, the division is responsible for maintaining systems ranging from HVAC,

with Bike Amenity Improvements, Energy Retrofits, Painting, Furniture Repairs, Electrical
Upgrades, and Tenant Finish Improvements.

Rail Systems Engineering
The designing of system elements range from the overhead catenary poles and wire, traction
power stations, to communications and relay houses. Systems engineering is outsourced
with one project manager overseeing the contract. There is limited technical expertise
in-house in this area.

Real Property
The real property division is primarily responsible for acquisition and disposition
of all RTD properties. The division regularly interacts with the general public to manage the use
of RTD properties. In addition, this division works in conjunction with the engineering division
in providing inspection and permits for construction of private and public development projects
with the use of RTD’s right-of-way.

Mapping and Engineering Data
This division is responsible for surveying and mapping, responding to Utility Notification Center
for Colorado utility locate requests, reviewing and approving utility crossing designs, and
maintaining engineering information and mapping. This division maintains the Geographic
Information System (GIS) related to properties and utilities.

Facilities, and Manager, Contracted Maintenance will be trained as EOC representatives and will
have access to leaders for any decisions that need to be escalated, but shall also have
knowledge about available resources and the authority to commit department resources. The
department will evaluate damage to facilities, mobilize staff and resources, prioritize restoration
of services based on resources available and coordinate with other RTD departments/divisions.
Capital Programs will ensure that its subdivisions keep logs of actions taken and information
received. The priority of tasks will be determined jointly with the EOC Manager in accordance
with the overall planning effort for the emergency or event.

Organization and Assignment of Responsibilities
Prevention
x Utilization of Crime Prevention through Environmental Design principles when designing
new or changing infrastructure

Mitigation
x Participate in trainings, exercises and drills as requested
Response
x Liaise directly with first responders regarding facility hazards, layout, and any other
requested information
Recovery
x Facilities Maintenance and Facilities Engineering subdivisions will:
o If a facility is damaged, lead efforts to make facility operational again
x Engineering Division will:
o Conduct root cause analysis and resolve root cause if emergency occurs on Rail
corridors, Park-n-Ride, Stations or Bridges

Incidents could occur during duty and/or non-duty hours. The ability and timeliness to execute
the Capital Programs operating procedures is contingent upon factors associated with
occurrence of the events. In most cases, it is likely there will be a warning of at least a few
hours prior to an incident. Under these circumstances, the process of the activation will be more
planned including complete and orderly alert and notifications. The activation for the incidents
occurring with little to no warning and during duty hours is less routine and potentially more
difficult.

Direction, Control, and Coordination
The AGM Capital Programs will be responsible for the overall direction of the Department and
will coordinate with their EOC representative to facilitate information exchange and resource
management. If the AGM CP is unavailable, the order of succession will be:

RTD Emergency Operations Plan

Purpose
The purpose of this Annex is to define the actions and roles necessary for the RTD Transit
Police and Emergency Management Department to participate in a coordinated response within
the framework of the RTD Emergency Operations Plan. This Annex provides guidance to groups
within the Transit Police and Emergency Management Department with a general concept of
potential emergency assignments before, during, and following emergency or disaster
situations.
RTD Transit Police and Emergency Management Department division is responsible for Security,
Traffic Control, Arrests, First Aid-First Responders, Shelter Needs, Transportation Issues, Crime
Issues and Investigate any criminal matters.
Included in the Transit Police and Emergency Management Department is Emergency
Management, Video Investigations, Dispatch, Integrated Security and Technology Department,
and the RTD Transit Police Patrol Division.

Scope
The RTD Transit Police and Emergency Management Department will respond to an emergency
with appropriate resources from each of its divisions for emergencies to include a civil
disturbance, mass arrest, Law Enforcement related emergency event, a natural disaster and any
other emergency which would benefit from the use of a EOC activation. The RTD Transit Police
and Emergency Management Department will utilize all its resources to include mutual aid from
other police departments in the Denver Metro area.

Situation Overview
Characteristics
The RTD Transit Police and Emergency Management Department is located at 1 00 31St Street,
Denver, Colorado 80216, which is the main headquarters of the RTD Transit Police and
Emergency Management Department. At this location there are marked and unmarked patrol
vehicles, radios, less lethal weapons to include less lethal shotguns, Tasers and all computers
and laptops. The department also has two explosive detection dogs which roam the system to
identify any potential explosive materials, as well as respond to calls where explosives or
firearms crimes may be involved. All police personnel start shifts at this location, which includes
officers, corporals, sergeants, lieutenants, commanders, deputy chiefs and chief. The roles and
responsibilities of the RTD Transit Police are to:
x Enforce state law
x Conduct criminal investigations
x File reports

Included at this location is Video Investigations which utilizes surveillance cameras to view any
situation on RTD property. Video Investigations also utilizes computers and cell phones. The
roles and responsibilities of video investigations is to conduct video surveillance, conduct video
investigations and to complete reports on the investigations.
Emergency Management is also included at this location who utilizes computers, cell phones,
policies, and plans for emergency situations. The roles and responsibilities of emergency
management are to respond to and coordinate during emergency events, maintain emergency
plans, develop and serve as the EOC manager during activations of the emergency operations
center, and organize and conduct emergency preparedness training, exercises, and drills.
Transit Police Communications (TPC) has two locations. The District 1 dispatch center is
located at 1205 W 7th Avenue, Denver, Colorado 80204. The District 2 dispatch center is located
at 701 W 48th Avenue, Denver, Colorado 80216. The roles and responsibilities are to:
x Manage public safety related communications, including, but not limited to receiving
emergency and non-emergency safety and security-related phone calls and electronic
communications from the public
x Track and dispatch RTD police and security assets to emergency and non-emergency
incidents
x Request and coordinate assistance from outside agencies, including law enforcement,
fire, medical, and other first responders, and serving as the point of contact for these
agencies

Also at the 1205 W 7th Ave location is the Integrated Security and Technology Department
which monitor and maintains functionality for all RTD properties’ security technology and video
surveillance.

Planning Assumptions
All hazards that utilize an EOC, shall provide a strategic response by all members and assigns
specific responsibilities in the event a plan is activated. The plan is based on the concept that
emergency response functions will generally parallel the normal operations of all RTD
departments and divisions. To the extent possible, the same employees will be utilized in both
cases. Those day-to-day functions which would not contribute to emergency operations may be
suspended for the duration of the emergency and recovery period. Resources not normally
required for a day-to-day operation may be redirected to accomplish emergency tasks.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Annex G: Winter Weather Annex
The purpose of the Winter Weather Annex is to identify those planning considerations specific
to Winter Weather and the planning considerations to effectively manage events. Winter
Weather includes snow storms, blowing snow, blizzards (snow storms with wind speeds above
35 mph), ice storms, sleet, freezing rain, and extreme cold. Elements of this plan may also be
useful for hail events.

Situation Overview
The Denver Metropolitan area sees average first freeze dates in September-October with final
freeze dates falling in April-May. This means that the Agency is exposed to the potential for
winter weather events for about 8 months of the year.
Geographic Risk
All of the service area is exposed to winter weather risk, areas with increased elevation will be
exposed to lower temperatures and higher precipitation totals. Where Denver sees an average
seasonal snowfall of 56. ”, Evergreen and Nederland saw 113” and 194” inches of snowfall in
the 2020-2021 season respectively. These are two municipalities served by bus service and
whose routes are subject to chain law and may need to apply them upon requirement by
CDOT.
Potential Impacts
Impacts of Winter Weather can range in severity:
x Reduced Visibility
x Slick pavement on roads, sidewalks, and at stations
x Increased Travel Times
x Delays in scheduled headways and arrival times
x Decrease in available staffing
x Ice in rail switches or building up around overhead catenary systems
x Damage to permanent infrastructure
x Buses becoming stuck in snow/ice/slush and requiring retrieval
x Vehicular accidents with privately-owned vehicles
x Power Failure at fixed facilities or to power stations along rail alignment
These impacts may culminate to trigger a system-wide service suspension. A decision to
suspend service may only be made by the General Manager/CEO or their designee.
Mitigations in Place
Mitigations are currently taken at the operational level and are described below:

Step-well heaters on LRV’s to prevent icing on doors
Switch heaters at interlockings to prevent icing
Maintenance of protective equipment to mitigate impacts of winter weather

Planning Assumptions

x Typically advance notice is available for winter weather events. When advance
notice is available, planning will begin when predictions indicate significant
impacts.
x This advance notice will also be communicated via Situational Awareness Update,
published by Emergency Management before event initiation and updated
periodically as needed.
x Supplies for winter weather response will be procured seasonally in anticipation
of winter weather events. Maintenance on specialized equipment shall also be
conducted seasonally to remain in a state of readiness
x It is not typically the responsibility of RTD to perform snow removal on
municipal, state, and federal roads. This is done by the local authorities and
supported by RTD on an agreement basis

Concept of Operations
Detection/Monitoring
Winter Weather events will be monitored by Emergency Management via updates provided by
the National Weather Service and CDOT. When greater than 3” of snow are forecasted OR a
watch or warning has been declared, this information will be shared with the RTD workforce at
large.
Response Considerations
Because Winter Weather is typical in RTD’s Service Area, response will be managed by the
operational groups responsible for their execution. These actions are outlined in several
publications produced annually:

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

x Maintenance of snow removal specialty equipment and procure services for
contract snow removal
x Pre-plan in coordination with local partners such as Downtown Denver
Partnership, CDOT, Boulder, Boulder County, and the City and County of Denver
to perform snow removal at specified locations

For those events which overwhelm the ability of normal operations to maintain safe operating
conditions, the Emergency Operations Center will be activated to monitor and support
operations. Upon activation, the EOC Manager will supply regular updates to the General
Manager/CEO to support their situational awareness and decision making.
Suspension of Service is the final measure taken to address unsafe conditions related to winter
weather events. This decision is not taken lightly and must be made with adequate
consideration to factors such as:
x Safety of RTD staff and customers—Is it safe to continue providing service?
x Weather Conditions and forecast—What is the character of precipitation? Are
conditions worsening? Will there be some stall in precipitation/storm conditions
which will provide an opportunity to change tactic?

x Predictability for customers—Eg. Agency must provide service during PM peak
hours if AM peak hours service were conducted, ability to communicate to
customers changes being made
x Staffing availability— Communication centers, groups with winter weather impact
response responsibilities, and the availability for relief to transport themselves to
their work reporting location
x Rate of revenue service vehicles becoming stuck or stalled— Can support
functions recover vehicles more quickly than they are becoming stuck?
Recovery Considerations
Service Restoration post-suspension will also be decided upon by the General Manager/CEO and
will generally be communicated to the public in advance. This ideally would take place at the
start of the next service day.
The impacts of a severe winter weather event may take over a week to fully address. This
includes snow removal, de-icing, and damage assessment. These activities may need to be
conducted iteratively.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Annex H: Flood Annex
The purpose of the Flood Annex is to identify those planning considerations specific to flooding
events and the planning considerations to effectively manage events. Flooding is defined as any
overflow of water onto normally dry land. Flash flooding is also possible which is flooding that
occurs with little or no warning.

Situation Overview
Flooding is the most common disaster cause across the United States. Flooding can originate
from coastal flooding, riverine flooding, or excess precipitation; coastal flooding is not a concern
within RTD’s service area and instead is generally replaced by annual snowmelt hazards from
the mountains which will result in riverine flooding.
Geographic Risk
FEMA publishes Flood Maps identifying areas with 1% annual chance of flooding and 0.02%
annual chance of flooding, also known as 100 year floodplain and 500 year floodplain
respectively. RTD has rail and bus routes that traverse both types of floodplains as can be seen
in Figure 1.

While flooding is generally predictable, human intervention and water management
infrastructure can fail and cause flooding in places that are outside of the floodplain.
Potential Impacts
Impacts of flooding can range in severity:
x Bus detours to avoid flooded areas, resulting in increased travel times
x Flooded rail alignments, with potential to cause damage to infrastructure
x Water can potentially short circuit rail, causing gates to malfunction, impacting
service and causing a need for manual flagging at intersections or switches
x Decrease in available staffing
x Vehicles becoming stuck in flooded areas or before traversing flooded areas
x Damage to vehicle components, with possibility to cause arc-flash on LRV. This
can cause the LRV to become disabled on tracks
x Vehicular accidents with privately-owned vehicles
x Requests to support evacuation or emergency responders
x Increased traffic due to evacuation from affected areas

Mitigations in Place
Mitigations against the impacts of flooding are in place at several levels.

110
Packet Pg. 567

2.17.C.b

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
x Facilities must be built outside of the 100 year floodplain. When a location is
selected that is within the floodplain, physical mitigations will be added to the
building design such as elevating the foundation’s footprint
x Drainage maintenance for facilities and stations, including participation in
inspections from local jurisdictions to ensure proper compliance with local
ordinances
x Pumps are included as part of design in elevator pits whereby there is an
increased flood risk

Bus Operations

x Flood avoidance training, including when to stop the bus and not traverse
through a flooded area. Bus Operators are trained that conventional buses can
traverse approximately 1 foot depth of water.
x Repair to flooded engines to ensure proper functioning

Rail Operations

x Training to avoid flooded areas, LRV operators are trained that the LRV can
traverse though up to 3 inches of water above the railhead while CRV conductors
are trained that the CRV can traverse through 2 inches of water above the
railhead. Generally operators should not traverse through water if the railhead is
not visible
x Repair to flooded LRV’s
x Elevated rail on ballast to prevent standing water on rail. Most of the rail system
is built this way, with embedded rail in downtown areas being the exception

Planning Assumptions

x Advance warning is not always available for flooding events, especially flash
flooding

x When Flood Watches or Warnings are declared this information will be shared via
situational awareness update. Planning will begin when predictions indicate
significant impacts
x It is not typically the responsibility of RTD to clear debris resulting from flooding
off of RTD property
x Flooding may displace individuals who require evacuation. RTD will collaborate
with local jurisdictions on a case-by-case basis according to resource availability
x Because flood events can escalate quickly, it is important to maintain diligent
monitoring and to be proactive with making decisions to evacuate assets from
areas that may become impacted by flooding, especially due to the staff
credentialing requirements to safely move buses and rail vehicles

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Detection/Monitoring
Flooding events will be monitored by Emergency Management via updates provided by the
National Weather Service and Colorado Department of Transportation. When a watch or
warning has been declared, this information will be shared with the RTD workforce at large.
Response Considerations
Not all flooding events have significant impact to RTD and can be managed by the
communications centers and street or field supervision staff. For those events which overwhelm
the ability of normal operations to maintain safe operating conditions, the Emergency
Operations Center will be activated to monitor and support operations. Upon activation, the
EOC Manager will provide regular updates to the General Manager/CEO to support their
situational awareness and decision making.
Detours and cancellation of certain routes may need to be implemented, though full system
service suspension is unlikely.
Recovery Considerations
The impacts of a flooding event may take over a week to fully address. This includes debris
removal, drainage restoration, and damage assessment. These activities may need to be
conducted iteratively.
If significant fleet impacts occurred, maintenance and restoration could cause service
restrictions that would last until a normal operating fleet was restored. This could take weeks or
months to fully restore.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Purpose
The purpose of the Wildfire Annex is to identify those planning considerations specific
to wildland fire events and the planning considerations to effectively manage events. A
wildfire is an unplanned, wildland fire and can be caused by human-caused fires,
escaped wildland fire use events, escaped prescribed fire projects, and natural causes
such as lighting strikes. For the RTD service area, interface fires that abut the
wildland/urban boundary are more likely to have significant impacts. High wind speeds
can also impact the direction or speed of wildfire spread.
Situation Overview
Wildfire one of the top hazards at the state level, triggering the majority of Colorado
emergency declarations, though the majority of these are not in areas served by RTD.
This is not the case for the costliest emergency declaration in the state’s history relative
to structure damage, The Marshall Fire in Boulder County of 2021. RTD provided some
assistance for the recovery efforts relating to this fire.
Geographic Risk

Areas with significant vegetation are at most risk for wildland fires. This generally
concentrates the geographic risk to wildland fire within the western and southern parts
of the service area, especially Boulder, Jefferson, and parts of Arapahoe and Douglas
counties. The Colorado State Forest Service maintains an interactive Wildfire Risk
Viewer on their website. Figures 1 and 2 are snapshots of the risk to both wildland fire
in general, and the Wildland Urban Interface Risk for the RTD service area.

bridging on detour for rail suspension
Increased traffic due to evacuation from affected areas
Power failure caused by damaged power delivery infrastructure
Requests to support evacuation or emergency responders
Buildings, facilities, landscape, and irrigation damaged by heat, fire, or smoke

Mitigations in Place

Mitigations against the impacts of wildfire are in place at several levels.

x Practice fire drills for facilities and maintenance shops to allow for safe
evacuation of buildings

Capital Programs

x Green space management to cut back overgrown vegetation on RTD owned
properties, either with in-house staff or through contract
x Remove and deter encampments of people experiencing houselessness on RTD
owned properties, in partnership with law enforcement personnel

Rail Operations

x Weed control schedule to prevent overgrowth along alignment, performed by
MOW for LR and MOW & I for CR

Planning Assumptions

x Advance warning is not always available for wildfire events
x When fires are observed or under management in the service area this
information will be shared via situational awareness update. Planning will begin
when predictions indicate significant impacts
x Wildfire may displace individuals who require evacuation. RTD will collaborate
with local jurisdictions on a case-by-case basis according to resource availability
x Smoke inhalation is one of the risks presented by wildfire. While air quality
monitoring has become routine for Colorado in recent years, the risk escalates
the closer an individual or community is to the fire. This risk will be taken into
consideration when planning detours or for additional assistance provided by the
agency to maintain operator and customer safety
x While other events may create conditions that are appropriate to respond to
during the event, wildfires frequently require a full evacuation of the impacted
area until the fire can be controlled. This may prevent mid event maintenance,
repair, or damage assessment until the area is cleared by fire professionals

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

Impacts of wildfire can range in severity:

Packet Pg. 574

2.17.C.b

RTD Emergency Operations Plan

Concept of Operations
Detection/Monitoring

Wildfire events will be monitored by Emergency Management via updates provided by
the National Weather Service, Colorado Department of Transportation, and Colorado
Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. Though elevated risk
levels will not generally be communicated, upon notification of a named fire being
managed, this information will be shared through a Situational Awareness Update.
Response Considerations

Not all wildfire events have significant impact on or to RTD and can be managed by the
communications centers and street or field supervision staff. For those events which
overwhelm the ability of normal operations to maintain safe operating conditions, the
Emergency Operations Center will be activated to monitor and support operations. Upon
activation, the EOC Manager will provide regular updates to the General Manager/CEO
to support their situational awareness and decision making.
Detours and cancellation of certain routes may need to be implemented, though full
system service suspension is unlikely. If the fire is not affecting a rail alignment directly,
the operators and engineers may be instructed to turn off their ventilation systems
momentarily to prevent smoke entering the cab but to continue to serve the route.
Recovery Considerations

The impacts of a wildfire event may take a long time to fully address. This includes
debris removal, damage assessment, and possibly reconstruction. These activities may
need to be conducted iteratively.
If significant fleet impacts occurred, maintenance and restoration could cause service
restrictions that would last until a normal operating fleet was restored. This could take
weeks or months to fully restore.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Purpose
The purpose of the Active Assailant Annex is to identify those planning considerations
specific to risks and impacts from an Active Assailant and the planning considerations to
effectively manage events. The FBI definition of an Active Assailant is “an individual
engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area.” They go on further
to specify that firearms are the most common weapon used, but others are also
possible, including knives, clubs, explosives, or any other implement used with the
intention of harming others.
Situation Overview
Active Assailant events are becoming more common across the US, with a 57
increase in average incidents per year from 2000-2010 and a 53 increase from 20102020 to 2021-2022. The highest casualties from active assailant events are at
businesses open to the public, which also is the location with the second highest
fatalities behind open spaces, which are public or private properties openly accessible to
the public. Except for maintenance facilities, RTD properties mostly fall within these two
categories. Due to the increasing nature of active assailant events, it is important to
plan, train, and exercise for active assailant.
Geographic Risk

Risk from an active assailant event is not defined geographically but rather follows
trends of the locations that tend to be targeted. Some features which raise the risk of a
location being targeted by an active assailant include:
x High volume of population, especially populations who are perceived as being
‘easy’ targets
x Low security measures, including access controls, identification measures,
surveillance, presence of security or sworn officers

Potential Impacts

Impacts of active assailant events can range in severity, these are generally ranked
from lowest to highest severity:

2.17.C.b

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Concept of Operations
RTD-PD and Emergency Management are in communication with partner law
enforcement agencies, including the Colorado Information Analysis Center (CIAC) who
are actively monitoring social media, internet/darkweb sources, and other sources to
identify individuals or groups that may be planning violent or destructive actions. If a
threat is identified, Police and Emergency Management staff will communicate with their
chain of command and create a communication plan to include all relevant parties. Due
to the nature of active assailant events, information about potential threats is not public
information and must be handled with all due care and consideration.
Response Considerations

The response efforts for active assailant events are typically not long-lived in nature,
with most active shooter events lasting no more than 5 minutes, which is normally
constrained by the time for first responders to arrive. Short-term recovery efforts are
generally much longer lasting with patient reunification and survivor support lasting
days or weeks.
Not all active assailant events have significant impact to RTD and can be managed by
the communications centers and street or field supervision staff, especially those events
occurring near but not on agency property. For those events which overwhelm the
ability of normal operations to maintain safe operating conditions, the Emergency
Operations Center will be activated to monitor and support operations. Upon activation,
the EOC Manager will supply regular updates to the General Manager/CEO to support
their situational awareness and decision making.
In general, the guidance for individuals who find themselves in an active assailant
incident is to follow the “Run, Hide, Fight” guidance. This enhances the lockdown
procedures that many organizations had adopted and places agency with the individual
to decide the most effective course of action in the moment and with their skillset.
‘Run’ refers to evacuating away from the assailant. Once an individual is in a safe
location, they should notify authorities of the event and provide any information they
have about weaponry, suspect, or hostages.
‘Hide’ is preferential if evacuation is not an option. There are strategies one can learn to
barricade a room more effectively, which may deter the assailant from spending time to
gain entry. Once an individual has barricaded themselves into a room, do not open the
door for anyone but police and if possible, confirm with 11 dispatch that it is police
outside the door. When active assailant incidents occur, one should try to hide behind
cover which could prevent projectiles passing through.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

Detection/Monitoring

‘Fight’ is a last resort and should only be used if an individual is confident that they will
be able to react effectively to the assailant. This may be more effective with groups
deciding together to fight, but injuries should be expected. Some people will not feel

123
Packet Pg. 580

2.17.C.b

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
“Run, Hide, Fight” actions may need to be modified for individuals employed by RTD
based upon their position and the activity for which they are currently engaged. The
primary objective of a Light Rail operator/Commuter Rail engineer is to stop the vehicle
and provide a PA announcement for customers to evacuate. The conductor on a moving
commuter rail trains will also direct customers to evacuate to a different car, away from
the assailant. Communication with OCC/Control should always be maintained.
On buses, operators are individually responsible for the security and safety of their
vehicles and customers. Bus operators are empowered to use their own discretion to
protect themselves and customers. The judgement of the operator in the immediate
circumstances of the attack will be critical and the decision to act in each unique
situation ultimately falls to the operator. No agency policy can or should dictate an
operator’s response. This can include making decisions about the next safest location to
stop the vehicle and evacuating customers.
Detours and cancellation of certain routes may need to be implemented. If intelligence
information indicates that a threat has not been resolved or that multiple actors may be
targeting the agency and its modes of transportation, then a full-service suspension
may be requested by local law enforcement agencies. This decision can be made by the
communication centers or Transit Police. All due effort will be made to inform the
General Manager/CEO, though the time sensitive nature of these events may preclude
such an effort.
Recovery Considerations

RTD is not well-equipped to address the needs of patient reunification and survivor
support and will partner with local jurisdictions in these short term recovery efforts. This
partnership will include information sharing, staffing any EOC or JIC that may be stood
up, or personnel support needs.
Service restoration will occur when law enforcement officials have given indication that
it is safe for operators to resume service. This may include detours to avoid sites of
investigation or other security concerns. This will be communicated with the public
through all available channels.
The impacts of an active assailant event may take a long time to fully address. This
includes debris removal, damage assessment, and possibly reconstruction. These
activities may need to be conducted iteratively.

empowered to fight, and it is their right to decide which of the actions to take, based
upon their judgement.

response decisions for RTD cybersecurity incidents. This is a functional role; the CIRT Lead is
always a member of the CIRT, however, the specific person assuming the role of CIRT Lead
may vary depending on the nature and scope of the incident.
Cybersecurity Operations Centerџ The Cybersecurity Operations Center (CSOC) is responsible
for the monitoring, detection, and initial analysis of RTD cybersecurity events. CSOC analysts
intake and categorize user and Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) reported incidents

and issues and perform classification and/or coordination, analysis, and recovery activities. The
CSOC is an extension of RTD’s internal Cybersecurity Team.
IT Service Deskџ The IT Service Desk is the initial intake point for reports of incidents or
suspicious activity, creates tracking tickets, and engages the CIRT members that are needed to
respond to an incident. For complex incidents, the IT Service Desk additionally helps coordinate
communications among the CIRT members.
Business Process Ownerџ The business process owner is the lead or manager of the primary
business process that is impacted by the incident. The business process owner typically controls
the day-to-day access to, business use of, and appropriate operation of a computerized
business system. The business process owner provides support to the CIRT by providing
information and coordinating access and outages. The business process owner is also
responsible for understanding and addressing any legal, contractual, or regulatory incident
reporting requirements (e.g., data breach requirements) that are relevant to the system or the
type of data it contains.

Supporting Stakeholders
The following groups may provide support to the CIRT based on the context and nature of the
incident.

x System Administrators: System administrators are technical experts with
specialized skills and intimate knowledge of RTD technology. Enterprise system
administrators are typically members of the IT division; however, other system
administrators also exist within RTD. If applicable, system administrators coordinate
activities with vendors supporting the technology base.
x General Counsel: Provides guidance to ensure compliance with local, state, and
federal laws, and industry regulatory requirements (Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI), credit card brands, etc.). Provides advice if there is reason
to believe that an incident may have legal ramifications, including evidence
collection, prosecution of a suspect, or a lawsuit. If an employee is implicated in the
incident, coordinates with Human Resources and provides advice, including
appropriate internal investigations.
x Transit Police: Immediately notified if the CIRT determines or suspects imminent
danger to people or criminal activity. Provides oversight and assistance during
incidents involving criminal activity. Provides physical security to CIRT members as
otherwise requested.
x Human Resources: Provides assistance if an incident directly involves an
employee or employee data (e.g., employee is the victim of the incident or is
suspected of causing the incident). This may include, but is not limited to,
assistance with disciplinary action or counseling, and employee termination.
x Communications: Responsible for handling public relations needs (e.g., media
inquiries, press releases, or public statements). Depending on the nature and
impact of the incident, Communications may need to confer with other parties in
the incident response process (CIRT, senior management, legal, etc.) to ensure
public statements comply with constraints imposed by business, security, and law

End Users: Participate in annual awareness training and immediately report all
suspicious activity or observed incidents through ServiceNow. Where implicated in
an incident, cooperate with the CIRT’s investigation.
4.1 PROCEDURE
As defined in NIST 800-61, the Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, the incident
response procedure encompasses six phases: preparation, detection, analysis, containment,
eradication, and recovery. The dynamic relationship between those phases is highlighted in the
figure below.

The integration of these steps with RTD’s Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan aids in
addressing compliance with Transit Security Administration (TSA) Security Directive 1582- 2101. Section 4 will detail the integration of these six phases for incident response at RTD.

4.1 PREPARATION

Cybersecurity Awareness Training
The Cybersecurity Incident Response policy requires all employees and contractors to
participate in annual cybersecurity awareness training. This training shall include, at minimum,
learning activities focused on recognizing and avoiding common types of end- user
cybersecurity incidents (e.g., credential theft, malware, and phishing or other social engineering
attacks). Additionally, users receive training on how to report incidents through ServiceNow.
All employees, contractors, or any agency representative with RTD email accounts shall
participate in training once per calendar year. New members will be enrolled in training within
30 days of employment start date and shall complete training within 30 days of enrollment
date.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
The Senior Managers who have oversight of technology systems and incident response
stakeholders shall appoint members to the CIRT. The CIRT shall comprise at least one primary
and one alternate member for each critical technology function supported by the team. The
CIRT members, or their management, shall provide both business hours and off- hours contact
information for the CIRT members (e.g., a call list, escalation tree, primary number, or
rotation). The responsible senior manager shall review CIRT membership at least annually or as
members change roles or leave RTD. The senior manager shall provide an updated contact list
to the IT Service Desk when changes are made.
CIRT Contact information: CIRT Contact and Escalation

CIRT Training
The CIRT shall participate in annual incident response training and incident response testing
exercises related to their supported technologies. Supporting stakeholders may participate in
training or testing at the invitation of the CIRT or as necessary to meet business needs but are
not required to participate in annual training or testing.

Supporting Procedural and Technical Tools and Resources
The following resources are critical to an appropriate, timely, and well-documented response
and shall remain available in case of an incident:

x RTD’s standard communication toolset, including the ServiceNow ticketing system
and designated rooms or bridge lines for incidents occurring on platforms such as
Microsoft Teams
x Incident response runbooks, playbooks, wiki pages, or other standard procedures,
forms, decision trees, and checklists (as exist). These living documents are
maintained by the CIRT and are adapted based on the CIRT’s experience and
changes in industry best practices. These should be available in physical copies, on
the N drive, and in the cloud on sites such as Microsoft Teams and Microsoft
office365
x RTD published security policies, procedures, and best practices
x Contingency procedures designed and endorsed by the business process owner
Optionally, equipment used to capture information and perform system analysis may be helpful
in determining the root causes of an incident and/or capturing information for future forensic
analysis.

4.2 DETECTION AND REPORTING
4.2 Detection Method

Tier 1 support is provided by Critical Start, RTD’s MSSP. Security events are monitored, and
alerts are triaged and investigated appropriately. Alerts that require additional investigation are
escalated to Tier 2, RTD’s Cybersecurity Operations Center.

RTD Cybersecurity Operations Center (CSOC)
Escalated alerts from the MSSP are handed off to RTD for Tier 2 support and are investigated
further. A ServiceNow ticket is opened for any alerts that require remediation. Refer to
Classification section below regarding impact and criticality. Additionally, threat hunting is
conducted across several data sets to proactively search for anomalies in the environment that
may be a threat.

Internal Staff
Cybersecurity incidents may also be reported by internal staff via ServiceNow. Technical
administrators may identify an issue with their system, for example, or end users may report a
phishing email.

4.2.1 Reporting Method
Employees, contractors, and agency representatives shall open a Service Desk ticket to report
cyber-related incidents. Employees and contractors may contact the Service Desk via:

x

Create ServiceNow ticket via Email: servicedesk rtd-denver.com
Email the Service Desk team: servicedeskteam rtd-denver.com
For urgent incidents, employees, contractors, and agency representatives shall additionally
notify the IT Service Desk and appropriate CIRT member (if known) by phone. If emergency
response is required to contain the threat, in addition to creating a ticket, the IT Service Desk or
CIRT member immediately notifies the business process owner to start communications and
business continuity procedures.

4.2.2 Documentation and Routing
The IT Service Desk shall ensure that each incident report is documented in an IT Service
Ticket. The IT Service Desk or CIRT may bundle multiple reports related to the same incident
into a single ticket. If the ticket contains sensitive information, the IT Service Desk shall ensure
that access to the details is limited to those with a need-to-know.

Additional considerations for severe incidents
Certain severe incidents may require more delegation and communications than normal. For
example, the CIRT Lead may need to form additional teams to cover Communications, Business
Continuity, Technical and Operational functions. This will likely require further delegation of
authority to designated leads and setting up call bridges and/or Microsoft Team sites. These
functional leads will be in close communications with the CIRT lead.
In the event of a serious breach, Cybersecurity will reach out to RTD Risk Management for
direction on engagement with the agency’s cyber insurance. Additionally, for incidents that are
complex and warrant root cause analysis or forensics, a third-party consultant may be engaged
to utilize RTD’s Incident Retainer, as of 2023 RTD retains Mandiant for this service.

Containment
Containment is maintaining control of the affected system(s) and surrounding environment and
preventing an incident from causing further damage. It may be technical (e.g., removing the
affected system from the network) or non-technical (e.g., working with supporting stakeholders
and the business process owner to identify strategies to manage customer impacts).
If an intruder’s actions are rapid, destructive, and/or spreading, the CIRT Lead shall authorize
the CIRT’s immediate action to contain the threat, including actions that could be disruptive to
business operations or public service. Examples may include:
x
x
x
x

Disconnecting IT networks impacting fare collections and business operations
Shutting down servers disrupting rail operations
Isolating systems supporting paratransit operations
Restricting networks impacting critical back office and administrative functions

General Guidance for Containment Governance
Any containment actions that will significantly disrupt RTD’s operations or ability to achieve its
strategic priorities, shall require prior approval by the General Manager and CEO.
For other less disruptive containment directives, the CIRT Lead shall seek prior approval from
affected Chiefs or Assistant General Managers (AGM), but if they are unavailable after best
effort attempts, these actions do not require process owner or leadership approval.
After containment actions are performed, the CIRT will stand-up a Communications Call Bridge
to provide real-time updates to RTD’s Leadership Team and affected stakeholders. A
notification with call-in information will be sent to the business stakeholders and leadership
within 15 minutes of containment directives being issued.
Specific requirements for the approval of containment actions will be defined in the Containment
Procedures.
4.5.1 Containment Procedures
To facilitate timely containment of cybersecurity attacks, each of the following containment
procedures should be documented and annually reviewed for accuracy.
Each procedure should include provisions for the designation of different approval methods
depending on the impact and scope of the incident, if applicable.
Each procedure will need to be signed and approved by the associated department’s Chief or
AGM.

Eradication

Eradication involves removing the identified threat from the environment. In order to ensure
that the threat is completely removed, additional threat mitigation actions may need to be taken
to prevent immediate reoccurrence and reduce the chances of future reoccurrence of the
incident.
In the event of a major incident, a cybersecurity forensics firm should be engaged to ensure
that the threat has been completely eradicated.

Evidence Gathering
Critical incidents often require evidence gathering to resolve the incident; however, it may also
be needed for legal proceedings. It’s important to document how all evidence, including
compromised systems, have been preserved. A detailed log should be kept for all evidence,
including the following:

Recovery
Recovery involves testing and restoring the systems to normal operation, and remediating
vulnerabilities to prevent similar incidents (e.g., restoring systems from clean backups,
rebuilding systems from scratch, replacing compromised files with clean versions, installing
patches, changing passwords, tightening network security, increasing logging and monitoring
levels).
To ensure the integrity and security of backed-up data and systems, the following measures
must be considered and implemented where technically feasible:

x

Backups should be secured and maintained offline

x

Procedures are documented so that when data backups are made, they are scanned by
security software to check that it is free of malicious artifacts

x

Procedures are documented so that when backups are tested for restoration, they are
scanned by security software to check that it is free of malicious artifacts

Incident Closure
This step involves documenting and communicating closure of the incident to all involved
stakeholders.
4.6 POST-INCIDENT REVIEW
Following a major incident, the CIRT Lead schedules a meeting with the CIRT and any other
individuals who participated in the incident response to discuss the following:
Root Cause Detail
The root cause of the incident should be identified and detailed, including the technical and nontechnical causes of the incident using a standard methodology.
Lessons Learned
Identify what went well during the incident response, so that those procedures or techniques
can be repeated, and areas for improvement, so those procedures can be revised or additional
support can be obtained. A post-incident report (PIR) shall be completed at this time. To
facilitate the PIR, collect the following information:
x

A timeline of activities taken by RTD from when the incident was discovered, to
recovery

x

Were documented procedures followed? Why or why not?

6 Ransomware Specific Response Guidelines
Section 6 serves as a CIRT reference for responding to ransomware attacks.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

RTD Emergency Operations Plan

6.1 Ransomware Detection and Analysis
1. Determine which systems were impacted, and immediately isolate them.

146
Packet Pg. 603

2.17.C.b

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
x If taking the network temporarily offline is not immediately possible, locate the
network (e.g., Ethernet) cable and unplug affected devices from the network or
remove them from Wi-Fi to contain the infection.
x After an initial compromise, malicious actors may monitor an organization’s activity
or communications to understand if their actions have been detected. Be sure to
isolate systems in a coordinated manner and use out-of-band communication
methods like phone calls or other means to avoid tipping off actors that they have
been discovered and that mitigation actions are being undertaken. Not doing so
could cause actors to move laterally to preserve their access—already a common
tactic—or deploy ransomware widely prior to networks being taken offline.
Note: Step 2, which follows, will prevent from maintaining ransomware infection artifacts
and potential evidence stored in volatile memory. It should be carried out only if it is not
possible to temporarily shut down the network or disconnect affected hosts from the
network using other means.

2. Only in the event devices cannot be disconnected from the network, power them
down to avoid further spread of the ransomware infection.
Containment actions should prioritize RTD’s most critical assets. Should initial containment
fail, consider asset and business service prioritization when performing disruptive proactive
actions, as follows:

a) Disconnect Windows domain controllers
b) Disconnect network backups
c) Disconnect firewall and network connections into commuter rail
d) Disconnect firewall and network connections into light rail
e) Disconnect Ticket Vending Machines (TVM) and supporting VPN connections
f) Disconnect core switches isolating user and data center environments
g) Disconnect internet connections
3. Triage impacted systems for restoration and recovery.
x Identify and prioritize critical systems for restoration and confirm the nature of
data housed on impacted systems.
x Prioritize restoration and recovery based on a predefined critical asset list that
includes information systems critical for health and safety, revenue generation,
or other critical services, as well as systems they depend on.
x

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

x If several systems or subnets appear impacted, take the network offline at the switch
level. It may not be feasible to disconnect individual systems during an incident.

eep track of systems and devices that are not perceived to be impacted so they
can be deprioritized for restoration and recovery. This enables the organization

Packet Pg. 604

2.17.C.b

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
to get back to business in a more efficient manner.

5. Using the contact information below, engage internal and external teams and
stakeholders with an understanding of what they can provide to help mitigate,
respond to, and recover from the incident.
x Share the information on hand to receive the most timely and relevant
assistance. eep the leadership team and senior managers informed via regular
updates as the situation develops. Relevant stakeholders may include the IT
department, managed security service providers, the cyber insurance company,
and departmental or elected leaders.
x Consider requesting assistance from CISA; MS-ISAC; and local, state, or federal
law enforcement (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI and U.S. Secret
Service USSS ).
x As appropriate, coordinate with communications and public relations personnel
to ensure that accurate information is shared internally with the organization
and externally with the public.
x The Public Power Cyber Incident Response Playbook
(https://www.publicpower.org/system/files/documents/Public-Power-CyberIncident-Response-Playbook.pdf) contains guidance for organizational
communication procedures as well as templates for cyber incident holding
statements for public consumption. Work with the team to develop similar
procedures and draft holding statements as soon as possible, as developing this
documentation during an incident is not optimal. This will allow the organization
to reach consensus, in advance, on what level of detail is appropriate to share
within the organization and with the public, and how information will flow.
Ransomware Containment and Eradication

If no initial mitigation actions appear possible:
1. Take a system image and memory capture of a sample of affected devices (e.g.,
workstations and servers). Additionally, collect any relevant logs as well as samples
of any “precursor” malware binaries and associated observables or indicators of
compromise (e.g., suspected command and control IP addresses, suspicious registry
entries, or other relevant files detected).
x Take care to preserve evidence that is highly volatile in nature—or limited in
retention—to prevent loss or tampering (e.g., system memory, Windows
Security logs, data in firewall log buffers).

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

4. Confer with the team to develop and document an initial understanding of what has
occurred based on initial analysis.

148
Packet Pg. 605

2.17.C.b

RTD Emergency Operations Plan

To continue taking steps to contain and mitigate the incident:
1. Research the trusted guidance (i.e., published by sources such as government, MSISAC, reputable security vendor) for the particular ransomware variant and follow
any additional recommended steps to identify and contain systems or networks that
are confirmed to be impacted.
x

ill or disable the execution of known ransomware binaries; this will minimize
damage and impact to systems. Delete other known, associated registry values
and files.

2. Identify the systems and accounts involved in the initial breach. These can include
email accounts.
3. Based on the breach or compromise details determined above, contain any
associated systems that may be used for further or continued unauthorized access.
Breaches often involve mass credential exfiltration. Securing the network and other
information sources from continued credential-based unauthorized access may
require the following actions:
x Disabling virtual private networks, remote access servers, single sign-on
resources, and cloud-based or other public facing assets.
4. If server-side data is being encrypted by an infected workstation, quick-identification
steps are to:
x Review Computer Management Sessions and Open Files lists on associated
servers to determine the user or system accessing those files.
x Review file properties of encrypted files or ransom notes to identify specific
users that may be associated with file ownership.
x Review the TerminalServices-RemoteConnectionManager event log to check for
successful RDP network connections.
x Review the Windows Security log, SMB event logs, and any related logs that
may identify significant authentication or access events.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

2. Consult federal law enforcement regarding possible decryptors available, as security
researchers have already broken the encryption algorithms for some ransomware
variants.

5. Run Wireshark on the impacted server with a filter to identify IP addresses involved
in actively writing or renaming files (e.g., smb2.filename contains cryptxxx ).

14
Packet Pg. 606

2.17.C.b

RTD Emergency Operations Plan

x Look for evidence of precursor “dropper” malware. A ransomware event may
be evidence of a previous, unresolved network compromise. Many ransomware
infections are the result of existing malware infections such as TrickBot, Dridex,
or Emotet.
x Operators of these advanced malware variants will often sell access to a
network. Malicious actors will sometimes use this access to exfiltrate data and
then threaten to release the data publicly before ransoming the network in an
attempt to further extort the victim and pressure them into paying.
x Malicious actors often drop manually deployed ransomware variants on a
network to obfuscate their post-compromise activity. Care must be taken to
identify such dropper malware before rebuilding from backups to prevent
continuing compromise.
7. Conduct extended analysis to identify outside-in and inside-out persistence
mechanisms.
x Outside-in persistence may include authenticated access to external systems
via rogue accounts, backdoors on perimeter systems, exploitation of external
vulnerabilities, etc.
x Inside-out persistence may include malware implants on the internal network
or a variety of living-off-the-land style modifications (e.g., use of commercial
penetration testing tools like Cobalt Strike; use of PsTools suite, including
PsExec, to remotely install and control malware and gather information
regarding—or perform remote management of—Windows systems; use of
PowerShell scripts). Identification may involve deployment of endpoint
detection and response solutions, audits of local and domain accounts,
examination of data found in centralized logging systems, or deeper forensic
analysis of specific systems once movement within the environment has been
mapped out.
8. Rebuild systems based on a prioritization of critical services (e.g., health and safety
or revenue generating services), using pre-configured standard images, if possible.
9. Once the environment has been fully cleaned and rebuilt (including any associated
impacted accounts and the removal or remediation of malicious persistence
mechanisms), issue password resets for all affected systems and address any
associated vulnerabilities and gaps in security or visibility. This can include applying
patches, upgrading software, and taking other security precautions not previously
taken.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

6. Conduct an examination of existing organizational detection or prevention systems
(e.g., antivirus, Endpoint Detection & Response, IDS, Intrusion Prevention System)
and logs. Doing so can highlight evidence of additional systems or malware involved
in earlier stages of the attack.

150
Packet Pg. 607

2.17.C.b

RTD Emergency Operations Plan

6.2 Ransomware Recovery and Post-Incident Activity
1. Reconnect systems and restore data from offline, encrypted backups based on a
prioritization of critical services.
x Take care not to re-infect clean systems during recovery. For example, if a
new Virtual Local Area Network has been created for recovery purposes,
ensure only clean systems are added to it.
2. Document lessons learned from the incident and associated response activities to
inform updates to—and refine—organizational policies, plans, and procedures, and
guide future exercises of the same.
3. Consider sharing lessons learned and relevant indicators of compromise with CISA or
the sector ISAC/ISAO for further sharing and to benefit others within the
community.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

10.Based on established criteria, which may include taking the steps above or seeking
outside assistance, the designated IT or IT security authority declares the
ransomware incident over.

Annex L: Hazardous Materials Annex
The purpose of the Hazardous Materials (Hazmat) Annex is to identify those planning
considerations specific to hazardous materials both at RTD Facilities and in the broader service
area. Hazardous materials are defined by the NFPA 400, Hazardous Materials Code as:

A chemical or substance that is classified as a physical hazard material or a health
hazard material, whether the chemical or substance is in usable or waste condition.

Where physical and health hazards can be any of the classifications (Table 1):

Situation Overview
RTD uses/stores Hazmat in nine facilities, which are all accounted for in the annual Tier II
Emergency and Hazardous Chemical Inventory submitted in whole or part to the State
Emergency Response Commission, Denver County LEPC, Arapahoe County LEPC, Boulder
County LEPC, Denver Fire Department, Aurora Fire Rescue Department, Englewood Fire Area
Control District, and Boulder Fire-Rescue Department. Denver Fire Department also requires
additional hazmat reporting for permitting purposes.
Additionally Hazmat is transported through Denver along designated Hazardous Materials
Routes (entire portion contained in service area unless otherwise noted): I-25, I-70 from 270

Potential Impacts
Hazardous materials spills can vary widely in severity and their impacts. Physical and health
impacts as outlined above are potential risks as well as:
x Property damage
x Service Disruption or detours
x Regulatory non-compliance
x Financial cost to remediate
x Investigation to identify cause or impacts can cause long-lasting disruption
x Reputation damage
x Injury or loss of life to RTD employees or customers
Mitigations in Place
All hazardous materials stored in RTD facilities are properly labeled and stored in appropriate
size, material, and quantity according to their state (gas, liquid or solid), concentration, and
application.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

Rail Operations have several lines which travel within 100 m of freight rail alignments. These
are described in Table 4.

RTD facilities with petroleum products also have leak detection equipment and secondary
containment to identify and prevent spills. Regular monitoring is conducted by RTD Personnel
and a third-party contractor, including inspections, maintenance, and regulatory compliance.

158
Packet Pg. 615

2.17.C.b

All RTD staff responsible for handling of hazardous materials are trained on their safe handling
instructions and have Safety Data Sheets available in any workspace that has hazardous
materials. These are also communicated with local first response partners to ensure they are
able to respond safely to facilities storing hazardous materials. Fire Department partners have
also been familiarized with all RTD Facilities.
RTD has Contracted CG Environmental and Belfor Environmental to do asbestos, mold, flooding,
lead-based paint, groundwater and soil contamination, and fire damage remediation, as well as
waste disposal to prevent exposure hazards at RTD facilities.
RTD vehicles have ventilation systems in place to protect operators and customers. Buses,
including paratransit buses, have recirculating ventilation systems which can prevent air from
the outside of the bus from entering into the space when all doors and windows are closed. On
light and commuter rail vehicles, operators are able to turn off HVAC systems to prevent
external air from entering the internal operator and customer area when doors are closed.

Planning Assumptions
x Hazardous materials are stored and transported throughout the Service Area and
events impacting RTD may not originate at RTD facilities or vehicles

x Wind and other weather conditions can increase the area impacted by a
hazardous materials incident and may be unpredictable

x Impacts of Hazardous Materials incidents may have long-lasting

response/recovery efforts to address the event’s impacts, including the mitigation
of environmental impacts, especially to affected waterways

Concept of Operations
Detection/Monitoring
Hazardous materials incidents are the responsibility of the originating agency to report to
authorities. Air quality monitoring may be an early detection point for hazardous materials
releases not sufficiently reported. This information will be disseminated by local response/public
safety agencies.
RTD facilities with petroleum products have leak detection equipment and secondary
containment to identify and prevent spills. Regular monitoring is conducted by RTD Personnel
and a third-party contractor, including inspections, maintenance, and regulatory compliance.
Safety & Environmental staff perform regular inspections to identify any potential hazmat
hazards, among other factors.
Safety and Environmental create and disseminate training for frontline staff to identify improper
hazmat handling with reporting tools made available to encourage efficient identification of any
risky behaviors and storage methods. Industrial spill response training and other training is
available on HR management platforms, currently under the name of “Safety Skillz
(implemented in 2023).”

2.17.C.b

RTD Emergency Operations Plan

First Responders and Environmental Professionals will primarily be responsible for response and
notification of when it is safe to return to an affected area.
For hazardous materials incidents originating at an RTD facility, the primary point of contact
within RTD will be Bus dispatch, 303-2 -3000, and Light Rail Control at 303-2 -3480, with
secondary contacts being RTD’s Environmental Compliance Manager and Environmental
Specialists. If the spill is larger or more hazardous/unsafe than what RTD is adequately able to
address independently, they will then contact one of two hazardous materials clean-up
contractors, CG Environmental or Belfor Environmental as of 2023.
Facility specific plans have been developed for six facilities containing the majority of the
agency’s hazmat: Boulder, District Shops, East Metro, Elati, Mariposa and Platte (Format name
2023 RTD ICP Facility Name). These are available on The Hub, the agency’s intranet, and
should be reviewed by all individuals responsible for response operations taking place at an RTD
facility.
Recovery Considerations
RTD Facilities impacted by a hazardous materials incident may not be accessible for days or
weeks following the incident. In this case, affected staff members located at that facility will
report to the alternate facility identified in the Continuity of Operations Plan.

Roles and Responsibilities

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Purpose
The purpose of the Power Failure Annex is to identify those planning considerations
specific for the loss of power to any major RTD facility and the planning considerations
to effectively manage these events.
Situation Overview
cel Energy is the only power supply company within the RTD service area and
maintains all pre-RTD infrastructure related to power delivery. Occasionally, RTD will
have power loss to one or more building, or to power substations serving the rail
alignment during a power grid failure. In the past, there have been one to three major
outages on average per year affecting the agency. These outages can range in duration
from six to 36 hours.
Geographic Risk

As the entire service area is supplied with power from a single entity, no single location
has an elevated geographic risk. However, power failures can be caused by severe
weather such as extreme heat, extreme cold, snow, hail, or high winds. Power failures
can also occur due to technological or human-caused events such as excavation or
malicious actors.
Potential Impacts

Impacts of power failure can range in severity:
x Dependency on diesel generator power for facilities
x Impacts to maintenance and transportation caused by inoperable equipment,
x
x
x
x
x
x

such as not being able to fuel, inoperable lifts, power charging for electric fleet
Loss of power to access control systems
Loss of traction power for rail system
General loss of power to buildings (lights, computers, conveyances)
Lack of power to life and safety systems
Loss of Communication center (Bus, Light Rail, Commuter Rail, Transit Police,
Customer Care), including train control systems like SCADA and LRV signaling
system for light rail and Wabtec and WiMax for commuter rail
Data center failure, Network failure, Security Camera system failure, Radio
system failure

These impacts may culminate to trigger a system-wide service suspension. A decision to
suspend service may only be made by the General Manager/CEO or their designee.

or supporting facilities. RTD may be secondary priority to restore depending
upon the other facilities impacted
When far-reaching power failures occur, temperature controls are likely to fail in
residential settings and may result in warming/cooling centers being open. This
may cause increased traffic on RTD revenue service vehicles
Power restoration times are almost always estimates and are subject to change
Generally, loss of power to servers does not necessarily mean a loss of historic
data, the predicted data loss should be limited to the data that has not been
backed-up at the time of the power outage, typically no more than 24 hours of
loss. New data generated since the loss of power may not be stored
Many elements of ensuring continuity from a power loss are included in the
COOP. Where facilities, IT systems, or communication systems are impacted the
COOP is the most up to date record of backup procedures. This includes
prioritization of restoration from the agency-wide perspective

Concept of Operations
Detection/Monitoring

Power failures can be identified by RTD staff, systems, or through notification from cel
Energy. Once a power failure has been identified, facilities staff will communicate with
cel to gather restoration information.
Response Considerations

For those events which overwhelm the ability of normal operations to maintain safe
operating conditions, the Emergency Operations Center will be activated to monitor and
support operations. Upon activation, the EOC Manager will supply regular updates to
the General Manager/CEO to support their situational awareness and decision making.
Suspension of Service is the final measure taken to address impacts related to power
failure events. This decision is not taken lightly and must be made with adequate
consideration to factors such as:

charged batteries for radios be available?
x Can vehicles be kept in a safe operational condition?
x Is fuel available to keep generators and vehicles running? For how long?
x Predictability for customers-Eg. Agency must provide service during PM peak
hours if AM peak hours service was conducted, ability to communicate to
customers changes being made
Recovery Considerations

Service Restoration post-suspension will also be decided upon by the General
Manager/CEO and will generally be communicated to the public in advance. This ideally
would take place at the start of the next service day.
The impacts of a complete power outage event may take some time to fully address.
This includes IT data and system restoration, inspections of equipment before clearing
for use, and repair of damage to infrastructure if surge events occurred, inclusive of
staff availability.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Annex N: Train Derailment Annex
The purpose of the Train Derailment Annex is to identify those planning considerations specific
to a train derailment either on or off RTD alignments and the planning considerations to
effectively manage events.

Situation Overview
Rail infrastructure throughout Denver is owned and operated by RTD, DTP, and a number of
commercial freight companies. Derailments are possible on any rail alignment and could impact
RTD service delivery at rail crossings, on parallel alignments, or on RTD alignments.
Geographic Risk
Rail infrastructure in RTD’s service area is shown in Figure 2.

Mitigations in Place
Mitigations are currently taken at the operational level and are described below:

Capital Programs
x Application of engineering design best practices, specification of materials, and
construction oversight to create a quality product to ensure safe and reliable
train operations.
x Track quality is correlated with the speed of allowed operations; in case of minor
issues, reducing the speed of operation can be considered.
Facilities

Planning Assumptions
x Train derailments are no-notice events which cannot reliably be predicted, but
may be more likely to occur during inclement weather
x Not all train derailments which affect RTD will be on RTD alignment or involving
RTD vehicles. For these events, RTD will liaise with the primary rail service
provider to gather timelines to restoration as well as resolve financial matters
related to damages and service delay
x RTD will liaise with first responders but will take ownership of any event
impacting RTD property once life-saving activities have concluded

Concept of Operations
Detection/Monitoring
Derailment events will be communicated by the Communication Center which has identified the
impacts. At time of Emergency Management notification, a Situational Awareness Update will be
sent to the RTD workforce at large.
Response Considerations
Due to regulation from FRA and FTA, derailment and rerailing procedures for RTD vehicles are

RAIL OPERATIONS RULEBOOK

This rulebook is the primary governing document for the day-to-day
operation of the RTD Light Rail system and adherence to these rules is
mandatory for those governed by it.

I

The Rules and Procedures Development Committee worked
collaboratively to produce a rulebook that adheres to RTD’s longstanding
safe operating practices, which is clear, simple, and unambiguous. A new
numbering system has been introduced so that subject matter areas are
grouped logically. Duplication of rules have been eliminated unless the
Committee felt it appropriate to leave them in multiple locations, for clarity
or for emphasis.

Safety is the most critical element for continued success of RTD and
must be every employee’s ﬁrst consideration in the performance of our
duties. Within light rail, safety begins with each employee’s thorough and
comprehensive knowledge of the rules and procedures.

RTD has operated high-quality, safe light rail transit in the Denver region
since 1994. During this period, the system has grown in size, technical
sophistication and number of daily riders. With the FasTracks program
well under way, light rail continues to grow.

“MOW Job Brieﬁng Forms” must be turned in to supervision at the end
of shift.

• Other workers enter the work area.

• Working conditions change.

FOLLOW UP JOB BRIEFINGS WILL BE
CONDUCTED WHEN:

• Means by which the Flagger or ﬂagman will
warn workers of an approaching train.

• Safe location to clear track.

• Form of RWP protection(s) employed.

• Work to be performed

• Trains Maximum Authorized Speed for the
location of work

• Identiﬁcation of Working limits and location of
work.

• Designation of the Roadway Worker In Charge
(RWIC)

INFORMATION TO INCLUDE IN JOB BRIEFING

An “MOW Job Brieﬁng Form” must be ﬁlled out and signed by all
members of the work party.

Prior to entering the alignment a job brieﬁng must be conducted with
all members of the work party by the Roadway Worker In Charge. Lone
workers must conduct a job brieﬁng with their supervisor or Control prior
to entering alignment.

Summary: The job brieﬁng is an essential part of Roadway Worker
Protection. It ensures roadway workers clearly communicate to each other
details of the work plan, protection employed, hazards associated with
the planned work, and method of train approach warning prior to fouling a
track.

JOB BRIEFING

2.17.C.b

96 RWP MANUAL

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

5. RTD management should periodically review their Roadway Worker
Protection program to identify and remove any administrative or
procedural barriers to the utilization of the good faith challenge.

4. Supervisors and co-workers should actively encourage the use of the
good faith challenge.

97

Remember: If you are uncertain about your safety, trust your instincts;
make a good faith challenge. You may be saving your life.

3. Roadway workers should periodically review the good faith challenge
procedures during crew meetings/job brieﬁngs.

2. All roadway workers should know where to access RTD’s good faith
challenge procedures and understand the resolution process.

5. If good faith challenge has merit, deﬁciencies will be corrected and
employees will resume work. If the good faith challenge has no
merit, RWP will be explained by supervisor to Roadway worker and
employees will resume work.

4. If onsite supervisor cannot resolve than MOW manager or his designee
will be reached for resolution.

3. If supervisor cannot resolve over the phone, supervisor will report to
the scene and evaluate the challenge.

2. If challenge can be resolved, resume work. If challenge cannot be
resolved, supervisor will be contacted.

1. Roadway worker has concern about on-track safety and discusses with
Roadway Worker in Charge.

Note: All good faith challenges steps will be held outside fouling distance.

Good Faith Challenge Process

1. Employees should remain clear of track until the challenge is resolved.

Key Points:

RTD management fully supports a roadway worker’s absolute right to
initiate a good faith challenge without fear of retaliation or discipline. The
good faith challenge process begins when an employee raises an RWP
concern.

A good faith challenge is an opportunity to jointly resolve any Roadway
Worker Protection concerns; it is not a confrontation with your supervisor
or RTD management. A job brieﬁng is the ﬁrst opportunity to make a
good faith challenge; however, a challenge can be made at any time.
Challenges require prompt and fair resolution.

Summary: Purpose of a good faith challenge is straightforward: To
provide roadway workers with a non-punitive mechanism for raising and
resolving on-track safety concerns so the work can be performed safely.

Summary: The purpose of roadway worker protection is to prevent
accidents and casualties caused by rail vehicles striking roadway workers.
The following methods of protection described in this manual will vary
dependent on type of work performed and location. More than one form
of protection may be used at the discretion of the RWIC.

Summary: Use of the radio is a vital part of roadway worker projection.
Communications from control to a roadway worker that pertain to their on
track safety will be repeated back to control for clarity.

Note: Trains are never allowed to bypass a red signal into the work
zone under foul time protection.

Either of the two methods listed below are acceptable to make a track
inaccessible:

3. Used in interlocking’s and electric lock switch areas only.
4. Will be used in conjunction with a ﬂagman.
Step by Step – Foul Time

2. Conduct job brieﬁng with all members of the work group.

3. Line switches on both ends away from the work zone and lock/point
lock switch; or, install derails with double red ﬂag protection if unable
to use switches for protection.

Packet Pg. 692

100 RWP MANUAL

101

4. Protection must remain in place until track is made safe and workers
are clear.

3. force signals governing entrance(s) into the work zone to red.

2. Notify control of location of foul time and wait to receive authority
before proceeding.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2025_Exhibits (5008 : 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

5. Protection must remain in place until track is made safe and workers
are clear.

1. Conduct job brieﬁng with all members of the work group.

2. Used for short periods of time only, not to exceed 10 minutes.

1. Notify Shop Supervisor at Elati or Control at Mariposa of track to be
made inaccessible.

4. If switch is dual control, take switch off power.

1. No Trains will be allowed in your work zone during foul time.

Key Points

If in an electric switch lock area the signal maintainer will be required to
take the switch/switches out of correspondence setting outer opposing
signals (OOS) red.

Upon receiving permission from control, the Roadway Worker must force
signals governing entrance(s) into the work zone to red. This can be
accomplished by placing the interlocking house into Local control mode,
taking the switch(s) out of correspondence, opening gold nuts or placing a
shunt.

Step by Step – Inaccessible Track

d. An additional red ﬂag must be placed 50 feet in advance of the derail.

c. Derails must have double red ﬂags placed at the location of the derail.

b. Derails must be secured at all times. When transporting derails in
vehicles they must be chained and locked to the vehicle to prevent
theft. When installed on the rail they must be securely locked to
prevent tampering.

a. Permission must be obtained from MOW supervisor on duty.

2. Installing derail(s) with ﬂag placement.

d.If the switch lacks the ability to be locked out, than point clamp or
spike the switch point.

c. Dual control switches will be taken off power.

b. Switches on both ends need to be lined away from work zone.

a. Line the switch away from the track being worked on.

Foul Time is a restrictive form of protection, in that trains are not allowed
into the work zone until the Roadway worker reports clear and gives back
authority to Control. Control has the authority as whether or not to grant foul
time to a roadway worker. If the roadway worker fails to give back foul time,
trains will not be allowed to move until the roadway worker is contacted and
it is conﬁrmed the track is safe and the roadway worker(s) is clear.

Summary: A method of establishing on track protection where the
roadway worker in charge (RWIC) requests that the controller stop all
trains and track equipment from entering the work zone until all personnel
are clear of the track and the track is safe for train movement. Can only be
used at interlocking and electric switch lock locations.

Summary: This form of protection is used only in yards and auxiliary
tracks by making the track inaccessible by one of the following methods
below. Prior to making a yard track inaccessible, the shop supervisor
and Yard Master must be notiﬁed at Elati and Control must be notiﬁed at
Mariposa and auxiliary tracks.

1. Line and lock switches on the limits of work zone to prevent access.

Sufficient sight distance must exist in order to detect an approaching train
and clear 15 seconds prior to train arrival. Always assume trains are at
Maximum Authorized Speed (MAS). Where sufficient sight distance does
not exist, an advance ﬂagger may be used to relay train approach warning
to the watchmen near the workgroup. All rules and procedures governing
ﬂagger apply to advance ﬂagger.

1. Mainline track within the working limits shall be placed under the
control of one qualiﬁed Roadway Worker in Charge.

Summary: Work zone established on mainline tracks where movement
of trains and equipment shall be made only at the discretion of the

Some examples of hot spots are listed below. This is not a complete list.

Summary: Hot spots are locations of limited sight distance, loud ambient
noise, or tight clearances. These could be bridges, tunnels, or tight
curves. In the areas of hot spots, extra attention needs to be paid to which
form of RWP is chosen and in some locations RWP such as individual
train detection is not useable. Some locations will also require heighten
vigilance for trains.

Summary: All roadway workers will receive new hire RWP training. Each
year after that, roadway workers will receive refresher training on RWP.
Passing the training is a requirement of the job and having your proof
of training card on your person at all times is required to access the

Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management of all financial resources

Each Strategic Priority is associated with a measurable Success Outcome.
During the Board’s annual retreat in 2024, Board members discussed opportunities to enhance agency
transparency and bolster communication and engagement with jurisdictional partners, stakeholders, and
customers. At that time, Board members collectively discussed the development of a series of openended questions intended to probe whether the agency is meeting its performance goals.
In alignment with this effort, staff developed a public-facing agency performance dashboard
(performance dashboard), which launched in May 2024. The performance dashboard provides answers
to these questions and serve as an easily accessible repository for performance data related to the
Strategic Plan. The performance dashboard will also be expanded over time to house information related
to the agency budget and financial reports, people power statistics, and other key measurements. The

Packet Pg. 811

2.18.A

performance dashboard enhances agency transparency and supports the Performance Committee’s
efforts to assess the agency’s progress toward Strategic Plan Success Outcomes.
Further, staff has developed a separate annual scorecard related to agency performance driven by an
operational vantage point. Related to this scorecard, staff has developed tactics and leading indicators
that stem from Strategic Initiatives related to agency performance.
DISCUSSION
As noted in the Strategic Plan document, and as contemplated by the Board and staff in 2021,
performance metrics are subject to change during the duration of the Plan. Adjusting agency metrics,
and thereby adjusting agency operations and performance, in order to achieve success outcomes is an
essential element of the Strategic Plan.
During the Performance Committee meeting on Monday, September 16, 2024, staff discussed potential
performance metrics related to the Strategic Priority of Financial Success, including:
•

•
•
•
•
•

Financial Trust Index: A weighted composite index measuring financial trust, calculated as
follows:
o Percentage of compliance with the nine ratios utilized by the Office of the State Auditor in
assessing financial health (50% of weighting):
▪ Cash to Liabilities
▪ Working Capital
▪ Asset Sufficiency
▪ Unrestricted Net Position
▪ Net Position
▪ Debt Burden
▪ Principal Payments to Total Outstanding Debt
▪ Tax Revenue per Capita
▪ Expenses per Capita
o Standard and Poor’s bond rating (20% of weighting)
o Average of Community Survey responses related to trust in financial management,
specifically in relation to the following prompts (30% of weighting):
▪ RTD manages its financial resources well
▪ RTD is a good financial steward of public funds
▪ The community's investment in transit provides value
▪ RTD's financial reporting is understandable and transparent
Budget Variability: % deviation from adopted budget
Cost per Revenue Hour: Inflation-adjusted operating cost per revenue hour
Debt Service Coverage: 1.2x coverage maintained
Monthly Reserves: Three months' operating reserves maintained
Fare Value: Percentage of customers who agree or strongly agree that fares are reasonable, as
measured by annual Customer Excellence surveys

Packet Pg. 812

2.18.A

The metrics are incorporated into the Agency Performance Scorecard for the Performance Committee’s,
and subsequently the Board’s, consideration.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of the Agency Performance Scorecard
revisions.

COMMITTEE CHAIR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Resolution in Support of RTD Vision Zero Initiatives

October 9, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
October 22, 2024

Added to Committee Agenda by the Committee Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section
1(b). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the attached resolution supporting RTD specific Vision Zero
initiatives.
REPRESENTATIVES
JoyAnn Ruscha, Director – District B
Ian Harwick, Director – District L
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Vision Zero is a systems-based strategy to eliminate traffic fatalities and severe injuries on the principle
that traffic deaths and severe injuries are never acceptable. Many municipalities have adopted Vision
Zero plans including Boulder County, City and County of Denver, City of Thorton, and City of
Westminster. Additionally, RTD has been a member of the Denver Regional Council of Government’s
Vision Zero working group since its inception.
At the June 12, 2024 Operations, Safety, and Security Committee meeting, Directors JoyAnn Ruscha
and Ian Harwick presented on Vision Zero and the work they had been doing alongside Director Guzman
to engage community groups and customers to develop a set of recommendations to the Board and staff
regarding Vision Zero.
The group convened by the aforementioned Directors met publicly nine times from October 2023
through January 2024. The group included nearly 40 participants and representatives from Denver
Streets Partnership, Pedestrian Dignity, ATU 1001, Denver Bicycle Lobby, Greater Denver Transit, and
the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition.
The Directors are now returning to the Board with a recommended action to adopt a resolution
supporting Vision Zero initiatives.

RESOLUTION NO. ___, SERIES OF 2024
A RESOLUTION SUPPORTING VISION ZERO
TO ELIMINATE TRAFFIC FATALITIES AND SEVERE INJURIES
WHEREAS, Vision Zero is a systematic data-driven approach to traffic safety that prioritizes
human life and seeks to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries in our transit systems; and
WHEREAS, traffic-related deaths and serious injuries are preventable public health issues that
disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, including cyclists and pedestrians; and
WHEREAS, at least one-third of all RTD customers begin and end their transit journeys as
pedestrians, and many others are cyclists; and
WHEREAS, the American Public Transportation Association found increasing transit ridership is
one of the best ways to reduce traffic related deaths and injuries, and RTD is committed to
providing safe, reliable, and sustainable public transit options; and
WHEREAS, RTD registered as an ally to the United States Department of Transportation’s
(USDOT) National Roadway Safety Strategy in 2023 and has implemented a resulting training
program for bus operators to avoid three common mistakes; and
WHEREAS, RTD and its commuter rail concessionaire, Denver Transit Operators, raised significant
awareness around transit safety issues during this year’s Rail Safety Week held September 23 rd
through 29th; and,
WHEREAS, RTD has been involved in the Denver Regional Council of Government (DRCOG) Vision
Zero working group since its inception; and
WHEREAS, Directors JoyAnn Ruscha, Ian Harwick, and Michael Guzman convened a grassroots
group of community and transit-oriented organizations, which included representatives from the
Denver Streets Partnership, Greater Denver Transit, Pedestrian Dignity, ATU 1001, the Denver
Bicycle Lobby, and the Colorado Cross Disability Commission, to review and make Vision Zero
policy recommendations to RTD; and
WHEREAS, DRCOG, Boulder County, City and County of Denver, City of Thornton, City of
Westminster have each adopted Vision Zero policies with the aim of improving transportation
safety in our region; and

2.18.B.a

WHEREAS, adopting Vision Zero principles aligns with our mission to make lives better through
connections;

1. Support for Vision Zero: The Board supports an RTD specific Vision Zero initiative and
commits to taking actionable steps towards the elimination of traffic fatalities and serious
injuries within our transit operations and infrastructure.
2. Collaboration: RTD has adopted USDOT’s Safe Systems Approach and will continue to
work with DRCOG’s Vision Zero working group; and RTD shall continue to collaborate with
city planners, community organizations, and local governments to develop and implement
strategies as well as make infrastructure investments that align with Vision Zero principles.
3. Infrastructure Review and Investments: In addition to the ongoing wayfinding planning
assessment, RTD staff will continue to review its fixed route bus routes as well as light rail
and commuter rail networks to identify high risk areas for accidents and injuries, and
leverage that information when evaluating ongoing infrastructure investments, similar to
the recent installation of new blank out signs along the light rail system, to improve
pedestrian and vehicular safety; starting in 2025, budget documents will specifically
identify funding for bus stop, rail crossing, and pedestrian improvements.
4. Community Engagement: RTD will continue to engage the communities we serve in a
robust dialogue around safety on and around our system, and, starting in 2025, RTD staff
will incorporate system safety feedback sessions into its on-going outreach endeavors.
Groups to engage should include disability rights, transportation advocates, community
members throughout the whole RTD service area, and individuals from disadvantaged
communities.
5. Ongoing Evaluation: Starting in 2025, the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee will
receive an annual report each May detailing the number of injuries and fatalities involving
pedestrians, cyclists, and other motorists occurring on RTD’s system over the previous
year and highlighting staff’s on-going efforts to eliminate serious injuries and fatalities.
6. Staffing Resources: No later than the end of the second quarter of 2025, the General
Manager and CEO will assess the viability of dedicating staff resources in support of the
agency's efforts to eliminate traffic fatalities and serious injuries within its service area.
Such support could include the development and implementation a comprehensive Vision
Zero plan, collaboration with stakeholders, data analysis, promotion of safety culture, and
advocacy for necessary resources.

Why RTD Should Adopt a Vision Zero Action Plan
▪ Public transportation is a key tool in achieving Vision Zero
• Traffic fatality rates can decrease by 10%-40% by prioritizing transit and accessible pedestrian-friendly
infrastructure (via APTA)

▪ Public transportation is part of the traffic network
• Be it a dedicated ROW or a bus stop, those who use interact with RTD are impacted by our decisions

▪ Communities need us!
• Partner agencies can’t be successful in their Vision Zero Plans if we aren’t active partners in the effort.

▪ We have an ethical responsibility to take advantage of our unique role in local transit
• As an independent transit agency, we are poised to lead the nation (and industry) in Vision Zero!
Remember: A third of RTD customers begin their transit journey as pedestrians!

Complete Streets
for All

Complete streets are streets designed and operated to enable safe use and
support mobility for all users—such as bike lanes, sidewalks, bus-only lanes,
etc. These concepts are integrated into planning.

Context-Appropriate
Speeds

Travel speeds are set and managed to achieve safe conditions for the
specific roadway context and to protect all roadway users, particularly those
most at-risk in crashes. Proven speed management policies and practices are
prioritized to reach this goal.

Vision Zero prioritizes safe travel of people over expeditious travel of motor vehicles.

Equity-Focused
Analysis and
Programs

Commitment is made to an equitable approach and outcomes, including
prioritizing engagement & investments in under-served communities.

Proactive,
Systemic Planning

A proactive, systems-based approach to safety is used to identify and
address top risk factors and mitigate potential crashes and crash severity.

Responsive,
Hot Spot Planning

A map of the community’s fatal and serious injury crash locations is
developed, regularly updated, and used to guide priority actions and funding.

Comprehensive
Evaluation and
Adjustments

Routine evaluation of the performance of all safety interventions is made public
and shared with decision makers to inform priorities, budgets, and updates to
the Vision Zero Action Plan.

Recommendations – Examples – Rail Safety
▪ Address conflicts at intersections between light rail trains and turning vehicles
• Analyze data and identify solutions, prioritizing known high-risk areas like Stout Street and Welton
Corridor.

▪ Implement safety countermeasures for pedestrians in the right—of-way
• Install mini-gate arms, flashing lights, and pavement markings at prioritized crossings to enhance
pedestrian visibility and protection.

▪ Invest in smart(er) technology (including seeking funding)
• Assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using LIDAR/RADAR, AI, or other technology at high-accident
grade crossings, considering both general safety and suicide prevention implications.

Recommendations – Examples – Communications
▪ Invest in essential upgrades
• Upgrading automated announcements, ensuring multilingual signage and information,
standardizing pedestrian crossings, and conducting a comprehensive ADA review will
contribute to enhancing communication and accessibility for all riders.

▪ Develop SOPs for Equitable Access
• Create standardized operating procedures (SOPs) for clear and consistent communication
across all stations, promoting equity and inclusivity

Recommendations – Examples – Planning
▪ Address local infrastructure gaps by partnering with municipalities.
• Improve pedestrian access to stations (particularly in areas adjacent to Peoria Station) - as
well as station design itself - focusing on sidewalk connections, lighting, and signage.

▪ Adopt DRCOG Vision Zero Guidelines, i.e.:
• For signalized intersections, place stops at the far side.
• For non-signalized intersections, place bus stops and pedestrian crossings in close proximity
(‘co-locate’) to allow people riding transit to cross the street safely

▪ Create a fund for bus stop & pedestrian improvements, focusing on equity

“Underlying the Vision Zero strategy is the Safe System – a holistic safety approach that shifts
responsibility from the people using roads to the people designing them, integrating core management and
action areas to create a safe mobility system forgiving of human error. The structure of an effective Vision
Zero strategy embodies the Safe System approach. “
