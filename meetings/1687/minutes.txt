*************************************************************************
Call to Order: Chair Brohl called the Operations and Customer Services Committee meeting to order at
6:07 p.m.
The meeting began with an update on the West Corridor IGA with Jefferson County from Director
Pulliam and Marla Lien, General Counsel. Staff has gone back to Jefferson County and explained some
of the items the Board was unhappy with. Last Friday, January 29, 2010 there was a meeting to
hammer out a compromise. Marla Lien wanted to see if the compromise satisfies the concerns of the
Board that were expressed in Executive Session on January 12, 2010. There were a couple of issues
with the Jefferson County IGA which was first signed in 2008 that required an amendment. When the
IGA was signed the parking facility was not yet designed. One of the key issues is the stipulation that
if RTD did not use the facility for two years it would revert to Jefferson County. Jefferson County is
now offering five years for the reversion. The second issue was parking management. There will be
no paid parking initially but if parking remains at 90% sustained level for three months, the Board can
begin parking management. The third issue is that Jefferson County has a right to 135 spaces for which
RTD will issue an easement. The majority of these parking spaces will be on the first floor of the
parking garage that would be controlled access (via gates).

There was a discussion by the Board and most of the members are displeased with having a reversion
clause and the reserved parking on the first floor of the garage. The Board wanted to see if it would be
possible to open the gates to the reserved parking in off-peak times to allow RTD patrons to use it.
Director Pulliam reminded the Board the Jefferson County perspective is that they have suffered most of
the cuts on the West Corridor project and that there is really no alternative on where we can build the
end of the line station.
Ms. Lien told the Board that this would come to them as an action item next month.
I.

Recommended Actions
a. Smart Media Technology Contract Award – Bruce Abel introduced this item.
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents
necessary to award a contract for the Smart Media Technology (SMT) project to ACS
Transport Solutions, Inc. of Columbia, Maryland in an amount no-to-exceed $17,300,000.
There was a lengthy discussion on this action item. The main concerns of the Board were:
1. Price – as this is over the amount budgeted for the project.
2. Why there were two separate RFPs issued instead of a combined Smart
Card/Farebox RFP.
3. Clarification of District policy in regards to when vendors can contact
Board members in regards to a staff recommendation.
4. Hands on demonstration – the Board would like to see the recommended
product and be able to test it prior to deciding on the action.
Motion:

Director Tayer made a motion to continue to the
next Operations and Customer Services meeting
on March 9, 2010.

Second:

Director Busck seconded the motion.

Vote on Motion:

The motion passed unanimously.
(Director Pulliam had left before the vote.)

b. Transfer of Funds for the East Metro & Boulder Boilers – TIGGER Grant
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to transfer $1,095,000 from the Transit Reserve
account and $156,000 from the Energy Conservation program to the East Metro and
Boulder Maintenance Boiler Replacement Project accounts. The Energy Conservation
funds are included in the 2010 RTD budget.

Director Cohen made a motion to forward this
item to the February 16, 2010 Board meeting
agenda.

II.

Next Meeting Date – The next meeting of the Operations and Customer Services Committee
will be March 9, 2010.

III.

Other Matters – There was a discussion on Denver Union Station issues. Please refer to the
handouts distributed by Bruce Abel that are on file in the Operations/Customer Services
Committee Meeting Minute notebook. The discussion focused on ridership projections, the
bus staging lane and the following questions from Board members.
Director Christopher wanted to know when the bus box would reach service level F.
Director Brohl wanted to know if it would be possible to have security stations and 1/3 and
2/3 through the bus station rather than in the middle. She also wanted to know the
passenger capacity at Denver International Airport. She strongly urged the Board to consider
other options for bus staging rather than in the prime space as indicated on the design.
Director Kemp encouraged committee members to contact with staff on any questions they
might have regarding DUS.
Chris Martinez brought out an issue about ridership/unemployment. Do we work with
unemployment offices in providing transportation so they can help the unemployed look for
work? General Manager Washington said that the District does provide reduced cost tokens
to social services agencies.
Mr. Washington shared that President Obama has released the 2011 budget. RTD was
prominently listed in that budget for East and Gold lines as well as the West Corridor for
another 40 million. FTA Administrator Rogoff will be here Friday, February 5, 2010 and
there will be a media event tentatively scheduled for 1:30 p.m. This is the second monetary
pledge for the Eagle P3 project. This is a big step towards receiving the full amount.

IV.

Adjourn - Hearing no objection, Committee Chair Brohl adjourned the meeting at 9:32 p.m.
