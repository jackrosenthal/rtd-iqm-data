### B. Recommended Actions

There were no recommended actions.

#### 1. Salaried Employee DB Pension Plan

Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration, introduced Wendy Londa of Rael and Letson who reviewed a Power Point Presentation that was included in the February 9, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.

Wendy Londa reminded the Board that the Salaried Employees’ Pension Plan is reviewed each year by an Actuarial and a fund status is provided.  She explained that as an Actuarial she is required to adhere to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  This fund status is based on a snapshot in time along with a comparison of what happened over the year versus the Actuarial assumptions.

Wendy Londa reviewed the following valuation highlights as of January 1, 2015:

- Total participant count decreased by 15 (716 to 701)

o        Plan closed to new participants on January 1, 2008

o        Active population decreased from 382 to 361

- Actuarial Accrued Liability increased by $12.9M (from $133.6M to $146.5M)

- Actuarial Value of Assets increased by $7.2M (from $113.7M to $120.9M)

- Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability increased by $5.8M (from $19.9M to $25.6M)

- Funded ratio based on the Actuarial Value of Assets decreased from 85.1% to 82.5%

- Funded ratio based on the Market Value of Assets decreased from 93.5% to 88.7%

- Recommended contribution increased by $1.1M from $5.47M to $6.8M

Wendy Londa reminded the Board that in 2013 the Board approved a funding policy which was changed from a percent of payroll (9% cap) to the actuary’s recommended contribution amount of up to $3.1 million annually; however, due to poor investment performance in 2015 and a significant salary loss in 2014, the Plan is not projected to achieve 100% funding with a $3.1 million annual contribution.  She noted that based on the projections, the Board approved a $4.1 million contribution for 2016 while the actuary’s recommended contribution was $6.8 million.

Wendy Londa explained that the Plan experienced a $3.5 million salary loss in 2014 due to an 8.21% average salary increase for continuing activities compared to an expected average increase of 4.0%.  Additionally, investment return in 2015 fell well short of the 7.50% assumption at -0.5% for 2015.  She stated that based on the January 1, 2015 valuation results and a -0.5% return on assets for 2015, if all Actuarial assumptions are met each year the Plan is projected to reach 100% funding in 2043.  She stressed that future investment returns will have a significant impact on when the Plan will reach 100% funding.

Director Archuleta inquired as to who funds the pension.  He wondered if the employees paid into it.  Wendy Londa stated that RTD contributes to the Defined Benefit (DB) pension plan.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, noted that this valuation was only for the Salaried Employees’ Pension Plan (Plan).  She explained for this Plan employees do not pay into it.

Committee Chair Menten believes part of the problem is that there were average salary increases of over 8%.  She commented that the average person in the workforce has not had an 8% salary increase.  She wondered what safeguards are in place to protect the taxpayers as the contributions to the Plan are essentially taxpayer money.  Heather Copp reminded the Board that between 2008 and 2011 there were no pay increases.  She stated that employees pay was falling below market level, so in 2012 progression increases were implemented to move people closer to that level.  In addition, in 2014 employees began receiving results based pay raises, which were also done in 2015 and 2016.  She believes at this time there has now been a leveling out of people reaching a more reasonable market rate.  She does not anticipate there will be the same salary increase in the future.   She pointed out that there were also employees who were promoted which added to the salary increase.  She does not think that should be discouraged.  Heather Copp explained that salary increases are approved by the Board annually through the budget process.

Director Anderson wondered if an employee would stay in this Plan if they moved to a different position.  Heather Copp stated they would stay in the same plan.  Director Anderson shared that in her experience, plans similar to this, once closed to new participants, get more actuarially sound because there are fewer and fewer people in the plan.  Wendy Londa pointed out that it still depends on the funding.

Director Hoy said he did not believe there were many new jobs created last year, so he wonders how promotions affected the salary increase so much.  Heather Copp explained that there could be a scenario where someone was in the new retirement plan, left RTD, and then someone from the Pension Plan was promoted to that position.  She said that overall, the total percentage of salary increases related to people that got promoted was 12%.

Director Hoy wondered if staff had given any thought to a third plan.  Heather Copp said no as staff was very happy with the new plan.  It is working very well and does not have a pension liability.

Heather Copp stated that when looking at other pension plans she feels our plan is in pretty good shape.  She noted there is always the risk that the return on the assets will be lower than anticipated as what happened in 2015; however, that was one of the reasons the trustees recommended the contribution be raised to $4.1 million for 2016.

#### 2. Represented Employee DB Plan

Doug MacLeod, Controller, noted that this fund status was for the Union Pension Plan.  He asked Leslie Thompson of Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company to review the Power Point Presentation included in the February 9, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.

Leslie Thompson pointed out that this plan does have funding from the employees.  She stated that as she informed the Board last year, this Plan is still in funding peril.  She explained that the fund was in better shape than last year but wanted to make sure the Board understood the fund was still in funding peril.

Leslie Thompson reviewed the following valuation highlights as of January 1, 2015:

- Contributions are not sufficient to fund the liabilities

o        Total actuarial requirement is 25.21% while 18.0% is scheduled for receipt in 2015

- Fund is projected to be fully depleted by 2040 while last year it was 2036 and the year before was 2032 assuming 7.0% earnings

- Actuarial Accrued Liability increased by $1.0 million

- Actuarial Value of Assets returned 7.36%, exceeding the assumed 7.0%

- Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability decreased by $3.5 million

- The normal cost decreased from 11.81% of pay to 10.79%

- Funded ratio increased from 48.7% to 49.6%

- Total active participant count increased by 106

Leslie Thompson stated that the funded ratio of 49.6% is a low, funded ratio as the national average is around 80%.  She indicated there are signs that the pension reforms made, such as the changes in benefits for employees hired after 2010 and the funding increases in 2013, are working; however, she reiterated that the plan is not out of the woods yet.  She stressed that she did not want to leave the Board in a relaxed stated based on the improvements the Plan has seen.  She pointed out that a few bad years of returns on assets could bring the fund to zero very quickly.

Committee Chair Menten stated she would worry about anyone that felt relaxed after that presentation.

Director Solano expressed that it seemed odd to him that the salaried employees do not pay into their retirement plans but the represented do.  He feels like this is an inequality between the two groups.  Heather Copp noted it was true that the salaried employees do not pay into their plan; however, on the salaried side RTD only pays 9% of an employee’s salary while on the union side RTD puts in 13%, so the ratio is higher.  Director Solano thinks it is important to look at this Plan because we do not want to go broke like other organizations have.

Committee Chair Menten asked how honest the discussion is at the Union Pension Trustee Board Meetings about the state of their Plan.  She wonders if the union knows how bad the outlook is.  Doug MacLeod shared that he is on the Trustee Board and they do have those very frank discussions.  Leslie Thompson gives them periodic presentations as well.  He stated that everyone is very well aware of what is going on with the Plan.  He pointed out that the contributions are dictated by the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) so he is not sure there is much that the Trustee Board can do.

Marla Lien indicated that what Doug MacLeod reviewed is what happens at the Trustee Board Meetings.  She explained that RTD does not know what the Union Trustees share with the union as RTD management is constrained as to how they communicate with union members.  She stated that while RTD does not know what the union members know, the union officers are aware.

Committee Chair Menten said that in talking to the bus drivers they do not seem to understand the situation.

Chair Tobiassen asked if there were other retirement that union members could participate in.  Doug MacLeod indicated there is a retirement plan that they can elect to participate in and determine their contribution.  He noted that RTD employees also contribute to Social Security, which many government agencies do not.

Director Archuleta wondered what RTD planned to do about the funding of the Plan.  He stated that the situation did not sound good.  Doug MacLeod noted that the Plan has been extended through some of the measures that have been taken.  Marla Lien explained that the collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) is what defines the funding commitments of RTD while the Trustee Board defines the benefits.  RTD does not set the benefits nor is RTD liable to pay for anything other than the amount defined in the CBA.  Interim General Manager Genova believes the Pension funding will be one of the main items during the next CBA negotiations  along with wages.

Director Solano believes that during the CBA negotiations the wages of the salaried employees also need to be evaluated so things are more equitable.

Director Hoy asked if it was a fair synopsis that it really was the union employees’ pension.  The Trustee Board decides what the benefits are for retiring employees.  RTD is only responsible for the contribution outlined in the CBA.  Interim General Manager Genova said there are three salaried employees on the Trust Board and three union members.  The Trustee Board must reach consensus for any changes.  Marla Lien explained that if the union trustees do not agree to proposed changes the only way to make those changes would be to force arbitration.  Heather Copp reiterated that RTD’s liability is the 13% of union salaries that we have agreed to contribute.

#### 3. December Monthly Financial Status Report

Doug MacLeod reviewed the Monthly Financial Status Report that was included in the February 9, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.  He indicated that for both the month of December and year-to-date we were under budget for sales and use tax, ridership and fare revenue.  He said YTD we were down 1.8%, 4.3% and 1.7% respectively.  For the month we were down 8%, 7.1% and 4%.

Doug MacLeod stated that December is usually our best month for sales and use tax so staff was surprised to see it at 8% under budget.  He shared that staff immediately contacted the Department of Revenue who explained that there were 1400 returns filed electronically that were corrupted.  The Department of Revenue is working to provide an estimate of how much RTD is owed from those returns.  Heather Copp commented that the hope is to count this revenue for December; however, if that is not the case then the January sales and use tax will probably be higher than expected.

Doug MacLeod stated that we have about an $11 million shortfall in revenue compared to the budget.  Heather Copp said that staff had been estimating between $8-10 million with a worst case scenario of $14 million.  She noted that even with the missing returns revenue was better than the worst case scenario.  She shared that staff had made provisions to cover this shortfall.  She indicated that as soon as the books were closed she would provide the Board with the actual budget shortfall.

Director Archuleta wondered how we count extra money that someone might pay in fare.  For example, if the fare should be $2.60 and a person puts in $3.00, he asked how the extra $0.40 is recorded.  Doug MacLeod said that the extra money is not really recorded.  Bus drivers record if someone pays a fare but not if they pay too much.

Director Sisk inquired if RTD had a claim against the State in terms of fiduciary responsibility as these corrupted records have really affected our finances.  Heather Copp explained that something like corrupted files are items that they do not have much control over.  She does not think there are any claims against the State but the State will owe RTD interest.  Director Sisk asked staff to look to make sure RTD does not have a claim.

Director Solano shared that several months ago he received a copy of a whitepaper produced by St. Louis Metro Bus Service about analytic measures they use that are not used at RTD.  He believes these are good analytical tools that should be utilized and asked staff to look into it.  He said he could provide a copy of the whitepaper if needed.

Committee Chair Menten wondered if there would actually be a difference in our sales and use tax after the Department of Revenue reviewed the corrupted files.  Heather Copp stated that staff was unsure at this time.  She said the returns were statewide returns so many may not be within the District; however, because the numbers were so low compared to what staff was expecting they do believe it will make some difference.

Committee Chair Menten asked when staff would come back to the Board with budget adjustments for 2016.  Heather Copp anticipates that 2016 will be lower than what is budgeted based on the trend of the past 6 months.  She said that staff will come back with an amended budget in the June/July timeframe.

Committee Chair Menten asked staff to send the Board the updated sales and use tax numbers as soon as it was available.

#### 4. Quarterly Investment Report

Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments, noted that the report was included in the February 9, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.  He shared that it was an interesting quarter in the bond market with the Federal Reserve raising rates.  He stated that investment return outperformed both indexes; however, for the enhanced cash tier both the benchmark and RTD’s enhanced cash had negative returns for the 4th quarter.  Year-to-Date both the liquidity tier and enhanced cash tier were positive.

There were no questions from the Directors.

##### a. INVESTMENT REPORT DEC 2015

#### 5. SmartCard Project Update

Heather Copp shared that out of the 913 people that were participating in the pilot, 495 cards had been loaded for a total of $31,900.  The total boardings using Smart Cards were 5,160 for an average fare of $2.21.  She shared that the steering committee has agreed to issue up-to another 1,000 cards next week and the following week as staff felt more cards were needed to gather meaningful feedback.

Heather Copp noted that negotiations with King Sooper’s were supposed to start after the Super Bowl; however, they have asked that this be delayed until March.  She noted the following status changes from the report:

- Day Pass Printers changed to yellow until the random issues that have been periodically happening are systematically addressed

- Handheld Smart Media Readers changed to yellow as staff is monitoring this closely since RTD is relying on two vendors and on-time delivery of the iPhones

- Stabilization and Enhancement of Current Operating Pass System was changed to yellow as previously we have seen issues when people return to college so staff wants to monitor this

Heather Copp stated that there are several new items that were added to the report as well: the public facing portal enhancements, back office portal enhancements, and University of Colorado A Line SmartCard Validators and Fare Equipment installation.

Director Sisk asked if the Board should be concerned about the statuses that changed from green to yellow or if staff was just being overly cautious.  Heather Copp explained that staff wanted to make sure they were being very transparent.  She indicated that even though these are just routine issues the team thinks it better to err on the side of caution and keep the Board informed.

Director Sisk wondered what he should tell people who ask him when the SmartCards will be fully implemented.  Heather Copp stated that the deadline for people to be able to get SmartCards loaded online or at our sales outlets is June 30 and for passes it is December 30.

Director Deadwyler inquired how staff is advertising that the SmartCards will be available June 30 as she has many people asking her.  Heather Copp stated that advertising would not begin until closer to rollout.

Director Deadwyler asked if it was a possibility that we would miss the deadline.  Heather Copp indicated that it was “all hands on deck” everyone was working toward that deadline.  Director Deadwyler said she hopes that is the case as many of her constituents are excited to get the $0.25 discount.  Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, pointed out that there is already a $0.25 discount built into the Access-a-Ride fares.  Fixed-route passengers can take advantage of the discount through the purchase of ticketbooks until SmartCards are available to the general public.

#### 6. Denver Union Station Update

Heather Copp indicated that information on Denver Union Station was included in the February 9, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet to provide the Board with further information.

There were no questions from the Directors.

### D. Other Matters

Director Bagley reminded the Directors about an email sent regarding additional classes that the Financial Administration and Audit department planned to host.  He asked if staff could provide more information as he believes it is critical for the Board to understand RTD’s finances.  Heather Copp explained that there had been quite a few Directors who approached her about wanting more time to really dive into certain parts of the Strategic Budget Plan, revenue, etc. so staff put together several classes.  She hopes the Board will be able to take advantage of them as she is very excited to offer them.  Paula Perdue, Executive Director to the Board of Directors, said she would send additional information to the Board as the dates got closer but they would be starting in March.  These workshops are listed on the Board Two Week Calendar.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Menten adjourned the meeting at 7:20 p.m.
