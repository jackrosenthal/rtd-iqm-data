Long-Term Funding

 Effective with the 2013 Fiscal Year, the Board-approved funding policy was changed
from a percent of payroll (9% cap) to the actuary’s recommended contribution amount up
to a $3.1M annual cap
 The change in funding policy was considered more prudent given the Plan’s decreasing active
population and resulting reduction in future expected payroll

 The 2013 policy was established with the goal of achieving 100% funding within 20 years (by
2033) assuming all future actuarial assumptions were realized

 Due to poor investment performance in 2015 and a significant salary loss in 2014, the
Plan is not projected to achieve 100% funding with a $3.1M contribution cap
 In November 2015, the Board amended the funding policy to provide a contribution amount

based on the recommendation of both the actuary and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer; the
amount may be less than the actuary’s recommended contribution
 The Board approved a $4.1M contribution for 2016. The actuary’s recommended contribution

was $6.8M.

1.C.1.a

 Last year, based on the January 1, 2014 valuation and an estimated net investment
return for 2014 of 7.0%, the Plan was projected to reach 100% funding in 2031 with a
$3.1M contribution cap assuming all assumptions are met in the future
 What changed since last year?
 The Plan experienced a $3.5M salary loss in 2014 (8.21% average salary increase for

continuing actives compared to an expected weighted average increase of 4.0%)
 The salary assumption was revised to an average weighted salary increase of 5.0% effective
January 1, 2015 to reflect anticipated wage increases
 Increased the Accrued Liability by 2.1% and the Normal Cost by 12.1%
 The investment return in 2015 fell well short of the 7.50% assumption – the investment

consultant estimates a net return of -0.5% for 2015

Long-Term Funding (Continued)

1.C.1.a

 Reflecting January 1, 2015 valuation results and a -0.5% return on assets for 2015, if all
actuarial assumptions are met each year, including a net investment return of 7.5% per
year beginning in 2016, and annual contributions equal the recommended contribution
up to a $4.1M annual cap:
 The recommended contribution is projected to temporarily decrease from $6.8M in the 2016
Fiscal Year, but increase in later years as cumulative contributions fall short of recommended
contributions and the amortization period declines
 The recommended contribution is expected to exceed $4.1M through the 2043 Fiscal Year

(when there is no projected unfunded liability)
 The Plan is projected to reach 100% funding in 2043
 Alternative funding scenarios are shown in the accompanying graphs

 Due to the Plan’s size and nature, future investment returns have a significant impact on
projected liabilities – we will keep the Board apprised of the impact of the Plan’s

investment performance on future costs

January 1, 2015 Valuation Highlights
(the plan is in funding peril)

Ã Contributions are not sufficient to fund the liabilities
• The amount of insufficiency has improved
• Total actuarial requirement is 25.21% (prior year was 27.14%) ; 18.0% scheduled for receipt

in 2015

• The contribution deficiency decreased, from 11.14% of payroll to 7.21%

Ã Fund is projected to be fully depleted by 2040; last year was 2036 and the

prior year was 2032

• Assuming 6% earnings the depletion date is 2035; at 8% there is no depletion date in the 30

year projection period

Ã Actuarial Accrued Liability increased by $1.0 million
• From $426.3 million to $427.3 million

Ã Actuarial Value of Assets returned 7.36%, exceeding the assumed 7.0%
• Increased by $4.6 million, from $207.4 million to $212.0 million
• Market value increased from $213.0 million to $214.5 million

January 1, 2015 Valuation Highlights
(the plan is in funding peril)

Ã Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability decreased by $3.5M
• From $218.8M to $215.3 million
• This decreased the actuarially determined contribution

3
Packet Pg. 17

January 1, 2015 Valuation Highlights
Ã The normal cost decreased from 11.81% of pay (including admin expenses)

to 10.79%

• The scheduled contribution is 18% of pay

Ã Actuarially determined contribution (ADC) decreased by 1.93% of pay
• Decrease due to investment gains, salary increases less than expected and retirements fewer

than expected (with that related assumption change)

• ADC will keep increasing as the actuarially determined contributions are “missed”

Ã Funded ratio increased from 48.7% funded on an actuarial basis to 49.6%
Ã Total active participant count increased by 106
• From 1,581 to 1,687
• New hires will continue to “bend down” the normal cost, so more funding can go to the

unfunded accrued liability

Long-Term Funding-Reforms to
improve the plan
Ã Total ARC is 25.21% of payroll compared to the total scheduled contribution

rate of 18.00% of payroll.
Ã Amendment #22 was adopted in 2010 with the following changes in effect for
participants hired on or after January 1, 2011 (Tier 2):
• New benefit schedule listed in Section 6.01 of the Plan provisions
• Vesting is changed from 5 years to 10 years
• The benefit multiplier is changed from 2.5% to 1.0%
• Unreduced retirement is changed from age 55 with 20 years of service to age 60 with 20 years of service
• Early retirement reduction is changed from 5.0% from age 55 to 2.5% from age 60
• The maximum service included in the benefit calculation is reduced from 30 years to 25 years
• Sick and vacation payouts are no longer included in the pension benefit calculation
• Interest on employee contributions is changed from 5% to 3%

Ã Due to amendment #22, a drop in the normal cost rate is expected as new

hires enter the plan.

• The normal cost last year was 11.81% and this year it is 10.79%

Long-Term Funding
Considerations
Ã If all actuarial assumptions are met each year, including a net investment

return of 7.0% per year, and annual contributions equal those stated in the
tentative agreement:
• Assets will be fully depleted by 2040

Ã Members are not retiring as quickly as assumed
• Based on a five year history, 745 members were expected to elect normal (non reduced)

retirement and 185 were expected to elect early retirement.
• 194 elected normal retirement and 40 elected early retirement
• The retirement probabilities have been changed to reflect this slow down in retirement

9
Packet Pg. 23

RTD/ATU Summary
Ã There are positive signs that the pension reforms are working
• Decrease in the normal cost rate
• Decrease in the actuarially determined contribution
• Improvement in the funded ratio
• Gained four more years in the future depletion date (have gained 8 years in the past two

years)

Ã But the plan is “not out of the woods yet”.
• Projections (based on an assumed 7% return) still show depletion in 2040
• This is a highly volatile calculation; one year of poor returns could bring that number much

closer to today

(1) The majority of debt interest payments occur on December 1st therefore variance will correct by year end
(2) Increase due to drawing funds from the TIFIA loan (TIFIA loan of $280m has been fully drawn) and issuance of 2015 COPs.
(3) Increase is due to funds being set aside for semi-annual debt service payments
(4) Variance is due to a timing difference between construction expenditures and bond and COP draws. Bond and COP draws will replenish this by year-end.
(5) Increase is due to the increase to fund balances per the 2015 amended budget
(6) Decrease will be replenished with draws on Bond and COP project funds at year-end

Information

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the fourth quarter of 2015 attached.
On December 16, 2015, for the first time since 2006, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee
announced that it would increase short term interest rates by 0.25%, into the range of 0.25% to 0.50%
from the range of 0.00% to 0.25%. The committee noted that “in light of the current shortfall of
inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its
inflation goal.” Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to maintain maximum
employment and price stability. The Federal Reserve finished winding down its$85 billion a month bond
purchase program in October, 2014.
The impact to the bond market was as expected in that as interest rates rose, the value of existing
bonds fell because newly issued bonds now have higher interest rates. This relationship between bond
yield and bond price is demonstrated in the following graphic:

The decrease in value of existing bonds will be reflected in RTD’s financial statements as of
12/31/2015, however since RTD generally holds bonds that it owns until maturity, actual losses are not
expected to be realized. The decrease in value is also reflected in the total return (yield plus change in
value) performance of RTD’s investments and their correlating benchmarks.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics

Packet Pg. 32

1.C.4

to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

4th Quarter

RTD cash and cash equivalents:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 3-month U.S. T-Bill Index

-0.051%

0.486%
0.296%

Enhanced Cash Tier:
RTD enhanced cash:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index:

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through 2015 was 0.50% which produced earnings of
$1,103,437. The current yield for the month of December was 0.68% which would produce annualized
earnings of $1,826,619.

Board Meeting Date: February 9, 2016
Information

The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public currently
enrolled in the pubic pilot program to pay for transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored
Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards encoded with chips. These cards can be loaded with certain
dollar amounts and used much like a debit card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or
rail until the dollar amount on the card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto
the card at RTD retail outlets.
Starting the morning of Monday January 4th, cards were being dispersed to the Public Pilot Riders at the
RTD retail outlets. For the first three-weeks and as of January 24st, a total of 425 cards were issued of
which 320 (75%) were full fare and 105 (25%) were discount cards. The average initial stored value
loading is $50 with a total value loaded of $24,400. There have been 2,980 boardings using these
MyRide cards with fare value of $6,600. Of these boardings; 71% were local, 28% regional and 1%
airport.
The third party assessment found that the systems and processes are working well but did suggest
some areas to continue advancing process and service improvements. With this assessment and
recommendations of staff the AGMs decided to increase the number of participants for the public pilot.
The initial recruitment for January 1st included 913 Riders followed by a second round of recruitment for
812 Riders during the week of January 18th and an additional recruitment of 1,000 Riders the week of
February 1st is underway.

Denver Union Station Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: February 9, 2016
Information

There are two main elements associated with the improvements in the Union Station area: (1) the
construction of and improvements to transportation related elements, and (2) the renovation of the
Historic Building. The transportation related elements of the Project were overseen by the Denver
Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) and RTD’s FasTracks Union Station team. The renovation of
the Historic Building was overseen by Union Station Alliance (USA).
TRANSPORTATION
The total cost of relocating light rail, constructing commuter rail and the underground bus box, and
improving surrounding plazas was $482.4 million. Two federal loans financed $300.6 million (or 62
percent) of the project. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) loan
provided $145.6 million and the Railroad Rehabilitation & Improvement Financing (RRIF) program
provided the other $155.0 million.
In 2010, as part of the loan repayment agreement between RTD and DUSPA, RTD issued a 30 year,
5.85 percent bond with a par value of $168.0 million. Debt service of $12.0 million is remitted by
RTD to DUSPA annually for debt service associated with the TIFIA and RRIF loans. The City of
Denver (CCD) also remits to DUSPA property and sales and use taxes from a special district created
specifically for the debt service of the two loans. When both loans are paid in full, RTD’s annual
bond obligation ceases and CCD retains the revenues from the special taxing district.
Current taxes generated in the special district are far outweighing projections made at the beginning
of the project in 2009. As such, if current economic conditions continue, the TIFIA and RRIF loans
are now projected to be paid off 14 years ahead of schedule. From an RTD cash flow perspective,
the prepayment of these loans by 2026 translates to a reduction in cash outflows of $162.1 million
between the years 2027 to 2040.
HISTORIC BUILDING
In December 2012, RTD entered into a 60 year lease with USA which includes the option of
renewing the lease’s initial term for two successive periods of 20 years and 19 years, for a total of
possible lease term of 99 years. As part of the lease, RTD is entitled to 7.5 percent of all gross
revenues exceeding $12 million from hotel operations (including the Terminal Bar, Cooper Lounge,
Pigtrain Coffee and event income) and rents received by USA from their tenants.
Similar to the tax receipts trend above, actual rental income to be received by RTD is outweighing
the 2009 projections. Rental income to be received by RTD from USA for 2015 is expected to be
$486,800. The 2009 projection anticipated that RTD would not receive rental income in 2015.
