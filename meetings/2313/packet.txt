CEO

Date: July 9, 2015

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

Board Meeting Date: July 28, 2015

Subject:

Recommendation for Passage of Resolution
Authorizing the General Manager to Execute a
Design Build Contract and other Agreements
for the Southeast Rail Extension

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
resolution authorizing the Chair of the RTD Board of Directors and the General Manager, whether interim
or permanent, or their officers or delegates to execute grant agreements, a two phase design-build
contract, intergovernmental agreements (IGAs), purchase and sale contracts, documents evidencing
property interests, and such other agreements as are necessary or appropriate for the construction of the
Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) and to accept third party contributions and increase the project budget
by such third party contribution amounts to implement third party requested betterments, all according
to the terms set forth in the Resolution.
BACKGROUND
On February 21, 2012 the RTD Board of Directors approved selection of a locally preferred alternative
following an environmental study mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as a
prerequisite to seeking federal funding for the SERE. The Board authorized RTD to apply to enter into the
federal new starts grant funding process with the goal of a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) on
August 28, 2012. A Record of Decision (ROD) for the project was issued by the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) on October 17, 2014. FTA has since issued a ROD and has authorized the project
for each phase of development that is a statutory prerequisite to obtaining an FFGA, and the executive
branch of the federal government has included SERE in each report and budget necessary to maintain
FFGA eligibility. RTD anticipates receipt of an FFGA in the first half of 2016.
The Chair and staff members will be required to sign acceptance of the FFGA and other federal grants.
On July 15, 2014 the RTD Board of Directors authorized staff to submit an amendment to the DRCOG
Baseline Report on FasTracks, which contained a listing of projects that would serve as the basis for
inclusion in the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). The Southeast Rail Extension was approved to
be included in this list in order to maintain eligibility for and support the RTD intent to seek federal
funding to construct the SERE.
The RTD Board of Directors authorized staff to issue a request for proposals for a design build contract
for construction SERE.
Responses were received from several qualified teams and a team
recommendation is described below.
Throughout the NEPA, funding, and procurement processes RTD staff have been engaged in negotiations
with the City of Lone Tree (Lone Tree), Ridgegate Investments, Inc. (Ridgegate), owner of significant
amounts of needed right of way, and Rampart Range Metropolitan District (RRMD), an additional
property owner, regarding project development.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Based on evaluation criteria and processes discussed below RTD staff recommends selection of a
design-build contractor and execution of a two phase contract, the construction phase of which will be
dependent on receipt of an FFGA.
Lone Tree is prepared to contribute funds of $25 million to the project and property interests necessary
for construction and operation on entry into an IGA as more fully described below.
RRMD is prepared to contribute property interests necessary for construction and operation on entry into
an IGA as more fully described below.
Ridgegate is prepared to contribute property interests necessary for construction and operation on entry
into a Purchase and Sale Agreement and supplemental agreements and deeds as more fully described
below.
DISCUSSION
The FFGA
Following completion of NEPA work and selection by the RTD Board of a locally preferred alternative,
RTD requested authority from FTA to enter into the first phase of Project Development which is
Preliminary Engineering. FTA authorized the first phase of Project Development in April 2013. Following
the Board’s authorization to include the project in the DRCOG RTD in July 2014 RTD requested
authorization to enter the Engineering Phase of Project Development in September 2014 which was
granted. The President’s budget for 2016 included the project, indicating that FTA is planning to issue
an FFGA next year. RTD hopes to receive the FFGA in the first half of 2016. The Chair and members of
RTD will be required to execute the FFGA as it is a contract between FTA and RTD. It obligates RTD to
complete the project within a specific time frame, to follow all federal terms and conditions including
Buy America, Davis Bacon Wages, construction of the project defined through the NEPA analysis and to
be responsible for all costs other than the FFGA contribution.
The Design-Build Contract
The Southeast Rail Extension is a 2.3 mile double track extension of light rail from the existing Lincoln
Station to a new end of line station south of Ridgegate Parkway. There will be two additional new
stations as well as three bridge structures.
After completing 65% design using RTD engineering staff, RTD embarked on a two-step procurement
process in November 2014 to select a Design-Build Contractor for the Southeast Rail Extension.
Requests for Qualifications (RFQ) were provided to the contracting community on November 17, 2014.
On January 16, 2015, RTD received 7 Statement of Qualifications (SOQ). Following a two week review
process, RTD shortlisted the following teams to receive an invitation to propose on the project in the
form of Request for Proposals (RFP):
1) Kiewit with Hatch Mott McDonald and Mass Electric
2) Balfour Beatty with Parsons Brinckerhoff
3) Stacy and Witbeck/Herzog Joint Venture with STV and Wadsworth
4) Graham/Kraemer Joint Venture with Stantec
The Request for Proposals were sent to the four teams on February 27, 2015 with the deadline for
proposals set for May 15, 2015. One on one meetings were held with each of the proposing teams
during the proposal period. Additionally RTD received numerous questions from each team as well as
Alternative Technical Concepts (ATC’s). On April 27, 2015, RTD provided final responses to all
questions and ATC’s in the form of a final addendum to the RFP.
On May 15, 2015, RTD received proposals from all four shortlisted teams. RTD staff evaluated and
scored the proposals based on the following four areas:
1) Technical Approach, Technical Innovation and Creativity (35 Points)

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

2) Management Approach, Experience and Approach (10 Points)
3) DBE/SBE/WIN Approach (10 Points)
4) Cost Proposal (45 Points)
In addition to this evaluation, a group of stakeholders also reviewed the proposals and provided their
input in the form of pros and cons.
The evaluation of the Technical, Management, and Cost Proposals were conducted separately. After
review and scoring by each Technical and Management Working Groups, those scores were provided to
a Technical Subcommittee which then prepared a recommendation to the Evaluation Committee which
consisted of members of RTD’s Senior Leadership Team. At the Evaluation Committee Meeting, the
results of the Technical and Management Approach Working Groups were combined with the scoring of
the Cost Proposal Working Group.
The Balfour Beatty/Parson Brinckerhoff team scored the highest with a score of 83.31, rating number
one in Technical, SBE and Cost, and number two in Management. Their price is $139,769,254.00,
which is also the lowest of the proposers.
The following basic components are included in the contract:
1) Lump Sum Contract Price.
2) RTD set a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goal of 20% for design and 24% for
construction. The contractor has committed to exceed those goals by an additional .5% each.
The contractor has also presented a plan to include to a voluntary Small Business Enterprise
(SBE) goal of 6%.
3) The Project hiring goals for Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) graduates are as follows:
a. Professional Service – Goal 8.5%: Participants may perform professional services such
as design, quality control, quality assurance, surveying, contract administration,
easement acquisition, and public information duties.
b. Skilled Craft – Goal 13.11%: Participants should perform skilled construction related
activities such as carpentry, masonry, iron worker, equipment operator, mechanic
work, or similar skilled construction work.
4) Davis-Bacon and Buy America Requirements – The contractor will be required to use DavisBacon wage rates and comply with Buy America Requirements.
The Lone Tree IGA
Lone Tree has agreed to be responsible for the cash contribution of $25 million for the construction of
SERE. RTD has been advised that other parties benefitting from the project will be contributing to the
$25 million but RTD will need to sign an IGA with only one entity, Lone Tree, to receive those funds.
The IGA will allow Lone Tree to use federal grant funds that would not otherwise have been available to
RTD as part of its payment. Funds will be paid over a three year period anticipated to meet RTD’s
construction cash flow needs. In addition to the cash contribution, Lone Tree is contributing property
rights in the form of deeds and non-revocable licenses to property worth about $50,000 in addition to
the cash. It is also contributing staff time and waiving permit fees with an estimated value of
$150,000.00. In consideration for the Lone Tree contributions and as a prerequisite to their receipt, RTD
must receive the FFGA and award a contract for the construction of the project. If RTD has not started
revenue service by 2020 it must reimburse Lone Tree unless RTD continues to make diligent progress.
Lone Tree is entitled to review all project plans, and all facilities that require local government permitting
will be subject to Lone Tree’s codes, ordinances and standards. The IGA also commits that RTD is
building some temporary drainage and roadway facilities that will be replaced with shared or public
facilities as additional infrastructure is developed in Lone Tree.
The RRMD IGA
The RRMD IGA Rampart Range Metropolitan District, a political subdivision of the State of Colorado is
conveying property required for construction of the line, subject to RTD’s consummation of its

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1

transactions with Ridgegate for its property and receipt of the FFGA. RTD estimates the value of the
property being donated by RRMD is over $800,000.
The Ridgegate Agreements
RTD will require right of way and easements from Ridgegate. RTD is acquiring a total of more than 10
acres and drainage and septic easements. The easements will be replaced with shared municipal
drainage and utilities as the area is developed. Closing on all real estate interests is contingent on RTD’s
receipt of an FFGA and proceeding with construction of the project along with satisfaction of title and
escrow matters and completion of the IGAs described above. RTD estimates the value of property being
donated by RIdgegate is about $2 million.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The current projected budget for the Southeast Rail Extension is $233.1 million. This total includes
$34.4 million that was spent through the end of 2014 on environmental analysis, preliminary
engineering and design, and the acquisition of eight light rail vehicles for the project.
The remaining budget for the project from 2015-2019 is projected at $198.7 million. Funding for the
remaining costs is projected to come from the following sources:
FTA Full Funding Grant Agreement

$92.0

FTA CMAQ Funds

7.5

Cash Contribution - Local Entities per IGA

25.0

In-Kind Contribution - Local Entities per IGA

3.0

RTD Local Funding

71.2

Total Remaining Funding

$198.7

Per the current budget projections, RTD would be responsible for 35.8% of the remaining project costs.
The local funding partners would contribute 14.1% of the remaining project cost, and federal grants
would provide 50.1% of the remaining funding. The RTD funding is included in the 2014 Board adopted
FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation and is programmed over the construction period.
Board authorization for Phase I of the Project will allow expenditures up to $24.4 million for design,
related staff costs, and some land acquisition costs from parties other than Lone Tree, Ridgegate and
RRMD. A transfer of $15,180,408 from the FasTracks Management Reserve to the project budget is
also included in the Resolution to cover a portion of the Phase I costs. The remainder of the $24.4
million will be included in the 2016 budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the
attached resolution authorizing the Chair of the RTD Board of Directors and the General Manager,
whether interim or permanent, or their officers or delegates to execute grant agreements, a two
phase design-build contract, intergovernmental agreements (IGAs), purchase and sale contracts,
documents evidencing property interests, and such other agreements as are necessary or
appropriate for the construction of the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) and to accept third party
contributions and increase the project budget by such third party contribution amounts to
implement third party requested betterments, all according to the terms set forth in the Resolution
2. Do not pass the attached resolution. This will jeopardize receipt of an FFGA and construction of
the project. This will put third party funding contributions including cash, right of way and staff
time in jeopardy.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and

Date: July 9, 2015

William C. Van Meter,

Date:

2015-2020 Strategic Plan

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: July 28, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the
2015-2020 RTD Strategic Plan.
BACKGROUND
The RTD Strategic Plan reflects guidance and direction from the District’s Board of Directors,
supplemented by extensive staff, stakeholder, and public input. The Plan includes material from the
2015 Board Strategic Advance, and Plan content was heavily based upon two separate sets of one-onone meetings with Board members during the first half of 2015.
Key contributions to the Plan are the result of additional outreach including the following:







Thirty employee Listening Sessions held at fifteen different locations;
An Employee Survey completed by 1,363 employees;
A meeting with the RTD Customer Panel;
Meetings with the Citizen’s Advisory Committee (April 15 and July 8, 2015);
A Local Government Planning Meeting (March 12, 2015); and
Results from the 2014 Customer Satisfaction Survey.

The Plan also reflects input from the Board’s June 30, 2015 Study Session.
The Strategic Plan is organized around seven overall strategies reflecting RTD’s mission. These are:
 Customer Service
 Safety
 Financial Sustainability
 Equity and Accessibility
 System Optimization
 Technological Innovation
 Workforce
Each strategy is accompanied by a goal statement, narrative describing the strategic theme in more
detail, and a set of initiatives that articulate short-, medium-, and long-term implementation. Most of
these initiatives are ongoing in nature, and will be a continuous effort during the five-year plan timeframe. Some of the initiatives involve actions that may not come to fruition until beyond the five-year
time-frame but warrant action now.
The Strategic Plan represents a Board-initiated and adopted document that singularly incorporates longerterm policies, complementing other Board efforts and actions. For example, tactical plans such as the
Strategic Budget Plan, FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation, Annual Budget, and Annual Board/Senior
Leadership Team Strategic Planning advance are at a more immediate implementation level while the
Strategic Plan looks at the next five years and well beyond.

Packet Pg. 47

2.B.1

Strategic Plan Implementation will take place in a number of ways. A subsequent document will
describe performance measures to monitor and report on the success of Plan initiatives. In addition, the
Strategic Plan will be referenced during preparation of Board Reports, the Annual Budget, and the
Strategic Budget Plan. Finally, the Board will review the Strategic Plan annually during the Strategic
Planning Advance to check on timeframes, relevance, and content of the seven key strategies identified
in this document.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Financial impact attributable to Strategic Plan initiatives has previously been incorporated or will be
considered in the Annual Budget, Strategic Budget Plan, and/or FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation as
appropriate.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the 2015-2020 RTD Strategic Plan.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action.

The exhibit on this page provides the context for the Strategic Plan within RTD’s overall planning and budgeting process. As shown,
the Strategic Plan represents the District’s long-term strategy and vision, carefully integrated with the Board’s short-term goals
established during the annual Strategic Planning Advance.
The Plan is organized around seven overall strategies serving RTD’s mission. Each strategy is accompanied by a goal statement,
narrative describing the strategic theme in more detail, and a set of initiatives that articulate short-, medium-, and long-term
implementation. Most of these initiatives are ongoing in nature, and will be a continuous effort during the five-year plan time-frame.
Some of the initiatives involve actions that may not come to fruition until beyond the five-year time frame, but warrant action now.

FOREWORD
On behalf of the RTD Board of Directors, we adopt the 2015 Strategic
Plan. This Plan reflects the Board’s collective vision for the District
– for both the next five years, and for decades to come as well. The
Board has identified seven strategies that help frame the District’s
big-picture goals, accompanied by initiatives to implement them. This
Plan clearly and simply articulates those goals for our employees,
stakeholders, and most of all, our passengers.
RTD is a complex organization, relying on hundreds of employees to serve nearly 3 million
people spread over 2,340 square miles across the Denver metro area. This complexity,
however, does not obscure the simple strategies and goals that are paramount to the District:
customer service, safety, and financial sustainability. To these we provide additional strategies
and goals that amplify and support our fundamental, basic mission. Included among these is
our commitment to implement the FasTracks program approved by the voters in 2004.
It is the Board’s hope that the Strategic Plan will be our guiding, aspirational document detailing
how we will move forward together. In my previous role as a city Mayor, we always turned to
our comprehensive plan to influence important land use decisions. The Strategic Plan should
serve a similar purpose, helping us make sound choices that direct and shape what RTD is,
what RTD does, and why we do it. This Plan focuses on the next five years, yet looks far into the
future, and we will revisit it periodically as circumstances warrant. The Board is committed to
making decisions based on sound public policy, and the Strategic Plan is a key tool in doing so.

RTD MISSION STATEMENT

RTD Interim General Manager Dave Genova
RTD was created in 1969 by the Colorado General Assembly to
develop, operate, and maintain a mass transportation system. Since
then, the District has made strategic decisions based upon careful
budget planning, attracting and retaining a talented workforce,
and never losing sight of our commitment to our customers and
safety. From our beginnings as a bus company, we have added light
rail, transformed Denver Union Station, and witnessed extensive
development around our transit stations. The FasTracks program,
which will add more light rail, new commuter rail, and new bus rapid transit, is carving an
unmistakable mark on the Denver metro area. It is now time to adopt a Strategic Plan to
move us into the next five years and beyond.
Between 2016 and 2020, RTD will undergo another period of transition as significant
portions of the FasTracks program begin revenue service, and the bulk of our current major
capital expansion program winds down. The Strategic Plan will be an important document
as we move through this transition, since it identifies seven key strategies to focus our
attention. We will build upon a solid foundation, particularly in the safety area, which the
overwhelming majority of RTD employees understand is RTD’s top priority. Additionally,
this plan details how we will enhance customer service, use technology to improve
the customer experience, optimize our growing system, continue to ensure financial
sustainability, and maintain a dynamic workforce. Join me as we maintain RTD’s position as
one of the top transit agencies in the country and continue our strong legacy of providing
safe, reliable transportation to the region.

To meet our constituents’ present and future public transportation needs by providing safe,
clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective service throughout the District.

Customer Service
Deliver safe, reliable,
and efficient transit
service District-wide.
Engage our customers
to improve services in
an open and transparent
manner.

RTD’s customer experience has to be safe and reliable for RTD
to continue to maintain and grow its customer base. On-time
performance and service reliability will allow RTD to build a
competitive edge within the regional transportation system
as vehicular travel becomes increasingly difficult in the future.
Having a seamless interface between all RTD services—whether
it be bus, Access-a-Ride, light rail or commuter rail—should be a
high priority to ensure RTD customer satisfaction. RTD customers
must feel comfortable and safe on any RTD service, whether it is
run by RTD or one of its contractors.

Attachment: RTD_Stategic_Plan_layout_v9 (2441 : Strategic Plan)

Strategy:
Deliver CustomerOriented Service

Responding to customer needs is important in the 21st century.
As rider expectations evolve, RTD must endeavor to meet their
needs with a growing emphasis on technology and immediate,
reliable information. It will be critical for RTD to proactively
engage our customers to seek ways to improve our service,
and to be transparent about the realities of how we operate
our services. Finding new and improved ways to engage
our customers will allow RTD to stay ahead of the curve and
anticipate rather than react to customer needs.

Safety
Continue to develop
new approaches and
new technologies to create
safer environments for our
riders and our workforce.
Establish best practices
with safety partners to
develop a performancedriven safety culture.

“RTD is the best transit agency in
the country because of our great
team of employees and what you
do every day to safely deliver our
mission.”

RTD recognizes that management and employee commitment is
the hallmark of a true safety culture, where safety is an integral
part of daily operations. To support safety’s priority in the agency,
RTD will strengthen accountability systems and promote a safety
culture. Safety accountability includes establishing safety goals,
measuring safety activity, eliminating hazards and unsafe work
behaviors, and proactively improving the safety environment.

Attachment: RTD_Stategic_Plan_layout_v9 (2441 : Strategic Plan)

Strategy:
Foster a Safety Culture

In the recent employee survey more than 70% of employees
responded favorably to questions about RTD’s safety priorities
(72%), the safety of their work life (76%) and the ease with which
they can report safety concerns (84%). Still, maintaining safe
service requires constant vigilance and collaboration throughout
the agency. Through the Strategic Plan, RTD looks to improve
customer and employee safety by encouraging respectful
collaboration founded on mutual trust. RTD has an organizational
commitment to establish the core value of safety. RTD will
further promote a positive safety culture where values, attitudes,
competencies and patterns of behavior will improve the health
and safety of employees and customers. RTD will continue to
build on an already robust safety culture through enhanced
employee engagement. Ultimately, safety is each employee’s
responsibility.

responsible use of funding
and proactively pursue
partnerships to supplement
District resources. Strengthen
fiscal resiliency and explore
financial innovation to keep
the system in a state of
good repair and deliver
better service.

RTD has the responsibility to use taxpayer and passenger dollars
to provide the best possible public transit service. To consistently
deliver excellent services and projects, RTD must maintain
financial stability. Multi-year financial planning is vital to ensure
that capital and service visions become realities. The agency can
augment its finances by maximizing the revenues it generates
through operations and by exploring new sources of income.
Traditional funding sources alone will be insufficient to meet
the long-term needs of the future RTD system. RTD must also
continue to seek out non-traditional partnerships with public and
private sector partners to leverage outside funds.

Resiliency and Explore

Even as RTD employs asset management programs and
endeavors to keep the system in a state of good repair,
ongoing investment must be sustained to keep its vehicles and
infrastructure functioning and to maintain a robust system. These
assets often require more frequent maintenance to ensure
safety and ongoing functionality, which puts a growing burden
on the operating budget. Reliable and sustainable funding will
be absolutely necessary for RTD to make the critical investments
that the region needs. A long-term comprehensive funding
plan that takes into account both operating and capital needs is
essential to creating a robust, modern transit system.

A balanced approach to accessing RTD facilities will be important
in order to continue to expanding and increase RTD’s customer
base. Active transportation options such as walking, biking, car
share, and ride share should be embraced as viable alternatives
to access RTD facilities in addition to personal vehicles and buses.
Improved first and final mile connections through partnerships with
local jurisdictions, developers and other entities are essential to
expanding multi-modal access and growing ridership.
Continued improvement of access for people with disabilities is
important to preserve mobility for those with limited options.
Best efforts to adhere to the American with Disabilities Act
(ADA) Standards for Accessible Design at all RTD facilities,
and continued improvement of efficiency of RTD’s Access-a-

Ride service and ADA access to fixed route service, are key to
preserving mobility for the disabled community.
Promoting the creation of diverse transit oriented communities
around our facilities serves RTD well by improving accessibility
near stations and expanding RTD’s ridership base. Local
jurisdictions have prioritized development around RTD facilities
as means to direct future growth. RTD should proactively partner
with local jurisdictions and others to leverage this planning vision
and create vibrant, walkable areas around stations. In creating
these transit oriented communities, RTD needs to be sensitive to
community issues such as affordable housing and transportation,
and should work with local jurisdictions and others to find
solutions to promote neighborhood diversity.

RTD began as a bus company and has expanded with the Central,
Southwest, Southeast, Central Platte Valley, and West light rail
lines. The District has also added a variety of other transportation
options, including Call-n-Ride, Access-a-Ride, Limited stop bus
services, Express and Regional bus services, and an extensive
Park-n-Ride system.

Strategy:
Optimize Service
Delivery
Balance competing
mobility needs across
the District to provide
service in the most efficient
manner possible. Work with
partners to develop, fund
and complete FasTracks and
increase ridership.

The FasTracks program represents one of the most ambitious,
large-scale transit expansion programs ever undertaken in
the United States. The combination of light rail, commuter rail,
downtown circulation, and bus rapid transit capital investment
projects—as well as Denver Union Station and its integrated
transit oriented development—is destined to transform the
Denver metropolitan region. A key effort over the next five
years will be to carefully integrate the FasTracks projects into
our existing bus and rail system.

2010

2012

While most of FasTracks will be in service by 2020, key
components of the program will likely not be completed. During
the next five years, the District is committed to exploring financial
and implementation strategies to keep these unfinished projects
in the forefront to fully realize the voters’ 2004 vision. It is
unlikely that RTD can fully fund these projects from FasTracks
sales tax revenues in the near term, so partnerships with local
governments and private companies will become an integral
component of the funding strategy.
FasTracks, however, will not meet all the transit demands
expected during the longer time horizon of 15 to 25 years.
These 2040 transit needs, based on Denver Regional Council
of Governments jobs and housing growth projections, must
be planned for implementation a decade or more from now.
Addressing these needs may require improving the existing
system’s capacity. Other needs will likely be met by a thorough
exploration of bus rapid transit investments throughout the
District, both on arterial streets and on State highways. Finally,
RTD will need to explore visionary approaches to linking the
District’s light rail, commuter rail, and bus rapid transit systems
with other transit systems serving the rest of the Front Range.

Employing technology can help RTD not only increase ridership
but also better manage its business, assets, and operations.
Customer expectations are changing with a shift in rider
demographics, travel patterns and needs. Meeting customer
needs means providing access to information, ensuring
connectivity with devices throughout the system, and employing
the technological innovations that have become the norm. A
public transportation system that is easy to understand and use
is not only important in attracting and retaining riders but also in
increasing market share. Technology-based customer information
tools are essential to inform riders about transit services and help
them easily navigate the RTD system.

RTD recognizes that our employees are the single most important
asset in the organization. As the baby-boomer generation
nears retirement, the agency needs an ever-greater focus on
recruiting and training employees with competitive benefits while
providing the knowledge and skills for those employees to build
their careers in public transportation. Additionally, a coordinated
effort to capture the experience and knowledge from the current
workforce will pass knowledge to the next generation.

Strategy:
Foster a Dynamic and
Sustainable Workforce

The upcoming completion of a large percentage of FasTracks will
also require that RTD examine the best use of resources to shift
focus from construction to maintaining existing and new assets.
Results from the recently-conducted employee survey show that
the agency’s focus on safety and customer service are wellestablished at every level of the organization. However, that
survey also revealed concerns about internal communication and
collaboration. RTD has made a commitment to improve two-way
communication to ensure that every employee’s voice counts.

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: JULY 14, 2015



Surface transportation programs are currently operating under a two-month policy extension that
expires on July 31.



Long-term revenue solution: Even after several hearings on the subject of transportation funding
and finance over the past month, the House and Senate tax-writing committees have not yet been
able to reach consensus on a multi-year revenue solution. Vocal opposition persists, among various
factions in Congress, to the two most often-discussed ideas: increasing the gas tax and taxing the
overseas assets of U.S. corporations (repatriation tax). As the funding impasse continues, most of
the surface transportation authorizing (i.e., policy-making) committees of the House and Senate have
refrained from moving multi-year legislation.



Short-term revenue solution: Accordingly, there is broad resignation among stakeholders that
Congress will pass another short-term extension of surface transportation programs before the July
31 deadline. Any bill would likely extend funding at current-year levels, paid for by another General
Fund transfer to the HTF. The only real question is the duration of the extension.

FY 2016 Transportation/HUD Appropriations Bill:


The Senate Appropriations Committee on June 24 approved a spending bill to fund the programs of
US DOT for the fiscal year beginning on October 1. In the absence of an authorization bill for FY
2016, the Senate bill maintains current-year funding levels for transit formula programs funded from
the HTF, but makes cuts from current-year levels for several General Fund programs, including the
Capital Investment Grants (“New Starts”) program. (The full House passed its own THUD bill in
early June.)



Committee Democrats objected to the funding levels in bill, urging their Republican counterparts to
fund programs at levels that would require the Committee to exceed the sequester-imposed funding
levels for this year, in violation of this year’s budget agreement. The White House and Congressional
Democrats continue to insist that sequester cuts cannot be accepted, but Republicans in both the
House and Senate are drafting all spending bills to fit within FY 2016 sequester levels.



So what’s next? Congress must act by the end of September to pass the 12 annual appropriations
bills that keep government programs and agencies funded. It is likely lawmakers will pass a shortterm omnibus spending bill in late September that maintains current funding levels for Federal
programs and buys Appropriators more time to work out a bipartisan budget deal on full-year
spending levels.
