BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: June 8, 2016

From:

Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General
Manager, Capital Programs

GM

Date:

June 8, 2016

Board Meeting Date: June 28, 2016

Subject:

Extension of Aconex Contract to 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents necessary to award a three-year
contract in the amount of $695,400, with three one-year options at $167,000 each in the total amount
not too exceed $1,196,400 to Aconex for Construction and Operational Management Software as a
Service. Funding for this contract was included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation, and will be
appropriated in future year budgets.
BACKGROUND
RTD’s current Aconex contract will be ending May of 2017; however, RTD will still have many ongoing
construction projects such as Eagle, I-225, SERE, North Metro as well as smaller engineering projects,
that will still be active past that date. These projects will need a document control system to capture
construction and process project closeout documentation. Also, as projects complete, Capital Programs
is required to turn over necessary operational data to Base side departments such as Commuter Rail and
Facilities Maintenance. Because these Base side departments did not have a repository to receive and
store turn over and operational documentation, an Aconex Change Order was issued in 2016 to provide
the Aconex platform to the Base side to satisfy that business requirement. Because of these ongoing
document control needs, RTD would like to extend the Aconex contract to 2020. In addition, Aconex
recognizes the benefit of having RTD as a client and has made an extension offer price that is good until
June 30, 2016. This price is close to our original contract amount and still offers RTD more usability for
the Base side departments.
DISCUSSION
Due to the number of current and future projects, the large amount of data and number of system users,
it is recommended that RTD extend the contract years to obtain a consistent document repository rather
than go out to bid on a different system. This is also the recommendation of the RTD’s Enterprise
Content Management consultant, the iQ Business Group, who is currently working with RTD to improve
our information management practices and will recommend an enterprise content management approach
later this year. Other factors include, with five of the major FasTracks projects opening this year,
Capital Programs would be hard pressed to provide the necessary resources to conduct a procurement
for another system of this type and migrate the data from over thirty-two (32) projects to another
system. Also, because many of the projects, including the new University of Colorado A-Line Commuter
Rail, have the use of Aconex set in to their contracts and/or agreements, RTD would have to work with
contractor teams on conversion to another system and provide training. By staying with the Aconex
system RTD will be able to:
 Maintain system and process continuity to its project teams and stakeholders
 Provide a system to receive track performance reports and invoice processing for the Commuter
Rail division

Packet Pg. 8

2.11.A

 Provide the Facilities Maintenance department a repository with which they are already familiar in
order to turn over closeout data for the FasTracks projects to Facilities Maintenance
 Avoid any contractual disputes with stakeholders
 Avoid migration costs and training
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total amount of the contract extension is $695,400, with three one-year options at $167,000 each
not to exceed the total amount of $1,196,400 Funding for this contract was included in the 2015
Annual Program Evaluation, and will be appropriated in future year budgets.
SBE PARTICIPATION
The RTD Small Business Opportunity Office established a 0% SBE participation goal for this project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents necessary to award
a three-year contract in the amount of $695,400, with three one-year options at $167,000 each in
the total amount not too exceed $1,196,400 to Aconex for Construction and Operational
Management Software as a Service. Funding for this contract was included in the 2015 Annual
Program Evaluation, and will be appropriated in future year budgets.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead, use RTD in-house staff and consultants to
develop a solution using RTD’s Legacy document control software and re-train users. This is not
recommended because the Legacy system does not have the necessary functionality to provide the
level of service needed to support RTD projects and departments both inside and outside our firewall.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not extend the contract and go back out to look for a
new system. This, also, is not recommended, because of the impact to the FasTracks and
Operations Departments and the level of effort it would require to conduct another Request For
Proposal (RFP). This is not recommended because Aconex presented the proposal that best meets
the evaluation criteria set forward in the RFP.

ConvergeOne

Phone

Switch

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial, Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into contract negotiations with ConvergeOne
for purchase of Avaya hardware, licenses, installation, and maintenance of RTD’s phone system. The
estimated cost of the Avaya Phone Switch Upgrade of $865,000 includes installation costs of
$355,750 which was approved in the 2016 Capital Budget and five (5) years of warranty,
maintenance and support of $509,250 which will be included in future operations and maintenance
budgets.
BACKGROUND
The Shared Technical Services Team within RTD’s Information Technology department is seeking
Board of Directors approval for the purchase of an upgrade to RTD’s Avaya Phone Switch. A phone
switch provides capabilities that channel incoming and outgoing calls and data and directs it toward
its intended destination. RTD’s current phone switch provides limited call screening and recording
capabilities. This functionality needs to be upgraded to accommodate planned service improvements
within RTD’s Customer Care Division. Moreover, by keeping RTD’s equipment current and supported,
we reduce the risk of loss of communication within RTD and with its customers while improving
needed security capabilities for RTD security staff.
With our current hardware and support offerings, RTD is facing a number of risks:
 The current equipment being utilized is a minimum of ten years old with some equipment
having been installed in 2004.
 External vendor support contract is expiring in Q3 2016.
The purpose of this project is to implement an upgraded phone switch, install modern components,
upgrade the software, and provide installation and maintenance support to RTD. This will yield the
following additional benefits:
 This implementation will allow for the recording of the Internet Protocol (IP) phones
throughout the District, with a specific benefit to the RTD security team RTD’s planned new
Telephone Information Center’s (TIC) software solution is dependent upon the phone switch
being upgraded to allow gathering of call center operational metrics including:
o Average wait times
o Queue management
o Call interrupt
o Listening capabilities
o Workforce management
 Increasing the number of licenses to help accommodate the growth of rail lines and facilities
within the District.

Packet Pg. 10

2.12.B

 Allows for voicemail/e-mail integration where individuals can screen their voice message
through their computer and/or mobile device.
DISCUSSION
The current district wide phone switch was upgraded from a Siemen’s system to an Avaya system in
2004. This equipment has reached the end of its useful life under the current configuration.
Following RTD’s Procurement process, the Information Technology department issued a Request for
Proposal and has identified an Avaya Platinum Partner in telecommunications equipment. This
proposed partnership will allow RTD the flexibility for any future expansion of services and/or
features that may arise due to rapidly changing communications platforms. As part of the Request
for Proposal, Information Technology included a request for pricing for five (5) years of maintenance
and warranty services payable annually.
The requested funds include the hardware, software and licenses necessary to upgrade the Avaya
Telecommunications switch, as well as installation, integration and training of RTD staff. The new
telecommunications phone switches will be installed within RTD Telecomm closets throughout the
District.
An RFP has been issued and a selection committee has evaluated and identified the best candidate,
ConvergeOne, to meet RTD’s needs.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of the Avaya Phone Switch Upgrade including installation, warranty, and
maintenance and support is $865,000 which includes $355,750 for capital costs for installation and
$509,250 for ongoing support. The capital costs are included in the 2016 Capital Budget and the
remaining costs will be budgeted in future years in operating expenses
ALTERNATIVES
The available alternatives include:
 Approve the contract with ConvergeOne. This is the recommended action to ensure that
RTD’s phone switch is replaced to meet current and future needs.
 Do not approve the contract with ConvergeOne. This is not the recommended action because
the current phone switch has aging equipment and will no longer be supported after Q3 2016.

BACKGROUND
The purpose of this Board Report is to request an amendment to the 2016 Adopted Budget. This
amendment will account for capital carryforward adjustments from year-end 2015 to 2016. The
amendment also will detail other adjustments to the capital budget and adjustments to the operating and
administrative budget.

Packet Pg. 15

2.12.C

DISCUSSION
Overview of the 2016 Budget Amendment
The total proposed appropriation for the 2016 Amended Budget and the changes from the 2016
Adopted Budget are summarized in the first set of tables above.
2016 Operating Expense Adjustments
The operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment reflects an
increase of $11.6 million from the 2016 Adopted Budget. This increase consists of $1.2 million on the
Base System, $10.4 million in FasTracks Project/Construction, and $0 million in FasTracks Operations
(West Line, Denver Union Station, Free MetroRide and I-225). Of the total increase for the Base
System, major elements are $2.1 million for one-time expense projects in Capital Programs (13th Avenue
crossing replacement, Bike Shelters pass-through, Wagon Road PnR improvements) and $0.4 million for
ongoing street improvements to support the runboard, $0.4 million for the labor practices settlement for
mandated overtime in Bus Operations, $1.5 million for a write-off of parts inventory sold at auction, and
$0.3 million for additional track maintenance costs and $0.3 million for rail overtime in Rail Operations.
These amounts are offset by reductions of $2.0 million for traction power in Rail Operations, $0.7
million in service costs in Access-a-Ride, and various other costs. For FasTracks, the $10.4 million
increase consists primarily of $2.5 million in utility relocation and bridge/sewer work on DUS track and
$6.9 million in third-party betterments in Aurora (funded by third party contributions). On the Base
System, the true increase to operating expenses is less than 0.5%.
Shown in detail on the attached Amendment A, major changes in Amended Budget operating expenses
(excluding previously approved transfers) are summarized by department below.
Base System
Bus Operations
 Net increase of $0.4 million for the labor dispute settlement related to mandated overtime
Access-a-Ride
 Net decrease of $0.7 million in ADA service costs
Rail Operations
 Net decrease of $1.2 million from a reduction in traction power on the West Line, offset by increases
in operator and non-operator overtime, additional track maintenance costs and software upgrades for
the LRT training simulator
Capital Programs
 Net increase of $37.9 million from Wagon Road PnR improvements, grant-funded work to replace the
13th Avenue Crossing, grant-funded bike-shelters, annual street improvements inadvertently omitted
from the Adopted Budget to support the runboard, and Facilities functions moved to Capital
Programs ($35.6 million)
Safety, Security and Asset Management
 Net decrease of $35.6 million from Facilities functions moved to Capital Programs

Packet Pg. 16

2.12.C

Finance and Administration
 Net decrease of $0.5 million from decreases in various IT project costs, training, and office rent
offset by increased funds received for Wellness Department recognition
Planning
 Net decrease of $55,000 for reduction in Art-n-Transit and Bicycle Program expense
Communications
 Net decrease of $48,000 for decrease in SmartCard promotional material costs offset by
reimbursement of other funds used for Grand Opening costs
Executive Office
 Net increase of $1.5 million for write-off of inventory to be sold at auction
Non-Departmental
 Net decrease of $0.2 million for expense pass-through grants to capital
FasTracks Project/Construction
Capital Programs
 Net increase of $9.6 million for utility relocation and bridge/sewer work on BNSF DUS track
derailment, outside reproduction and forms, and storm drainage, water line and fiber work funded by
the City of Aurora (third-party betterments)
FasTracks Operations
There were no increases to operating expense for FasTracks Operations.
Debt Service
On the Base System, interest expense is expected to increase by $0.4 million from a proposed new COP
issuance of $50.0 million for bus fleet purchases in 2016 (to include MCI Intercity buses, new
articulated buses, and transit buses scheduled in the 2018 fleet plan) but there is no change to principal
payments on debt. Capitalized interest as well is expected to show no change. Interest expense and
principal payments on FasTracks also will remain unchanged. A bond issuance of $200 million which
will generate over $228 million of proceeds for construction of SERE and the remaining rail projects
under construction (Eagle, I-225, North Metro) is proposed for the second half of 2016.
2016 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed amended budget reflects a net increase of $35.1 million over
the 2016 Adopted Budget. These changes result from program changes that have occurred since the
2016 Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
Base System
New capital changes consist of a decrease to Base of $1.8 million. Major adjustments to new capital
funding since the 2016 Adopted Budget include projected reductions in spending for the remainder of
2016 of $1.0 million for the Lafayette PnR reconstruction, $1.0 for expansion of the Treasury Building,
$0.9 million in handheld Smart reader/mobile station devices, $0.2 million in CCTV retrofit on buses,
$4.1 million for articulated buses offset by a transfer of same amount from intercity coaches, with

Packet Pg. 17

2.12.C

increases of $0.1 million for Civic Center Station rebuild, $0.5 million for mall bus charging units, and
$0.7 million for SMT stored value card implementation. Please see Attachment B for detail.
FasTracks
New capital changes to FasTracks consist of an increase of $36.9 million. This results from updated
project schedules for current projects that changed the projected expenditures in 2016, adjustments for
grant funding, changes in cost estimates, and corrections to the Adopted Budget. Major additions to
new capital funding since the 2016 Adopted Budget include $0.8 million in higher cost estimates for the
purchase of two new light rail vehicles for I-225, and $38.4 million for the North Metro Corridor which
brings the amount up to the Board-approved Annual Program Evaluation (APE). These amounts are
offset by reductions totaling $2.3 million to FasTracks admin projects and I-225 third-party betterment
work. Please see Attachment B for detail and Program Capital attached.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2016 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/15 were used to compute the
estimate of the carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of the adoption of
the annual budget. For the 2016 Amended Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 12/31/15
were used to compute the estimate of the carryforward. This takes into account expenditures that were
made in the last quarter of 2015.
Previously approved capital carryforward of $843.2 million is decreased by $243.9 million from the
2016 Adopted Budget to reflect fourth quarter 2015 actual expenditures, transfers to reclassify certain
capital projects as expense projects, previously approved transfers, completion of projects, and project
scope changes. The Base System portion is a decrease of $59.3 million and the FasTracks decrease is
$184.7 million. Please see Attachment C for detail and Program Capital attached.
Revenue Changes
In the Amended Budget, revenues are projected to decrease $46.9 million on a combined basis from the
2016 Adopted Budget.






Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $20.7 million from the 2016 Adopted
Budget based on the CU-Leeds School March forecast. The 2016 Amended Budget incorporates
the Below-Trend forecast of 5.2% over 2015 actual. The 2016 Adopted Budget used the CULeeds September Baseline forecast which called for an 8% increase over the then projected 2015
level.
On a combined basis, grant revenues including operating grants, capital grants, capital
maintenance, FASTER grants, and CMAQ grants are projected to essentially remain flat from
amounts in the 2016 Adopted Budget. This reflects an increase of $2.4 million on the Base
System in capital maintenance, fixed guideway, FASTER, and carryforward grants from the 2016
Adopted Budget, offset by decreases in CMAQ, FTA Ladders of Opportunity, and certain local
grants. FasTracks allocated grants are expected to decrease $2.5 million due to a decrease in the
amount of Small Starts grant funding for the SERE project expected to be received in 2016 offset
by increases in CMAQ funds for the Eagle project.
Fare revenue is reduced by $27.9 million on a combined basis from the 2016 Adopted Budget to
reflect: 1) an 8% fare revenue increase from the 10% fare rate hike offset by retention of
transfers, and 2) a 1.5% ridership increase from FasTracks expansion offset by the effect of the
fare rate increase. Of projected fare revenue of $130.2 million, $117.5 million is attributed to
the Base system and $12.7 million is attributed to FasTracks.

Packet Pg. 18

2.12.C



Other operating revenue will be reduced by $0.6 million due mainly to a reduction in the 2016
advertising contract. Other non-operating income at $11.8 million is projected to be slightly
higher by $0.2 million due to higher DUS rental income and naming rights offsetting the reduction
in the advertising contract.
Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance

The Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to decrease $2.4 million from the Adopted Budget
to $13.4 million reflecting amended budget expenditure increases combined with decreases in revenue.
FasTracks Contingency Reserve
The proposed 2016 Amended Budget reflects maintenance of the FasTracks Contingency Reserve at a
balance of $15.9 million, same as the 2016 Adopted Budget. This reserve is appropriated annually, and
is used to fund any changes in the FasTracks schedule that could not be forecast at the time of adoption
of the annual budget. The purpose of this reserve is to allow the District to accommodate minor
changes to the FasTracks schedule without requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from
the FasTracks Future Construction Reserve. This reserve was reduced from $30 million in 2015 to
reflect a drawdown of $14.1 million for North Metro construction.
The FasTracks Construction Reserve at $81.3 million is split between the Construction Reserve at $56.3
million and a Start-up Operations Reserve at $25 million. The Start-up Operations Reserve was
established in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation for the years 2015-2016 in order to meet the
1.2x debt service coverage if needed. These balances reflect draws totaling $18.7 million for FasTracks
continuing construction.
Budget Transfers
The proposed 2016 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and further amended on 1/1/93, 5/15/08 and
4/1/10. The policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000
require prior approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2016 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.
Fund Balance Policy
The proposed 2016 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2016 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and Unrestricted Year-End Fund
balance in the District's working capital. The objective is for the total of these three funds to equal

Packet Pg. 19

2.12.C

approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for the Base System and two
months of same for FasTracks. On the Base System, this objective is not expected to be met in the
2016 Amended Budget. The contributions to the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital Replacement
Fund on the Base System will continue at $3.0 million to each fund in 2016.
Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of principal are treated
as expenditures, and (2) depreciation and gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are
excluded.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Amend the 2016 Budget to reflect the capital project changes and the adjustments to the operating
budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2016 Budget and amend the budget with
revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2016 Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2016 Adopted Budget does
not reflect the capital carryforward adjustments, capital budget adjustments, and material changes to
the operating and administrative budget.
