BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date:

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

January 27, 2016

Board Meeting Date: February 2, 2016

Subject:

Route 324 - April 2016 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Interim General Manager that the Board of Directors amend the April 2016
Service Change package, as previously approved, to include the Route 324 – Main Street Crosstown
service changes as described below.
BACKGROUND
This proposal was initially included in the April 2016 Service Change recommendations previously
submitted to the Board of Directors by staff for approval. On January 19, 2016, staff was advised that
DRCOG had not completed the approval process to award the grant funds that were to support the
provision of these services so RTD staff requested that the Board remove this recommendation from the
recommended service change package. DRCOG convened a special Board meeting on Tuesday January
26, 2016 to approve the funding to support the Route 324 service changes so RTD staff is
recommending that these changes now be approved by the Board.

DISCUSSION
The previously submitted proposal read as follows:
Route 324 – Main Street Crosstown
This proposal extends weekday hours of operation by 3 ½ hours. Service would be provided between
5:30am to 8:00pm rather than the current 6am to 6pm. Additionally, Sunday service is proposed to be
added from 8:00am to 6:00pm matching current Saturday service levels (hourly).

FINANCIAL IMPACT
This proposal is funded through a Transportation Improvement Plan grant and sponsored by the City of
Longmont. Cost impacts are estimated to be $368,000 annualized for a period of 3 years. Funding is
provided by the previously referenced Transportation Improvement Plan grant and the City of Longmont.
