RTD Funding of DUSPA Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager to contribute the 2012 $3.3 million working capital advance to the
Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) towards completion of the Denver Union Station project
and relieve the related receivable as of December 31, 2013.
BACKGROUND
The Denver Union Station Project Authority is constructing the $480 million Denver Union Station
redevelopment project which is funded through a combination of federal loans, state and federal grants,
land sale proceeds, an RTD bond, and FasTracks funds. When the $480 million project is completed, all
project elements will belong to RTD. To date RTD has contributed approximately $222.8 million, which
is comprised of a $168 million RTD Bond and a combination of FasTracks-funded project planning,
oversight and change order costs.
The Denver Union Station (DUS) project is comprised of multiple elements. The light rail plaza opened in
May 2012 and the underground bus complex will open to the public on May 9, 2014. The project is a
key element for the FasTracks vision and will be the central multi-modal hub of the RTD transit system.
It will be recognized as the “Grand Central Station” of the metropolitan area in the heart of the city.
Through its 22 bus bays and light rail and commuter rail platforms the station is designed to
accommodate up to 10,000 people per hour.
DISCUSSION
In March 2012, the RTD Board of Directors authorized an advance of up to $6 million in funds to the
Denver Union Station Project Authority. This advance was authorized to provide working capital to the
project since DUSPA’s funding sources could only be accessed on a reimbursement basis after
expenditures had been made. In December 2012, RTD advanced approximately $3.3 million from Block
A land sale proceeds of the authorized $6 million. Of the $3.3 million advance, DUSPA used $1 million
to convert the Tail Tracks Plaza to a platform walkway and sitting area. The remaining funds were used
to build Wynkoop Plaza.
When the $3.3 million advance was made in December 2012, RTD recorded the $3.3 million as a
receivable from DUSPA to indicate that the funds were anticipated to be paid back at a future date. In
addition, an allowance for $3.3 million dollars was recorded in the event that DUSPA would be unable to
repay these funds. An allowance is required under conservative accounting principles when the
possibility of an inability to repay exists. The project has a fixed amount of funding available for project
completion and there was some uncertainty of remaining costs at the time. This method of accounting
effectively offsets the receivable leaving no future negative impact to RTD’s fund balances.
As the project approaches completion, it is clear that all funds DUSPA has received are needed to
complete the project. If DUSPA were to repay the advance to RTD, DUSPA would have to borrow those
funds, thereby incurring interest and increasing the project cost to RTD. After careful consideration,

Packet Pg. 3

staff has determined that contributing the $3.3 million to the project and relieving the receivable would
be the best course of action. With an effective date of December 31 2013, we would remove the
receivable and its allowance from RTD’s balance sheet while showing the $3.3 million invested in the
RTD owned capital asset.
In the future, RTD may realize a financial benefit to compensate for the additional $3.3 million project
funding from the possible early retirement of DUSPA’s debt. DUSPA’s debt obligations are funded
through tax increment financing (TIF) generated from property, sales and lodging taxes in the DUS taxing
district as well as the RTD bond. Due to accelerated development in the TIF district, DUSPA is currently
receiving TIF revenues at a rate higher than originally forecasted in the financial plan. These excess TIF
revenues will be applied toward the early payment of outstanding principal on DUSPA’s TIFIA and RRIF
loans. If these two loans are repaid before RTD meets the entirety of the RTD bond payment schedule
(approximately $12 million per year for 30 years) RTD’s bond obligations to DUSPA will cease at that
time. Because DUSPA would not have to borrow the $3.3 million, this has the potential of saving RTD
at least $3.3 million in future bond payments.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Because the receivable allowance was recorded in 2012, there will be no financial impact. Approval of
this action item would simply result in a financial statement entry at December 31, 2013.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the staff recommendation to authorize the General Manager to contribute the $3.3 million
working capital advance to the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) towards completion of
the Denver Union Station project and relieve the related receivable.
2. Do not approve the staff recommendation and wait until project close-out to see if DUSPA has funds
to repay RTD. This is not the recommended action because it is unlikely that there will be funds
remaining which would cause DUSPA to borrow additional funds thereby increasing the cost to RTD.
3. Do not approve staff recommendation and seek repayment options through alternate means.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
The RTD Management Directive for “Accountability for RTD Equipment” requires that
“The responsible department will do a physical inventory of attractive equipment
(exception IT computer equipment) to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the
Districts’ records at least once a year or any time key personnel are reassigned or leave
RTD. The IT division will be responsible for a yearly physical inventory of computer
equipment and related items.” RTD defines Attractive Equipment as “…. tangible,
nonexpendable, non-capitalized equipment that is considered relatively portable and
easily converted to personal use or benefit that had an original purchase price over
$500 …”

AUDIT SCOPE
Our review compared the physical existence of “attractive equipment” within the
Communications Department to listings maintained in our work paper files, which are
updated on an annual basis. We did not examine ‘IT Computer Equipment’ as these
lists are tested annually by the IT Division.

CONCLUSION
Several old, obsolete items that were noted in our 2012 testing have been disposed of,
as suggested in our prior report. During this current review, we updated department
schedules for ‘Attractive Equipment’ and verified the existence of such assets.

CURRENT STATUS
There were no reportable findings in this year’s report.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 13-08-11
DECEMBER 16, 2013

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
This is an annual audit mandated by the Board of Directors. It is an in depth review of
the District investments and the received income to ensure accuracy of reporting and
compliance with the Board of Director’s Investment Policy.

SCOPE
Based on the work performed during the preliminary survey and the assessment of risk,
the audit period covered the operations of RTD Investments from July 1, 2012 to June
30, 2013.

OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to ensure that investments are conducted and
controlled in accordance with the Investment Policy and the Investment Contract.

CONCLUSION
Investments are being conducted, controlled and monitored effectively. A few areas
were identified where the internal controls could be stronger as follows:
Internal Audit found no evidence of review of the monthly reconciliations prepared by
the Investment and Debt Accountant, by any member of the Finance Team. Internal
Audit recommended review of the reconciliations, with visible evidence of the reviews.
Management agreed that the review will be conducted by the Manager of Accounting.
In addition, the Manager of Investment/Debt will verify investment inventory with trustee
and bank statements. A signature and date of review will be documented in both cases.
In addition, Internal Audit found that there were no back-up arrangements for the
Investment and Debt Accountant. Internal Audit recommended training or cross training
as a minimum to ensure that in case of absence, continuity is assured. As a result Staff
Accountant position is currently being recruited and when the position is filled, the
individual will be trained and will back-up the Investment and Debt Accountant.
In 2014 Internal Audit will follow up to ensure that the agreed upon recommendations
have been implemented.

MILENDER WHITE CONSTRUCTION CO.
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 13-10-17
NOVEMBER 27, 2013

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD contracted with Milender White Construction Co. for renovations to the historic
Denver Union Station building. In part, these renovations will facilitate the return of
Amtrak station and offices to the historic building early in 2014. The renovations will be
paid for using the FASTER Transit Grant received by RTD on August 9, 2011. The
effective date of the contract was May 12, 2012. The total contract sum is $5,000,000
with $1,200,000 lump sum for the design plus $3,800,000 (Not-to-Exceed) for the
construction phase based upon Schedule of Values lump sums and/or cost plus fee.

SCOPE
The scope included a review of the work done, the payments made and level of
completion claimed. The period under review was from May 2012 to December 2013.

OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to:
1. Determine whether the selection of the contract was properly justified.

2. Ensure that the contract was valid, properly authorized and approved.
3. Ensure that all invoice charges were valid, reasonable, accurate and according to
the terms and conditions of the contract.
4. Ensure contract compliance by RTD and the contractor.

CONCLUSION
The selection of the contractor was properly justified. The contract was valid, properly
authorized and approved. Payment was only made on invoice charges that were valid,
reasonable, accurate and according to terms of the contract. There was compliance by
both RTD and the contractor. The final payment was not processed at the time of the
audit as completion is expected early in 2014.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
PAYROLL AUTHORIZATIONS and CLASSIFICATIONS:
BASE VS FASTRACKS
AUDIT REPORT # 13-10-18

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD employees routinely charge their work time and corresponding salaries to either
Company 01 – Base; or Company 02 – FasTracks. These costs are accumulated and
utilized for various reporting purposes and budgetary forecasting models within RTD.
FasTrack project costs can be reimbursed through revenue generated by the special
.4% additional sales tax that was approved by voters in 2004 and is currently in place.

AUDIT SCOPE
Our audit included a review of various employees’ time and salary charges within a
recent Pay Period, and a determination of whether those employees were properly
recorded on the General Ledger, as either Company 01 or 02, depending on their title
and role within the organization.

CONCLUSION
Internal Audit’s testing did not identify any employees who are considered to be
Company 01 Base, but whose costs were charged to Company 02 FasTracks. We did
note selected employees who are charged fully to Base, but who appear to spend
significant time on FasTracks projects.
We have suggested that a policy statement be developed to more clearly define the
guidelines for charging employee costs to either Base or FasTracks. However, Finance
management is not currently in favor of documenting these guidelines and feels that
strict budget controls have been put in place. Through the job offer, approval process,
and current accounting controls, management believes there is adequate data integrity
and separation of funding sources. Due to the complexity in maintaining this practice,
management feels individual review of each job and the related benefits should
continue and that a written policy could weaken the controls that are in place.

CURRENT STATUS
Internal Audit continues to encourage RTD management to formulate written policies
and procedures to enable a more effective and targeted payroll allocation process, while
still maintaining the appropriate tracking to ensure that FasTracks vs Base (Company
02 vs Company 01) expenditures remain properly separated.

P-CARD AGREEMENT
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 13-10-16
NOVEMBER 27, 2013

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD is currently participating in the State of Colorado Master Contract for Credit Card
Services CMS# 26552 – a revenue generating agreement. The period of performance is
from the effective date of the contract until December 2015 with the option through
December 31, 2018. The estimated annual P-Card expenditure was $3,375,714.00.
RTD receives a rebate twice each year based on the volume of P-Card purchases. In
2012, RTD spent $1,683,819 (partial year) and in 2013, $5,099,006 under the State of
Colorado Master Contract for Credit Card Services, CMS# 26552. The total rebate
generated to date is $75,810.
OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE
The objectives of the audit were to ensure that the awarding process was justified, there
was compliance by both parties with the terms of the contract, there was appropriate
documentation and approval of all invoices paid and to confirm receipt of the
deliverables described in the contract. The audit excluded review of actual purchases
with the cards. The scope included 2012 and 2013.
CONCLUSION
Internal Audit found that monthly card limits range from $500 to $40,000 and appeared
to be assigned without recourse to the individual’s position, authority or departments’
budgets. Internal audit recommended further review of the monthly limits. Management
has agreed and the initial review should be completed early in 2014.
Internal Audit found it necessary to improve the policy in the areas relating to
purchasing from Vendors with RTD Purchase Orders and the purchase of Food and
Alcoholic Beverages. Management agreed to changes in the policy to highlight the
areas.
Internal Audit will follow up to confirm the changes in 2014.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
Bus spare parts inventories are maintained in several locations, with the majority
housed in the Central Warehouse, within the Denver District Shops maintenance facility.
Parts from this location are often transferred to other maintenance facilities within the
RTD network.
During 2011, RTD’s internal parts recordkeeping was converted to the Maximus system
as the primary ‘transaction system of record’. Via interface, the Oracle software
continues to be used as a basis for Accounting’s financial records. Per the October
2013 RTD Trial Balance, total Repair Parts Inventory is approximately $29 million for all
locations and there are about 27,000 different spare parts listed for the bus and light rail
fleet on the inventory system.
Management relies on the primary control process by which the inventory system
selects a sample of individual items to be test counted and compared to the perpetual
inventory records on a daily basis.
AUDIT SCOPE
Our review concentrated on the procedures in place to ensure the accuracy of bus
spare parts and supplies inventory records and emphasized the process of daily
inventory sample counts in the Central Warehouse.

CONCLUSION
Based on the results of our testing, it appears that system generated daily inventory
counts are performed, differences are researched and resolved, and perpetual inventory
records are adjusted when necessary. We have suggested that the current process
guidelines, which are contained in multiple narratives, be consolidated into one concise
document which can be utilized by any employee who participates in the daily test count
process.

CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to normal Audit
follow-up review in 2014.

SIMMONS MACHINE TOOLS CORPORATION
MAINTENANCE CONTRACT
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 13-09-15

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
Simmons Machine Tools Corporation bought Hegenscheidt-MTD, the manufacturer of
the Wheel Lathe owned and used by RTD to maintain the Light Rail train wheels. As
such, Simmons is the only company with access to the error codes and programs
necessary to repair the Wheel Lathe, a machine that is critical to Light Rail operations.
Simmons will not entertain calls for maintenance without a Purchase Order in place
prior to a call out. RTD has contracted with Simmons for three years for quarterly,
annual and emergency service visits to ensure the timeliness and quality of the service
on the only electronic Wheel Lathe owned.

SCOPE
The scope included review of the contract and the Wheel Lathe together with the
maintenance of the Wheel Lathe by RTD and Simmons Machine Tools Corporation.
The period under review included January 1, 2013 to November 6, 2013.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to:
1.
Determine whether the selection of the contractor was properly justified.
2.
Ensure that the contract was valid, properly authorized and approved.
3.
Ensure that all invoice charges were valid, reasonable, accurate and according to
the terms and conditions of the contract.
4.
Ensure contract compliance by RTD and the contractor.

CONCLUSION
The Wheel Lathe is a large machine that is critical to the Light Rail Operations.
Together, RTD Staff and Simmons do a proper job of ensuring that the machine is
continuously well maintained. Simmons owns the error codes for the machine, making it
necessary to engage in a sole source contract; the selection was properly justified. The
contract was properly authorized and approved.
Invoice charges were valid,
reasonable, accurate and according to terms of the contract. There was compliance by
both RTD and the contractor.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD has elected to implement the Smart Media Technology (SMT) system on its buses
and train platforms using a ‘phased in’ approach. Phase One was introduced in
January 2013, and was intended to gather ridership data from ECO, Neighborhood, and
College pass programs.
The system is being built by ACS Transport Solutions, a subsidiary of Xerox. Various
testing and pilot programs are utilized by RTD personnel before each new phase of the
system is approved for use. Stored Value capability, which will allow cardholders to
purchase credit on their Smart Cards and then utilize that credit when riding RTD buses
or light rail, is expected during 2014. With this enhancement, other fare media such as
Monthly Passes, etc. will eventually be converted from current paper passes to Smart
Cards. Software development is continuing and is tested by RTD staff to validate
proper functioning before going ‘live’ throughout the RTD transit system.

AUDIT SCOPE
Utilizing a System Development Life Cycle audit approach, our examination has
included a review of both the development procedures used to build the system; and
testing to ensure processes will function as desired when it goes live.

CONCLUSION
During 2013, the Project Team identified several critical issues which were then closely
monitored and handled in a timely manner by various Team Members.
RTD Internal Audit has again suggested that appropriate Project Team members
document potential system risks and offsetting controls in the live, operating
environment before implementing Stored Value capability, in 2014.

CURRENT STATUS
Internal Audit will continue to be involved with this project and will ensure that mutually
agreed upon corrective action is implemented.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
SMART MEDIA TECHNOLOGY PROJECT
3rd INTERIM AUDIT REPORT # 13-11-19

1.C.1.a

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD has developed a prescribed set of policies and procedures which direct the
ongoing preventive maintenance requirements for buses in the organization’s fleet.
These provide guidance for mechanics performing inspections at specific mileage
intervals. Automated tracking is utilized to ensure that buses are taken out of service
and inspections are completed when due.
Inspection checklists, necessary repair work orders, mechanic comments, etc. are
documented within the Maximus system for ongoing record keeping. Significant
maintenance items which are identified during scheduled inspections are rated as ‘Out
of Service’ issues, if required to be repaired immediately, before the bus can return to
normal passenger use.
The FTA review, which was conducted at RTD earlier this year, reported no significant
findings in the area of bus preventive maintenance.

AUDIT SCOPE
Internal Audit reviewed the controls which ensure buses are thoroughly inspected in
accordance with prescribed mileage intervals, and needed repairs are adequately
completed before the bus is returned to service.

CONCLUSION
Based on the results of our testing, buses are routinely inspected in a complete and
timely manner. Needed maintenance is identified and completed as necessary to
maintain the safety of bus operations. There were no reportable findings which required
a response from management.

CURRENT STATUS
This audit is considered closed at this time.

Fourth Quarter 2013 Investment Report

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the fourth quarter of 2013 attached.
The U.S. economy expanded at a rate of 3.2% percent during the fourth quarter of 2013. The national
unemployment rate declined to 6.7% and general inflationary pressures remain tame.
In order to promote economic recovery, the Federal Reserve chose to continue with its accommodative
monetary policy and leave the federal funds target rate range (0.0% - 0.25%) unchanged during the
fourth quarter noting that this level will continue to “be appropriate at least as long as unemployment
remains above 6.5% and inflation expectations continue to be well anchored”. The Federal Reserve also
announced that it would begin winding down its $85 billion a month bond purchase program by $10
billion a month beginning in January.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
