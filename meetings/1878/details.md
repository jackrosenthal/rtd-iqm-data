#### 1. RTD Funding of DUSPA Project

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager to contribute the 2012 $3.3 million working capital advance to the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) towards completion of the Denver Union Station project and relieve the related receivable as of December 31, 2013.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 18, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Terry Howerter, Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration, stated that in in March 2012, the RTD Board authorized an advance of up to $6 million in funds to the Denver Unions Station Project Authority (DUSPA) to provide working capital to the project.  In December 2012 RTD advanced DUSPA $3.3 million for Block A land sale proceeds.  He said that DUSPA used $1 million to convert the Trail Tracks Plaza to a platform walkway and sitting area.  The remaining funds were used to build Wynkoop Plaza.  Terry Howerter explained that this was recorded as a receivable on RTD’s balance sheet.  He stated that staff is asking for this item to be removed.

Director Bagley appealed for the Board’s approval of this item.  He noted that he has been on the DUSPA Board for 3.5 years.  He stated that the work DUSPA did with these funds are critical elements for the entire RTD District.  Director Bagley believes with the development around Denver Union Station (DUS) the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) and Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) loans will be paid off much in advance of the projections.  He does not think it makes sense to make DUSPA incur greater debt in order to pay RTD for investments that benefit us.  Director Bagley stated that the exact numbers are hard to determine but the District will be well compensated for this project.

Director James echoed Director Bagley’s comments.  He is confident that going forward the development around DUS will be strong enough for the loans to be paid off early.  He thinks that RTD will benefit both qualitatively as well as quantitatively.

Director Deadwyler asked when these funds were scheduled to be paid back to RTD.  She also wondered where the money came from.  Terry Howerter stated there was not a schedule of repayment as the funds were a working capital advance.  He said the funds came from the proceeds of the sale of Block A.  RTD received about $10 million and advanced $3.3 million to DUSPA.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. Fourth Quarter 2013 Internal Audit Report

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, noted that the audit reports are available in the February 11, 2014 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.  He asked if there were any questions.

Director Hoy commented that in some of the reports the conclusion indicated that staff would follow-up on the outcome.  He wondered if that follow-up information would be provided to the Board.  Anne Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager of Internal Audit, stated that the follow-up results would be presented as part of the quarterly audit report following the initial audit report.

#### 3. December 2013 Monthly Financial Status Report

Doug MacLeod, Manager of Financial Reporting, noted that the December Monthly Financial Status Report is the unaudited year-end data.  He said the audit should be complete sometime near May so these numbers could change.  Doug MacLeod stated that staff does not believe there will be any major issues or unusual items as part of the audit but will keep the Board updated.  He informed the Board that this is the first year since 2008 that RTD has had over 100 million riders.  Terry Howerter noted that this was also one of RD’s best years for Sales and Use Tax collections.

Director Folska wondered if the 7% increase in ridership was due to the opening of the W-Line.  She also wondered if RTD saw a 7% increase in fare box revenues as well.  Doug MacLeod noted that the 7% ridership increase was just for the month of December.  Ridership increased 2.5% for the year while fare revenue increased 4.9%.

Director Folska asked how well CU Leeds did at forecasting RTD’s Sales and Use Tax Revenue.  Terry Howerter stated that they were off by about half.  The most recent forecast predicted an increase of 2% and it was actually 4.2%.  General Manager Washington recognized that forecasting is not easy, even for only one year.  Director Folska highlighted that these numbers show that CU Leeds is very conservative in their projections and Sales and Use Tax is exceeding expectations.  She believes if we err on the side of being conservative than RTD will be in good shape going forward.

Director Bagley commented that it is a good practice to under promise and over deliver.  He noted that there has been a tremendous amount of discussion about increasing ridership.  He said that the W-Line demonstrates that when RTD develops new services, ridership jumps.  Developing new corridors, routes, etc. is how RTD increases ridership.  He stated that 10 years from now it will be hard for RTD to grow ridership because we will not be putting out major new service.

Director Daly noted that CU Leeds forecasts are an improvement over what RTD was using from the legislature or Governor’s office.  He pointed out that the dashboard was all green and asked staff to keep up the good work.

Committee Chair Walker thought Director Folska brought up an excellent point related to ridership and flat fare revenue.  He said that it would be possible to see an increase in ridership but flat fare revenue depending on if the additional riders had monthly passes, discount cards, etc.  He stated that there is not necessarily a correlation between ridership and fare revenue.  Terry Howerter said that Committee Chair Walker was correct.  He noted that as the SmartCard program gets implemented for all service RTD will have better reporting to look at this.

### D. Other Matters

Committee Chair Walker commented that it has been a busy week for the Communication Department.  He shared that he saw an article in the paper about Aurora related to development.  He was surprised that the article did not note any development that is occurring on the Southeast Line.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Walker adjourned the meeting at 8:34 p.m.
