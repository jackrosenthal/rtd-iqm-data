BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: April 5, 2017

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

April 5, 2017

Board Meeting Date: April 18, 2017

Subject:

Award of “Group 27” Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with First Transit for the
provision of contracted fixed-route transit services “Group 27.” This contract is for three years,
with two one-year options for a total of 5-years, for a 5-year cost of $128,033,723.00. In addition,
RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be $13,804,915.00
for the total 5-year term. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for the contracted fixed route
transit service and fuel is $141,838,638.00.
This recommendation represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response
to Request for Proposals (RFP) 16-DH-055 to provide “Group 27” Public Transportation Services. The
contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective on May 13, 2017.
BACKGROUND:
As a result of a series of State legislative activities over the years, and in support of the Board
adopted strategic goals, RTD outsources a portion of the delivery of its fixed route bus service.
On January 12, 2017, a Request for Proposals (RFP) 16-DH-055 named “Group 27” was issued
soliciting proposals for the provision of fixed-route transit services. This service package “Group 27”
replaces “Group 23” and consists of 130 buses operating 37 routes providing approximately
343,449 revenue hours per year. A summary of the routes included in “Group 27” is included as
Attachment A. Responses to the Request for Proposals were due on February 17, 2017. Proposers
were required to provide detailed operating plans for providing fixed-route service, including hiring
and training employees, maintaining RTD-provided transit vehicles, and conforming to RTD operating
requirements. The contract award was anticipated to be awarded on a fixed-price basis and based
on “best value” competitive proposal procedures.
DISCUSSION:
Procurement:
One (1) proposal was received from First Transit in response to RFP 16-DH-055 for the Provision of
Group 27 Public Transportation Services. MV Transportation, National Express Transportation and
Transdev, also expressed interest in the solicitation however, elected not to submit proposals due to
the lack of available facilities in the Denver metropolitan area.
The First Transit proposal was evaluated on the following evaluative criteria:
a)
understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%); b) experience/qualifications and
safety record (30%); c) price (30%); and d) SBE plan and goal attainment (5%).

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

The technical evaluation team consisted of Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager, Contracted Services;
David Ober, Assistant General Superintendent, Maintenance; Greg Smith, Manager, Competitive
Services, and Brian Matthews, Manager, Special Services. The technical evaluation team reviewed
and scored each proposal based on a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation
and b) experience/qualifications and safety record.
The SBE plan and goal attainment evaluation team consisted of Zamy Silva, Senior Manager, Civil
Rights, and Alexis Nightengale, SBO Compliance Officer.
The scores for pricing were provided by the Procurement Department staff.
The following is a summary of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal:
Key Strengths:
Increase in bus operator wages. First Transit’s proposal provided a much needed increase in bus
operator wages. The bus operator starting wage increased from $13.46/hour to $15.13/hour.
Adjustments were also proposed for other operator wage levels. RTD, as well as our contractors,
have faced long-term challenges with recruiting and retaining qualified operators. The proposed wage
increases will provide First Transit the opportunity to offer a more attractive wage package, which
will improve recruitment and retention of operators, which will result in improved service for our
passengers.
Dedicated on-site recruiter. This full time new position will be solely focused on the recruitment of bus
operators and maintenance personnel for the First Transit Denver location.
Enhanced Quality Control. Corporate team to work with local team to identify causes and potential
modifications to improve on-time performance.
Strong maintenance program. Mechanics required to complete 40 hours of initial training and 40 hours
of skills enhancement training annually. First Transit promotes the Automotive Service Excellence (ASE)
training and certification program. The Denver location has 12 mechanics that are ASE certified and 4
mechanics that are Master Technician certified.
The proposed management team. Under this team’s leadership, the First Transit Denver division
consistently meets/exceeds RTD quarterly performance goals. The team has developed and nurtured
positive and productive relationships with Denver and surrounding governments and communities. The
team is experienced in providing service for RTD and there will be no disruption of service when
transitioning from the previous “Group 23” contract to the new “Group 27” contract. The local
operation is also supported by experienced professionals at the Regional level.
Experience of firm. First Transit has been providing RTD service for 28 years. The company has been
providing fixed-route bus service in other locations for over 60 years. The company currently has over
300 contracts in 39 states and other countries.
SBE goal set at 5%. First Transit’s proposed SBE plan met the 5% goal.
Key Weaknesses:
The proposal weaknesses identified below were forwarded to First Transit for clarification. The
responses received from First Transit adequately address the perceived deficiencies.

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

Operator in-service evaluations. Process not thoroughly discussed in proposal. First Transit provided
detailed description of annual in-service operator evaluations.
DOT hours of service monitoring procedures. No monitoring procedures for ensuring compliance with
DOT hours of service included in the proposal. Procedures were provided upon request.
Distracted driving policy. Policy not included in the proposal. Policy and clarification was provided upon
request.
Corporate safety record details. Safety record for company not included in the proposal. First Transit
provided this information upon request. Numbers show less than 0.2 NTD reportable accidents per
100,000 miles.
Customer complaint procedures. Procedures not thoroughly discussed in proposal. First Transit provided
sufficient information to ensure all complaints are thoroughly investigated and appropriate action is
taken.
Safety Manager experience. Resume did not include tenure in other positions held within First Transit.
An updated, complete resume was provided.
First Transit “Group 23” Performance:
First Transit Denver division currently operates this fixed route service package which has been
evaluated based on the following Board of Directors adopted performance measures:



Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 Miles: First Transit utilized bus operator monitoring
technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators. They emphasized safety with all
employees at monthly safety meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their
facilities.

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1

Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 Miles: First Transit raised awareness of passenger safety through
campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.
On-Time Preventive Maintenance Inspections: First Transit placed a high emphasis on completing
preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local operation was diligent about
completing these inspections on time.
On-Time Performance: First Transit continues to understand the impact new operators, construction
detours, and traffic can have on OTP. From the beginning of the “Group 23” contract, First Transit
worked in conjunction with RTD Service Planning and Scheduling to continuously improve OTP. They
achieved this improvement, from 85.2% (2012) to 87% (2016), by identifying low performing routes
and assigning supervisors to campaign the routes and to meet with operators to discuss factors that
impacted their ability to run on time. Schedule issues were forwarded to RTD Service Planning and
Scheduling for review.
Miles Between Lost Service Road Calls: First Transit continually exceeds the goal in this area by
completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely manner,
monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a pro-active approach to
maintaining the buses in their fleet.
Operator Complaints per Boarding: First Transit’s performance in this category reflects the difficulties
experienced throughout the RTD district in the earlier part of the year due to operator shortages which
resulted in a high number of “bus late” and “bus did not show” complaints. First Transit, along with
RTD, continues to investigate and address customer complaints with operators. First Transit utilizes
onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist operators in improving customer interactions. In
addition, the steps noted above regarding on-time performance should help address some customer
complaints. First Transit addresses complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
To ensure a fiscally sustainable service delivery, RTD prepared an internal estimate of cost for
outsourcing the “Group 27” service package as well as a RTD cost model projection of costs for RTD
to bring the operation of the Group 27 service package in house.
RTD Internal Cost Estimate:
This estimate was prepared by the Competitive Services Department to anticipate the amount RTD
could expect to pay to outsource the Group 27 service package to a contract operator. Due to the
recent labor shortages experienced by RTD and its contractors, RTD anticipated proposers would
address these challenges by increasing operator and maintenance personnel wages. RTD also
factored a 3% increase in inflation.
RTD’s total five-year estimate for the Group 27 service package was $130,333,390. First Transit’s
proposed total five-year price was $128,033,723 or $2,299,667 less than the RTD estimate. First
Transit reported that their proposed price included increases in operator and mechanic wages,
inflation, and increases in maintenance costs associated with the aging 2005-2007 Gillig bus fleet.
Note: bus operator starting wages increased from $13.46/hour to $15.13/hour; C level Mechanic
starting wages increased from $18.03/hour to $20.00hour.

RTD Cost Model:
The Cost Model estimate was prepared by the RTD Finance Department to estimate the cost for RTD
to operate the Group 27 service package in house rather than outsource to a qualified contract
provider.
The RTD internal financial analysis (Attachment B) indicates that the five-year estimated cost for RTD
to provide these services would be $142,283,722, which is $14,249,999 higher than the five-year
cost proposed by First Transit. The RTD Cost Model Estimate is based on current and projected
wage rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience providing other fixedroute services. In addition to estimating the cost for RTD to provide the services included in the
“Group 27” service package, the cost of providing a facility to serve as the operating and
maintenance base for the provision of the services is also included in the estimated cost of RTD
operation. RTD currently does not have the capacity to provide these additional services without
building or leasing additional facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance base for the
provision of the services.
The First Transit total five-year proposed price represents a $14,249,999 million (10%) savings over
the estimated cost for RTD to provide the service. Please see the Group 27 - Proposer Service Cost

Contract Cost Details:
This contract is for an initial three-year amount not to exceed $73,418,463 with two (2) one-year
options in the amount of $26,781,472 (option year 1) and $27,833,788 (option year 2), for a total
five-year not-to-exceed amount of $128,033,723 for service. In addition, RTD will reimburse the
contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be approximately $8,054,771 for the initial
three-year contract term, $2,845,625 for option year 1, and $2,904,520 for option year 2, for a
total of $13,804,915 for the five-year period. This results in a total not-to-exceed contract amount
of $81,473,234 for the initial three year contract period and $141,838,638 for the five year period
for service and fuel.
In addition to the hourly costs paid to the Contractor for the provision of service, the actual diesel
fuel costs incurred by the Contractor in the provision of the specified service will be paid by the
District through the contract. RTD will reimburse the actual cost for diesel fuel to the Contractor as

Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the approved
2017 RTD budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future
years.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Award the contract to First Transit, as recommended
2)
Resolicit the Group 27 service package. This is not recommended as the proposal
process has resulted in a responsive and responsible proposal that is less expensive
than the RTD internal cost estimate and is less expensive than the estimated cost for
RTD to provide these services internally.

• Larger Wheelchair Lift Area to Accommodate Large Wheelchairs and Electric
Scooters:
We expanded the three aisle facing seats on the curbside to five seats,
increasing the size of the wheelchair area from 30”x48” to 30”x60”.
• Staggered Two Wheelchair Areas to Open Aisle Passageway:
We moved the curbside wheelchair area rearward to offset the side-by-side
parking of the two wheelchairs to open up the aisle passageway.
• Thinner Profile Aisle Facing Seats to Allow Wheelchairs to Park Closer to
Sidewalls:
We replaced the normal aisle-facing folding seats with thinner profile seats to
gain over 2” on each side for wheelchair to park closer to bus sidewall,
reducing wheelchair protrusion to aisle passageway.
• Individual Forward-Facing Flip-Up Seats:
We modified the seats in the Priority Seating Area to individual flip-up seats,
allowing seats to fold-up to make room for accessibility devices such as
walkers.
• More Leg Room for Passengers with Large Items:
We now have only a pair of two forward facing seats on the curbside forward
of the rear doors. These seats have more leg room for passengers with large
items.
• Color-Coded Wheelchair Areas:
We now designate the two wheelchair areas with the use of bright blue color
flooring to highlight the wheelchair areas for use by passengers with
disabilities.
•

The above improvements added $1,150 to the unit cost of the buses.
