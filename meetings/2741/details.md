#### 1. 2017 CAFR and Report to Governance

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended December 31, 2017 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD's independent auditor, RubinBrown, LLP.

GM CORE AND TASK GOALS MET

Core Goal #3:  Strong Financial Management

Task Goal #1:  Fiscal Sustainability

Motion:               Director Solano made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the May 22, 2018 Board Meeting.

Director Williams seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration, introduced Cheryl Wallace from the auditing firm of RubinBrown, LLP (RubinBrown).

Ms. Wallace highlighted the results of the financial statement and single audit from December 31, 2017, from the ViewPoints presentation included in the Board packet which contained the communication that every auditor is required to provide to a governing body. She stated that RTD had retained RubinBrown to perform a single audit and a financial statements audit because RTD had received federal awards over $750,000, and that RTD had also engaged RubinBrown to issue an opinion on RTD’s federal awards.

Ms. Wallace explained that RubinBrown provided the following services:

- Financial statement audits for the year ended December 31, 2017

- Single audit for the year ended December 31, 2017

- National Transit Database Federal Funding Allocation Statistics Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagement for the year ended December 31, 2017

- Report on Cost of General Manager’s Contract

She highlighted the objectives of a financial statement audit:

- Report to those charged with governance

o        RTD Board of Directors

- Provide an opinion on whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement

- Obtain an understanding of the entity’s internal controls

- Audit procedures include:

o        Review risks impacting the financial reporting process

o        Perform inquiries and analytical procedures

o        Verify and substantiate selected account balances or a sample of certain

o        transactions

o        Update our understanding of IT security risks

Ms. Wallace noted that the required auditor communication began on page 9 of the presentation and she explained that the left side of the report outlined the auditing standards and the right side was the response from RubinBrown. She stated that the audit was performed following governmental auditing standards. Ms. Wallace explained that RubinBrown had issued an unmodified opinion that was previously called an unqualified opinion or a clean opinion. She noted that RubinBrown planned and scoped the audit through an engagement letter dated October 16, 2017. Ms. Wallace explained that RubinBrown was responsible to report to the governing body any changes in accounting practices and their application and summarized the following findings:

- No new accounting policies were adopted, and the application of existing policies was not changed.

- We noted no transactions entered into during the year for which there was a lack of authoritative guidance or consensus, with the exception of the P3, which the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) had yet to address.

- No significant transactions have been recognized in a different period than when the transactions occurred.

Ms. Wallace explained that RubinBrown evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates in determining that they were reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole. She identified the most sensitive estimates affecting the financial statements as:

- Management’s estimate of depreciation is based upon estimated useful lives of capital assets.

- Management’s estimate of the allowance for bad debts is based on management’s review of outstanding receivables.

- Management’s estimate of the net pension liability is based on actuarial valuations and employee census data.

Ms. Wallace stated that RTD had several financial disclosures that were particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statement. However, she said the disclosures were neutral, consistent and clear. She explained the most sensitive disclosures affecting the financial statements were:

- The disclosure of investments in Note B

- The disclosure of capital assets in Note D

- The disclosure of long-term debt in Note E

- The disclosure of employee retirement and unearned compensation plans in Note F

- The disclosure of commitments and contingencies in Note H

- The disclosure of the tax, spending and debt limitations in Note K

Ms. Wallace explained that the RTD finance team prepared the document and that there were no difficulties encountered in dealing with the management related to the performance of the audit. She detailed the following audit adjustments that were proposed as a result of the audit:

- Interest expense was adjusted for prepaid TABOR Secured Interest in the amount $40,953,636. This adjustment increased the change in net position by the same amount.

Ms. Wallace stated that professional standards required her firm to accumulate all misstatements identified during the audit, other than those that were trivial, and communicate them to the appropriate level of management but she said there were no uncorrected misstatements in the RTD report.

Ms. Wallace stated that RubinBrown had one recommendation regarding the Public Private Partnership (P3) arrangement. She explained that impacts to financial reporting were not consistently evaluated throughout the project to consider the changes and that the project was nearing full completion with several amendments and anticipated amendments to contract provisions. She said RubinBrown recommended that management perform a comprehensive review of the key clauses of the P3 agreement, which included but were not limited to, completion of project, termination clauses and changes in service, any potential accounting, budgetary and financial reporting impacts. Further the suggested a review at least annually with a key member of the financial management team related to the impacted areas.

Ms. Wallace stated that the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) had been very active implementing future financial disclosures and that RTD would need to report on the following:

- GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions

o        Effective for 2018 RTD year end

o        Similar effect to GASB 68 for other postemployement benefits (health and welfare plans), i.e., ATU Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust. RTD would be required to report the benefit plan’s projected liability.

- GASB Statement No. 87, Leases

o        Effective for 2019 year end

o        Established a single model for lease accounting based on the principle that leases were financings of the right to use an underlying asset

o        Application of this standard would go beyond the previous guidance related to the recording of leased assets. The standard would require additional leased items on the books be recorded as intangible right-to-use assets and related liabilities.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked if RubinBrown provided comments and guidance in order for RTD to receive the last part of the Full Funding Grant and assistance with the refunding of the credit risk premium from the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program that RTD paid off 22 years in advance.

Ms. McKillop explained that the FFGA had been withheld because the G Line had not opened and that, as soon as the G Line opened, the funds would be released. She added that the funds from the FFGA were not an accounting issue and that the money had been appropriated but could not be withdrawn. Ms. McKillop stated the RubinBrown recommendations regarding the P3 project were regarding what to classify as reimbursable and set accounting standards of the funds for the future.

Director Broom asked how pension reporting had changed in the last few years.

Ms. Wallace explained that the GASB found significant differences in pension reporting between for-profit corporations and governments. She stated that in the past, if the actuary stated that payments had been made, then there was no issue, and in 2008 some pension plans lost retirement funds and that brought about the new requirements for government pension reporting. Ms. Wallace explained that government appropriate budgets yearly and the pension reporting needed to include what the total benefits payments would be, assets, investments, and expenditures in order to assess the total liability for benefit plans.

Director Broom asked if an agency could have a negative net worth by booking that liability.

Ms. Wallace described the issue with Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA) and that the previous reporting standard had a negative impact on net position for many governmental entities.

Ms. McKillop thanked all the staff who spent so much time working with the auditors.

Committee Chair Mihalik agreed with Ms. McKillop.

Vote on

The Motion:              The motion passed with 15 in favor (Anderson, Archuleta, Broom, Catlin, Deadwyler, Folska, Hoy, Lubow, Mihalik, Menten, Sisk, Solano, Tisdale, Walker, Williams) and 0 against.

Committee Chair Mihalik declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

##### a. RTD 2017 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (05-2018)

##### b. Regional Transportation District 2017 ViewPoints FINAL

#### 2. Budget Transfer for Commuter Rail Third Party Services

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $2.82 million from the FasTracks Management Reserve to the commuter rail operations budget for third party reimbursable projects to allow RTD to compensate Denver Transit Partners (DTP) for costs it will incur for work associated with third party agreements.  The FasTracks Management Reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended Budget with the funds that will be received from third parties to compensate RTD for the impacts to its operation.

This action addresses two of the General Manager’s goals for 2018:  Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services, and Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability.

Motion:               Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the May 22, 2018 Board Meeting.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Ms. McKillop stated that RTD had worked with third party partners, including stakeholders, local governments, and private entities, on betterments that have included enhancements to RTD rail lines and facilities beyond the original construction plans and concurrent construction of associated facilities for third parties. She explained that the third parties requesting the work would reimburse RTD for all costs associated with these betterments, so these betterments were done at no net cost to RTD, and that RTD must pay DTP for its costs related to these improvements.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked for an example of the third party projects.

Susan Cohen, Senior Manager of Finance stated that the two largest projects are for the City and County of Denver (CCD) road related projects such as the Central Park Road widening and the Wewatta viaduct structure.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked why CCD was not doing their own projects.

Ms. Cohen explained that if CCD performed the work they would impact RTD rail and have to coordinate with RTD projects in order to perform any work. She stated that RTD may see service impacts from third party construction projects that require access to the right-of-way. She explained the project varied from utilities that pass under the track, or construction on bridges over the track and that in these instances, DTP may be required to provide access to the track, or to modify service, to allow the third party construction.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked how long it would take for CCD to reimburse RTD for the city’s projects.

Ms. McKillop stated that CCD pays within thirty to sixty days of invoicing.

Director Hoy asked for clarification between the FasTracks Management Reserve and what Ms. McKillop stated was the Board Reserve.

Ms. McKillop stated that it was one and the same and explained that the FasTracks Management Reserve was a reserve that the Board set aside out of the base system, but in order to draw money from that reserve, it must be Board approved.

Vote on

The Motion:              The motion passed with 14 in favor (Anderson, Archuleta, Broom, Catlin, Folska, Hoy, Lubow, Mihalik, Menten, Sisk, Solano, Tisdale, Walker, Williams) and 0 against. Director Deadwyler was absent.

Committee Chair Mihalik declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. Salaried Trust Actuarial Report

Ms. McKillop introduced Wendy Londa from Rael and Letson to provide the update on the salaried employees’ pension plan fund status.

Ms. Londa reminded the Board that the Salaried Employees’ Pension Plan was reviewed each year by an actuarial for a fund status report.

Ms. Londa reviewed the following information from the presentation that was included in the Board packet:

Valuation Highlights as of January 1, 2017

- Total participant count decreased by 12 (from 687 to 675)

- Plan closed to new participants on January 1, 2008

- Active population decreased from 327 to 291

- Actuarial Accrued Liability increased by $7.6M (from $157.8M to $165.4M)

- Actuarial Value of Assets increased by $8.3M (from $123.6M to $131.9M)

- Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability decreased by $0.7M (from $34.2M to $33.5M)

- Funded ratio based on the Actuarial Value of Assets increased from 78.3% to 79.7%

- Funded ratio based on the Market Value of Assets increased from 77.8% to 79.2%

- Recommended contribution decreased by $0.3M from $7.6M to $7.3M

Long-Term Funding

- There had been no change in the Board’s funding policy since 2016 – the contribution continues to be determined as an amount to keep the Trust “actuarially sound” based on the recommendations of the Actuary and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer to contributing.

- Last year, based on January 1, 2016 actuarial valuation results and an estimated 2016 net investment return of 9.4%, the Plan was projected to reach 100% funding in 2043 with a $4.6M contribution each year if all assumptions were met in the future.

- What has changed since last year?

Ø      The actual net investment return for 2016 was 9.3% based on the 12/31/2016 Plan audit.

Ø      The Plan experienced a $2.3M salary gain in 2016 (2.5% average salary increase for continuing actives compared to an expected weighted average increase of 5.0%).

- Reflecting January 1, 2017 valuation results, the Plan is projected to reach 100% funding in 2042 (1 year earlier) with a $4.6M contribution each year if all actuarial assumptions were met in the future, including a net investment return of 7.5% per year beginning in 2017.

- What happened since the final January 1, 2017 valuation results were issued?

Ø      The Board approved a $5.1M contribution for the 2018 Fiscal Year; the actuary’s recommended contribution was $7.3M.

Ø      The investment return in 2017 exceeded the 7.50% assumption – the preliminary 2017 net return is 14.2%.

- Reflecting January 1, 2017 valuation results, a $5.1M contribution in 2018, and a 14.2% preliminary net return on assets in 2017, if all actuarial assumptions were met each year, including a net investment return of 7.5% per year beginning in 2018:

Ø      If future contributions were equal to $5.1M (or the recommended contribution if lower), the funding level is projected to reach 100% in 2031 (end of the 14-year amortization period) with recommended contributions dropping below $5.1M in 2022.

§         The recommended contribution ranges from $4.9M in 2022 down to $0.8M in 2032.

Ø      If the recommended contribution is made beginning in 2019, the Plan is expected to achieve 100% funding in 2031 (end of the 14-year amortization period) and the recommended amount is projected to drop below $5.1M in 2022.

§         The recommended contribution ranges from $5.9M in 2019 down to $4.7M in 2022 and $0.8M in 2032.

- Due to the Plan’s size and nature, future investment returns have a significant impact on projected liabilities – we would keep the Board apprised of the impact of the Plan’s investment performance on future costs.

Projections

- 14.2% preliminary net return in 2017, 7.50% in all future years

- Reflects a $4.6 million contribution in 2017 and a $5.1 million contribution in 2018.

- Assets reflect a preliminary market rate of return of 14.2%, net of investment expenses, in 2017, and assumes a market rate of return of 7.50%, net of investment expenses, in each future year thereafter.

- Assumes all other assumptions were met in 2017 and each future year.

- As of 1/1/2017, the amortization period is 14 years.

Next Steps

- We would continue to monitor and review the following items going forward:

Ø      The Plan’s funding level and recommended contribution amount.

Ø      Actuarial assumptions and methods:

§         The Trustees of the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plan were considering lowering the interest assumption – which would increase Plan liabilities and lower the benchmark for future investment returns.

Ø      Policies adopted by other public pension plan systems.

- All such items would be reviewed by Rael & Letson and discussed with the Board annually.

Director Hoy asked what would be the disadvantage of funding more in order to reach full funding faster.

Ms. McKillop stated that RTD should be funding closer to the level of the actuarial recommendation of 7.3%. She added that the agency had not been had a situation where performance for investment was up in some time.

Ms. Londa stated that the 14.2% return for 2017 painted a different picture for the funding status of the pension plan.

Ms. McKillop explained that the trustees concern was that it was unlikely that the investment rate would continue at the same rate of return and that was why she recommended a slight increase rate of investment each year in order to get achieve full funding of the plan earlier than projected and to set the agency up for better plans for the future.

Director Hoy clarified that the goal was to get to full funding sooner.

Director Hoy ask who made the investment decisions.

Ms. McKillop stated that the trustees made the decisions about the investments.

- August 14 – Presentation of third draft mid-term financial plan, second draft long-range financial plan

- September 11 – Presentation of final mid-term and long-range financial plan, and 2019 Requested Budget at FAAC

- September 18 – Adoption of mid-term and long-range financial plans

Ms. McKillop stated that this is the planned schedule but she said that the outcome of the Pass Program Working Group (PPWG) would have an impact on the schedule because the current plan assumes a fare increase and that there may be revisions due to adoption of the PPWG recommendation.

Director Broom stated that listed under uncontrollable variables were interest rates on debt and asked if the agency had variable rate debt, how much of this type of debt, and how much the rates increased.

Ms. Scarpino explained that must be a mistake and the RTD debt was all at a fixed rate.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked for examples of the deferred capital projects.

Ms. McKillop stated that she would provide that list of all the projects being considered for the $65 million in project requests (capital and expense) that need to be eliminated, reduced, or deferred in Base System.

Director Lubow asked if the North Metro Line would be completed to State Highway 7 or to 124th Avenue within the six year plan.

Ms. Cohen stated that it would be completed up to 124th Avenue, which was currently under construction.

Director Lubow asked what the consequences would be for not making the 1.2 times debt service coverage requirement.

Ms. McKillop stated that she had met with the rating agencies because the agency had not met the required debt ratio and were not expected to meet it the last plan. She added that rating agencies would receive a copy of RTD’s short-term and long-term model to be aware of any problems the agency may encounter. Ms. McKillop stated that the consequences would be that both RTD COPs and outstanding bonds were downgraded, that RTD had high ratings which meant that RTD interest rates when bonds were issued were lower, and that RTD had been able to take an advantage because the agency was well respected in the investment community for high, solid COPs or bonds. She stated that RTD was not expecting issued debt in the near future and any issued debt would be subject to a new rating. Ms. McKillop stated that the other issue was that the agency may be violating a Board policy by not maintaining the required 1.2 times debt service coverage. She explained that in the financial plan last year the agency was expected to meet the requirement in 2026 and this year was expected to meet it in 2023, so there was improvement. Ms. McKillop stated that the financial department was working on determining what it would take to meet the debt service coverage requirement in 2019 and if the agency could afford that.

Director Lubow asked when the Board would receive a cash flow graph.

Ms. McKillop stated that the cash flow graph would be included in the long–term financial plan.

##### a. 2019-2024 Mid_Term Financial Plan 051518

Ms. McKillop and Michael Washington, Transit Equity Manager, gave an update on the Pass Program Working Group and highlighted the following points from the presentation included in the Board packet:

Current State

- Fare Box Revenue

- Fare Box Revenue targets were set by the RTD Board of Directors

- The Board’s Fiscal Policy Statement directs staff to plan on a fare adjustment every three (3) years to adjust to inflation

- Policy directs staff to review potential fare adjustments to establish a fare structure to ensure that it:

o        Is understandable

o        Is implementable

o        Is equitable

- Achieves the revenue levels established in the Mid-Range Financial Plan (Formerly SBP & APE)

- The current Mid-Term Financial Plan for 2018-2023 incorporates a planned fare increase assumption in both 2019 and 2022.

o        Approximately 10% in 2019 and 10% in 2022

Current Fare Structure

- $2.60 for Regional

- $9.00 for airport

2019 Fare Change Proposal Three Alternatives

- Primary Fare Change Proposal Elements:

o        3-Hour Pass to replace One-way Trip with 3-hour transfer

o        EcoPass, NECOPass and CollegePass -  Price based upon the previous year’s utilization

o        FlexPass – Retain without discount

o        MyRide – Retain without discount ($0.25)

o        10-Ride Ticket Book – Retain without discount (10%)

o        ValuPass – Discontinue (purchase 12 monthly passes instead)

- Three Alternatives Summary

o        No Increase in the Base Fare

§         Doesn’t generate enough revenue to meet fare targets in current SBP/APE

§         Insufficient revenue generated by eliminating discounts and transitioning to utilization pricing for pass programs to introduce 70% discount for Youth or Low Income Program

o        Regularly Scheduled Fare Change

§         Local One-Way $2.60 to $2.90

§         Regional One-Way $4.50 to $5.00

§         Airport One-Way $9.00 to $10.00

o        Pass Program Working Group Recommendation

§         Local One-Way $2.60 to $3.00

§         Regional One-Way $4.50 to $5.25

§         Airport One-Way $9.00 to $10.50

§         70% discount for Youth

§         Maintain Nonprofit Program (Adult & Senior/Disabled products offered at 50% discount on the full fare;

§          Youth at 70% discount)

§         70% discount for Youth

§         40% discount through the Low Income Program

o        Alternative 1: No Increase in Base Fare: Modeling Results

§         Leaving the Base Fares unchanged results in a sizeable revenue shortfall (-$36 million) compared to the cumulative Strategic Budget Plan fare revenue target for 2019-2021

§         This revenue shortfall remains sizable, even with the elimination of some fare discounts (e.g.: FlexPass, MyRide, ValuPass, etc.)

§         Compared to the Baseline, this alternative results in higher ridership, due to the lower Base Fare

o        Alternative 2: Regularly Scheduled Fare Change: Modeling Results

§         The Regularly scheduled fare change would result in revenue slightly below (-$2 million) the cumulative Strategic Budget Plan fare revenue target for 2019-2021

§         Compared to the Baseline, the Recommendation results in a very slight increase in ridership, due in part to the greater discount offered to Youth customers

o        Alternative 3: PPWG Recommendation

§         The PPWG recommendation is slightly below (-$2 million) the cumulative Strategic Budget Plan fare revenue target for 2019-2021

§         Compared to the Baseline, the Recommendation results in a slight increase in ridership, due in part to the introduction of the Low Income Program

- Still Evaluating: Staff continues to evaluate implementation of the Low-Income program and Youth discount:

o        Low-Income Fare and Youth Fare

o        What will it take to apply the discount to all products

o        Which fare product(s)/media would allow for the lowest implementation cost

o        Which fare product(s)/media would allow for the soonest implementation

o        Which fare product(s)/media would allow for the simplest operator/customer interaction

o        Is mobile ticketing an accessible option

o        Administration: means-testing, proof of eligibility, fare product acquisition, etc.

o        Is the 12 and under free enforceable

Ms. McKillop stated that the PPWG would be starting the public input process presenting the three option but that these three option may change due to staff and public recommendations. She added that the options would be presented in order to give the public something to respond to and provide comments.

Director Broom asked what the cost would be to implement the change that kept the existing fare schedule and increase all fares by 10% and offer the 40% discount.

Ms. McKillop stated that the total cost of the program was between $11 and $12 million to implement the 40% discount. She explained that approximately $6.8 million was applied to the current discount program and it would cost an additional $7 to $8 million because RTD actually only receives about half of the $6.8 million to implement the 40% discount alternative.

Director Sisk stated that it was expensive to provide the program.

Ms. McKillop explained that was why it would be difficult to implement the alternative and that the PPWG option balanced a new fare structure.

Mr. Washington stated that the revenue loss was shaded with that alternative because it was largely dependent upon the type of fare media and the fare to apply the discount. He explained that if the discount was applied to unlimited monthly pass there would be a much greater revenue loss than if the discount would be applied to a stored value MyRide card.

Ms. McKillop agreed with Mr. Washington and explained that the shortfall was dependent on how the discount would be offered to the public.

Director Broom asked if there would be costs estimates provided for several different discount percentage amounts.

Ms. McKillop explained that there was not enough money to offer several different discount options and that it would require a significant raise in the current base fare.

Director Williams stated that the modeling results of the three alternatives reported that the revenue loss was relatively small and that, by not implementing a new fare program, what the agency may lose in public opinion and reputation would be significant. She added that there was not a dollar value to be placed on the reputation of RTD by trying to provide the discounted service to the public and that the agency needed to make the best out of all the work that was done. Director Williams asked what percentage of ridership would bear the fare increase to provide discount for other riders.

Mr. Washington stated that he did not have that information with him but would send it to Director Williams.

Director Menten commented that there needed to be more than five outreach meetings and that five meeting would possibly work if there was enough advertising and the meetings were held at convenient locations and hours. She added that the meetings should share the information to the taxpayers regarding the subsidy and what the current cost was and how it would increase.

Director Anderson stated that she was concerned the outreach would not include the people that pay the regular fare. She added that she did not agree that part of RTD riders should be paying for others, which she stated was unfair. Director Anderson stated she agreed with the plan for children riding free with a parent or responsible person. She added that the income level needed to be transparent and that she would like to see an option where the agency reduced all fares in order to increase ridership. She asked what routes and services would be impacted by implementing any low income program.

Ms. McKillop stated that an option to eliminate all discounts, except for federally mandated discounts, to try to get fares as low as possible was examined but that resulted in a tremendous amount loss in ridership.

Director Anderson stated that RTD should figure out how to provide the lowest fares possible and increase ridership and have the taxpayers subsidize that amount.

Ms. McKillop stated she would provide the modeling results of reducing all fares option.

Director Anderson stated that the agency had provided the Eco and college passes and that the options appeared to eliminate those programs.

Ms. McKillop stated that all options keep the ECO, NICO, and college passes.

Director Anderson stated that the person that does not receive discount passes and fares pays for the people who do.

Director Lubow stated that the ridership declined on both option 2 and 3 and why would RTD provide a low income pass that caused ridership to go down.

Mr. Washington explained that ridership decline was due to the sensitivity to price increases and that people would ride less if it cost more to ride. He added that using fares to gain the revenue needed to provide a discounted pass begin to eat away at the goal to gain ridership.

Ms. McKillop stated that both options 2 and 3 tried to keep the ridership as high as possible by how passes were implemented.

Director Lubow asked if in option 3 if there would no longer be a nonprofit program but still have the 50% government requirements.

Mr. Washington explained that nonprofit organizations would be able to purchase fare media on behalf of individuals but that it would not be the nonprofit program in place currently. He added that there would not be a cap on the amount of fare media to be purchased on behalf low-income individuals as there currently is a limit.

Director Lubow asked whether nonprofit organizations be negatively impacted from option 3.

Mr. Washington stated that it would allow nonprofit organizations to expand the rate at which they can contribute to the transportation services provided.

Director Lubow asked if there was data that showed ridership decreased because of the deletion of MyRide and the ten-ride fare book.

Ms. McKillop stated that it was a very small portion that impacted ridership related to those passes.

Director Lubow asked if those people who were low income but did not qualify for the low income pass were losing a discount and had to pay increased fares. She also asked who the riders were that RTD was losing.

Mr. Washington explained that ridership loss came from the increase of the base fare to $3.00.

Ms. McKillop stated that it was hard to measure exactly which riders RTD would lose and that currently there was no statistical information to determine if it would impact cash fare payers.

Director Lubow suggest having a Telephone Town Hall to reach plenty of people.

Chair Tisdale stated that in the presentation option 2 included senior and disabled discounts but noted that those are not included in option 3 and asked to verify that those discounts were federally mandated and regardless of the option that was being assessed.

Mr. Washington explained that wording was difficult but that it was supposed to communicate that there would not be a way to receive a discount on a discount.

Chair Tisdale asked if the information on page 14 regarding ridership numbers was equivalent to boardings.

Ms. McKillop confirmed that it was data for boardings.

Chair Tisdale stated that RTD reported that in 2017 the agency had 101 million boardings and was projecting, in any of the options, to significantly fall short of that number.

Ms. McKillop stated that data reports a 1% to a 1.5% decrease in ridership every year.

Chair Tisdale stated that the Board was interested in the public comments.

Director Archueta asked if the agency would consider changing the fare increase timing to every five years rather than every three years.

Director Walker stated that he looked at the way these options as a household benefit and that he did not agree that it was RTD’s mission to increase ridership but rather to provide the needs to the customers. He expressed concern that ridership loss would resulted in service cuts and eliminating discounts to pay for discounts would hurt a lot of riders that would not qualify for the low in come pass. He asked if the cost of gas was included in the model.

Mr. Washington explained that gas was not included and the study was a sensitivity to price model.

Director Walker stated that gas, parking, and transit oriented development all impact ridership.

Director Hoy stated that all options showed that when the agency gave something away, the fares increased and it shows that someone else pays for someone else’s fare. He added that the person who pays the cash fare was paying for someone’s discounted fare. He asked how the 70% youth discount was calculated.

Mr. Washington explained that it was calculated at 70% discount off of the base fare.

Director Hoy stated that, as a director of a suburb, he would not underwrite the Denver Public School district because children that go to school in other areas do not take the RTD bus. He added that means that the people in the suburbs subsidizes the urban areas.  He stated that he was surprised that there was not an option 4 that was just a fare increase and that every option that had a fare increase there was a new discount and that the pass program was tied to increasing the fares.

Ms. McKillop explained that option 2 showed what the fares would look like if fares were not raised and that the school discount was such a small number that it did not impact the overall numbers

Director Hoy agreed with Director Anderson and stated that RTD was not a social agency but a bus company and responsible for moving people. He added that was not an RTD decision was who should receive discounted fares and that it was RTD’s decision to give a great service to all the district. Directory Hoy stated that the issue with the programs was that someone would pay more money to give somebody else a free ride and that it was taking money from A to give it to B, and the taxpayers all pay more.

Mr. Washington stated that the 10 cent difference in Alternative 2 and 3 was to allow the low income program to not have a cap on the amount of discounted fare revenue to be purchased for low income individuals and was not to pay for a discounted youth fare.

Director Catlin asked to see more information on the cost to implement any of the alternatives or similar programs and to have the in formation available for the public.

Ms. McKillop explained that was being worked on and would be provided.

Director Catlin expressed concern that RTD was presenting the PPWG alternatives to the public at the same time as making service changes.

Director Menten agreed with Director Hoy and stated that she believed that ridership was decreasing because of time. She stated that RTD should get rid of low discount fares and should keep the ECO pass and flex pass. Director Menten stated the Board members were to be the stewards of the taxpayers’ money.
