Recommended Actions
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager, Customer & Contracted Services presented
this item to the Board.
Director Daly asked if our operations staff can step forward and store buses at our
facilities and pay less. He thinks we should try and get our in house people to put
out an optional bid to provide storage and facilities to accommodate the service
First Transit provides in Longmont.

Director McMullen will be voting against this item because First Transit does not
provide health care for spouses and children.
Bruce Abel clarified that First Transit provides healthcare to employees and provides
a percentage access to family.

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the

First Transit, Inc. This contract is for three years for an amount not to exceed
$33,046,625 with two (2) one-year options in the amount of $11,615,882 (option

costs in an amount estimated to be approximately $6,477,610 for the initial three
year contract term, $2,238,799 for option year 1, $2,274,389 for option year 2,
for a total of $10,990,799 for the five year period. This results in a total contract
amount not to exceed $39,524,235 for the initial three year contract period and
$67,530,743 for the five year period. This proposal represents the most responsive
