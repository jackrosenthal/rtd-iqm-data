Positive Train Control (PTC)
• PTC is not a Technology!
• PTC is a Federal Mandate
• Train separation or collision avoidance
• Line speed enforcement
• Temporary speed restrictions
• Rail worker wayside safety

• RTD’s Primary Train Control System
• Network Utilizes Wireless & Fiber Communication
• Functions as a “MOVING” Block System

• RTD’s Current PTC Efficiency is at +98%
• DTP selected Wabtec I-ETMS system
because it is an industry leader

Automatic Train Control (ATC)
• Conventional Train Signaling System
• Utilized in USA Since 1920’s
• “Fixed Block” System
• Utilizes Track Circuit Technology
• Incremental Speed Restrictions

Grade Crossing Activations & Prediction
• Conventional Activations
• Function of the ATC System
• “Fixed” Approach Lengths
• Based off Civil Track Speed
• System Fails Safe and
provides the minimum 20 second warning time required by law

• Wireless Activations
• Utilizes the PTC System Technology
• Constant Communication with Crossing Equipment
• “Pings” Approximately 10x per Second
• Provides dynamic control of crossing

• Incremental Train Control System
(ITCS)
• Utilized by Some Commuter Rail
Roads
• Will not Function with RTD’s System
• Low Voltage AC current in Rails
Combined with Track Circuits

• Interoperable Electronic Train
Management System (I-ETMS)
• Technology Utilized on RTD’s
System
• Utilizes Wireless Technology

Driver Behavior Concerns
• Effects of Warning Time on Driver Behavior and Safety
at Grade Crossings Study
• Warning Times in Excess of 30-40 seconds caused many
more drivers to engage in risky crossing behavior.
• Most drivers expect a train to arrive within 20 seconds from
the moment the activation begins.
• Drivers begin to lose confidence in the traffic control
system if the warning time exceeds approximately 60
seconds.
• Suggested warning time guidelines (20 sec minimum, 2535 sec desirable, 60 sec maximum)
• Four-quadrant gates should be used if 10% of warning
times exceed 60 sec.
• Reference: Assessment of Warning Time Needs at Railroad
Highway Grade Crossings with Active Traffic Control,

Introduction and Background Highlights
In Director-level roles of Process Excellence, Data Analytics or Customer Research,
I zealously apply research, science and analysis skills to guide strategic decisions
and solve practical problems for organizations.
Background Highlights – Academic
I received a Ph.D. and an MA in Industrial-Organizational Psychology with a minor in Statistics
and Measurement.

Background Highlights – Career
In addition to corporate employment, I have regularly conducted research, taught University
classes and consulted with small-large businesses, unions and individuals. I spent over 12
years at DTE Energy in progressive roles in customer research, process improvement, and
customer service. Many of the challenges faced by RTD are very similar to those at the Detroitbased electric and gas utility.

Continuous Improvement & Innovation
Formal approaches to improvement (e.g., Quality Circles, Total Quality Management, Process
Reengineering, Lean Six Sigma) have helped many organizations dramatically increase their
ability to meet goals.
• Continuous improvement is a set of methods for identifying opportunities for
streamlining work and reducing waste
• Innovation is an organization's process for introducing new ideas, workflows,
methodologies, services or products.

Why Focused Improvement is Critical Now
RTD is facing many challenges both external and internal to the agency.

Environment
• Population Growth
• Low Unemployment-Competition for Employees
• Customer Expectation Changes (e.g., Real Time Information)
• Technology Changes (Automatic People Counters, Global Positioning System, etc.)

Industry
• Technology Changes (Ride share, Autonomous vehicles, etc.)
• Emphasis on Equity

Inside RTD
• Limited Revenue Growth
• Competing Needs of Capital Growth and Operations
• Data Assets not Optimized
• Decreasing Ridership
• Aging Workforce

Packet Pg. 41

History of Continuous Improvement at RTD
RTD has already started a formal approach to improvement.
• RTD conducted 30 “Listening Sessions” at 15 facilities & received nearly 1400 employee surveys in 2015.
• Several employees attended Peak Academy with the City and County of Denver
• Began E3 Program (Engage, Exchange, Empower), with primary goal of employee engagement, to provide
employees with foundational skills and a framework to apply expertise and ideas and solve problems.
• Imported existing training from Peak Academy,
adapted for needs of RTD.
• Implemented Pilots in Customer Care and Bus
Maintenance. Led to meaningful increases in
engagement, many local improvements.
• Emphasized front line training and coaching to
support engagement.
• Established a base program for shared mindset
and language around finding solutions.
