Sales Tax Audit Process, Presentation from Colorado Dept of Revenue
Phil, Chief Auditor of Department of Revenue, gave a brief presentation on Audit
process, which includes home rule jurisdictions and discussed with the Committee
the process of audit vendors who are collecting taxes properly and ensure what
they collect is correct. The way audits are selected come from a variety of
sources. For small vendors, all invoices are searched by a block sample over a
period of time or random sampling basis. The Denver Metro area covers the
majority of where audits are done. He also discussed how use tax is audited.
There was discussion about if RTD went home rule, in his opinion, he does not
think it would make a difference.
