BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2023 General Manager and CEO Performance Appraisal

December 4, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
December 4, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson’s attached
performance appraisal for the period of January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023 (performance
period), and in connection therewith, to approve no corresponding monetary incentive award and no
corresponding change to the 2024 Adjusted Base Salary.
BOARD REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Chair of the Performance Committee
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 Minutes
BACKGROUND
The Performance Committee (PC) is responsible for oversight and management of the GM/CEO’s
employment contract, compensation package, and annual comprehensive performance appraisal.
Following the PC’s consideration, the GM/CEO’s performance appraisal and any corresponding incentive
and adjusted base compensation are reviewed and approved by the Board.
On September 20, 2020, RTD and General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson entered into
a five-year employment agreement (“Agreement”). The Agreement sets forth her compensation and
benefits, as well as a program by which the Board, in consultation with Ms. Johnson, establishes
performance goals and metrics, annually evaluates her performance, and utilizes a framework for
determining future incentive awards and increases to base salary subject to her meeting or exceeding
these goals. The Agreement has been amended by the parties four times, with the most recent
amendment adopted by the Board on October 25, 2022.
DISCUSSION
Consistent with the Third and Fourth Amendments, on November 6, 2023, GM/CEO Johnson submitted
a self-evaluation for the Board’s consideration. All Directors were given the opportunity to submit rating
and comments on the GM/CEO’s performance during the performance period. The attached appraisal
reflects the Board’s assessment that GM/CEO Johnson did not meet expectations with respect to the
Strategic Priorities and Success Outcomes and that she met expectations with respect to the
Organizational Values.

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the GM/CEO’s performance is reflective of the overall performance
of the agency as a whole.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact for the action.

GM/CEO Self-Evaluation
As I reflect on the year, there have been some notable wins associated with the agency’s core business, e.g.,
service delivery:
•
•

•

•

The adoption of Respect the Ride, the agency’s updated Code of Conduct to foster a welcoming
environment for all employees and customers in July 2023
July also saw the adoption of a new simplistic, equitable, and affordable fare structure that has been
lauded by customers, employees, stakeholders and advocates that came after a robust engagement plan
that included communicating in 21 languages, extensive surveys and public meetings in Spanish and
English
The new fare structure was accompanied by a one-year Zero Fare for Youth pilot program supported by
the Federal Transit Administration, Denver City Council, and Denver Public Schools. Further in July, during
the weekend of July 14-15, RTD experienced its busiest weekend ever. The surge in ridership was the
result of back-to-back Taylor Swift concerts at Empower Field at Mile High Stadium and home baseball
games of the Rockies vs. Yankees at Coors Field. The starting times of the major events overlapped on
both Friday and Saturday evening
In August 2023, the agency retained the services of WSP to work in partnership to develop a Facilities
and Fleet Transition Plan over the course of 18 months. Rounding out the summer was the two-month
Zero Fare for Better Air Initiative that garnered a 10% increase in the overall number of boardings on
bus, rail, and paratransit services. When compared with the same period last year, an additional
1,106,567 customer boardings occurred on RTD’s system during the months of July and August

I have been able to enhance my external relationships with state legislators and other state public officials, as
evidenced by my inclusion in the state’s delegation to Switzerland in May 2023, in addition to serving as a
thought leader on the myriad service delivery methods and governance structures for intercity passenger rail,
as that is a priority of the Governor. Further evidence of these relationships is the level of support received from
Governor Polis and members of his staff, including the Colorado Department of Transportation, in April 2023
regarding RTD’s holistic facilities and fleet transition strategy and the agency’s commitment to assisting the state
in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
At a regional level, my engagement has been equitable in that I have met with and presented at Boards of
County Commissioners, City Council meetings, and study sessions and have participated in Metro Mayors Caucus
meetings as well as a service-area wide forum for elected officials.
Some specific examples of my engagement include, but are limited to, the Northwest Mayors and Commissioners
Coalition advocacy mission to Washington, D.C., which culminated in the Northwest Region receiving a RAISE
grant in the amount of $25 million to support CO 119 Safety and Mobility Improvements and Bikeway Project
and a celebratory media event of which I participated along with Governor Polis, CDOT’s Executive Director,
Senate Transportation Committee Chair, Faith Winter and Boulder County Commissioner Claire Levy amongst
others.
Regarding internal relations, during the March 2023, “Dialogue with Debra,” which is an in-person and virtual
open forum for all employees held on a bi-monthly basis, I stated:

“We’re only better together. When people talk about RTD, it’s not some anomaly or some
ambiguous entity. RTD is all of us. We’re the people that comprise it. If we want to be great at

responsibilities. With that top of mind, my performance review period was filled with successes and areas of
opportunities that will carry over into 2024.

1.C.1.b

GM/CEO Self-Evaluation
With that mindset, employees were empowered to address pain points in 2023 via the Employee Ownership
Task Force; that direct ownership, as evidenced by Employee Satisfaction survey responses via the 2023
Employee Ownership Survey, resulted in substantial percentage increases in employees’ perception relative to
their supervisors respecting employees; employees understanding the agency’s mission and vision; and their
perception of internal communications.
I have had the opportunity to leverage Employee Appreciation Days, including National Employee Appreciation
Day on March 4 and Transit Worker Appreciation Day on March 17, division visits and ride-alongs on bus and
rail as well as with RTD-PD and the Coordinator for Houselessness issues, in addition to rounding out with
bimonthly “Dialogue(s) with Debra.”
Regarding Board interactions, I have prided myself on being versatile and agile by meeting Board members
where they are in maintaining open communication. I have provided advance notification of critical issues and
have not shied away from delivering unpopular news, e.g., the cancellation of the New Flyer contract for 17
battery-electric buses; the required duration of developing a holistic Facilities and Fleet Transition; the Nine Mile
Elevator Service disruption; the W Line derailment and service restoration; and the coping panel project impacts.
Moreover, I have remained consistent in providing Board notifications regarding trespassers on RTD right-ofway who have succumbed to injuries sustained and appearances/presentations before the state legislature as
well in local jurisdictions represented by Board members.
Lastly, I have been flexible with addressing one-on-one interactions by deferring to Board members to decide
the best form of engagement. These interactions range from recurring one-on-ones to monthly engagements
for some, and ad hoc for others.
Going forward in 2024, I once again welcome the opportunity to have standing engagements with the Board
collectively to discuss critical matters, share a day in the life of the GM/CEO, and receive constructive, candid,
and helpful feedback for the betterment of my success and that of the agency.
There is a plethora of opportunities before the agency, including, but not limited to:
•

•
•
•

Maintaining assets in a state of good repair and utilizing the Transit Asset Management Plan in concert
with financial forecasting to ensure longevity for the transit network, including its infrastructure, facilities
and rolling stock
Upgrading systems and establishing processes and procedures for the betterment of core business
functions; reporting and transparency
Increasing the agency’s investment in its people through learning and development, and other retention
strategies
Creating an optimal working environment for all employees and a welcoming transit environment for our
customers

what we do, we have to take ownership in that. The strategic priority of employee ownership is
important. Because there’s no need for me without you, and there’s no need for any of us without
customers. When we start thinking in those people-centric terms, we can effectuate some great
things and effectuate change.”

1.C.1.b

GM/CEO Self-Evaluation
A healthy and productive partnership between the Board of Directors and its Chief Executive is critical to the
success of any organization. I look forward to leaning in and further engaging with the Board to makes lives
better though connections in 2024.

I, along with the agency’s dedicated employees, will be tackling these challenges in 2024 through three
initiatives – Back to Basics, People Power, and Creating a Welcoming Transit Environment – that will
drive operational decision-making and resource utilization.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Fifth Amendment to CEO and GM Employment Agreement

December 4, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
December 4, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt a Fifth Amendment to the Employment Agreement with General
Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson to adjust the annual deadline by which the Board shall adopt the
Weighted Success Outcomes, Organizational Values, and Goals and the distribution of the Compensation
Increase between base salary and incentive compensation for the upcoming performance period from
December 31 to January 31, as set forth in the proposed amendment.
Added to Committee Agenda by the Performance Committee Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws
Article VI., Section 1(b). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Director Erik Davidson, Performance Committee Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On September 29, 2020, the Board and Ms. Johnson entered into an employment agreement
(Agreement), which provides that the Board, in consultation with Ms. Johnson, will adopt a program by
which the Board will annually evaluate Ms. Johnson’s performance. Per the Agreement, by November 1
each year, Ms. Johnson shall propose any suggested adjustments to the Weighted Success Outcomes,
Organizational Values, or Goals and the proposed distribution between base salary and incentive
compensation of the Compensation Increase for the Board’s consideration. After consideration of Ms.
Johnson’s proposal and consultation with Ms. Johnson, the Board adopts the Weighted Success
Outcomes, Organizational Values, or Goals and the proposed distribution between base salary and
incentive compensation of the Compensation Increase for the next performance period by December 31.
DISCUSSION
To allow additional time for the Board to consider Ms. Johnson’s proposal and engage in further
consultation with Ms. Johnson, it is recommended that the Board adopt a fifth amendment to the
Agreement to adjust the Board’s annual deadline to adopt the goals and metrics upon which Ms.
Johnson will be evaluated in the coming year from December 31 to January 31. In addition, following an
election year, this timing would allow newly elected Directors an opportunity to participate in the goals
and metrics development discussion. If the amendment is adopted, for the performance period beginning
January 1, 2024, the Board’s deadline would be January 31, 2024.
