RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the RTD Service Standards as revised July 2016, thereby adopting the updated policies and
standards as included in Attachment B.
BACKGROUND
RTD has had service standards in place since 1987, which have provided a rational, equitable and
sustainable approach to developing and evaluating all its services for the benefit of the District’s
constituents as a whole. The last revision was adopted in 2002 and in 2008 RTD commissioned our
Service Development consultant to provide a thorough review of our standards in relation to transit
industry peers.
DISCUSSION
Many changes have occurred in our industry as well as to RTD needs since 2002. The acquisition of
automatic vehicle location and passenger counting has provided a profusion of valuable data for
improved analytics and reporting, such as better measurements for on-time performance and crowding.
Our Geographic Information System is used to illustrate service classification and the effects of service
changes on Access-a-Ride customers. Consideration of FTA regulations for Tile VI and Environmental
Justice are now expressly incorporated into the Standards. To address the diverse needs of the RTD
constituencies, RTD has developed guidelines regarding shuttles and circulators as well as a cost sharing
policy. In addition, recommendations have been incorporated into the revised standards for: the service
classification system; new service warrants; service design and performance standards; demandresponsive transit; and standards for transit-dependent riders.
These and other revisions developed since 2002 were vetted with extensive involvement of RTD Service
Development, Engineering and Planning Technical Services staff. In 2015 RTD invited review and
comment from our stakeholders and held several meetings with all those representatives who were
interested (about a dozen). As a result a number of revisions were incorporated into the document,
although some that require much more extensive analysis were postponed for future consideration.
Attachment A provides highlights of the revisions.
FINANCIAL IMPACTS
No direct financial impacts are incurred with the adoption of this update to current policy. Financial
impacts will be determined by the actual application of these standards.

Highlights of Revisions to the Transit Service Policies & Standards
The following follows the Table of Contents of the document.
1. Introduction
Due to the implementation of FasTracks and resulting service restructuring, the routes
in the Express, Regional and SkyRide service classes are reassigned into either the
Regional class or the Local CBD class based on the length of the non-stop portion of
the route. Also the Urban classification is now specifically defined as having 35% or
more of route length within a ¼ mile buffer with population+employment density of
12 per acre or greater; and Suburban class with 34% or less.
2.3.1 Minimum Service Frequency
Rail and Enhanced Bus (BRT) minimums were added to the table of minimum
frequencies.
2.3.3 Maximum Load (Crowding) Standard
From the latest customer and industry research, RTD now defines the amount of
crowding on a route as the percent of total trips during a defined time period that
exceed the comfort passenger level of 4.3—5.3 square feet per standee (level-ofservice D and E).
2.4.2 Access-A-Ride
A new section was added summarizing US DOT requirements for ADA complementary
paratransit for individuals who cannot readily access the RTD bus and rail system.
2.5 Reliability
A new section was added defining on-time for fixed-route service as not more than 1
minute early to not more than 5 minutes late.
3.3 Roadway Design Goal
This now references the Engineering staff’s Bus Transit Facilities document, Transit
Access section.
4. Shelters
A new section was added defining the minimum warrant for the placement of a shelter
as 40 boardings per day at a stop.
5.2.1 Minimum Service Levels
Call-n-Ride is included as an appropriate service for areas with 3 - 12
population+employment per acre.
5.2.2 Maximum Target Service levels
This section was deleted as not needed.
5.2.2 Access-A-Ride - ADA Required Service Area Coverage
A new section was added summarizing the FTA requirements for ADA complementary
paratransit services.
6. Transit Access
A new section was added referencing the Engineering staff’s Bus Transit Facilities
document, Transit Access section.
7.2 Standards for Events
The paragraph that “RTD may also provide service at events with lower attendance
projections if the promoter is willing to subsidize such service” is deleted. This is
charter service and not permitted by FTA.
8. Shuttles & Circulators

Packet Pg. 5

Attachment: Atch A - Highlights of Revisions to Transit Service Policies & Standards (2844 : Revised RTD Transit Service Policies & Standards)

1.B.1.a

A new section was added that provides guidelines and requirements to stakeholders in
local communities who would like to develop such services. It addresses such
characteristics as population density, major activity centers, transit friendly
environment, minimum service levels and fares.
10. Title VI Compliance
A new section was added that RTD follows FTA Circular 4072.1B “Title VI
Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration Recipients,” Chapter
4.4.
12. Service Change Process
A new section was added describing the typical runboard process for analyzing,
proposing and implementing service changes.
13. Cost Sharing Policy
A new section was added detailing this policy that facilitates partnerships with RTD to
demonstrate new or expanded services using funds obtained from grants and
voluntarily pledged by private employers, businesses or local governments. The
guidance outlines financial feasibility, vehicle availability, local government and
community support and performance requirements.

1.B.1.b

1.1 Overview
RTD continually receives requests for changes to existing service and for new service in
growing areas of the District. Additionally, RTD may be operating some services that are
not attracting enough riders to justify their cost. In order to be consistent in the
evaluation of service proposals, and to ensure that the service being provided represents
the most cost-effective use of the District's resources, a set of service standards is
maintained by RTD.
The specific standards, targets or minimum/maximum values for the standards, and a
procedure for applying these standards, are presented in this document. Since service
standards are intended to optimize usage of the District's resources, they are updated
periodically to reflect changes in the District goals and resources. The procedure for
updating the standards is described in Section 1.3.

1.2 Application of Service Standards
There are two primary applications for the ongoing use of the service standards. These
are the use of standards to evaluate existing services, and use of standards to evaluate
proposals for new service.
The application of standards to existing routes is a flexible process. The purpose of the
standards is to help identify routes which are most in need of service changes, such as
restructuring to eliminate lower productivity segments or branches, adjusting service
frequency to better reflect the demand for service, or providing additional promotion of
less patronized routes where appropriate. Routes, which do not meet standards, are not
automatically designated for elimination. Elimination of routes is only intended as a last
resort, when it has been determined that no cost-effective actions are available to improve
the productivity of the route.
The standards for evaluation of existing routes are not intended to preclude changes to
routes that meet these minimum standards. In many cases, it may be possible to improve
the productivity of routes that meet the minimum standards by making changes to
headways or trip times. Since the overall mission of RTD is “To meet our constituents’
present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable, courteous,
accessible and cost-effective service throughout the District,” these standards should not
be used to prevent changes to improve the efficiency of existing routes, as long as the
changes meet the route design standards.
The availability of financial resources, represented by the annual budget, is the bottom line
for these standards. Service expansion may occur when additional funds are available and
contraction may occur otherwise. In any case, selection of which services to provide or
curtail is based on these performance standards and no service is considered guaranteed

1. Introduction

Service Development Policies & Standards

1.B.1.b

The evaluation of new service proposals will take place as proposals are received or needs
identified. The most recent values of the standards for existing routes will be used to
evaluate the proposed new services. Decisions regarding implementation of new routes
will be made through the service planning process. New routes and services will be
expected to meet all applicable design standards described in Sections 2, 3 and 554, but
will not be expected to meet the productivity standards described in Section 2.3.2.1 until
they have been in operation for at least six months. Demonstration, experimental, and
cost sharing services are also handled in this manner.

1.3 Updating of Service Standards
The service standards are intended to support the goals and objectives of the District.
Since these objectives and the resources available to attain them can be expected to
change over time, the standards will be revised periodically to reflect those changes.
The service standards will be reviewed on a bi-annual basis. At that time, experience
with the service standards over the previous time period, as well as changes in the
District's goals and objectives, will be used to determine whether any standards should be
added or revised.
The numerical values of productivity standards will be updated each year, using ridership,
revenue and cost figures for the most recent twelve-month period for which data are
available. The rankings are based only on those routes that existed for the entire year.
Routes which were eliminated during the year will not be included because they cannot be
identified as candidates for revisions. Routes that were introduced during the year will not
be included in determining the new standards since they are not required to meet the
productivity standards until they have been in operation for at least six months. However,
these routes will be evaluated separately, using the service standards contained in this
document.
The updating procedure will compare the values of the productivity standards with those
in effect for the previous year. Operating cost data for the previous year will be revised to
account for system-wide increases or decreases in operating cost.

2. Performance Standards
2.1

Derivation and Use of Standards

The productivity standards are used to identify routes and services for appropriate
marketing and possible revision or elimination. Separate standards are identified for each
class of service. Routes are evaluated on ridership (either boardings per in-service hour or
per trip, depending on the class of service) and on the economic measure of subsidy per
passenger. These standards are based on the performance of the least productive 10
percent of the routes in each service class for either the ridership or economic measure, or

Revised July 7, 2016July 7, 2016April 15, 2016 2

or beyond review. The RTD Board of Directors, with input from RTD staff and the public,
is responsible for making decisions on service recommendations.

Service Development Policies & Standards

on the least productive 25 percent of routes in both measures. The basis for the
standards will be reviewed in conjunction with the cost recovery standards in Section 996,
and may be revised if necessary.
New services should meet the applicable standards for their class of service after six
months of operation. All new services will be reviewed after six months of operation and
routes that have not shown adequate progress toward meeting the standards will be
targeted for cost-effective actions to increase productivity or for elimination.
For the purpose of applying the standards, Local and Limited routes will be divided into
three groups based on area-type land-use designations: CBD routes (routes which serve
the Denver Central Business District), Urban routes, and Suburban routes. These
groupings of Local and Limited routes will enable the comparison of routes with similar
service characteristics. Express, Regional and sky Ride routes will be evaluated as
separate classes due to their different service characteristics. For the purposes of
evaluating productivity, Light Rail will be measured against the standards established for
CBD Local routes, except where otherwise noted.
To meet the RTD mission to provide cost-effective service throughout the District, RTD
has developed different types or classes of service that serve specific markets and,
therefore, have different performance expectations. Due to their different service
characteristics Express, Regional and SkyRide were treated as separate classes. However,
due to the deployment of rail, BRT and resulting service restructuring, these classes are
reconfigured. The routes in these three are reassigned into a new, consolidated Regional
class or the Local CBD class. Regional class includes routes providing high-speed service
on limited access highways from suburban and outlying communities to downtown
Denver, Denver International Airport and other metro, major employment centers, and
provided at distances of approximately 6 miles or more. Local services have three subclassifications: CBD—any route serving downtown Denver; Urban—35% or more of route
length within a ¼ mile buffer has population+employment density of 12 per acre or
greater; and Suburban—34% or less. Call-n-Ride and Access-a-Ride are separate classes.
Enhanced bus and BRT routes may warrant future consideration regarding their operation
with: dedicated right-of-way; partially dedicated ROW; limited or express mode; priority
over other traffic; and various speeds appropriate to context. [Please see attachment A
Service Classes for details on how these revisions affect current routes.]
The standards for evaluating portions of routes are intended for use in identifying needed
service improvements, for making modifications to specific portions of existing routes, or
for identifying low productivity segments of routes.
These standards could be used in situations such as isolating low productivity portions of
otherwise productive routes or measuring options for bringing unproductive routes into
compliance with the overall service standards. These standards may also be used to
evaluate proposals for new route extensions or deviations on existing routes.

1.B.1.b

Service Development Policies & Standards

The RTD’s approach is to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel
markets. All services are designed to match the level of service with demand, thus
improving performance and sustainability. This results in multiple domains of acceptable
performance for the various classes of service. Standards are best set by first determining
measures of performance and objectives. The core objective is to maximize overall
ridership, to the extent allowed by the available resources.
2.2.1 Performance Objective
Service allocation is driven by the RTD adopted mission statement: “To meet our
constituents’ present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable,
courteous, accessible cost-effective service throughout the District.”
Performance Measures
 Passengers/hour (productivity)
 Passengers/trip (Regional class
productivity)
 Subsidy/passenger (cost
effectiveness)
The subsidy per passenger measure
combines fare revenue and total cost
impacts to produce a measure that
comprehensively reflects the District’s
allocation of resources. The effectivenessproductivity chart, Error! Reference source
not found.Figure 1 - Effectiveness - Figure 1 Effectiveness - Productivity Chart
Productivity Chart, presents economic
effectiveness on the vertical axis, and productivity, or boardings per hour, on the
horizontal axis. The chart offers a convenient comparative analysis of all classes of
services, illustrating both absolute and relative performance.
When standards and
guidelines are applied, judgments can be made.

2.3 Fixed Route Service Design and Evaluation Standards
2.3.1 Minimum Service Frequency
New routes shall provide the minimum frequencies specified below. Existing services that
cannot meet these minimum standards while adhering to the minimum passengers per
hour or trip standards defined in Section 2.3.2 shall be identified as candidates for service
changes or appropriate marketing promotion within available resources. These service
changes may include providing service with longer headways if no other viable alternative
exists. Elimination of the route may be considered if service changes and/or promotional
efforts do not improve productivity.
These are “policy” service levels and represent a compromise between economic
efficiency and the functionality of the system. To be sustained at these levels, a route
must meet the minimum ridership performance standards discussed in Section 2.3.2.1 and

2.3.2 Minimum Ridership Performance
This standard applies to routes operating at the minimum service frequency target. For
Local and Limited routes, the standard is passengers per hour based upon the bottom 10%
and 25% of routes in the respective class. For Express, Regional, and SkyRide routes, the
standard is passengers per trip.
These standards are derived from system averages by class of service. All routes must
meet their applicable minimum standards. Those that do not meet these standards will
need to be modified or marketed in some way in order to bring them up to the minimum
standards. Those that are not brought up to the minimum standards are subject to
cancellation. Routes that meet their applicable minimum ridership standards justify a
service level at the minimum service frequencies outlined in Section 2.3.1. Higher
frequencies must be justified by ridership as outlined in Section 2.3.4.
2.3.2.1

Performance Standards

These measures and the effectiveness-productivity for all routes and services and the class
10% and 25% standards are calculated annually and are provided separately at

available.For other routes Table 2 applies.
On rail, the first trip of the operating day in each direction, operated as the “Sweep
Train” and pull-outs, is exempted from the minimum ridership standards.
Maximum Load (Crowding) Standard

For Local and Limited routes in the peak, the maximum load standard is 125% of a seated
load at the maximum load point. For Local and Limited routes outside of the peak, and for
Express, Regional, and SkyRide routes at all times, the maximum load is the seated
capacity of the vehicle.
Service frequencies shall be adjusted so that the following maximum load standards are
met at least 60 percent of the time:


Local and Limited Service:
Peak periods – 125 percent of seated load on RTD's present bus fleet. The
maximum time that an individual passenger should be expected to stand on a given
trip is 15 minutes.
Off-peak periods - seated load



Express, Regional, and SkyRide Service:
Seated load at all times.



2.3.2.2 Specific Trips Ridership Standards

Service Development Policies & Standards

Peak periods – 125 passengers per vehicle
Off-peak periods – seated load
Special events – 165 passengers per vehicle
From the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual: “From the passenger
perspective, the passenger load on a transit vehicle affects the comfort of the on-board
vehicle portion of a transit trip-both in terms of being able to find a seat and in overall
crowding levels within the vehicle. From a transit operator's perspective, a poor quality of
service may indicate the need to increase service frequency or vehicle size to reduce
crowding and increase passenger comfort.”
RTD defines crowding as a seated load plus the standing passenger space, as calculated
for each vehicle by subtracting the area occupied by seats and other objects from the
gross interior floor area. The amount of crowding on a route is defined as the percent of
total trips during a defined time period that exceed a comfort passenger level of 4.3—5.3
square feet per standee, generally having these characteristics (See page 5-24 of the
Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, 3rd Edition,
http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_rpt_165ch-05.pdf):
 Standing load without body contact
 Standees have similar amount of personal space as seated passengers
 Reasonably easy circulation within vehicle
The maximum number of standees can be computed for each vehicle by determining its
standing passenger square footage and dividing by 4.3—5.3. For any service class during
any defined period (e.g., AM early, AM peak, midday), when 10% or more of the
directional trips exceed the computed maximum standees at the maximum load point,
further investigation of potential remedies, such as changing the bus assignment or
frequency of service, is warranted. For special events heavier loads are expected and
acceptable, but when 10% or more of trips during the take-away have 4 or less square
feet per standing passenger, further investigation of potential remedies is warranted. See
Attachment D Crowding Report Examples for reference. The Percent of Total Trips chart
(lower right) with level-of-service D or E would indicate crowding.
2.3.4 Demand Based Service Frequency
Service frequency in the RTD network is based on clock-pattern schedules. This pattern
provides consistent and easy to understand schedules for our customers, and makes
possible the provision of timed transfer connection hubs, whereby multiple routes are
scheduled to meet at one location to facilitate connections. In general, routes are
scheduled to operate in even increments of 30 minutes, or every 60, 30, 15, 10, 7.5, or 5
minutes. However, other frequencies may be provided depending upon passenger
demand, or operational and scheduling needs.
For routes meeting the above frequency, ridership, and load standards, frequency better
than every 30 minutes may be provided when and where justified by ridership. This
standard applies equally to all service categories. In order to be sustainable, higher
frequency service must meet the following criteria:

Incremental frequency necessary to maintain the appropriate load standard during any
30 minute time period.
Appropriate vehicle assignment as outlined in Section 2.3.5
When a service exceeds the maximum load standard, higher frequency may be justified
during that time period and/or route segment.
If a service with better than the minimum frequency has passenger loads that can be
accommodated with a lower frequency without violating the load standard, then
frequency may be reduced.
As a general guideline, a typical productivity by service frequency, for a whole route or
a segment or time period is provided in Table 3 Demand Based Service Frequency

Small 27’-30’ Bus: Appropriate for lower volume Local routes where ridership does
not require a standard bus, or for routes where specific operating concerns preclude
use of standard buses and for Call-n-Ride.
Standard 40’ Transit Bus: The standard equipment for Local and Express Regional
services. May also be used on Regional and SkyRide trips in the Express fare category.
Articulated 60’ Bus: Appropriate for higher volume Limited and Express Regional
services. May also be used on Regional and SkyRide trips in the Express fare category.
Intercity Coach: Appropriate for Regional and SkyRide services.

2.3.6 Design and Evaluation of Portions of Routes
The standards for evaluating portions of routes cover two areas in which minor
modifications may be made to routes without changing the overall structure of the route:
 midline segments or midline deviations
 branches or end segments
The governing standards for overall route productivity were presented earlier. Since trips
provided during marginally productive hours of the day or trips over marginal segments
often increase the attractiveness of the overall service, an otherwise productive route may
be able to support some less productive trips or portions of the route. However, if a route
cannot meet the overall service standards for its class of service, there may not be
productive segments to enhance the unproductive segments. Therefore, specific
segments, branches, or trips which meet the standards for portions of routes may still be

Service Development Policies & Standards

1.B.1.b

2.3.6.1 Midline Segments and Midline Deviations




A midline segment or deviation of a Local or Limited route should generate enough
boardings per hour of service provided to meet the standard for its class of service
(CBD, Urban and Suburban). Boardings in both directions will be counted.
If a route is changed, the change shall not cause a reduction in the overall boardings
per hour for the route.
If a route is changed, the change shall not cause the route to violate any route design
standards as defined in Section 2.3, or the overall productivity standards as defined in
Section 2.

2.3.6.2 Branches and End Segments









A branch or end segment of a Local or Limited route should generate enough boardings
to meet the ridership standard for its class of service (CBD, Urban and Suburban).
Boardings generated along the branch are defined as all passengers boarding the bus
along the branch or end portion of the route, and all outbound passengers alighting
along this section.
Local collector portions of Express and Regional routes which meet the following
maximum travel time standard, shall meet the ridership productivity standard for the
entire route. This maximum travel time is equal to 15 minutes or 50 percent of line
haul travel time, whichever is less.
For shorter segments, the minimum ridership standard is reduced by the ratio of actual
travel time to the maximum allowable travel time. Thus, if the actual travel time along
the collector is half of the maximum allowed, it must average half the number of
boardings per trip specified in the minimum ridership productivity standard.
A new extension to a route that does not meet the minimum ridership productivity
standard must attract sufficient ridership for the entire route to meet the minimum
ridership standard for its service class.
A route extension will not be initiated if it violates any of the route design standards
found in Section 2.3, or causes the route as a whole to fall below the minimum riders
per unit of service or standards found earlier in Section 2.3.2.

2.4 Demand Response Service Design and Evaluation Standards
RTD continues to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel markets.
The goal of this approach is to match the type and level of service to the demand in a
given service area, thus improving performance and sustainability. As such, a variety of
non-fixed route services are provided by the RTD including the following.
2.4.1 Call-n-Ride
Rather than operating on a fixed route and schedule, demand responsive Call-n-Ride
service is characterized as a shared ride within a defined geographic service area and the
need for the passenger to arrange for pick-up in advance or be at a designated checkpoint

Revised July 7, 2016July 7, 2016April 15, 2016 9

meet the service standards for its class of service.

Service Development Policies & Standards

at prescheduled times. A Call-n-Ride service area averages about 7 square miles or
between about 2 to 30 square miles depending on its number of vehicles and service
configuration—predominantly station feeder or community-based service. Call-n-Ride often
provides first/last mile access to the broader RTD network of services through timed
connections at transfer centers and Park-n-Rides. Population plus employment is
predominantly 3 to 12 persons per acre. Call-n-Ride service is evaluated based on
passenger boardings per revenue hour and subsidy per passenger boarding.
2.4.2 Access-A-Ride
Access-a-Ride provides ADA complementary paratransit in the District to individuals who
cannot readily access the bus and rail system. As per US DOT requirements the
passenger’s trip origin and destination must be within ¾ mile of RTD’s non-commuter bus
route system, during the same days and hours of their operation and within the District
boundaries, and curb-to-curb service must be provided. However, RTD provides door-todoor service as a reasonable accommodation. Trips must be booked at least one day and
up to 3 days in advance; however, RTD also offers subscriptions.
All applicants must qualify for certification under the guidelines established by the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, complete a functional evaluation in person,
provide a physician’s statements to verify disability and must meet one of the following
criteria:
 Be unable to get to and from a bus stop or on and off a lift-equipped bus by yourself
 Have a cognitive disability that prohibits your understanding of how to complete bus
trips
2.4.3 Vanpooling
Vanpooling is a public transportation option in which commuters, whose residences are
geographically clustered, ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically vanpools make one roundtrip per day and
carry from 5 to 14 riders. Vanpooling offers greater opportunities for increased capacity
compared to carpooling and offers a cost-effective alternative to conventional transit in
areas of low employment density and longer commute distances. RTD contracts for this
service with DRCOG to subsidize the portion of the commute trip within the District.
Vanpool service is evaluated based on subsidy per passenger boarding.
2.4.4 SeniorRide and Senior Shopper
SeniorRide Special Events transports groups to a variety of cultural, educational and
entertainment events. The Schedule of events is published 3 times a year to the public.
Service is available on a first come first served basis. A minimum of 10 passengers per
trip is required. Scheduled events that do not generate reservations of at least 2 groups of
10 may not be rescheduled for the next 12 months.

1.B.1.b

Service Development Policies & Standards

SeniorShopper buses have established routes that provide trips to major grocery stores.
Service is available Monday through Friday. A minimum of 10 passengers per trip is
required.
RTD provides services to enhance the welfare of certain groups of persons such as the
current services offered for shopping and recreational trips for elderly persons or persons
with disabilities. Since SeniorRide and Senior Shopper service are point to point services,
these services are evaluated based on passenger boardings per trip. Refer to Appendix A
for current standards.

2.5 Reliability
On-time for fixed-route service is defined as not more than 1 minute early to not more than
5 minutes late. RTD sets annual objectives for on-time performance by class of service
and which are reported in the Quarterly Performance Report. [Improved methods for
monitoring, identifying the causes and remedying unreliable service are currently in
development.]

3. Geometric Design Standards
3.1 Directness of Route
Routes shall be designed to be as direct as possible and to provide maximum accessibility
to transit.
 Deviations from a direct path from end-to-end of the route shall account for no more
than one-quarter of the end-to-end travel time of the route.


For a specific deviation, the total additional travel time for all through passengers
should not exceed three minutes for each rider boarding or alighting along the
deviation.
In mathematical terms, this means that the quantity
Pt * VTT < 3 minutes
Pd
where: Pt = through passengers
VTT = additional vehicle one-way travel time
Pd = passengers served by deviation

3.2 Stop Spacing Standards
Bus routes shall adhere to the following stop spacing standards. Placement also
considers: the balance between pedestrian access and route travel time; ADA
requirements; adjacent land uses; streetscape conditions and property ownership.
3.2.1 Minimum


Local and Express Regional collection, residential areas - 600'

Limited service, residential and commercial areas – 1,250’ (4 stops/mile)
Limited service, limited stop zone – 8,000’ (1 stop/1.5 miles)

3.3 Roadway Design Goal
New bus routes should not be operated along streets that do not meet minimum
standards:, such as for bus turning radius, pavement strength/loading, lane width,
roadway grade, shoulder width on rural roads (for pedestrian waiting and safety) and
overhead clearance. Refer to the RTD Bus Infrastructure Design Criteria Section 1 –
Transit Access for specific details [currently in development].
 Turning radius - 35' minimum
 Street surface must be asphalt or concrete
 For deep-strength asphalt: 7" for existing street; 11" for new street
 For concrete pavement : 8.5" design thickness; 8" existing thickness
 Lane width - 10' minimum
 No speed bumps
 Bridges - rated for H-20S loading (all legal weights)
 Shoulder width on rural roads - 6' minimum
 Overhead clearance - 12' minimum (16' 6" for structures on new roads)

4. Shelters
The minimum warrant for the placement of a shelter is 40 boardings per day at the stop.
Stops with the highest average of daily boardings will take top priority for shelter
placement. [Revised standards are currently in development and will reference the RTD
Bus Infrastructure Design Criteria.]

5. Area Coverage Standards
5.1 Purpose and Application
The purpose of these standards is to define a reasonable level of service to all areas of the
District and to help RTD maintain this service level. Since the RTD service area includes
many different types of development, and population densities and land use vary widely
across the District, it would not be reasonable to expect all areas to support the same level
of service. Moreover, different types of service may best meet the needs of different
areas, and RTD's resources can be used in a more productive fashion if service can be
tailored to the needs of particular areas. Area coverage standards provide guidelines for
tailoring service to the needs of communities and help ensure that all areas receive a level
of service that is commensurate with their needs.

Service Development Policies & Standards

Levels of service for specific areas also depend on the productivity of existing services. If
existing or proposed services cannot meet the productivity standards outlined in Section 2,
RTD may choose not to provide the minimum level of service. Financial constraints may
also limit RTD's ability to meet the area coverage (or any other) standards.

5.2 Coverage Levels Outside the Denver CBD
The area coverage standards for areas outside the Denver Central Business District (CBD)
are based on a combined density measure. This measure adds population and employment
to determine potential demand for transportation to and from a particular area.
[Attachment B shows the density classifications overlaid with RTD services for the entire
District.]
The area coverage standards presented below deal with minimum and maximum route
spacing. Actual route spacing and service frequency will depend on demand and
productivity of existing service in the area.
For use in this document, arterial roadways are defined as follows:
 Traffic flow controlled by traffic signals as opposed to stop signs
 Carry longer distance traffic flow
 Speed limit 30 mph or faster
 Road width two plus lanes in each direction
5.2.1 Minimum Service Levels
Areas with 3-12 residents and employees per acre
 Peak period Park-n-Ride service if either the travel time to the Denver CBD by Express
bus or rail, or a bus/rail timed connection, exceeds 20 minutes.
 Call-n-Ride service.
Areas with 12 or more residents and employees per acre:
 Local service on major arterials with pedestrian access within 1/4 mile.
 Peak period, Limited, Express, or Regional service from Park-n-Rides if either the travel
time to the Denver CBD by Express bus, or a bus/rail timed connection, exceeds 20
minutes.
5.2.2 Maximum Target Service Levels
Areas with 3-12 residents and employees per acre:
 Local service along major arterials with pedestrian access within 1/4 mile.
 Peak period, Limited, Express, or Regional service from park-n- Rides if travel time to
the Denver CBD by Express bus exceeds 20 minutes.
Areas with 12 or more residents and employees per acre:
 Local service with ½ mile route spacing.
 Limited, Express, or Regional service if travel time to the Denver CBD by Express bus
exceeds 20 minutes.

49 CFR 37.131 - Service criteria for complementary paratransit.
“(1) Bus.
(i) The entity shall provide complementary paratransit service to origins and
destinations within corridors with a width of three-fourths of a mile on each side of
each fixed route. The corridor shall include an area with a three-fourths of a mile
radius at the ends of each fixed route.
(ii) Within the core service area, the entity also shall provide service to small areas
not inside any of the corridors but which are surrounded by corridors.
(iii) Outside the core service area, the entity may designate corridors with widths
from three-fourths of a mile up to one and one half miles on each side of a fixed
route, based on local circumstances.
(iv) For purposes of this paragraph, the core service area is that area in which
corridors with a width of three-fourths of a mile on each side of each fixed route
merge together such that, with few and small exceptions, all origins and
destinations within the area would be served.
“(2) Rail.
(i) For rail systems, the service area shall consist of a circle with a radius of 3/4 of
a mile around each station.
(ii) At end stations and other stations in outlying areas, the entity may designate
circles with radii of up to 11/2 miles as part of its service area, based on local
circumstances.
“(3) Jurisdictional boundaries. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
paragraph, an entity is not required to provide paratransit service in an area outside
the boundaries of the jurisdiction(s) in which it operates, if the entity does not have
legal authority to operate in that area. The entity shall take all practicable steps to
provide paratransit service to any part of its service area.”
“Requirements for complementary paratransit do not apply to commuter bus …
fixed route bus service, characterized by service predominantly in one direction
during peak periods, limited stops, use of multi-ride tickets, and routes of extended
length, usually between the central business district and outlying suburbs.”

6. Transit Access
RTD has guidelines for access to its facilities for pedestrians, bus riders, bicyclists,
passenger loading, and parking. The RTD Bus Infrastructure Design Criteria, included here

planning transit access (including projects under construction) [separately under
development].

Service Development Policies & Standards

1.B.1.b

The following guidelines for provision of bus and/or train service to special events are
based on prior RTD Board actions and on the public convenience and necessity to:




Protect neighborhoods from the impact of events which are so large as to overwhelm
the surrounding supply of parking, and
Serve customers by offering adequate service for events which are predictably large
enough to overload the normally available transit service, and
Protect taxpayers by only serving those events that have a predictable level of transit
demand great enough to justify the operation of special routes.

7.2

Standards for Events

RTD, within the limits of its budget, will operate special service:




For events at Invesco Field at Mile High stadium with projected attendance of over
55,000, for which the crowd is expected to all be present at one time.
For events at Coors Field with projected attendance of over 40,000, for which the
crowd is expected to all be present at one time.
At other venues where the ratio of projected attendance to available on-site parking is
6:1 and for which the crowd is expected to all be present at one time.

This service will not be provided when substantial numbers of the event patrons can be
expected to arrive in privately operated or non-profit owned buses or regularly scheduled
RTD service.
RTD will provide Express Shuttle service to Invesco Field and Coors Field from selected
Park-n-Rides for events described in this section. The General Manager must specifically
authorize Park-n-Ride service for other events.
RTD may also provide service at events with lower attendance projections if the promoter
is willing to subsidize such service. The RTD Board adopted a specific subsidy formula in
September 1987: “the prorated share of RTD’s incremental cost of service, plus a 10%
administrative service fee, the share to be based on the percentage shortfall in ridership
between the minimum ridership of 1650 passengers going to the event and the actual
number of passengers carried, based on RTD traffic checks.”

8. Shuttles & Circulators
8.1 Characteristics
Shuttle and circulator routes are not defined as a separate class of service, but are
typically proposed to serve specific, local, community-focused needs. Shuttle and
circulator routes are generally defined by the following characteristics: short routes,
usually less than 5 miles long; operate on local streets and arterials; connect major activity

Service Development Policies & Standards

1.B.1.b

8.2 Guidelines for Success
Several factors are critical to shuttle and circulator success. As a guideline to make
informed decisions, the following characteristics must be present and considered.


A sustained average population density of at least 10 people per acre along the length
of the route is a minimum requirement; a critical mass of potential riders is needed to
succeed.



Connects community residences with major activity centers such as colleges, high
schools, middle schools, shopping districts (but not auto-centric malls), medical
centers, and downtowns that appeal to all market segments (youth, families, seniors)
and can serve a variety of trip purposes.



Transit friendly environment: pedestrian friendly, walkable streets are a minimum;
mixed land uses; areas of clustered shopping or employment; public spaces; and
bicycle parking/paths.



To attract spontaneous walk up use, the headway needs to be15 minutes or less for a
service span for the intended markets, typically 6:00 – 18:00 or longer.



Offers bi-directional service.



Does not substantially duplicate a service of comparable utility.

9. System-Wide Cost Recovery Standard
The state required system-wide minimum cost recovery ratio is 30 percent. This ratio is
calculated by the following formula:

[Farebox Revenues + Advertising Revenues + Lease Revenues + FTA Operating
Assistance + Other Non-Sales Tax Revenues ] / [Category I Costs +Category II Costs +
Local share of depreciation on RTD assets] [Category Costs applied according to RTD Cost
Model Memo, June 15, 2010, as updated (See summary below)]
Cost Model Summary
With the exception of Private Carrier costs, all costs are allocated to routes by one of
three methods: hours, miles or vehicles. The RTD Bus Cost Model has five cost categories:
Variable/Direct, Variable/Indirect, Private Carrier, Retained Costs and Depreciation. Private
Carrier costs are allocated to routes by the number of hours the contractor operates the
route, multiplied by the average hourly rate billed for that particular contract, plus the
average hourly cost for fuel.

centers; and serve short passenger trip lengths within a single community. Fares must be
set according to RTD Fare Policy.

Service Development Policies & Standards

The annual budget and six-year Strategic Budget Plan are evaluated using this cost
recovery standard.
If the standard is not met, several courses of action may be taken. The RTD Board has
adopted a policy of evaluating the fare structure as part of the annual budget process;
fares may be changed at that time to provide additional revenue. RTD may also choose to
market its services more aggressively to attract more customers and their fares, or RTD
may look for revenue from other sources. The productivity standards in Sections 2 and 3
may be used to reduce the costs of providing service while disrupting service to as few
passengers as possible.

10. Title VI & Environmental Justice Compliance
RTD follows FTA Circular 4072.1B “Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal
Transit Administration Recipients,” Chapter 4.4.
Title VI Protected Classes are race, color and national origin.
Environmental Justice Protected Classes are as follows:
1. Minority Populations:
 American Indian and Alaska Native, which refers to people having origins in any of
the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and
who maintain tribal affiliation or community attachment.
 Asian, which refers to people having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far
East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent, including, for example, Cambodia,
China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and
Vietnam.
 Black or African American, which refers to people having origins in any of the Black
racial groups of Africa.
 Hispanic or Latino, which includes persons of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South
or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.
 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, which refers to people having origins in
any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.
2. Low-Income Populations (150% of Federal Poverty Guidelines)

10.11. Standard for Service for Transit Dependent Persons and
To Social Service Destinations
For purposes of these service standards, transit dependent riders are defined as riders who
either live in a household which does not own a car or who have a physical or mental
disability that prevents the transit patron from driving a car. Social Service destinations
are those destinations that are provided as a public service that may not have consistently
sufficient ridership to otherwise warrant the establishment or continuation of a route or
route segment. Examples of social service destinations would include county court
facilities, hospitals, schools, or public institutions which have been situated or constructed

Service Development Policies & Standards

in isolated locations prior to the establishment of RTD or following review and comment by
RTD of the proposed development plans of such institution or agency, by the appropriate
jurisdiction.

10.111.1

Purpose of the Standard

This standard is intended to provide for consideration of transit dependency in service
decisions. This standard does not guarantee a minimum level of service to all transitdependent riders. However, it will ensure that transit-dependent riders and/or the need to
have access to social service destinations are identified and considered when decisions are
made to reduce service levels in an area.

10.211.2

Determination of Transit Dependency

Whenever RTD plans changes to an existing route where there is no alternative service
available to meet the area coverage standards in Section 5 such as a change in routing or
span of service, transit-dependent riders will be identified through on-board surveys. This
survey will ask questions about riders' travel habits and demographics, and it will attempt
to identify transit-dependent riders and their destinations.

10.311.3

Application of Transit Dependency Standard

The applicable minimum productivity standards for a route will be reduced by one-half the
percentage of ridership that is defined as transit dependent. Thus, if 60 percent of the
riders on a route are transit dependent, the route must achieve 70 percent [100 percent
minus (60 percent divided by 2)] of the applicable productivity standards (ridership and
economic) in order not to be considered a poor performer.
Applicable ridership standards for fixed route services may be found in Section 2.3, and
for non-fixed route services, in Section 2.4.
If the on-board survey reveals that the route does not serve the destinations desired by
transit-dependent riders, RTD may restructure the route to improve service and increase
ridership. This could include changing the routing or schedule to serve passenger needs.
RTD wishes to provide transit dependent riders with service that fits their needs and to
provide service to social service destinations when there is even a modicum of recognized
demand.
Another consideration to be given in whether or not to eliminate a route with some transit
dependent passengers is the impact on required Access-A-Ride services. The Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that eligible persons with disabilities be provided with
paratransit service if they have trip origins and destinations within a defined service area
three-fourths of a mile from a non-commuter fixed route. If accessible fixed route service
is considered for removal from a portion of the defined paratransit service area, an
estimate of the demand for substitute Access-A-Ride service for persons with disabilities

1.B.1.b

The following is a description of the steps necessary in developing and implementing
service changes, which are typically conducted each year in January, May and
September—also called runboards—as required by Board policy and the Collective
Bargaining Agreement.
Proposals are derived from a variety of inputs continuously throughout the year including:
periodic customer, household and employer surveys; stakeholder meetings; service
performance evaluation; and changing demographics and land uses. They are compiled for
each runboard and evaluated based on a number of factors, including RTD annual budget,
RTD Service Standards, effects on the transit network and on transit dependent markets
(Title VI), cost-effective services throughout the District and responsiveness to changes in
the communities within RTD. A Board paper is compiled and presented to the Board,
stakeholders and public for consideration.
Staff then discusses the proposals with members of the Board, stakeholders and senior
staff and coordinates with other staff including Marketing, Operations, Facilities and
Finance. Modifications are made as warranted and then the proposals enter the pubic
engagement process: formally scheduled public hearings; informal presentations upon
request; repository for customer input—service.changes@rtd-denver; responses to General
Manager and Board Member requests. Upon completion of public engagement, all
previous input is compiled and evaluated and revisions to the proposals are made as
warranted. A final Board report is prepared with a summary and details of proposed
changes and a summary of public hearings and other public input for approval of the
Board.
The approved changes then go into a comprehensive production process which includes:
schedule creation; bus and operator requirements and assignments; compliance with
privatization policy; runcutting and compliance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement;
marketing promotions and public relations; bus stop and on-street changes; printed and
electronic public information, including maps and timetables; and validation and
distribution of all data within the Transit Information Exchange System (TIES).

13. Cost Sharing Policy
13.1 Background
On June 21, 1994, the RTD Board of Directors passed a resolution, Transit Service CostSharing Policy, to provide guidance to RTD staff in responding to the increasing number of
requests for new service. This policy authorized the General Manager to pursue cost
sharing as a method of providing transit service using RTD revenues and other funds
voluntarily pledged by private employers, businesses or local governments; this has
resulted in a number of RTD partnerships in demonstrating new services. The following
incorporates this experience and provides guidance on the application and limitations of
cost-sharing arrangements.

1.B.1.b

13.2.1 Financial Feasibility
Financial feasibility depends not only on the availability of funds, but also on consideration
of fares, cost/revenue allocation and equity.








Net operating cost (subsidy) needs to be defined so that all partners are treated
equitably. Net cost is the total operating cost less farebox revenue and other operating
revenues and any grant revenues secured on behalf of the proposed service. The
application of grant revenues prior to the net cost sharing allows all partners to
participate in the benefits of grant funding.
Cost-sharing projects need to adopt the RTD fare structure for similar services for
reasons of equity. Furthermore, this places all projects on the same revenue basis for
calculating net operating cost. Project sponsors may propose a fare that does not
follow the RTD fare structure. For these projects the partner is required to fund the full
difference in revenue between the comparable RTD fare and the project fare, based on
actual ridership. The adoption of any non-conforming (economically or technically) fare
is always subject to Board approval.
Costs associated with vehicles are addressed project by project. Vehicles can be
purchased outright by project sponsors with grant funds or provided from the RTD
inventory. Should new vehicles be required, grants should fund their acquisition and
the local share split equally by the cost-sharing partners. If no grant funds are used,
RTD will limit its share to 10%, half of the usual local share when grant funds are
used. If the RTD operates the service and agrees to provide the vehicles from its
inventory, capital costs need not be included as part of the project cost unless special
accommodations are required.
Cost-sharing projects are new or expanded transit services and RTD’s share must be
budgeted out of allocations for new services for the entire District. Thus any partner
with expectations for RTD financial or operational participation must first obtain
commitment from RTD before applying for project grants. In addition, each project will
be subject to the appropriate RTD and DRCOG planning processes, especially as
regards estimates of costs, ridership, revenue and other benefits.

13.2.2 Vehicle Availability
RTD may have, with some minor modifications, vehicles readily available to provide the
proposed service. In some cases projects require a specialty or significantly modified
vehicle that must be acquired, subject to RTD approval for fleet maintenance compatibility.
Financing these vehicles is addressed above. Sometimes the availability of operators has
been more critical.
13.2.3 Local and Community Support
Local and community entities (e.g., government, employers, businesses and associations)
generally initiate cost-sharing transit projects concomitant with other plans and
developments in the community. Thus the proposed transit project is designed to address
a specific development or perceived need. To advance their project for implementation, an

Service Development Policies & Standards

entity such as a city, will offer to share in the net costs of providing the service. RTD
needs to be responsive to these requests, but keep them in the context of the needs of
the entire District.





Projects generally have substantial institutional support; however they are subject to
the same public scrutiny, for example public hearings, as any other proposed service
change. Implementation of any cost-sharing project will continue to be subject to
RTD’s public review process.
RTD generally provides 50% of the local share of the net operating and/or capital cost
of a project. This cost-sharing ratio may be adjusted in consideration of the District
budget and policies.
Cost-sharing arrangements for each project are of limited duration for which agreed
upon performance milestones must be reached (see below). The purpose of the test
period is to assess the sustainability of the service and decide RTD’s and its partners
continuing participation. The test period is typically set at one, two or three years, as
appropriate to the project. Performance milestones must be set and evaluated and a
recommendation regarding continuation made for each year of the project.

13.2.4 Performance
Cost-sharing services will have clearly defined evaluative criteria agreed upon within the
cost-sharing agreement and prior to implementation.








At a minimum these criteria will include average daily ridership and RTD Service
Standards within the appropriate class of service for passenger boardings per hour and
subsidy per boarding. Additional criteria may also address issues related to project
objectives, such as new riders. State mandated cost recovery may also be considered.
Expectations of performance will be laid out in the form of milestones, such as a range
or minimum attainment at the end of each year.
During the first year performance will be assessed to determine if expectations have
been met and if continuation of the service is warranted. Often an experimental
service will need to be changed to improve performance. As warranted the same
assessment will be made in each succeeding year during the test period. This
assessment and recommendation regarding continuation will be reported to the RTD
Board each year of the test period.
If the cost-share service meets expectations and RTD Service Standards during the test
period, RTD will consider extending the period of its participation and increasing its
share of net cost; however, RTD is under no obligation to continuing any service
beyond the cost-share agreement, even if it meets Service Standards. If the cost-share
service does not perform up to expectations, RTD funding participation in such project
will be reduced or discontinued. These decisions are subject to the customary financial
and Board review.
Should RTD decide to discontinue or reduce its funding of the project service, a
sponsoring partner may choose to continue its funding by entering into a cost-sharing
agreement with RTD. This agreement will specify the service to be provided and its
cost, will be annually reviewed for potential renewal and will be subject to all RTD
Service Standards, budgeting and public processes.

Proposed Fall 2016 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required, for information only. The following service change proposal will be taken to the
public for review and comment.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and service reductions. Also included in this report is a
grant funded proposal anticipated to be implemented with the completion of North Central Park
Boulevard roadway construction. Funded through a CMAQ grant, the new Route 62 would operate
between the Central Park Boulevard Station and 60th/Dahlia in Commerce City. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service improvements:

1.C.1.a

Attachment A - Fall 2016 Service Change

Flatiron Flyer – US36 BRT
It is proposed to add one FF6 trip, eastbound, at 4pm from Boulder Junction to Union
Station to replace former Route S trip. Additionally, it is proposed to add 2 FF2 trips in
both the morning and evening peak period to address passenger overloads currently being
accommodated using Loop Extras, which are vehicles set aside to support operation of the
corridor. Anticipated cost impacts are estimated to be $70,000 annualized. Running time
adjustments for FF1, FF2, FF3, FF4, FF5 and FF6 are also proposed with no additional
cost impacts anticipated.

Rail
C Line – Mineral Station/Union Station
It is proposed to add an earlier northbound weekday morning trip. The trip that was added
in August 2015 is meeting the 10% boardings per hour service standard for light rail and
multiple customers have written requesting an earlier trip for University of Colorado A Line
connections. A morning pullout from the north end of Elati can be changed to pullout from
the south and still cover this trip. This trip would depart Mineral Station at 4:42 AM and
arrive Denver Union Station at 5:10 AM. It is also proposed to add an earlier C Line
pullout trip by utilizing an existing out of service train that interlines to a W Line train.
This trip would depart Evans Station at 4:24 AM and arrive Denver Union Station at 4:40
AM.
E Line – Lincoln Station/Union Station
It is proposed to add an earlier northbound weekday morning trip. The trip that was added
in January 2016 is meeting the 10% boardings per hour service standard for light rail and
multiple customers have written requesting an earlier trip for University of Colorado A Line
connections. The existing trip that departs Southmoor Station at 4:54 AM would be
extended to depart Lincoln Station at 4:49 AM and a new trip would be added to depart
Southmoor Station at 4:24 AM and arrive Denver Union Station at 4:49 AM.

Anticipated cost impacts of the C and E Line proposals is estimated to be $106,000
