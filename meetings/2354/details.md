## IV. Retiree Awards

Chair Sisk indicated there were no retirees for the month of September.

## V. Public Participation

Chair Sisk reminded the speakers they would have three minutes to address the Board and asked that they be respectful of their fellow participants.

- Nancy Rider shared that she is the Deputy Director of Homeless Services and also appointed by Mayor Hancock on a Commission on Homelessness.  She is here to talk about the proposed rate hikes and elimination of certain bus routes.  She expressed concern that the fare increase will hurt many Downtown businesses.  Most employees at hotels, restaurants, and retail stores in Downtown use RTD transportation.  She believes these people will have a difficult times getting to work with the rate increase.  She also expressed concern that businesses will have a difficult time attracting workers.  She said businesses need the rates to remain the same so they can attract employees.

- Doug Gragg, Denver, said he was going to repeat his trivial complaint from last month.  He stated the trees are still dead at the Union Station Light Rail platform and there are even lights shining on them that emphasize they are dead.  He asked that something be done before it becomes winter.

- David Cook, Senior TDM Program Manager from University of Colorado (CU), Boulder, said he was here this evening speaking at the request of CU President Bruce Benson and three CU campuses that participate in the EcoPass program.  He stated that the CU would like to thank RTD for being tremendous partners.  CU and RTD have worked together constructively on many initiatives including the US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), rail lines through the Anschutz campus, and branding of the A-Line to DIA.  CU appreciates the partnership forged with RTD over the past several years.  He wants to share CU’s concerns with the Board.  CU believes there is a more constructive way to address the Title VI concerns than increasing the Business EcoPasses by 18.3%.  The fix that RTD staff is proposing will not reduce the cost of transportation for Title VI populations or increase access to transportation.  It will increase the cost of the EcoPass program from RTD’s 1700+ partners in the business community.  If a company requires employees to contribute to their EcoPasses, it will increase the amount those individuals have to pay.  The likely result will be a net reduction in access to discounted passes for Title VI populations as many businesses will be priced out of the program.  He stated this fare increase is also contrary to Board policy on EcoPass pricing from 2009; therefore CU requests that the RTD Board either tables this proposal to put in place a timeline and process for stakeholder engagement on the EcoPass pricing or adopt alternative three.  He stated in either case the University of Colorado is committed to working with RTD on creating a good process and finding solutions to the Title VI issues.

- George Gerstle, Boulder County Transportation Director, wanted to highlight Boulder’s concerns that were outlined in a letter from the Boulder County Commissioners that is available in the Board Office.  The concerns are as follows:

o        There has been no meaningful opportunity for public input to the fare change, which affects over a hundred thousand RTD Riders and thousands of businesses

o        They do not understand the analytical approach used to justify the proposed fare increase

o        They are confused how making the EcoPass program more expensive, and therefore less likely to be taken advantage of by Title VI populations, is consistent with the goals of Title VI

George Gerstle stated that Boulder would like to have time to discuss any EcoPass price recommendations collaboratively with RTD.  He encouraged the Board to choose alternative three so there would be time to have a collaborative effort to understand how to best move forward.

- Scott McCarey, Boulder County Alternative Transportation Coordinator, shared that he spoke with the FTA and Boulder County’s legal counsel regarding RTD’s Title VI concerns.  In speaking with FTA staff he learned FTA does not review RTD’s fare policies to determine if there is a Title VI violation.  The FTA requires RTD to have a fare equity policy and fare equity analysis but they do not make any determinations of whether or not RTD has violated Title VI.  He said it is possible for a third party to make a claim that there is a Title VI violation but RTD cannot be sued for disparate impacts.  A third party can only submit an administrative claim to FTA.  He explained that what happens is the FTA will contact RTD to work through any claims with RTD.  The FTA would ask RTD to defend RTD’s fare policies to determine if the claim is valid.  If the FTA determined that there was a Title VI violation, the next step would be to require RTD to move towards mitigating measures, which in the case of the EcoPass could be in a variety of ways.  He said that if RTD refused to take any mitigating measures the FTA could begin proceedings to withhold federal funds but it would require the FTA to issue a report with the Transportation Infrastructure Committee of the House of Representatives and the Banking and Housing of Urban Affairs Committee of the Senate.  Additionally, any withholdings would have to be approved by the Secretary of Transportation of the United States.  He pointed out that this is a long process so he believes there would be time to work through any potential claim with the FTA.

Scott McCarey shared that he reviewed the administrative claims that had been made with the FTA and only a few were related to disparate impacts.  There were no administrative claims based solely on fare structure and only one successful claim involving the Bay Area Rapid Transit; however, as far as Scott McCarey can tell this claim was eventually worked out at the administrative level.  Scott McCarey stated that the message is that RTD has a lot of time before federal funds would be withheld.

Scott McCary noted that the EcoPass concerns have nothing to do with the 2016 price increase but the underlying price structure, which has been in place for over 20 years.  He pointed out there has been no administrative claim to this point.  He is concerned this additional fare increase is moving forward too quickly.  He emphasized that Boulder supports a 13.3% increase but asked that they approve alternative three.

- Daniela Villareal is a community organizer with Rights for All People.  She is here because she is trying to push forward a pass program that would be more inclusive.  Everyone she talks to is supportive of an income based pass.  She stated that many people cannot afford RTD’s current prices.  She encouraged the Board to consider this in the future.

- Gina McAfee, 36 Commuting Solutions, stated she came to the meeting to talk about the proposed EcoPass pricing.  36 Community Solutions is a Transportation Management Organization.  One of the reasons her organization was formed was to be a mechanism for assisting the region with its air quality goals.  EcoPasses are an extremely important tool they use to work with the private sector members in achieving that goal.  She believes with such a substantial price increase it will be much more difficult to use EcoPasses as a tool.  She stated that 36 Commuting Solutions is concerned that RTD is not complying with its 2009 Board Policy regarding EcoPass fare increases.  They feel there was a lack of public involvement and do not understand why this is being rushed.  She said 36 Commuting Solutions is perplexed as to how increasing the price of EcoPasses could address concerns about Title VI.  She encouraged the Board to vote on alternative three.

- Todd Kilburn, Naropa University Chief Financial Officer, thanked the Board for the opportunity to speak.  He wanted to raise Naropa’s concern about the increase in the pricing structure for the EcoPasses.  As a university they provide passes to all full-time employees and students.  He is concerned this increase will create some real challenges for Naropa to continue to provide the EcoPasses to their employees.  He encouraged the Board to consider alternative three and to consider the impact this increase will have on a University.

- Karen Benker shared that she is a former RTD Director and served on the Longmont City Council.  She is a founding member of Citizens for Completing FasTracks.  The goal of Citizens for Completing FasTracks is to bring rail to Boulder County.  They have been meeting with City Council members, Mayors, interested citizens, etc. to talk about how there not one mile of rail is planned for Boulder County until after 2040.  Citizens for Completing FasTracks has several requests: (1) establish a Northwest Rail Corridor Fund and set aside any excess revenue, (2) do not build or authorize any projects outside of FasTracks until FasTracks is completed, and (3) build the Northwest Rail in segments and start now.  She stated that Boulder County has paid $144 million into FasTracks projects.  She suggested RTD look at using money from the FasTracks Internal Savings Account, review RTD’s conservative Sales and Use Tax estimates and use any surplus in our operating budget.  She asked the Board to think of Citizens for Finishing FasTracks as RTD’s allies, not adversaries, as they want to help RTD build the line.

- Joan Peck, Longmont City Council Candidate and Co-founder of Citizens for Finishing FasTracks, explained that she was running on two issues: finishing FasTracks and giving the people of Longmont a voice on the issue of fracking.  She said that when her community voted to become part of the District, they did so with the expectation that RTD would fulfill its promise and build the Northwest Rail by 2017.  She noted that Boulder is growing and gaining more places of employment.  If two anti-growth initiatives Boulder is considering pass, employees will live in surrounding communities and need transportation.  Citizens are concerned that they have paid over $140 million in taxes.  She said that Citizens for Finishing FasTracks would like to work with RTD to get the rail built.  She believes the proposed enhanced bus service on US 287 is a very poor substitute and vision for a county that should be a leader in transit.   She asked the Board to put the ‘R’ back in RTD.

- Maggie Gómez, 9 to 5 Community Organizer, stated that the majority of RTD riders who are seeing a fare increase in 2016 are low income.  She is very excited about the RTD Board and staff seriously considering an income based pass.  There has been a lot of discussion regarding funding for this program and the low income communities are concerned.  She believes that low income riders are already implicitly subsidizing higher income riders.  An example of this is the free parking provided that low income riders will never use.  9 to 5 wants to make sure the Board follows through on its commitment to low income riders by implementing an income based pass.

- Andrea Chiriboga-Flor, 9 to 5, stated that in 2016 a lot of low income riders will be suffering the high costs of RTD.  She expressed concern about this because many of the passes for higher income riders are being subsidized by low income riders.  RTD’s primary funding source is Sales and Use Tax.  She noted that sales tax takes a bigger share of a low income household’s total income when compared with higher income households.  She is excited there are Board members who are supportive of an income based pass; however, the Board is concerned with funds.  She said it is a matter of prioritizing.  RTD contributed $17 million for the Crawford Hotel while an income based pass program would cost $11 to $12 million.  She does not believe the funds should come from non-profits.  RTD is a public service and the funds should come from RTD.

- Will Toor, Transportation Program Director for Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, thanked the Board for the opportunity to speak.  He said, as others have pointed out, there was little opportunity for participation in the development of the EcoPass proposal.  Given the fact that the fundamental structure has been in place for 20 years, and that in 2009 there was a commitment made not to alter EcoPass pricing without SmartCard data, he urged the Board to form an inclusive task force to explore EcoPass issues in a collaborative fashion.  He suggested there are other approaches staff could take when evaluating if there is a Title VI issue with EcoPasses.  An alternative approach could be to evaluate the subsidy per boarding for EcoPass riders compared to the system as a whole.  He encouraged staff to perform such an analysis in a transparent fashion that can be shared with stakeholders.  He noted that nothing in the proposed action this evening would benefit any minority or low income populations.  He asked RTD to consider expanding the EcoPass program.

- Yolanda Begay said she is a full-time college student at Metro and an intern with 9 to 5 as well as a single mother.  She appreciates RTD as it gets her around but acknowledged there are going to be cuts in the bus service next year.  She asked how she would get around when this happens.  She also hopes RTD will consider an income passed pass.  She has heard RTD employees speak distastefully about the homeless.  These people are already in a bad spot and RTD should be helping them, not speaking poorly of them.  She said that the Board is not listening and forgetting RTD’s true purpose.  She asked the Board to consider an income based pass as well as not cutting any bus lines.

- Debra Burns stated that last time she spoke before the Board she was homeless.  She lives in affordable housing now but she is waiting for social security.  While she waits she gets $189 to pay rent, buy groceries, etc.  She does not understand RTD raising fares just because it needs more money.  She also does not understand why people have to keep coming to the meetings to speak about this when the Board already knows the problem.  She said it should not be that hard to fix the problem.

- Dace West, Mile High Connects, noted that her organization has been working on fare affordability issues for about the last year and a half.  Tonight she would like to talk about the broader mission of Mile High Connects.  She said that while the focus has been on an income based pass, Mile High Connects overall mission is simply affordable transportation options.  She believes there is a real opportunity to be creative and use Business and Neighborhood EcoPasses to address affordability and accessibility and encouraged further discussion about this idea.

- Judy Grosswiler, Boulder, was here on behalf of Gary Brenner, her Neighborhood EcoPass Coordinator, who was unable to attend, and herself.  She said that overall RTD has been a very responsive partner.  She believes that the Board is probably confused by how many Neighborhood EcoPass program volunteers are so incensed about the proposed rate increase the Board is about to adopt.  She thinks the Board likely feels there is nothing wrong with the process followed as the neighborhoods are only being asked to pay the same fare increase that was proposed for the general ridership; however, they are hoping the Board can do better.  It is easy to fall into the habit of thinking you have all the information when you do not.  She stated that the process of evaluating the EcoPasses has been flawed in ways that have become discouragingly common.  She pointed out that in her area there are 20 apartment buildings predominantly occupied by low income residents.  She noted that RTD staff said there was not a need for public comment because EcoPasses are not available for the general public.  She believes RTD only conducts hearings only when it is compelled to do so.

- Dave Turnquist, Chair of the Campus TMA, is here representing the Anschutz Medical Campus, Children’s Hospital, University Hospital and Veterans’ Administration Hospital.  He believes what he is asking for is a little different than everyone else.  He is not saying do not implement a price increase but asked that the price increase implementation be delayed.  This would allow time to collect accurate data through SmartCards so RTD could be more transparent with the calculations.  He noted that independent reviews of the calculation methodology have shown the rate increase should be around 11% as opposed to 18%.  He stated that from a University standpoint it will cost an additional $47,000 annually.

- Debra Baskett, Transportation Manager for Broomfield, is here tonight to represent the US 36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition (MCC).  She said that the MCC is bigger than the Board might think.  It represents Adams County, Boulder County, City and County of Broomfield, Lafayette, Longmont, Louisville, Westminster, Jefferson County, Erie and Superior.  She apologized on behalf of Mayor Muckle who planned to attend but was called away for another matter.  She shared that on Bike to Work Day she volunteered to be an ambassador at Broomfield Bus Rapid Transit Station to let people know what they could expect.  She said the only thing people wanted to talk about is if their EcoPass would be affected.  She believes one of the ways to ensure that US 36 BRT is a success is to let EcoPass be one of the tools that make it great.  MCC asks the Board to support alternative three.

- John Tayer, President of the Boulder Chamber of Commerce and former RTD Board Member, had several comments regarding the EcoPass.  He recognized that the EcoPass is so important to businesses in the Boulder community.  There are traffic jams coming into Boulder every day that illustrate how businesses need an alternative.  He believes the EcoPass combined the US 36 BRT is a recipe for success to drive drivers from single occupancy vehicles to public transit.  He understands that RTD is addressing the economics of the entire fare structure and it is a challenge; however, it will also be a challenge for businesses to adopt an 18% increase this late in the budgeting cycle.  He is concerned many will make the difficult decision not to purchase EcoPasses.  He shared that as an RTD Board Member he has the opportunity to participate in the EcoPass Task Force in 2009.  He urged the Board to settle on a 13% EcoPass increase and then work together to address the other challenges.  EcoPasses are a benefit to businesses and a benefit to RTD in increasing transit use.  He hopes we can continue our history of working together.

- Kathleen Bracke, Go Boulder Manager, was here to speak on behalf of Mayor Applebaum who was unable to attend.  Mayor Applebaum’s comments have also been endorsed by Boulder’s Transportation Advisory Board as well as many partners and neighborhoods.  She echoed the comments and concerns of her community members and regional partners.  She said everyone is very concerned about the proposed increase in the EcoPass Fare Structure.  She encouraged the Board to offer more time to work together on the increase.  She stated that the EcoPass process has been too short.  She asked the Board to support alternative three.  Alternative three aligns with the general fare increase and allow for a task force to come up with a solution and addresses the goals of the community and those of Title VI.  She requested that the Board help work with the community on a collaborative basis going forward so more people can have more access to transit at all income levels.

- Rick McClintock, Denver, recognized that the Board is faced with a number of critical questions as they consider the EcoPass increase.  While there have been repeated efforts to get EcoPass data by the public, he said this was the first opportunity for public comment since the data was shared.  He wondered how CH2M Hill came up with their ridership data when the public has been waiting for tap data from SmartCards for years.  He is concerned that CH2M Hill is not using accurate ridership information.  He inquired how the cost per ride can be determined when you do not know how many trips are actually taken.  He expressed concern over the minimum number of employees requires as part of an EcoPass contract.  He believes this is disencentivising small businesses that hire low income workers.  He reminded the Board that this is an innovative program that is known to spur ridership and give RTD $20 million per year in secured revenue.  He thinks this increase might put that revenue in jeopardy.  He hopes the Board will only pass a 13% increase.

- Karen Werninghaus, eGo Car Share, has been in a unique position where her organization received an outside grant to work with the Globeville and Mariposa communities to try to get Nighborhood EcoPasses.  She stated that there have been many challenges, despite having extensive experience with Neighborhood EcoPasses in other communities.  She explained that in Globeville households were assessed at a rate of $424 per household, which is 4 times higher than a mobile home park she works with in Boulder.  This was so cost prohibitive that the program could not even get started.  She believes there are some really deep inequality concerns with the current pricing.  She feels that RTD needs to slow down and take a look at the underlying issues.  She thinks if there was accurate data many of the concerns could be addressed in an open manner.  She encouraged the Board to make getting and validating data a priority.

Vote on the

Motion:               The motion passed with 14 in favor (Archuleta, Bagley, Deadwyler, Folska, Francone, Hoy, James, Lasater Lubow, Menten, Sisk, Solano, Tobiassen, Walker) and 0 opposed.  Director Anderson was absent.

Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

### A. Approval of Investment Policy

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.

##### a. Investment Policy FINAL 8-28-15

##### b. 2015 Resolution - 009 Investment Policy

### B. Resolution No. ___, Series of 2015 Appointment of Trustees to the RTD Pension Trust and Defined Contribution Plan

##### a. 2015 Resolution - 010 Appointment of Trustees to the RTD Pension Trust and Defined Contribution Plan

### C. Purchase Additional Seventeen (17) Light    Rail Vehicles

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Siemens to purchase an additional seventeen (17) Light Rail Vehicles and spare parts, at a cost not too exceed $64.5 million.

Motion:              Director Tobiassen made the motion to approve the purchase of seventeen light rail vehicles.

Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Lasater stated that it has come to his attention that the representation by staff that there is a Board policy concerning a 20% spare ratio is totally erroneous as there is no Board policy.  He also learned that the FTA does not have a spare ratio policy for rail as rail transit operations tend to be highly individualized.  He said based on this information he would like to postpone this action to the next Board meeting.  This would allow the Board to establish a Board policy based on complete insight and education for the Board to make a quality determination to create a strong rational underlying the spare ratio policy.

Motion to

Postpone to a

Date Certain:              Director Lasater made the motion to postpone the approval of the purchase of seventeen light rail vehicles until the October 27, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Walker said he does not remember it being stated that there was a Board policy.  He noted an industry standard of 20% spare ratio referenced in the Board Report, but that is different than a Board policy.  He stated that he would not be supporting this amendment.  He thinks it is appropriate to have some level of back-up trains.  He often notices that it is standing room only on our trains, especially during rush hour.  He said he has talked to the people that clean the trains and heard about the problems they have in making sure the trains are ready in the morning.  Director Walker believes we need more trains.

Director Bagley thinks the big issue is determining the best practices at different transit agencies.  In his research he has found it to be from the mid-teens to low twenties.  He believes it is up to RTD as a transit agency to define an appropriate spare ratio, which staff has done.  He said the Board needs to move forward tonight with the main motion.

Director Lubow believes that the spare ratio needs to be dictated by staff’s own experiences.  She asked if they could indicate what they think the spare ratio should be.  Interim General Manager Genova explained that RTD develops a fleet management plan that is submitted to the FTA.  In the last revision the analysis indicated that a 20% spare ratio is recommended.

Director Folska inquired about the life expectancy of a rail car.  She thinks RTD’s first priority is safety for our riders and keeping the vehicles in a state of good repair is critical to that.  Interim General Manager Genova said the average useful life is about 30 years.  He noted that on the bus side RTD has been very successful in extending the useful life so hopefully we can do the same thing with the rail vehicles.  Director Folska stated she supports buying the new vehicles to be on the safe side.

Director Archuleta wondered how many miles the old trains have and when they were acquired.  He also asked how the new trains compare to the older vehicles.  Interim General Manager Genova said the trains were purchased in 1994 and have over 1.3 million miles.  He explained that the trains need to be compatible for interlining so they will be very similar.  The older vehicles have had various updates over the years that the new vehicles will automatically arrive with.

Director James feels a Board policy falls into the realms of micromanagement.  He is happy to accept staff’s recommendation.

Director Francone inquired if the chart outlining the maintenance spare ratio was before or after the purchase of the new vehicles.  Interim General Manager Genova said that illustrated the spare ratio if the additional vehicles were purchased.

Director Lasater said he has an extreme issue with the difficulty facing the Board tonight.  Staff has presented two issues that they say need to be approved without giving the Board time to do any due diligence.  He questions the calculations that have been used to determine the spare ratio and if they are actually needed now and not sometime in the future.  He is concerned that this action leaves vehicles sitting on the sidelines most of the time.  This would give RTD 32 spares at a value of $132 million, which is almost enough to build one of the extensions.  Having too many spares ties up a great deal of funding that could be used elsewhere.  He asked the Board to delay this for a month so staff could provide better information at a study session.

Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED.

Chair Sisk called for a brief recess at 7:13 p.m.

Chair Sisk resumed the meeting at 7:20 p.m.

### D. Recommended EcoPass Pricing for 2016

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors approves an 18.3 percent price increase for Business EcoPass and a 13.3 percent price increase for Neighborhood EcoPass. These price increases are for 2016 contracts. In addition, it is recommended that the current $2.50 DIA surcharge be eliminated for both the Business EcoPass and Neighborhood EcoPass programs.

Prior to the Board having the opportunity to move the recommended action made by staff, Chair Sisk made a motion to approve a Substitute Main Motion.

Motion to

Approve

Substitute

Main Motion:              Chair Sisk made the motion to approve a Substitute Main Motion which reads:

“Adopt the 13.3% price increase for both Business and Neighborhood EcoPasses for the 2016 contract, eliminating the current $2.50 DIA surcharge from both the Business and Neighborhood EcoPass.  In addition thereto RTD form a working group with stakeholders immediately to ascertain the basis for any increase.  As part of the working group, there will be a full and complete analysis of the Title VI to ensure substantial compliance therewith.  Any report from the staff and working group will be presented to the RTD Board no later than September 1, 2016, for implementation in the 2017 calendar year.”

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Folska stated she would not support the Substitute Main Motion as she supports staff’s recommendation.

Director Francone asked if the Substitute Main Motion could be read again.  Chair Sisk explained that it was Alternative Three with an additional proviso.  It read:

“Adopt Alternative Three with an additional proviso that RTD form a working group with stakeholders immediately to ascertain the basis for any increase.  As part of the working group, there will be a full and complete analysis of the Title VI to ensure substantial compliance therewith.  Any report from the staff and working group will be presented to the RTD Board no later than September 1, 2016, for implementation in the 2017 calendar year.”

Director Francone inquired as to who would comprise the working group.  Chair Sisk indicated that would be set up by staff similar to what was established in 2009.

Director Deadwyler supports some aspect of the Substitute Main Motion, like setting up a working group, but does not believe the Board should approve postponing an increase until 2017.  She recognized that it was very hard to talk to the general public about a rate increase in January of 2016 but the Board passed it anyway.  She feels changing direction for the businesses will not sit well with the constituents when the Board did not afford them the same consideration.  She said she would be voting no on the Substitute Main Motion.  Chair Sisk made a point of clarification that there would still be a 13.3% increase.

Director Lubow shared that she has thought long and hard about this because it is a very complex issue.  She expressed concern that the staff recommendation will be potentially destructive to the EcoPass program, which Director Lubow believes is a successful program.  It seems clear to her that it would be nice if there were more low income people in the program and hopes that can happen in the future.  She is concerned that a task force designed to look at EcoPasses will not be inclusive of low income people and the Affordable Fare Task Force.  She suggested that the task force for EcoPasses be more inclusive.

Director Bagley noted that there was tremendous discussion about the EcoPasses during the Committee meeting.  He recommended Alternative 2 at that time.  He said it is apparent that staff provided a range of alternatives as part of their recommendation which they do not normally do.  He understands that staff has Title VI concerns but believes those could be worked on over the next year.  He does not believe staff would have provided alternatives if they thought Title VI was going to blow everything out of the tub.  Interim General Manager Genova stated that staff definitely thinks it is very prudent for the Board to be thinking about Title VI.  He noted that staff typically provides at least one alternative in every Board Report.  Interim General Manager Genova pointed out that while there are alternatives, those alternatives also state that they are not recommended by staff.  He stressed that staff would not be proposing an 18.3% Business EcoPass fare increase if they did not think there was a Title VI issue.

Director Walker stated that he will not be supporting the Substitute Main Motion for many of the same reasons expressed by Director Deadwyler.  He is very concerned about RTD’s exposure should there be a Title VI complaint.  He said it is one thing to have an issue that the Board is unaware of, but to knowingly continue that after the issue has been discovered is an affront to RTD’s mission.  He commented that there are options outside of the EcoPass for companies to offer transportation as a benefit to their employees; however, he hopes most companies still see the value.

Director Tobiassen concurs with Directors Deadwyler and Walker.  He said that, quite frankly, he has not received one comment regarding the EcoPass increase from his District but he does hear from people every day that struggle to pay the full fare.  He does not believe RTD can ignore Title VI.  It needs to be a priority that everyone is treated fairly.  He has a problem passing off Title VI issues lightly because the FTA does not really enforce it.  The canary is in the tunnel and the tunnel is Title VI; the canary is having a hard time breathing right now.  He noted that the Board has tough choices to make, especially raising fare and impacting the low income community, and he would be supporting staff’s recommendation.

Director James thinks the lesson learned from this might be to have more incremental fare increases.

Chair Sisk stated that he respects the difficult work staff has done in evaluating EcoPasses.  He regrets that there is any reference to the fact that RTD is pitting EcoPasses against an income based fare as those need to be considered separately.  He said when the time comes to approve an income based fare he will support it.  He does not think RTD has given stakeholders enough time to participate with RTD in a collaborative process.  He recognizes that Title VI is important but was hoping to move toward compliance with Title VI while making an informed decision.  He said it is clear to him how the vote would go but reiterated that RTD owes it to the stakeholders to continue the process going forward.

Director Folska recognized how hard staff has worked during this process.  They have been under the gun and had a lot of pressure placed on them.  She said this action is really about equity and fairness.  To not vote to raise EcoPass pricing is unconscionable in her mind.  She shared that she has many friends who are employees at CU Boulder, CU Denver, and Anschutz.  She asked one friend how much she pays per month and it was only $25.  Director Folska asked her how much she would be willing to pay and she said $50, which is a 100% increase, not 18%.  She spoke to another gentleman who said he paid nothing but would be willing to pay a lot more than nothing.  She believes if it is hard for some employers to cover the increase perhaps they can ask their employees to contribute.

Director Francone asked if it was RTD’s legal counsel’s opinion that a 13.3% increase would satisfy any Title VI inequities.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, explained that CH2M Hill’s fare equity analysis indicated that without an 18.3% increase Business EcoPasses users would be receiving a greater subsidy per boarding when compared to low income or minority riders as a whole.  If an 18.3% increase is not passed RTD would be required to file a report that RTD is not in compliance with Title VI.

Director Francone asked Chair Sisk when the 13.3% increase would go into effect as part of his motion.  He stated January 1, 2016.

Director Francone wondered how staff determines whether people are high income, low income, minorities, etc.  Marla Lien explained that the information is gathered as part of RTD’s customer surveys.

Vote on

Substitute

Main

Motion:              The motion failed with 3 in favor (Bagley, Lubow, Sisk) and 11 opposed (Archuleta, Bagley, Deadwyler, Folska, Francone, Hoy, James, Menten, Solano, Tobiassen, Walker).  Director Anderson was absent.

Chair Sisk declared the motion FAILED.

Director Tobiassen read the original recommended action language as made by staff as follows:

“It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors approves an 18.3 percent price increase for Business EcoPass and a 13.3 percent price increase for Neighborhood EcoPass.  These price increases are for 2016 contracts.  In addition, it is recommended that the current $2.50 DIA surcharge be eliminated for both the Business Eco Pass and Neighborhood EcoPass programs”

Motion:              Director Tobiassen made the motion to approve the recommended EcoPass pricing for 2016 as outlined in the original recommended action.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Hoy called for the question.

Director Francone indicated that she would be inclined to vote yes with assurances from staff that there will be continuing study on the pricing with SmartCard Data.  Interim General Manager Genova stated that would happen.

Director Menten noted that overall the EcoPasses are still a great deal for businesses.  If a company has 15 employees, to buy an EcoPass for each employee will cost just under $1500 total, which is a great deal.  Also, if a company has 100 employees it would cost just $85 per year, per employee, for an EcoPass; however, she pointed out that there can be large increases for companies that move from one price level to another just by adding one employee.  She hopes that can be addressed.  She recognized that with current RTD pricing the taxpayers are heavily subsidizing RTD but many do not use our services.  She said the only right thing for her to do is to vote for the EcoPass fare increases.

Director Tobiassen believes that stakeholder participation is still an important step in the process but it needs to be more inclusive than just the businesses that participate in EcoPasses.

Director Solano stated that he will be voting no.  He thinks an 18.3% increase for businesses would be fine but his community is pushed to the max.  They cannot afford another fare increase.
