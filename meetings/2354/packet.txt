Update on GM Recruitment Process (Gregg Moser-Krauthamer)
Chair Sisk introduced Gregg Moser from Krauthamer & Associates, Inc., the Executive
Search firm selected by the General Manager Executive Search Committee in June, 2015
to manage the hiring process of RTD’s new General Manager. Krauthamer & Associates
was the firm hired for RTD’s General Manager hiring process in 2009. Chair Sisk noted
that Gregg Moser spent the day meeting individually with Board members and participated
during the General Manager Executive Search Committee meeting held prior to the Study
Session.
Gregg Moser thanked RTD for engaging Krauthamer & Associates in the Executive Search
process. He also thanked the Board members for their time throughout the day. He said
that it was great to hear each Director’s perspective on where RTD is and what they are
looking for in a CEO.
Gregg Moser explained that since Krauthamer & Associates engaged in the Executive
Search process in June he has worked with the General Manager Executive Search
Committee to finalize the job description. The description includes desired attributes and
skills expressed by the Board as well as incorporated stakeholder community feedback.
The firm has done background diligence for advertising the position. Gregg Moser said
that as the process moves forward, the next steps are publicizing the position through
advertising and direct recruit. He explained that the position is being advertised on RTD’s
website as well as other local, national and international forums. Gregg Moser stated that
he has started the 60 day direct recruitment process. He is targeting executives in
different industries in both the public and private sector. The recruiting is done through
networking and outreach. He stated that Krauthamer & Associates is keeping an open
mind to find the right candidate for the position. Gregg Moser pointed out that there is
interest in the position as he already has received applications.
Gregg Moser noted that it is a candidate’s market in the transit industry as seven major
agencies, as well as a few smaller ones, are in an Executive Search process. The seven
large agencies are Vancouver, Seattle, Salt Lake City, Orlando, Washington D.C., New
York City, and Philadelphia. He said that RTD offers outstanding benefits beyond the
financial component such as completion of significant FasTracks projects, regional
economic development, and Denver’s overall work-life balance.

Director Walker asked Gregg Moser to share the type of impression potential candidates
have of RTD. He said that he is in contact with different transit industry members and
would love to hear a view outside of the industry. Gregg Moser replied that the region
itself offers a great place to work with a reasonable cost of living. RTD is considered a
progressive transit agency transitioning from capital programs to operations and
maintenance while keeping focus on the future. Director Walker wondered if Denver or
RTD is the opportunity people may be looking for. Gregg Moser said that the opportunity
is RTD.
Director James asked what points may be unattractive to prospective candidates. Gregg
Moser replied that it all depends on what the candidate is looking for. Seattle and Orlando
are still in major capital growth programs. New York City is the largest transit agency; if
someone is looking for that, RTD will not be attractive. The role that transit plays into
regional development is another factor; if someone wants to work somewhere where the
region is starting to transition toward transit, then RTD is a great place to be at.
Chair Sisk wondered how many of the large transit agencies in Executive Search
processes have an elected board. Gregg Moser replied that they all have appointed
boards.
Chair Sisk thanked Gregg Moser for the time. He said that RTD is very fortunate to have a
first class professional like Gregg Moser working with us. He noted that Krauthamer &
Associates had the highest score in all the elements of the Request for Proposal. He
thanked Paula Perdue for what she has done and continues to do during this process.
Chair Sisk thanked all the Directors for their time and commitment. He stated that RTD
will take the right time to find and hire the right candidate.

III.

Fare Task Force Update - Eco Pass Program (Bruce Abel)
Chair Sisk reminded the Board that today’s update and discussion will be only as it relates
to the EcoPass program. He noted that Bruce Abel, Assistant Manager for Bus
Operations, and Lacy Bell, Planning Project Manager for Operations, have met with several
organizations to ensure RTD is reaching out to stakeholders in order to continue the fare
dialogue. He reminded the Directors that this discussion was postponed from the
Operations and Customer Service Committee meeting on August 11, 2015.

Packet Pg. 6

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 25, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Gregg Moser stated that Krauthamer & Associates will continue evaluating candidates.
The goal is to consider 5 to 7 candidates for interviews and then narrowing the field to
finalists. The General Manager Executive Search Committee wants to be respectful of
Colorado State laws for public disclosure while respecting the privacy of candidates. He
pointed out that the goal is to have a candidate on board by the end of the year.

Bruce Abel restated that the focus of tonight’s discussion will be the EcoPass program.
The companies engaged in the program will expect a renewal letter in September thus
staff is seeking the Board’s feedback tonight in order to have Board approval of the new
terms in a timely fashion. He noted that there will be stakeholder meetings that may
influence staff’s current thinking. Staff’s expectation is to come back with a
recommendation during September’s Operations and Customer Service Committee meeting
and seek Board approval in September as well. Staff will address the non-profit fare
program during the September Study Session. Bruce Abel thanked the Directors that
called and/or sent in their observations and feedback.
Lacy Bell reviewed the Fare Study EcoPass program presentation included in the Study
Session agenda packet for August 25, 2015. The presentation covered the background of
the existing programs and study schedule, rationale for the pass program, current business
EcoPass program pricing and service level areas, current pricing policy, current thinking for
modifying EcoPass program pricing and contracts, EcoPass program pricing matrix under
current thinking, detail for upgrade charge to DIA, current thinking for 2016 neighborhood
EcoPass program contracts, revenue impact and next steps. She noted that staff used
2011 survey data instead of SmartCard compiled data for accuracy when developing
staff’s current thinking for the business EcoPass program.
Bruce Abel emphasized Lacy Bell’s explanation of the charts on page 16 of the Study
Session agenda packet. These charts explain the current fare structure discount levels
and how staff arrived at the current thinking for a 30% discount for the business EcoPass
program. He noted that staff’s current thinking of the EcoPass program will be presented
to stakeholders during the RTD Local Government meeting on Thursday, August 27. Staff
will also meet with other stakeholders, sponsors, and other business to business programs
in the next several weeks.
Director Anderson thanked staff for explaining how staff arrived at the current thinking in
a manner that is easy to understand. She said that staff had answered why they used
2011 data instead of SmartCard data. She asked staff what will happen once SmartCard
data is able to be applied towards these estimations. Bruce Abel said that staff has a
good sampling on bus ridership data. He added that EcoPass program rail users were not
used to doing anything proactively with the SmartCard and it has taken a while to catch
on. Director Anderson said that the explanation of the current thinking on the discount did
not seem onerous and it correlated with the fare increase approved during the first phase
of the Fare Study. She thanked staff for their work. Lacy Bell said that cash fares were
increased by 13.3%. The 30% discount in consideration for the EcoPass program makes
it comparable to a monthly pass discount.

Director Lubow thanked staff for their work. She shared her concern that stakeholders
have not been included so far in the process. She compared it to the Northwest Area
Mobility Study when stakeholders received the data simultaneously with staff. She
wondered what data CH2M Hill, the consulting firm hired to assist with the Fare Study,
used to arrive at the average EcoPass program fare of $2.28 as reviewed during the
presentation. She added that the concern is not the 13.3% increase but the additional
4.4% increase included in the presentation as it seemed to not be supported by data.
Director Lubow said that stakeholders are looking forward to the Local Government
meeting later in the week. Lacy Bell replied that she could provide the data at the meeting.
Director Lubow said that she feels there is a timed deadline and the process is getting
rushed in getting the information to stakeholders, who have a right to see the information.
Director Lubow asked on behalf of a stakeholder if RTD would consider quarterly
payments for the EcoPass program. Bruce Abel replied that there are unusual instances
where installments payments are accepted.
Director Lubow asked if EcoPass program participants could be considered to have a
discount similar to those who will use a SmartCard under the 2016 fare structure. Bruce
Abel replied that the presentation discussed staff’s analysis of the different types of
discounts available to all participants. He recalled the discussion during the Operations
and Customer Service Committee meeting on August 11, 2015 where Title VI issues were
discussed in term of equity available to all customers. Marla Lien, General Counsel,
reminded the Directors that CH2M Hill used the criteria from the Federal Transit
Administration to analyze Title VI issues when it comes to discounts. She stressed the
importance of who has access to the discount programs and who uses them. She said the
goal is to equalize average fare pay by non-minority, non-low-income riders. She added
that the chances of the agency getting sued on these terms are low and that other
agencies that have been sued under this terms have won. Director Lubow noted that this
is a very valid discussion; however, it has been a private discussion not presented to the
stakeholders.
Director Lubow stated that the issues she has discussed so far concern her because of
transparency. She would like RTD to have this discussion, including Title VI issues, with
stakeholders instead of the discussion being an afterthought. Marla Lien said that Title VI
issues are not a legal concern at this time. Dave Genova, Interim General Manager, added
that Title VI issues have been discussed with stakeholders. Director Lubow requested that
Title VI issues be discussed during the Local Government meeting later in the week.
Director Lubow requested that staff not rely on the Business EcoPass program to fund a
low-income/non-profit program. She said that pitting programs against each other is not
good. Bruce Abel reassured Director Lubow that staff is casting a wide net. Chair Sisk

noted that he received the same email communication Director Lubow did which
addressed all these matters.

Director Francone said that she understood the computation of the 18.3%. She asked
staff to clarify the extra 4.4% discount to the business EcoPass program above the 13.3%
increase of the cash fare. Lacy Bell replied that the current undiscounted average fare for
EcoPass program participants is $3.39; this includes all fare levels. CH2M Hill’s model
looked at riders and revenue and found that the average discounted fare price is $2.28 per
trip. A 30% discount would result in $2.38, which is 4% higher than $2.28. Director
Francone asked for confirmation that these prices were calculated using EcoPass program
purchases data. Lacy Bell said that the 2011 EcoPass program purchase data is the most
accurate. Director Francone asked if staff did not use SmartCard data because they did
not have it. Bruce Abel replied that staff felt comfortable with the SmartCard bus
ridership data. To figure out rail ridership data, staff would have had to use a
mathematical equation to factor the rail data as the data at hand is not accurate. He said
that if the mathematical equation was used the discount would have been a bit more
substantive.
Director Francone wondered how many businesses participated in the EcoPass program in
unincorporated Jefferson County and how many units each business purchased. Bruce
Abel and Lacy Bell replied that staff will provide Director Francone with the information.
Director Tobiassen thanked staff for their work and the presentation. He shared his
concern that the stakeholders meeting may only represent a small portion of the riders. He
said that low income riders are not part of the EcoPass program. Director Tobiassen noted
that a 40% or even a 30% discount is substantial; meanwhile the low-income rider paying
full fare to subsidize the program uses RTD services to look for a job, going to the doctor,
and other day to day necessities. He finds this very disturbing and a Title VI issue. He
said he is concerned that RTD will feel the pressure from the EcoPass program
stakeholders while the working poor end up subsidizing the heavy discount. He thanked
staff for leveling the playing field as much as possible.
Director Folska thanked staff for their work. She noted that the idea of low income riders
paying full fare and the free parking at Park-n-Rides have not been taken into account into
the EcoPass program structure. She added that students pay $77 for 3 months of

Packet Pg. 9

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 25, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Francone asked for clarification on the service level areas. Bruce Abel said that
when discussing the business EcoPass program, service area A is the suburban area,
service area B are high traffic areas outside of town (such as the DTC), service area C is
the Central Business District, or Downtown Denver (CBD), and service are D is Denver
International Airport (DIA).

Director Folska expressed her disappointment at the missed opportunity of utilizing Park-nRide parking for revenue. She said that this would have been a great way to help
subsidize a low income/non-profit program that could reflect the offer to the University
Station Senior Housing. Chair Sisk reminded the Directors that the low income program
will be discussed during the September Study Session. Director Folska said that the
current discussion is relevant as we are talking EcoPass program that we are giving away
at $12. Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, added that the
University Station Senior Housing EcoPass program is not unique to this location and is
offered at other designated places. He pointed out that this is something to take into
consideration as staff moves forward.
Director Walker noted that RTD has a bunch of different programs and ways of selling
fare. He is not upset that someone gets a discount for buying 2000 passes at once. He
noted he has talked to Michael Washington, Title VI Manager, and he does not share the
concerns about this being a Title VI issue since people and business choose to be part of
the program and participants choose to use the program or not. He added that does not
have any concerns in relation to the EcoPass program as presented by staff.
Director Solano said that it is good that we are trying to level the playing field to get more
riders. He can see the complications and the disproportion for low income riders as they
are not able to benefit from the EcoPass program discount. He would not like to see this
come into a lawsuit. He is also unsure that any low income riders would participate at the
Local Government meeting later in the week.
Chair Sisk appreciates the fact that Bruce Abel and Lacy Bell have been educating staff,
the Directors, and the public. He shared his frustration about the lack of SmartCard data.
He gave credit to CH2M Hill for coming up with a basis of information that can be used to
calculate usage. He said that part of the frustration is not knowing how many EcoPass
program participants actually utilize the passes. He said that the next Board of Directors
dealing with the EcoPass program will hopefully have more information as they will have

Packet Pg. 10

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 25, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

EcoPass program access. She wondered if that was at a 30% or 40% discount. Bruce
Abel replied that the current policy is 40% discount and the college contracts have been
executed for the 2015-2016 school year. Director Folska stated that the college
employees receiving the benefits of the EcoPass program have to pay a monthly fee. She
shared that the residents at the University Station Senior Housing pay $10 a month to be
part of the EcoPass program. She wondered why something similar could not be done for
a low income/non-profit fare program. Bruce Abel replied that the pricing for the
University Station Senior Housing is based on a survey that reflects current ridership
patterns. The monthly price is $12.

SmartCard data. He would like to deal with the EcoPass program and then concentrate
the efforts on those who depend on transit for transportation.

Chair Sisk thanked staff and the Directors for their comments. He encouraged the
Directors to contact staff with further questions.

Director Lubow said that the University Station Senior Housing EcoPass program sounds
like a great deal. She thinks that the EcoPass program is a great idea pro-transit, proenvironment, and pro-people. She reminded the Directors to also take care of the low
income riders and to not pit the EcoPass program and the low fare-non-profit program
against each other.

There were no recommended actions.

C. Updates

• Local Government Update - CRL Associates
Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, shared that this week he would be
distributing the Municipal Candidate Election Snapshot to the Board. This
will be an Excel document that includes each jurisdiction and candidate with
a link to the snapshot of the candidate. He will provide an update after the
November elections. Roger Sherman said that his office is willing to help the
Directors make contact with any candidates prior to, or winners after, the
election.
Roger Sherman stated that the next Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) meeting
would be held November 7, 2015 at 7:30 a.m. at the Denver Metro
Chamber. He noted that Mayor Sue Horn of Bennett and MMC Chair has
announced that her husband took a job in Florida. He said that in the near
future she would be resigning and Mayor Heidi Williams of Thornton would
become the Chair.

• State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs
Jenifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry~McKenna (BBMK), commented that
August is a slow month for the Legislature. BBMK continues to monitor the
activities of the Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) who
have scheduled a tour of the Southwest Corridor in September. The TLRC
also has two additional meetings calendared to discuss potential legislation.

She said that to BBMK’s knowledge none of the legislation would impact
RTD.

Jenifer Brandeberry said that yesterday the State Audit Committee met
regarding an audit of the FASTER program and how CDOT spends funds and
prioritizes projects. She thinks from the audit it is clear there is tension
between the Committee and CDOT. She believes there might be legislation
targeting CDOT that directs them to be more accountable.
Jenifer Brandeberry informed the Board that in BBMK’s efforts to continue to
look for opportunities to build relationships with the Legislators, BBMK will
be putting together a learning/social event during the beginning of the
legislative session. She said BBMK is working to secure a date and noted
that the event will be Amendment 41 compliant. Committee Chair Folska
said that she looks forward to the ongoing relationship building.
Director Menten inquired if there was a State statute that required RTD to
have a mandatory audit and if so, what would be the timeframe. Scott
Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, noted that RTD is
currently in discussions with the State Auditor about conducting another
audit. He said he could not remember the exact timeframe but would get
back with the Board. He stated that staff would brief the Board as soon as
the timeframe and scope had been determined. Marla Lien, General Counsel,
noted that the State Audit Committee could request a special audit at any
time should they want.
Director Francone pointed out that the findings of the FASTER audit
identified nine projects in the appendices. She understood that RTD was not
called out specifically as being part of these projects but wondered if there
might be an obligation as an agency to respond to any of the findings or
possibly change our practices. Jenifer Brandeberry explained that the audit
related to money received by CDOT used for CDOT projects, not RTD.
Marla Lien stated that RTD receives grants from CDOT that do allow for
CDOT to audit us. She explained that while CDOT has not conducted an
audit of RTD, they have to review all of our drawdowns, bills, etc., which
was not part of the criticism. She said if there was overall legislation to
change CDOT’s policy about how funds are distributed at that time the
Board would have to determine if RTD would weigh in; however, at this time
RTD’s practices have not been questioned.

Jenifer Brandeberry shared that the Legislative Council Transportation

Maintenance Facility. She believes the staff wants to remain updated and
educated so they can answer any questions of the Committee members.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Mike Dino shared that last Wednesday there was a very successful tour with
the Congressional delegation staff. He thanked Directors Folska and
Francone for leading the briefing. He said that Directors Archuleta and
Solano were in attendance along with great support from Scott Reed,
Assistant General Manager of Communications, and Julia Marvin,
Community Outreach Public Relations Specialist. He thought there was a
good representation from our Congressional offices. The intent was to have
a good policy discussion, particularly as it related to the reauthorization,
which he believes went very well. He thinks this is something that should
be continued on a regular basis because of the good feedback received from
the people that participated.
He reminded the Board that Congress is back in session next week and they
have a lot of work ahead of them. He noted that before leaving for break
the Senate passed a transportation reauthorization bill that covered six years
but was only funded for three. It increases New Starts funding by 36% and
Bus and Bus Facilities funding by almost 43% which Mike Dino thinks is
very positive; however, the House has been reluctant to match anything the
Senate does.
Mike Dino stated that there was a three month extension of the current
authorization through October 29. He pointed out that this extension does
provide funding for the Highway Trust Fund through the end of the year so
there is some flexibility in determining if they need another extension. He
said this would be easy if it was just transportation but there are many other
issues such as:
 Annual appropriations for Fiscal Year 2016
 Passage of a short-term Continuing Resolution to avoid a government
shutdown by September 30
 Approve the Iran nuclear deal
 Extension of the debt limit by late October/early November
Mike Dino believes that if there is a transportation reauthorization bill it will
use repatriation for funding. He explained that there is not enough political
support to look at anything with taxes.

Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs, congratulated the RTD Board and staff on
being selected for a $700K grant from the FTA related to advancing the WIN
program. He said this is certainly a nice recognition and he knows RTD will
be able to use the funds effectively. He recognized that everyone normally
focuses on funding like FFGA but this grant is certainly important to what
RTD is trying to do as an organization.

Committee Chair Folska thanked Mike Dino for his help with the
Congressional delegation meeting. She also expressed her appreciation to
Julia Marvin for her excellent work.
Director Francone reiterated Committee Chair Folska’s thanks to the entire
team. She thought it was a wonderful event.

No recommended actions were presented.

C. Updates

• Northeast Area Transit Evaluation (NATE) II
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager, reviewed the Northeast Area Transit
Evaluation (NATE) II Update presentation included in the FasTracks
Monitoring Committee agenda packet for September 1, 2015. The
presentation included a background on the original NATE study, the purpose
of the NATE II, list of participants, study status, modeling results, capital
cost estimates, alignments pros and cons, and next steps.
Director Anderson wondered if the projected ridership within the modeling
results included existing or just new riders. Chris Quinn replied that the
analysis does not identify new riders versus existing. There is the
expectation that some riders may come from the R rail line; however the
expectation is that there will not be many because they serve different
markets.
Director Solano said he was glad the study was happening in Commerce
City and thanked staff for being involved.
Director Lubow mentioned she was very glad that the study was being done
because this area has been underserved. She asked for clarification as it
was her understanding that the NATE was approved for a certain amount of
money to evaluate transit options that could be done after FasTracks was
completed. Chris Quinn replied that the original FasTracks allocated $7.5
million for the preservation of Right of Way (ROW) in that area. He added
that the number has been adjusted due to inflation. Bill Van Meter,

Directors Bagley, Deadwyler, James and Lasater were absent.

6.C

Director Francone asked if the original NATE, authorized as part of
FasTracks was paid for with FasTracks funding. Chris Quinn replied that
NATE and ROW preservation were authorized under the original FasTracks.
Chair Sisk thanked staff for working on the NATE as he considers it very
important. He wondered how NATE dovetails with the possible Highway 7
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) study. Chris Quinn noted that on slide 7 of the
presentation the purple line shows Highway 7 BRT to Boulder and 120th Ave
intersecting with the trunk line from Brighton to Quebec Street. He pointed
out that his team is working with the Highway 7 BRT group to create a
ridership model with those east – west connections. He added that the
intent was to not only connect Brighton to Denver but also to the rest of the
FasTracks system. The Highway 7 BRT group is creating a Request for
Proposal (RFP) with the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) funding
received last fall. RTD will start our own needs analysis for Highway 119
BRT next year. Beyond Highway 119, which is included in the Denver
Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) Regional Transportation Plan,
staff does not have prioritization of other corridors. Chris Quinn added that
all other corridors would need an environmental study before moving
forward.
Director Solano wondered what the plan was for Highway 2. He asked if
there are plans to widen the road. Chris Quinn noted that the trunk line
goes through Highway 2 from Sable until it splits at Quebec. He added that
one of the issues staff has been working with Commerce City on is to
determine how to integrate the widening of Highway 2 with RTD’s plans.
Chris Quinn pointed out that the road has a limitation due to the railroad
tracks.
Director Folska shared that the region has noticed more congestion on the
roads as people tend to drive more instead of taking transit when gas prices
are low. She believes in the short term there will be continued congestion;
however, in the long term, when the system is fully built, the widening of
the road will be seen as a benefit to the region. She encouraged reaching
Packet Pg. 19

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 1, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Assistant General Manager for Planning, stated that the amount has been
adjusted to around $9 million. He added that no RTD funds have been
committed or expended on purchasing any ROW and that the amount has
not been budgeted, just as the Central extension and the Southwest
extension, finishing North Metro, etc. Bill Van Meter added that a lot of the
impetus of the NATE is to work with the jurisdictions to set aside ROWs for
when the opportunity to build arises. Director Lubow summed up her
understanding of the NATE as not placed in the 5 year plan since there is no
funding but it is something that could happen and it has been authorized by
FasTracks. Bill Van Meter said that was correct.

6.C

out to other colleagues throughout the region that would benefit from the
congestion mitigation.

Greg Straight, Engineering Project Manager, reviewed the Eagle P3 Project
Update as included in the FasTracks Monitoring Committee agenda packet
for September 1, 2015. The presentation covered:
 Design, construction and systems status
 Commuter rail vehicles
 East rail line update
 East rail line open house
 Gold/NW rail lines update
 Westminster Station parking garage
 Safety Outreach programs.
He noted that Tara Bettale replaced Kevin Flynn as the Public Information
(PI) Manager for the Eagle P3 Project. He introduced Nadia Garas as the
new PI Manager from Denver Transit Partners (DTP).
Director Anderson said that the project and the update look good. She
shared that construction crews are stringing the wire through the Gold rail
line in Arvada and she hopes to see some trains through the area soon. She
thanked staff for fixing the breach in Olde Town Arvada. She added that
she has been in some discussions regarding a possible low level planting
between the parking lot and the fence. Greg Straight noted he does not
know what the specific plan but he knows this circumstance triggered
another review for hazard analysis on that location. He added that he is not
sure what the final configuration is but can get back to her with the details.
Director Anderson noted that the Arvada Harvest Festival will happen from
September 11 to the 13. She said this would be a great opportunity for
education and outreach, though it might be too soon to plan. Greg Straight
said he would look into it.
Director Folska asked staff to explain the grade crossings in detail so the
Directors could have an image of what it looks like and how it works. Greg
Straight explained that current crossings have gates in the lane of traffic
travel which would not necessary preclude someone from driving around or
a pedestrian from walking around the gate. The new intersections have a
quad gate system: all sides will activate in order to deter motorists from
driving around gates. Since the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) allows
for municipalities to apply for quiet zones, trains will not be sounding horns
unless there is danger. Sidewalks will also have swing gates that would
point pedestrians towards the area of incoming trains in order to create more
awareness. He added that additional signage will be activated if a train,
commuter or freight, is coming in from a blind spot. Director Folska
wondered if this conversation was included in the safety trainings. She also

• Eagle P3 Project Update

6.C

asked if there is video or animation of these intersections as they do not
seem to be very familiar practices. Greg Straight replied that yes, these
items are discussed during education and outreach. He added that there are
no videos or animation of these crossings. He noted that staff is working
with Operation Lifesaver to prepare project specific materials as part of the
outreach.

Chair Sisk recognized Aaron Epstein, DTP’s CEO and Executive Project
Director, as a member of the audience. He thanked DTP for being great
partners in the Eagle P3 Project. Chair Sisk asked Greg Straight when DTP
will provide RTD with the exact opening date for the new lines, which
according to the agreement should be a 6 months’ Notice of Operations.
Greg Straight replied that the 6 months’ Notice of Operations is required if
operations were not to start on the target dates. He added that he is very
confident with the progress made and echoed Chair Sisk’s comments
regarding Aaron Epstein and DTP. Chair Sisk asked him to remind him of the
opening dates. Greg Straight said that the contract date for the East/A rail
line is April 22, 2016, the contract date for the Northwest/B rail line is July
26, 2016, and the contract date for the Gold/G rail line is October 27th.
Chair Sisk reiterated that this public private partnership has been great to
work with and that RTD should be pleased with the many people who have
worked to make this project happen.

D. Other Matters
Committee Chair Hoy shared that for the past 5 years as a Director, but more
specifically, for the past couple of years as the Chair of the FasTracks Monitoring
Committee, he has worked closely with Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for
Capital Programs. Committee Chair Hoy pointed out that this was Rick Clarke’s
last meeting. He said that it has been his honor and pleasure to work with him as
he has learned a lot from him. Even though he hates to see Rick Clarke go,
Committee Chair Hoy wished him the best of luck and success. He thanked Rick
Clarke for all his work. Rick Clarke appreciated Committee Chair Hoy’s words and
said that they meant a lot to him. He noted that he has enjoyed working with the
different Boards over the years. Rick Clarke added that there have been difficulties
and challenges but they have all been worked out.
Director Archuleta shared that he attended the Rail Rodeo at the invitation of Terry
Emmons, Assistant General Manager for Rail Operations. Director Archuleta shared
how impressed he was with the event. He noted that he was able to try out the
train simulator, used by the train operators for training purposes, which was really
amazing. He encouraged the Directors to attend next year’s Rail Rodeo.

B. Recommended Actions

• Purchase Additional Seventeen (17) Light

Rail Vehicles
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager, or his designee,
to enter into a contract with Siemens to purchase an additional seventeen
(17) Light Rail Vehicles and spare parts, at a cost not too exceed $64.5
million.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the
September 15, 2015 Board Meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager for Light Rail
Operations, stated that due to increased ridership, and based
on the ridership projections for the Southeast Extension and I225 corridor, staff is requesting seventeen (17) additional light
rail vehicles. He explained that this will give staff the ability to
maintain our aging fleet and maintain service levels as outlined
in the Board approved Service Standards. He said that funding
is programmed in the Strategic Budget Plan and will be
secured through Certificates of Participation (COPs). He noted
it takes two years to build a light rail vehicle so it is important
that staff is proactive in looking towards the future.

Director Tobiassen was absent.

6.D

Director Hoy wondered if RTD had ever ordered trains with a
different body style. Phil Eberl stated that we had not. He
said in 2014 RTD was told by the manufacturer that they no
longer built our body style; however, Siemens has decided that
since RTD is one of their best customers they are willing to
open the old assembly line to help us maintain fleet
consistency.
Director Hoy inquired if the vehicles would have the same
seating capacity with the new configuration. Phil Eberl
explained that the seating configuration does not change the
number of passenger seats. The new vehicles will be
maximizing the ADA capacity which will reduce the number of
passenger seats.
Director Francone asked for clarification if staff was requesting
to purchase twelve light rail vehicles or seventeen. Terry
Emmons said that the purchase of twelve vehicles was
approved by the Board in November, 2015. Staff is
requesting the purchase of an additional seventeen vehicles for
a total of twenty-nine new light rail vehicles.
Director Lubow expressed concern as it appears the spare
ratio will get very low. She wondered how this happened.
Phil Eberl noted that Director Lubow was referring to the
Maintenance Spares graph included in the Board Report. He
explained that the spare ratio would be at 5% in 2017 due to
the addition of four cars to service as well as the projections
for the Southeast Rail Extension and I-225 Corridor. This
action will return the fleet to a 17% spare ratio by 2018.
Director Lubow pointed out that two of the vehicles will be
funded through FasTracks while the remaining vehicles are
Packet Pg. 25

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Phil Eberl, General Superintendent of Light Rail Maintenance,
reminded the Board that in 2014, when staff made their initial
request for twelve (12) additional light rail vehicles, it was
requested that the seating arrangement be changed from kneeto-knee to knee-to-back. At that time there had also been
discussion about changing the exterior of the vehicle so it
looked more modern; however, it would be for only a small
portion of our vehicles, and require additional parts for
maintenance, so staff feels it is in RTD’s best interest to keep
the exterior the same.

6.D

Director Lasater stated that when he first became a Board
member he was told that the light rail vehicles for the
Southeast Rail Extension were already paid for and in service.
He wondered why staff is saying there is a need for more
vehicles when light rail ridership is below original projections
and RTD already has the vehicles for the Southeast Rail
Extension. Terry Emmons explained that we are increasingly
running four-car trains, which was not anticipated when the
original fifty-five vehicles were purchased, as well as having
higher ridership projections for the Southeast Rail Extension
and I-225 Corridor. Director Lasater asked how much
ridership is projected to increase for the Southeast Rail Line.
Eric Miller, Senior Rail Service Planner and Scheduler, stated
that there will be about a 10% increase in Southeast Rail Line
ridership over initial projections.
Director Menten asked if there are any light rail vehicles that
are not in-service as they are waiting to be rebuilt and what
the cost is to rebuild a vehicle. Phil Eberl stated that there
was one vehicle out-of-service. It would cost approximately
$300-$400K to repair a vehicle. Director Menten indicated
she had additional questions she would take offline.

• Recommended EcoPass Pricing for 2016
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors approves an 18.3 percent price increase for Business
EcoPass and a 13.3 percent price increase for Neighborhood EcoPass. These

Packet Pg. 26

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

funded through the base system. She wondered how the
division of funding was being determined. She wondered if
that meant that 15 of the trains would run only on the existing
T-Rex lines. Interim General Manager Genova explained that
for light rail operations there is a cost allocation with
FasTracks because the vehicles can run anywhere on the
system. Certain vehicles are not dedicated to certain lines.

6.D

price increases are for 2016 contracts. In addition, it is recommended that
the current $2.50 DIA surcharge be eliminated for both the Business
EcoPass and Neighborhood EcoPass programs.

Motion to
Approve
Substitute
Main Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to
approve Alternative 2, which reads:

“Adopt an 18.3 percent price increase for Business EcoPass
but phase it in over two years with a 13.3 percent price
increase for 2016 contracts and an additional 4.4 percent
price increase for 2017 contracts. Adopt a 13.3 percent
increase for Neighborhood EcoPass contracts to be applied in
2016. Eliminate the current $2.50 DIA surcharge from both
the Business and Neighborhood EcoPass programs.”
Chair Sisk seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Director Hoy inquired if the Board should be given the
opportunity to move the motion read into the record by
Committee Chair Anderson before other motions were made.
Marla Lien, General Counsel, stated that there was not a
motion made on the recommended action read by Committee
Chair Anderson. She explained that protocol would have
required Director Bagley to be recognized by the Chair of the
Committee, which did not happen; however, right now the
motion made by Director Bagley is on the table.
Director Lasater noted that the math is not correct in
determining the percentage increase as 13.3 and 4.4 do not
equal 18.3. Interim General Manager Genova explained that it
is a compounded effect, not a cumulative increase.
Director Bagley explained that the reason for his motion is that
in reading the packet he sensed there was some trepidation on
the part of some of the businesses. He thought this was an
opportunity to provide an alternative to the straight 18.3
percent increase. He stated that Committee Chair Anderson

Packet Pg. 27

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Prior to the Board having the opportunity to move the recommended action
read into the record by Committee Chair Anderson, Director Bagley made the
motion to approve Alternative 2.

6.D

Chair Sisk said he very much appreciates Director Bagley
making the motion to approve Alternative 2, as he thinks this
is an option that bares a great deal of thought. He noted that
there were a number of statistics used in determining the
13.3% fare increase, which is imbedded in Director Bagley’s
motion; however, RTD is asking the businesses to take on an
18.3% increase immediately. He expressed concern that RTD
has not yet made the case for an 18.3% increase. He
understands the need for compliance with Title VI but feels
there is more work to be done. He said Director Bagley’s
motion allows RTD to spend the next year to really focus on
SmartCard data that will really show what the actual increase
should be.
Director Lasater requested that the meeting go back to normal
process and allow staff to do their presentation. He feels that
for those that were not at the Study Session it would be nice
to hear the presentation. He also thinks it might answer
additional questions that other Directors may have.
Committee Chair Anderson indicated that she would allow
Director Lubow to speak first.
Director Lubow said she had the same concern as Director
Lasater. She would like to hear staff’s presentation as well as
the opinion of Marla Lien as RTD’s General Counsel.
Lacy Bell, Planning Project Manager, reviewed a Power Point
presentation with the Board that is available in the September
8, 2015 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda
Packet. She outlined the Fare study Process, Stakeholder
Outreach Groups, Stakeholder Feedback, Staff
Recommendations for 2016 Contract Pricing, Title VI Equity
Analysis, Revenue Impacts and Next Steps.
Marla Lien said that she does not make decisions, the Board
does; all she does is give advice. She stated that if there are
any repercussions from a decision made by the Board, they
will fall solely to the board, not Boulder County or the business
community. Staff has done their work and is giving the Board
their best recommendations. The Board is free to make policy
choices that staff does not recommend based on Title VI
Packet Pg. 28

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

never read a motion, she read a recommended action. He said
he made a motion and it was appropriate.

6.D

Marla Lien explained that she has not been involved in the
EcoPass program because there have not been serious Title VI
issues; however, Michael Washington, Manager of Title VI,
came to her with concerns. In reviewing the program, staff
found out there was over a 30% difference between the
number of low-income riders who had access to Business
EcoPasses and non-low-income riders. Staff found out that
there was over a 10% difference of minority riders who had
access to Business EcoPasses and non-minority riders. Finally,
staff found that the weighted average fare paid by EcoPass
riders was lower than the weighted average fare for of the rest
of the riders. She said that ultimately means RTD is giving a
higher subsidy per boarding to non-low-income, non-minority
riders than to low-income, minority riders, which was a
concern. She explained that based on this staff developed a
recommendation that equalized the subsidies.
Marla Lien reiterated that the Board can choose to do
something else; however, if there is an FTA issue or
investigation it will fall on the Board.
Director Folska made a point of order and asked to make a
motion to go back to the original motion made by staff. Marla
Lien explained that Director Folska would be making a motion
to amend Director Bagley’s motion. Director Solano seconded
the motion.
Committee Chair Anderson expressed that she was going to
take the opportunity to speak as the Chair of the Committee.
Director Folska pointed out that she had made a motion.
Committee Chair Anderson said that she did not hear Director
Folska make a motion and was going to take the opportunity
to speak as Chair of the Committee.
Committee Chair Anderson stated that she would be voting
against this motion because it is an issue of equity. She
believes Director Bagley’s motion should be voted down so
that there can be another motion and the Board can vote on
staff’s original recommendation.

because they have other concerns; however, if FTA has an
issue with what RTD is doing that will be up to the Board to
address with FTA.

6.D

Motion to
Amend Substitute
Main Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to
amend the substitute main motion back
to the original Board Action language.

Director Solano read the amendment as follows:
“It is recommended by the operations and Customer Service
Committee that the Board of Directors approves an 18.3
percent price increase for Business EcoPass and a 13.3
percent price increase for Neighborhood EcoPass. These price
increases are for 2016 contracts. In addition, it is
recommended that the current $2.50 DIA surcharge be
eliminated for both Business EcoPass and Neighborhood
EcoPass programs.”
Director Solano seconded the motion.
Marla Lien stressed that this was an amendment to the motion
to approve Alternative 2 (substitute main motion). If the
Board votes yes they are voting to amend the motion to
approve Alternative 2 (substitute main motion) and will then
have to vote again on the motion to as amended.
Committee Chair Anderson suggested that the cleanest way to
go back to staff’s recommendation would be to vote down
Director Bagley’s motion and then make a new motion.
Director Folska pointed out that would not be correct protocol.
Director Folska already had a motion to amend Director
Bagley’s motion that had been seconded, so the Board must
vote on her motion to amend.
Director Menten inquired if more SmartCard tap data became
available and it was determined that EcoPasses should really
have a 25 percent increase, would the Board have any future

Director Folska again made a point of order stating that she
previously made a motion to go back to the original
recommended action that was seconded. She stated that her
motion is now on the floor and requires a vote. Marla Lien
reiterated that the motion made by Director Folska was a
motion to amend Director Bagley’s motion. She asked
Director Solano to read the amendment as proposed by
Director Folska so everyone was clear.

options to adjust the pricing. Bruce Abel explained that there
is always the option for the Board to amend the pricing in any
given year. Marla Lien stated that the Board is not adopting a
policy but the pricing for the EcoPasses for the 2016 year.
Once the contracts were signed the Board could not change
the pricing for 2016 but would have the opportunity to do so
in subsequent years.

Discussion:

Director Lubow believes this is about basic equity. She does
not want to see a Title VI issue and does not want to see
EcoPass users get a larger subsidy than low-income riders;
however, she is very concerned that the process used has not
involved the stakeholders as much as it should. She
recognized that this was a thankless task for staff.
Director Francone agrees that there has not been enough time
given to the community for their concerns to be heard. She
recognized the desire to have any Title VI inequities resolved
quickly but she just does not believe there has been enough
time to involve the community. She requested the results of
the survey that was sent to the EcoPass businesses prior to
the Board Meeting.
Director Menten expressed concern that there was not enough
time for the businesses to respond as they were sent out last
Friday.
Director James believes that the Title VI concerns are great
enough to warrant this vote but he too had heard concerns
about the compressed process.
Director Bagley inquired if a vote on the EcoPass pricing could
be delayed. Interim General Manager Genova explained that if

Chair Sisk implored staff and the Board to review the EcoPass
pricing over the next year as more SmartCard data became
available and make any necessary changes based on the data.
He also hopes that the process can really involve the
stakeholders. He said he can assure everyone that an 18.3
percent increase will really take many businesses by surprised.
Bruce Abel stated that staff’s expectation is to continue the
evaluation process and work with stakeholders through next
years.
Director Hoy noted that one of the reasons RTD is in this
situation is because we waited five years for a fare increase.
He suggested addressing this more frequently so increases
would be easier to assimilate into budgets.
There was some discussion about the correct mover and
seconder for the vote on this motion. Marla Lien stated that
since Director Folska amended the motion made by Director
Bagley, Director Bagley was the mover.

C. Updates

• January 2016 Service Changes
Bruce Abel reminded the Board that RTD has three service changes per year.
He stressed that no action is being requested of the Board this evening.
Staff wants to ensure that the Board is briefed on the draft service changes
that will be taken out to public comment. He said that the Board will be
presented with a final recommendation next month for approval.

Packet Pg. 32

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

a vote was delayed it would be very difficult to get the 2016
EcoPass contracts out and executed.

Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, noted that these
changes would be happening in conjunction with the US 36 Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) Service Plan approved by the Board in July. He highlighted the
following more significant changes:
 Route L – add weekday mid-day service as well as Saturday service,
which is grant funded
 Route 8 – extended to 114th and Huron due to growth in the area
 Route 79Ltd – renamed to Route 83D to better reflect its final
destination in Downtown Denver
 Route 104X – as grant funding expires as of January. 2016 staff is
proposing to incorporate this route into regular RTD services since it
meets RTD Service Standards with the exception of the last
northbound trip, which will be discontinued
Director Francone recognized that there had been many back-and-forth
conversations about the Lockheed Martin Call-n-Ride being cancelled. She
asked for an update on the service. Brian Matthews, Manager of Special
Services, said that with the August service changes it was decided that RTD
would keep one Call-n-Ride trip to, and one from, Lockheed Martin. He
indicated that it was too early for ridership data as the change has only been
in effect for about three weeks. Director Francone inquired if there had been
significant conversations with Lockheed Martin about the need to increase
ridership for this service to continue. Brian Matthews stated that
conversations had been taking place for about eight years. Lockheed
believes that there will be enough riders to warrant the service based on
several new programs that just started such as an intern program. Director
Francone asked staff to analyze the ridership data for this Call-n-Ride very
carefully. She pointed out that while it is in her District, if ridership does not
support the service then it should be cancelled.
Director Bagley supported the comments made by Director Francone. He
has been on the Board seven years and the Lockheed Martin Call-n-Ride has
been a constant issue. He feels that RTD has bent over backwards for this
service but it has never achieved the ridership levels needed.
Director Solano asked for confirmation that Route 104X was being
acclimated into regular service. He also wondered if ridership was increasing
for Route 145X. Jessie Carter confirmed that staff is proposing Route 104X
continues. The route is doing very well and meeting RTD service standards
with the exception of the last northbound route that staff is proposing be
eliminated. He stated that Route 145X’s ridership has not increased. It is
the lowest performing of all RTD’s express routes. He said the market just
is not there to support the service. The current ridership is just above what
we would expect to see for a suburban local route.

6.D

Director Hoy pointed out that the route Director Solano inquired about,
Route 145X, only runs twice a day. He wonders if that is why ridership is
so low. Jessie Carter explained that the Route was not initially started as
having only two trips; however, the other trips performed worse so it has
been paired down. The Route is not targeted toward peak airport times for
airport employees.
Director Menten inquired as to the specific time when staff was proposing to
discontinue evening and late night short-turn trips on Route 16. Jessie
Carter said it would start around 10:20 p.m. He noted that it was not the
entire Route that would be discontinued but the short-turn trips between
Civic Center Station and Decatur-Federal Station.

• ADA Expert Mid-Year Report
Bruce Abel commented that as the Board may recall, last year RTD entered
into a settlement agreement with the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition
(CCDC). One of the requirements of the settlement was that RTD hire an
ADA expert to review our performance in conforming to the obligations and
commitments made in the settlement agreement. He said that overall the
report indicated that RTD is complying with the settlement agreement but
did make some suggestions of best practices we should implement.
There were no questions from the Board.

 Mall Shuttle Vehicle Update (no back-up)
Bruce Abel thanked the Board again for their approval of the purchase of the
new Mall Shuttles. He said a pre-production meeting was scheduled for the
last week of September.
Bruce Abel noted that there had been discussion regarding if RTD could
apply for a grant through the Regional Air Quality Council (RAQC). Bill Van
Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, had a meeting with RAQC
that was very positive. Bruce Abel shared that while there were no
commitments, it does appear the purchase of the Mall Shuttles would
qualify. He said that staff will continue to work to secure this funding.
Director James inquired as to when staff expected to have the new Mall
Shuttles on the street. Bruce Abel said that a pilot bus was expected in
April or May with delivery of the entire fleet in October of 2016.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Sisk asked why discontinuing the interline for the Sunday Route DASH
would increase the cost. Jessie carter explained that interlining is where a
bus from one route that is finished is then turned into another route. By
discontinuing the interline it creates two bus pullouts from the garage
instead of one, thereby increasing the cost.

6.D

• Special Services 2nd Quarter 2015 Report

Director Francone asked for an update on the Evergreen Call-n-Ride. Brian
Matthews, Manager of Special Services, shared that Evergreen has formed a
Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC). The TAC has decided to focus
on schools in the area and two senior living facilities to get ridership up. He
said he is waiting to hear back from drivers on their thoughts so far. At this
time it is too early to tell if there has been an increase in ridership as school
just started.

• Access-a-Ride/Cab 2nd Quarter 2015 Report
There were no questions from the Board.

• Contracted Fixed-Route 2nd Quarter 2015 Report
There were no questions from the Board.

• Customer Complaint 2nd Quarter 2015 Report
There were no questions from the Board.

• Security Statistics & Fare Inspection 2nd Quarter 2015 Report
There were no questions from the Board.

D. Other Matters
Director Lasater thanked everyone that had been involved with the Parker Call-nRide. Parker has implemented a Transportation Advisory Committee that has been
working on ideas to promote and bring awareness to the Call-n-Ride. He thought it
was very beneficial having the vehicles at the Parker Days Festival. He pointed out
that boardings have gone from about 2.7 per hour to 4. He thinks it is great to see
that things happen when you bring the community together. He believes this is
also what happened with the Federal Heights Call-n-Ride. Director Lasater said this
type of community engagement is what we need to do for our other Call-n-Rides.
Director James shared that recently the Rocky Mountain Institute held a
competition related to driverless cars that the Directors should hear about in the
news shortly. He hopes RTD can take advantage of opportunities to be involved as
this technological evolution takes place.
Director Menten remembered many years ago there being an experimental Personal
Rapid Transit Track east of Denver. She wondered if RTD ever owned that
property and if so, does RTD still own it. Interim General Manager Genova said he
was familiar with the project but did not know if RTD had any involvement.

Director Hoy expressed his frustration that the data included in the Special
Services report is not current enough. It is already September and the data
is from June. Bruce Abel noted that it was the 2nd Quarter Report that
covered April, May and June.

Director Bagley shared that he visited the facility when he was part of the Aurora
Planning staff. He does not believe RTD was involved.

Committee Vice Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorizes the Interim General Manager or his
designee to execute all documents necessary to amend the SumTotal
Systems, LLC (Contract Number 14D0002) to increase by $290,933.23 the
contract amount not-to-exceed limit from $343,003.80 to a total contract
amount of $633,937.03.
Motion:

Director Lubow made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the September 15,
2015 Board Meeting.
Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager of Finance and
Administration and Chief Financial Officer, introduced Kim
Heldman, Senior Manager of Information Technology and
George Hovey, Program Management Office Manager.
Heather Copp restated that the recommended action is for an
increase in the contract amount and that the funding for this
item is available in the existing budget.
Kim Heldman explained that TruTrack, the original union
payroll time tracking system, is now known as SumTotal.
Because of its age of 10 years plus in operation, the system
continues to present a number of challenges, including the
lack of replacement parts. Earlier this year the decision was
made to use SumTotal as the replacement system. Due to the
nature of the complex formulas used in tracking RTD’s union
employees; hours, it was discovered that the out-of-the-box
system did not cover all of RTD’s unique payroll elements.
Staff stopped the project at that point and made sure the
vendor had a clear understanding of RTD’s needs. Staff is
asking for a contract increase so the additional requirements
can be incorporated into the system.

• Approval of SumTotal Systems Contract Increase

6.E

Director Lubow wondered if this recommended action would
have been served better by a Request for Proposal (RFP) given
the needed customizations. Kim Heldman replied that an RFP
would have been likely in hindsight. Given the intricate nature
of the formulas necessary to calculate RTD’s union payroll,
staff estimates that SumTotal would have been chosen
through the RFP process.
Director Solano asked how union employees currently enter
their time. Kim Heldman said that they punch in on a time
clock. Director Solano noted that this type of system is
ancient. Kim Heldman clarified that the new system would
use time clocks as well; however these will be modernized and
updated to today’s standards. Director Solano wondered if
union employees could use laptops or handheld devices to turn
in their time sheets and measure their productivity throughout
the day. He thought that this would be beneficial when
accounting for out of the ordinary circumstances such as
snow, traffic, flat tires, among others. Heather Copp
explained that operators do not have RTD email accounts.
Two desktop computers are available at the garages for
employee use. Time clocks are available on the way to their
vehicles thus allowing for proper time keeping. She added that
the software in the back end does all the calculation needed
for the routes, duration of shifts and any out of the ordinary
circumstances.
Director Lasater explained that in a credit card facility, a Tier
IV facility is the bottom of the rung. He wondered if these
classifications are similar to the classifications used by
SumTotal since it is described in the Recommended Action
report as “Exceeds Tier IV facility requirements.” He
wondered if that meant that this company was at the bottom
of the rung for cloud facilities and backups. He added that in
his personal company he runs a Tier III/almost Tier II facility.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Hoy asked if the funding was already in the budget.
Kim Heldman replied in the affirmative. Director Hoy
requested clarification if this was an amendment to the
contract or a new procurement process. Kim Heldman noted
that this was an addition to the existing contract. She added
that staff went for a sole source request in 2014 for a new
system.

6.E

Director Deadwyler expressed her concern because she wants
to make sure that this recommended action will be enough for
the new software to last 10-15 years and another ask will not
be necessary in two years. She said that too many times the
Board has approved recommended actions that end up not
working as intended. She wants to ensure that staff has done
the proper research. Kim Heldman explained that staff did a
deep dive and has a solid understanding of what is needed for
the union time tracking system. She is convinced that the
vendor also has a deep understanding of the needs and is on
board to provide the needed service. Director Deadwyler asked
for the life expectancy of the equipment being proposed. Kim
Heldman replied that she was not sure but could research and
provide the Board with an answer. She noted that the current
system is 10 years old. Heather Copp added that the current
contract with SumTotal is 5 years. She pointed out that the
software will upgrade to a cloud based system. Director
Deadwyler agreed with Director Solano noting that a time
clock system seems ancient.
Director Francone wondered how long the previous contract
term was. Kim Heldman did not have that information
available but will provide the answer to the Directors. Director
Francone asked what the term of the new contract is and if it
includes future maintenance expenses. Kim Heldman replied
that the term is 5 years and it does include future maintenance
expenses.
Director Anderson noted that RTD has a unique situation when
it comes to our bus and train operators. She asked staff to
confirm that the current system has worked well given RTD’s
intricacies. Kim Heldman said that Director Anderson was
correct. Director Anderson noted that the current system has
been satisfactory and that staff has not received complaints
from employees about missing payments; however the system
does need an upgrade because it has been in use for 10 years.
Kim Heldman told Director Anderson that she was correct.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lasater mentioned that he does not like sole sourcing.
An RFP process is critical for transparency. He added that
there are a myriad of payroll processing companies that could
possibly be better and cheaper. He pointed out that for these
reasons he would be voting against this recommended action.

Director Solano expressed his concern that time clocks do not
track productive and non-productive time. He said that we
needed a device that at the end of the year would be able to
produce a graph tracking productive and non-productive times,
i.e. flat tires, accidents, etc. He also shared his concern about
not being able to track contracted bus operators. Bruce Abel,
Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, said that First
Transit and Transdev, the contractors RTD works with, are
separate employers with their own payroll systems. RTD pays
the contractors based on revenue hour of services regardless
of what the pay employees. He noted that RTD employs a
pay by exception system with union employees. Street
supervisors have the capacity to change the times in case of
any anomaly. Heather Copp noted that bus route information
is one of the types of information programmed in the
software’s back end. Director Solano said that he would
contact staff as he had other questions.
Chair Sisk noted that this item asks for another $300,000 in
unexpected costs. He agreed with Director Lasater about his
dislike for sole source. Chair Sisk said that he would be voting
for this recommended action as RTD cannot afford to have our
employees’ checks in jeopardy.
Director Archuleta asked what kind of operating system the
new program will use. George Hovey replied that it will be a
hosted environment. He added that he could provide Director
Archuleta with more details regarding the cloud based system.
Committee Vice Chair Menten wondered if SumTotal has
access to our employees’ personal information, like social
security numbers. Heather Copp replied that it is a tracking
system that feeds into our system. RTD does payroll for union
employees and all their personal information is confidential.
Committee Vice Chair Menten noted that the Recommended
Action Report, included in the Financial Administration and
Audit Committee agenda packet for September 8, 2015,
included the following sentence, “SumTotal has an established
security program that has had preliminary RTD review, further
review is underway and this will be followed by regular
monitoring of this hosting service.” She said this statement
made it seem like RTD had just started working with this
company. Committee Vice Chair Menten asked to meet with
Director Lasater so she can learn more about the tiers he
referred to.

Committee Vice Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED.

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorizes the Interim General Manager or his
designee to execute all documents necessary to execute a five-year contract
with Infax, Incorporated (Contract Number 15FH003) in the amount of
$1,788,655.39.
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the September 15, 2015 Board
meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Kim Heldman, Senior Manager of Information Technology,
noted that Programmable Information Displays (PIDs) are used
at Denver Union Station, Civic Center Station, Boulder Station,
Boulder Junction at Depot Square and Denver International
Airport as well as other locations throughout the District. With
the FasTracks expansion and desire for additional functionality
(i.e. software updates and real time information), staff
released a Request for Proposals to extend, enhance and/or
replace the in-kind system.
Director Lasater shared the concerns he has heard from his
constituents regarding the difference between scheduled time
and real time. He wondered if this software would give
constituents real time information on buses and trains. Kim
Heldman explained that for the present and the immediate
future it will still be scheduled time. She added that real time
will be available for bus service later this year and in 2016 for
rail. Director Lasater asked what the causes are for the delay.
He is concerned with the transfers between the A Line and the
R Line. He added that other systems throughout the nation
have this information readily available through smart phone
apps. He said that if RTD is a leader in the transit industry we

6.E

Director Folska asked if the real time information will also be
audible for those with low or no vision. Kim Heldman replied
not at this time. Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager for
Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer,
explained that the PIDs do have the capability to be audible
when speakers are installed; however, this would need to be
coordinated with the announcements from buses and/or trains
since too much audible information has the potential to create
confusion. Director Folska wondered if the speakers for the
PIDs are part of the budget. Heather Copp said that currently
they are not part of the budget. Director Folska noted that
she would like the speakers to be included in the budget.
Heather Copp pointed out that in order to do so a decision
needs to be made regarding bus/train announcements at
stations with PIDs. Director Folska restated that the speakers
need to be added to the budget as ADA considerations need to
be present in all recommended actions. Committee Vice Chair
Menten asked Dave Genova to come back to the Board with
more information on how to have PIDs with audible
announcements.
Director Solano asked if the information on the PIDs will also
be available in Spanish. Heather Copp said that staff will
come back to the Board with that answer.
Director Solano wondered if the real time information that will
be available on the PIDs will also be available via smart phone
applications. Dave Genova noted that RTD will launch a smart
phone application with real time information as soon as the
information is available. He pointed out that third parties will
have access to the information if they would like to include it
in their applications.
Director Francone wondered how much of the requested
amount will be spent on the PIDs themselves. Kim Heldman
said that the funding will be spent primarily on equipment and
installation. Heather Copp noted that staff will provide the
Directors with a breakdown. Director Francone asked
Packet Pg. 44

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

should be able to provide this information. Dave Genova,
Interim General Manager, explained that in order to retrieve
real time information on trains new infrastructure needs to be
placed along the right of way. This project is budgeted for
2016. Director Lasater emphasized that the sooner this
project is done the better.

Director Anderson shared her concern about confusing people
with too many announcements. She wants to make sure this
is done right. She said that she trusts staff to meet ADA
compliance and that the priority is to have real time
information for the riders. She noted that she will be
supporting this action as it works towards the completion of
the overall system.
Director Deadwyler said that she has a hard time with these
types of recommended actions which ask for funding approval
in increments. She thinks that the recommendation is
incomplete as there are many questions that staff has no
answers to.
Committee Vice Chair Menten wondered if the PIDs will be
used for advertising. George Hovey, Manager of Program
Management, pointed out that previously it was considered as
a possibility but determined not merited. He added that the
decision could be revisited at a later date. Committee Vice
Chair Menten pointed out that she would not want riders to
miss transit information because of an advertisement on the
display.

C. Updates

• Smart Media Technology (SMT) and Day Pass Printer Status
Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager for Finance and Administration
and Chief Financial Officer, said she was pleased to announce that there has
been significant progress on the SMT project since the 2nd Quarter update.

Packet Pg. 45

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

regarding the grant funding and the RTD match for this item.
Heather Copp replied that the Federal grant is paying for the
majority of the cost with the RTD match at 20%. She added
that the recommended action is for contract approval.

Kim Heldman, Senior Manager of Information Technology noted that this
project is a shared effort among many departments of RTD. She highlighted
the following accomplishments achieved since the 2nd Quarter update:
 Day Pass Printers – completed statement of work, executed contract,
completed design review, printers ordered, brackets for installment
being manufactured by bus operations.
 Merchant Agreements – finalized with RTD Legal and Finance, verbal
agreement from King Soopers.
 Smart Card Hosting – completed statement of work, procurement in
process.
 Stored Value Pilot program underway
 First Staff Pilot with RTD employees – over 50 RTD employees,
minimal problems reported.
 Independent readiness assessment to be conducted by IBI Group.
Kim Heldman pointed the Directors to the SMT Systems Budget and
Expenditures table as included in the SMT and Day Pass Printer Status
Update in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet
for September 8, 2015. She mentioned that the chart includes the budget
breakdown for the Xerox contract. She then highlighted the project
elements with a yellow status, which means they have a current or
anticipated issue with minor variance in scope, possible increase in budget
or possible delay. These items are:
 External Hosting of SMT Environment – procurement cycle timeline
and complexity of the architectural design took additional time to
finalize.
 Stored Value Internal Portal/Back-Office Enhancements – due to the
timing, availability and competition for Xerox development resources.
 Handheld Smart Media Readers (HSMR) – Xerox needs to make
programming changes to accommodate the new devices.
 Cybersecurity – RTD is dependent on Xerox to perform remediation
before RTD can complete all the changes needed.
Director Folska thought that the Board had already approved funding for the
HSMR. Heather Copp explained that the Board had approved it in the
Strategic Budget Plan. The HSMR will be included in the 2016 Budget
which will be discussed during the September 29, 2015 Study Session. Kim
Heldman added that the new HSMR will likely be iPhones with an
attachment that will accommodate the necessary software for 2016.
Director Lubow wondered if the only merchant willing to sell Smart Cards
was King Soopers. Kim Heldman replied that the plan was to reach out to
other retailers. Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications,
explained that Safeway is reorganizing with Albertson’s so at this time they

Chair Sisk thanked staff for their great work. He said he was sorry to see
some downgrades; however, he noted that listing these spoke to the
integrity of the process. He suggested that staff give an SMT update during
the November Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting since
the next update is scheduled for December and the program is scheduled to
go live in January, 2016. Heather Copp replied that staff will place a quick
update in the October and November Financial Administration and Audit
Committee meeting packets and allow a time for any questions. Committee
Vice Chair Menten agreed that more frequent updates would be a good idea
since the SMT is close to kick off.

• State Audit Process Update - No Backup
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, explained that
Colorado State statute requires the State to audit RTD at least once every 5
years and more frequently if requested by the State Audit Committee. The
current year is the 5th year of the cycle. He noted that RTD received
communication from the State late last year that the audit was coming up.
Chair Sisk and then General Manager Phil Washington sent a Letter of
Understanding to the State in late February/early March of this year.
Scott Reed noted that State statutes call for confidentiality until the audit is
released to audit committee. Because the auditor selection went through a
Request for Proposal process, the focus of the audit can be made public.
This audit will focus on matters related to compliance with bus and light rail
train operator safety requirements. He said that the State pointed out that
this audit is different from the one 5 years ago as that one directly focused
on the former General Manager Cal Marsella’s contract and concerns
expressed over severance package and deferred payments. The past audit
made specific recommendations to the Board. The current audit will make
recommendations before management.
Scott Reed added that the Audit Committee is scheduled to meet Tuesday,
October 20th at 9:00 a.m. at the State Capitol Building in room 271 to
review RTD’s audit. He read the following statement from the State of
Colorado to the Board, “Please inform the Board that RTD has been good to
work with and responsive to the auditor’s requests for information. We
understand that the audits could be difficult at times and we appreciate the
cooperation and efforts to make this a smooth audit and a value-added

Packet Pg. 47

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

are not interested but indicated they might be interested in the future. He
said that staff has reached out to Walgreens. Committee Vice Chair Menten
asked if Walmart is a possibility. Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for
Bus Operations, noted that Walmart respectfully declined as they are not
able to implement local initiatives that are not available corporate-wide.

6.E

process. We are in discussions with RTD at this point as our team works to
write its findings and draft the report.”

Committee Vice Chair Menten asked staff to confirm that there is a 5%
surcharge to the State Auditor’s Office. Scott Reed confirmed that she was
correct.
Director Francone asked if the subject of the audit is confidential. Scott
Reed replied that the scope of the audit is public yet the specifics are
confidential. The process usually casts a wider net than they are looking
into. Director Francone wondered if it was confidential because the work
was in process. Marla Lien, General Counsel, noted that State statutes call
for confidentiality for all audits.
Director Francone noted that the audit seemed to be a performance audit.
She wondered if staff felt that the scope of the audit is appropriate. Scott
Reed replied that the scope as written felt appropriate.

• Second Quarter 2015 Performance Measures
Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration and
Chief Financial Officer, referred the Directors to the Second Quarter 2015
Performance Measure updates as included in the Financial Administration
and Audit Committee agenda Packet for September 8, 2015. She noted
that the only measures that did not achieve goals were:
 Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
 Goal 4.2 – Level of Customers Complaints
 Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
 Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization.
She added that RTD continues to exceed its vacancies goals in bus operator
and bus mechanics due to retirements, system growth, and strong local
economy. She noted that Human Resources is trying out a “one-stop”
recruitment process by providing applicants with drug screening and
background checks at one time to shorten the cycle.
Director Lubow shared that during General Manager Executive Search
Employee Listening Forums employees expressed their frustration at the
length of the hiring process. She pointed out that low income people do not
have months to wait on a job offer. She wondered if staff has asked

Packet Pg. 48

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley recalled that RTD had to pay for the last audit. He asked
staff the price for the current audit. Scott Reed replied that the total cost of
the audit is $137,750 plus a 5% State Auditor Office fee. RTD was billed
$93,567.50 on June 30th and the remainder will be due once the audit is
completed.

6.E

Committee Vice Chair Menten recalled that there were a substantial amount
of comments from operators during the General Manager Executive Search
Employee Listening Forums referencing how hard it is to deal with shifts, i.e.
split shifts, end times, and others. She said that these comments may be an
insight as to the high turnover rate.

• 2016 Requested Budget (High Level Update)
Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis
reviewed the 2016 Requested Budget Presentation as included in the
Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet for September
8, 2015. The presentation included RTD’s Vision and Mission, the 2016
Budget Theme, the Strategic Budget Plan Summary, 2016 Budget
Assumptions, 2016 Budget Targets, Sources and Uses, and Next Steps.
Director Folska asked for clarification regarding the fund balances. She
thought that in the past the goal was 3 months of operating expenses yet
the presentation mentioned 2 months. Jannette Scarpino explained that for
base operations the fund balance is 3 months, approximately $90 million.
For FasTracks, it was adjusted to 2 months of operating expenses in order
to contribute to the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA). Director
Folska wondered what the FasTracks fund balance would look like as RTD
moves from capital programs to operations and maintenance. Jannette
Scarpino replied that the goals will remain the same and as staff starts
sketching out the budget they will present those to the Board and adjust as
necessary.
Director Francone wondered what items were accounted for in the nondepartmental line item. Jannette Scarpino replied that this line item is a
catch all for items that do not fit in other categories, such as interest
expenses and intern programs, among others.

• July 2015 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod, Controller, reviewed the July 2015 Monthly Financial Status
Report update as included in the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee agenda packet for September 8, 2015. He also distributed
updated charts with the final Sales & Use Tax numbers as they were
received after the agenda packet was distributed. Overall, the Sales & Use

Packet Pg. 49

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

employees for their feedback on this matter. Bruce Abel, Assistant General
Manager of Bus Operations, replied that as part of the Strategic Plan staff is
in the process of conducting market research with employees. He reinforced
Heather Copp’s remark regarding the economy; people are returning home to
higher paying jobs or returning to old jobs. Director Lubow noted that this
implied that RTD cannot keep up. Bruce Abel added that as the economy
improves RTD remains static.

6.E

Director Bagley thanked Doug MacLeod and Heather Copp for such a
comprehensive yet top level update. He said that it helps the Directors
understand where RTD is at. He noted he would not be surprised if Fare
Revenue and Ridership continue to decrease given that the predictions are
valuing retail gas at $2.00 per gallon by the end of the year. He added that
the Denver gas market is one of the highest in the nation. He thinks that
Sales & Use Tax may keep increasing. Committee Vice Chair Menten
thanked Director Bagley for requesting the extra information now included in
the Monthly Financial Status Report.
Director Lubow said she was very thankful to have this information
summarized in the report. She noted that things are very volatile and
wondered if the decrease in ridership is correlated to gas costs. Doug
MacLeod replied that gas costs seem to be one of the factors for ridership,
though it is hard to pin down the exact reasons. Director Lubow noted that
gas prices may help us in our forecasts.
Director Lubow asked if staff knew why the Sales & Use Tax was
decreasing. Heather Copp clarified that Sales & Use Tax is not decreasing
but rather the rate of growth is slowing. She expects to see more
information in the Leeds Forecast from the University of Colorado.
Director Lubow inquired regarding the state of the FISA account. Heather
Copp said the initial projections made may have been too optimistic. Staff is
examining the original assumptions and will bring an update to the October
Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting.

D. Other Matters
No other matters were presented.

E. Next Meeting Date - October 20, 2015

Tax, Ridership, and Fare Revenue were lower when compared to the July
2014 numbers; however, when comparing 2015 year to date to 2014 year
to date Sales & Use Tax and Fare Revenue have increased. Heather Copp,
Assistant General Manager of Finance and Chief Financial Officer, noted that
if the downward trends remain, management will meet with each area to
discuss what can be delayed, postponed or eliminated in order to achieve
budget targets.

September Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Sisk moved forward in review of the September agenda.
Motion:

Director Hoy made the motion to approve moving this agenda
before the full Board on September 15, 2015.
Director Menten seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Chair Sisk indicated there had been no GM Executive Search
Committee but we were moving forward in collecting
candidate applications and letters of interest. No indication of
candidate names has been presented. Chair Sisk asked Kent
Bagley, Chair of the GM Oversight and Performance
Committee, if he had any updates. Director Bagley said the
committee will be going through the Performance Evaluation
process starting in late October.
Chair Sisk moved into the review of the unanimous consent
agenda. There was no discussion regarding the unanimous
consent agenda.
Chair Sisk moved the discussion forward to the
recommended action agenda starting with the purchase of
17 additional light rail vehicles. Interim General Manager
Genova mentioned there were a number of questions that
staff were working to answer and he would send an update
on Friday to the full Board. Director Bagley asked what the

Packet Pg. 53

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 10, 2015 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Sisk asked if there was any discussion for this item.
He added that there had been conversations between Paula
Perdue and Director Tobiassen regarding the timing of this
action as opposed to waiting until December. It was decided
that since Scott Reed and Lou Ha were willing to continue
their service we should move forward with this action. Chair
Sisk noted that Directors Lubow and Tobiassen will end their
terms on December 31, 2016. There was no further
discussion.

6.F

Chair Sisk introduced the EcoPass pricing for 2016 action
item into the discussion. Chair Sisk indicated that the vote
on this item was 10 – 4 with Lasater, Francone, Solano and
Sisk in the negative. Chair Sisk asked for comments and
Interim General Manager Genova commented he would have
staff put together a few bullet points on the Title VI
information. He will include this information in the e-mail he
is preparing for the Board.
Director Menten remembered a memo from Scott Reed
regarding a breakdown of private and public entities in the
program; she would like to review those numbers again. She
also asked about the survey sent to stakeholders last Friday
and asked if she could get a copy of the questions. Director
Menten asked Interim General Manager Genova if we were
expecting a large crowd for public participation at the Board
Meeting. Interim General Manager Genova indicated he
thought public participation would be heavy but he did not
anticipate it being as extensive as the Fare Study. Director
Menten commented that she did not agree with allowing
elected officials speak first as other constituents were taking
time away from their businesses and families as well. Chair
Sisk took the opportunity to commend Director Menten on
her success as Acting Chair of the committee meeting and
added Director Anderson did a great job as well as both
meetings were challenging. Interim General Manager Genova
confirmed with Barbara McManus that we would have the
extended meeting set up for Tuesday; she indicated that had
already been arranged. There was some discussion regarding
how some of the EcoPass groups are determined. Chair Sisk
reviewed the structure of the Boulder downtown business
association as an example, which is made up of restaurant
workers, retail staffing etc. and subsidized by parking
revenue. Director Hoy commented that the outreach process
is important to our current stakeholders. Chair Sisk said the
outreach conversation had happened in committee meeting
and would like to move forward. Director Folska made some
comments regarding Neighborhood EcoPasses and cited
some breakdowns in one of the Boulder communities which
included City of Boulder contributions. She asked for further

Packet Pg. 54

vote was for this item. Interim General Manager Genova
indicated the vote was 12 – 2 and Chair Sisk confirmed.

6.F

Chair Sisk moved on to the recommendation of SumTotal
Systems contract increase. Interim General Manager Genova
spoke to some language changes that would need to be
clarified regarding the time clock component of the system.
He explained they do not actually punch cards but they use
the hardware to scan their RTD personal ID card, which
captures the information for the back office. The back office
structure is very complex and breaks out mechanics,
operators, cleaning staff and shift pay rates, shift
differentials, etc. Chair Sisk asked what the vote was on
this item. Interim General Manager Genova clarified the vote
was 12 – 2 with Directors Lasater and Solano in the
negative.
Chair Sisk asked if there was any discussion about the InFax
Contract Authorization. Interim General Manager Genova
clarified that the current procurement is only for the
Programmable Information Displays (PIDs). He would work
with staff to research information regarding the bi-lingual and
speaking functionality. He indicated split this into 2 areas:
(1) the technical side and what are the current capabilities for
audio and bi-lingual, if any, and (2) what hardware upgrades
would be needed for this functionality along with the
estimated cost. Staff will review what is needed to
implement these options. Some other questions that are
more difficult to answer are does the organization want to do
audio announcements and have information in other
languages. Interim General Manager Genova spoke to a
group he has appointed to look at how, if at all, we as an
organization would like to proceed. The team is comprised
of the following representation: legal, Ed Neuberg, ADA
Manager, Michael Washington, Title VI Manager, and others.
Chair Sisk clarified the approval of this item is only for the
contract increase for the PIDs. Any additional capabilities
added would require addition of scope and dollars.
Director Menten asked Interim General Manager Genova to
provide a current breakdown of language statistics for

Packet Pg. 55

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 10, 2015 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

analysis in the future. Chair Sisk reminded the committee
that the Neighborhood EcoPass program will be remaining at
the 13.3% increase. Interim General Manager Genova
indicated he would get the requested information back to the
Directors. Chair Sisk asked for any additional questions.

6.F

Denver. Director Hoy raised the question of how do you
make a distinction between understanding a language and
speaking a language and how do you decide what may or
may not be effective. Chair Sisk said moving forward that
minimally the functionality should be ADA compliant.
Director Menten clarified there would be no amendment for
these upgrades made at the Board Meeting on Tuesday.

IV.

Board Meeting Protocols
Chair Sisk spoke to the fact that this had been put together some time ago but was never
brought forward. Some questions brought up by Director Lubow prompted a new look at
this policy, which was completed after meetings with Chair Sisk and Interim General
Manager Genova. After careful consideration, a few additions and changes produced the
draft document you have before you. Chair Sisk added it is difficult to manage events
sponsored by outside groups. In this document we outline what we would like to see, but
sometimes we have to realize we are not hosting but being hosted. In some cases at
specific events it is appropriate for the Chair to speak, but we need to always recognize
the District and other Directors present. Chair Sisk noted this is a particularly important
document to be in place with all of the openings scheduled in 2016.
Director Bagley requested to see the original and redline version of this document. Chair
Sisk absolutely agreed. Interim General Manager Genova explained this was a guideline
produced by Pauletta Tonilas and was never formally approved. He recognized that very
little has changed from the original. Chair Sisk appreciated this being brought forward and
it will help all the Directors and staff moving forward. Director Bagley stated the issue for
him is that this was, not and is not, currently a Board policy. He said anything that has
happened to date was done appropriately. He understands Chair Sisk and Director Lubow
have reviewed the document but it disturbs him that no other Board member has seen or
had input on this document. He requested to see a full redline copy of the document.
Chair Sisk explained this is why the policy will go to committee for review of the full
Board. Director Folska added this is the first time any of the Board members have seen
this document and looks forward in doing a full review with proper changes to take place
before final approval.



The represented Health & Welfare Trust has been having issues in paying its bills
and has gone through all their reserves. We have been working with the trust to
resolve some of the issues as well as working with the actuarial in modeling
some changes with the plan such as deductibles and co-pays. Director Menten
asked if the service carriers will change. Interim General Manager Genova said
they are looking at all options to help the plan become solvent. Chair Sisk asked
is staff will be coming to the Board for additional funds this year. Interim
General Manager Genova indicated they would not.



In conjunction with the US 36 BRT openings, staff is looking to implement a
single change instead of multiple changes to routes at opening. Staff is working
with the external stakeholders this week to determine the best way to approach
the service change and opening of the BRT.



Director Bagley made the committee aware that Amanda Chilton, the citizen
who attended and interrupted the GM Oversight and Performance Committee
meeting as well as other meetings, was arrested and will be on trial October
14th. He said that he, as the person who filed the complaint, and staff will be
attending the proceedings. He will be briefing with Marla Lien later today and
will keep the committee up to date. Chair Sisk thanked him for his commitment.



Director Bagley brought up his continued interest in Video recording of all
meetings. Since this was not successful in moving forward he wanted to let the
committee know he is working with Scott Reed in determining what it would
take and what the cost would be to move forward. Once this is complete he
will bring it back to committee. Director Folska asked if this would be audio and
video. Director Bagley responded that he did not know what the outcome
would be to this research. Director Menten added that a security video system
had been added to R, T & D and wondered if that system be utilized for this
purpose. Director Hoy said that Adams County Courthouse just added a new
system. He also said a single camera system would be enough. Director Bagley
noted most elected bodies have this capability at this point. Interim General
Manager Genova said the camera in the Board Conference Room and R, T & D
are always running and tape over themselves unless they are needed because of
an incident. He would ask staff to see if the capabilities of the current video
system could work. Chair Sisk asked to look at this process holistically and
come back to the committee.



Chair Sisk let the committee know that Kenn Harden pleaded guilty to a charge
in federal district court and the trial was cancelled. He was charged but we do
not know what the charge was.

Retiree Awards
There were two retirees this month; however, none were in attendance. Chair Sisk
acknowledged our retirees for their contributions to RTD which are invaluable. He asked
the audience to join him in thanking them for being such great employees.
Kim D. Baker – LRT Train Operator – 22 years
Gary Lynn Hill – Dispatcher – 18 years
Special Recognition – GFOA 2015 Distinguished Budget Presentation Award
Chair Sisk believes this is an apropos recognition as later this evening the Board will be
asked to approve the Strategic Budget Plan. He recognized Todd Nikkel, Cost and Budget
Manager, for his budget presentation. Chair Sisk thinks this is such an honor. He
recognized that RTD’s budgets are very integral and complicated. He said that he is sure
he does not give the budgets the attention they deserve but he really appreciates the
amount of effort the finance department gives. He noted this is an award that RTD had
received for over 31 years but it should not be taken lightly.

V.

Public Participation
Chair Sisk noted the importance of public participation as it is a way for the constituents
to communicate with the Board members and staff. He reminded the speakers that they
would have three minutes to address the Board and asked that they be respectful of their
fellow participants.
 Kent Moorman, City of Thornton, shared that he was here on behalf of Mayor Heidi
Williams who was unable to attend the meeting due to a City Council Meeting. He
read a letter from Mayor Williams and the City Council expressing their support for

the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation for necessary aspects of Phase I of the North
Metro Rail Line to the 124th Avenue Station; however, they are very disappointed
that the 2015 APE does not include funding to completed Phase 2 of the North
Metro Line from 124th Avenue to the end-of-line station at 162nd Avenue. They
would like the Board to authorize funding this year to complete the final design to
the end-of-line station as well as negotiate an extension of the guaranteed price
option for construction of Phase 2. A copy of this letter is available in the Board
Office.
Steve O’Dorisio, Adams County Commissioner, said he wanted to begin by
thanking the Board for their commitment. He acknowledged the hard business
decisions the Board must make. These decisions are based on weighing
opportunity and risk. He stated that there is the opportunity to complete the North
Metro Rail Line thereby helping the North Metro community. He commented that
his community is asking RTD to focus on completing the line that was promised
before discussing the expansion of any other lines. He outlined the opportunities
and risks as follows:
o Opportunities
 Predictability – RTD has a guaranteed price for completion to 162nd
Avenue and a financial commitment of $3 million from Adams County
should RTD honor its commitment to finish the Line
 Permission – RTD owns almost all of the Right of Way (ROW) needed
for completion to 162nd Avenue
 Timing and Efficiency – RTD can take advantage of having design,
engineering and construction teams already mobilized
o Risks
 Waiting – RTD would have to start over with both the political
process and the design, engineering and construction teams
 Cost – RTD will lose the guaranteed cost for completion to 162nd
Avenue if we do not exercise our option with the contractor
Steve O’Dorisio hopes the Board will consider approving the guaranteed
construction price by approving construction to 162nd Avenue as well as authorizing
funding this year to complete the design. He looks forward to working with RTD
and thanked the Board and Staff for their dedication.
Gary Van Dorn, National Federation for the Blind – Colorado Chapter (NFBCO),
came to speak in his capacity as a NFBCO Board Member. The NFBCO has
concerns with the new fully electric mall shuttles that the Board will be voting on
due to their virtually silent operations. They are grateful that staff is looking into
options so the visually impaired can hear the vehicles on the mall but noted this is
not just a blindness issue. The mall is busy and noisy and the shuttles can be
difficult for everyone to hear. Gary Van Dorn noted something that RTD currently
does well is that operators ring bells and honk their horns. He hopes this

continues. He stated that the NFBCO is not opposed to the purchase of the mall
shuttles but wanted to make sure their concerns were expressed.
Julie Bennett, 9 to 5, stated that she is homeless. She wanted to discuss an
income based bus fare for people who live in poverty and are trying to get on their
feet. She commented that it is difficult to get by in this State unless you make $35
per hour. She asked the Board for their support and help so people struggling
could pay their fares every day to go to interviews, go to jobs, find housing, etc.
Yolanda Begay, 9 to 5, indicated that she too was homeless. She is a single
mother to her four year old son, a student at Metro, and lucky that she currently
receives an EcoPass. She noted that several years ago she was working a full time
job that paid over minimum wage and at times it was still difficult to pay for
transportation. She remembers the day she got a ticket in front of her son. It was
very embarrassing because it was not that she did not want to pay for the fare; it
was because she could not afford to pay for the fare. She stated it was important
for the Board to consider the many stories of people that cannot pay RTD’s fares,
not just a few. She thinks having an income based program would really help the
people that are struggling. She said she is tired of struggling.
Dre Chiriboga-Flor, 9 to 5 transit organizer, is here to share the story of a young
man who could not attend as he is not allowed on RTD property. He makes $9 per
hour at a fast food restaurant. Two years ago he had to go to court for light rail
tickets. The judge said if he received another ticket it would be considered
trespassing. She said that two weeks ago he went to a light rail station to buy a
ticket to get to work. The machine would not recognize his debit card so he got on
the train so he would not be late. On the train he was asked to show his ticket,
which he did not have, and was suspended from RTD for six months and issued a
ticket with a fine. He was told that if he was found at any buses, light rail or RTD
property he would be arrested. She expressed that it is hard to understand why
RTD would ban someone after issuing a fine since it only makes it harder for them
to get to work so they can pay the fine. This is one of many stories of people
being fined between $80 and $200 for not paying for a $2.25 fare. These people
are not paying their fares because they are trying to cheat the system but because
they cannot afford them. She said that they have heard many references to
working on an income based pass with Mile High Connects. She stated that 9 to 5
is here to hold the Board accountable. She hopes the Board will follow through
with this instead of further contributing to the financial crisis many people are
facing.
Steve Gutierez, SEIU Local 105, is an organizer with the Fight for 15 for Home
Healthcare Workers. He said he was here to speak to the Board about an income
based pass. He knows many of the Board members support this and he hopes they
continue to do so. He shared that many home health care workers make between
$8 and $10 an hour to perform this very critical job. Many are struggling already to

afford a bus pass or daily ticket. He asked the Board to look at the budget and
make an income based pass a reality.
Dana Nobles, 9 to 5, stated that as decision makers the Board chose to go against
overwhelming public input against a violent fare increase. She believes the Board
can provide protections to those that will be impacted the most by offering an
income based pass. She stated that by voting for the fare increase the Board
committed structural violence. Structural violence is defined as political economic
forces that enact unequal access to resources, services, rights and security that
limit life chances. The fare increase is directly propagating harm and exacerbating
poverty. She said that while the Board can no longer do the right thing there is still
time to do something right. She asked the Board to let go of being profiteers and
make a decision as a human being. The heart of transit is human beings and
families.
Violet Deseguin said that he is homeless. He was here to speak to the Board about
the fare increase. He does not think it is a good idea. He works for Praxus as a
volunteer. He relies on transit to get to work and back to his campsite. He stated
that he cannot afford the fare. He believes not being able to access public
transportation is affecting people’s lives. He hopes the Board can change its mind
about the fare increase.
Mary Durrent, Lakewood, is here on behalf of an organization called Praxus. She
oversees Praxus’ budget and noted that their funding has been significantly
decreased over the past 1.5 years. There have been massive funding gaps that
have meant that Praxus cannot purchase bus tickets for their youth. These youth
can no longer come to the Praxus office to access basic needs. She is here before
the Board as she has been many other times to talk about an income based pass.
She has spent many hours of her time at court to turn fees and fines into
community service for the youth that are the most vulnerable. Not only was
increasing the fare detrimental, but the penalties create an even bigger burden for
those that cannot afford the fare. She asked the Board to really think what it must
be like to choose between buying a bus pass or food or medication. They do not
get on the trains without paying because they want to go against RTD policies but
because they are unable to pay. She stated that the non-profit agencies can no
longer support the community’s transportation costs.
Doug Gragg, Denver, was recently at Denver Union Station watching the trains
come in and out when he was assaulted by a teenager. He said he is concerned
about security. A security officer did come to his aide and he was doing a great job
but unfortunately it was after the fact. He shared that every time he goes to DUS
he is worried now. He noted that the elevators at DUS also seem to be out of
service frequently. He asked RTD to put signs around the concourse letting
passengers know when the elevators are out of service. It can be quite frustrating
to walk from the middle of DUS to one end only to find that you cannot ride the

elevator. He commented that there is also an issue with several of the planters
with trees. They are all dead and it looks terrible.
Jonathan Perlmutter with North Metro Partners read a letter regarding the RTD’s
Annual Program Evaluation. A copy of this letter is available in the Board office.
The letter expressed North Metro Partners’ disappointment that the APE did not
including funding for the North Metro Rail Line to 162nd Avenue.
Brenda Lozada shared that she is a personal care provider that truly relies on RTD
for transportation. She expressed that it was going to be very hard for her to get
around with RTD raising prices and there any many people in her situation. She
really appreciates RTD’s service and drivers but she is concerned about being able
to pay for a ticket. She asked the board to look into a way to help low income
works with an income based pass.

Chair Sisk thanked everyone for their participation.

Director Folska mentioned there was a recent visit from a delegation from Miami. She said
they were very impressed with what RTD has been able to achieve. She was asked the
one thing that made RTD so successful. While there really are a multiplicity of elements,
she believes the bottom line is sustained regional collaboration. She thinks RTD and the
Board can take a lot of pride in that collaboration.

 Meeting with Valley Metro from Phoenix, Arizona on Tuesday, August 18
Director Folska expressed her concern with the elevators at Denver Union Station (DUS)
being frequently out of service. She pointed out that individuals with service animals
cannot take an escalator; they need an elevator. She recognized that there have been
issues with those elevators since DUS opened. Interim General Manager Genova
acknowledged that elevators do break down from time to time. He plans to look into the
elevators at DUS to determine if there have been intermittent issues or more frequent
problems.
Chair Sisk noted that the escalators on the east side of DUS frequently seem to be in need
of repair. He thinks an important point being made is that RTD needs to be more attentive
to our passengers when there is an issue so our constituents are not inconvenienced.

Approval of Interim General Manager's 2016 Goals

Original Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to approve the
Interim General Manager’s Goals for 2016.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Anderson noted that the full Board had
received the minutes from the General Manager
Oversight and Performance Management Committee
Meeting held on August 4, 2015 where Director
Menten’s proposed changes were thoroughly
discussed. She explained that the structure of having
core and task goals was created in response to the
State Legislature’s unhappiness in how a previous
General Manager’s contract and employment
compensation where managed. The State Legislative
Audit Committee said the Board should not blur the
relationship between base salary and incentive pay by
providing additional compensation to the General
Manager for performing functions, carrying out tasks or
achieving performance goals that could be considered
standard performance expectations or core functions of
the job. She explained that out of this the core goals
were developed.
Director Anderson reiterated that the core goals are tied
to the General Manager job description. When the
Board hired Dave Genova as the Interim General
Manager the job description was not altered. Since the
job description did not change, it is Director Anderson’s
belief that Interim General Manager Genova should be
able to rely upon the current job description and core
goals in order to fulfill his Interim duties.
Director Anderson acknowledged that Director Menten
has said the core goals are stale, which may be a point
for further conversation; however, the Board is in the

Packet Pg. 73

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 18, 2015 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of August 18, 2015)

It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management
Committee that the Board of Directors approve the Interim General Manager’s goals for
2016 as defined in the attached General Manager’s Performance Evaluation Form.

process of hiring a new General Manager and part of
that process will be re-evaluating the job description
and core goals. Director Anderson recommends
waiting to update the job description and core goals
during the process of hiring a new General Manager.
She believes this is about fairness to Interim General
Manager Genova to not change the rules in the middle
of the game.
Director Anderson asked the Board to also approve the
task goals as recommended. These goals were
discussed and vetted at the Committee Meeting. She
stated that 2016 will be a landmark year for RTD and
the focus should be on our new transit lines and getting
it right.
Director Folska asked for a point of clarification. She
noted that Director Anderson referred to changing the
rules on Interim General Manager Genova. She believes
that what the Board is voting on this evening does not
change the rules in the middle of the game as these are
goals for 2016. The goals for 2015, which Interim
General Manager will be evaluated against at the end of
this year, were already approved in 2014. She asked if
it was correct that these goals are for the 2016 years.
Chair Sisk stated that was correct.
Motion to Amend
Core Goal 1:

Director Menten made the motion to amend core goal 1
to read as follows under Exceeded Expectations:
Meets Achieved Goal criteria in all areas including both
of the following:
 Achieves 90% or more of RTD Board-approved
performance measures;
 Provides outstanding and noteworthy service for
major RTD-supported special events,
conventions, 16th Street Mall events, Broncos
Ride, etc.
Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Director Francone asked Director Anderson to reread
the portion of her comments related to the State
Legislature regarding certain measurable goals.
Director Anderson stated the Board should not blur the
relationship between base salary and incentive pay by
providing additional compensation to the General
Manager for performing functions, carrying out tasks or
achieving performance goals that could be considered
standard performance expectations or core functions of
the job. Hence the core goals were developed and tied
to the job description for the General Manager.

and transparent in agency operations.

Discussion:

9.A

Director Lubow seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Director Menten feels the current measures are really
based on external measures. She wants to ensure the
new General Manager understands it is important we
received feedback from our employees. She feels that
based on the survey that was done this year 65% is
not too much of a stretch and this will give the
employees a sense that their opinion is important.
Director Tobiassen said in in his experience surveys are
something done frequently but they should be used to
measure improvement from one year to the next. He is
concerned that this will change an employee survey
from something people can answer honestly to
something political. If there is a General Manager that
the Union does not like they can lobby for their
members to give a low score or vice-versa. He stated
that the Agency needs an employee survey that is fair,
unbiased and gives a scientific view of the temperature
of the employees.
Director Anderson thinks this is a classic example of
blurring the lines between what a General Manager
should be doing as part of his every day job and then
awarding him for doing it.
Director Folska said she appreciates the sentiments of
Directors Tobiassen and Anderson; however, the
process for evaluating the General Manager is based on
a multiplicity of factors. She reiterated that the most
important asset the Agency has is its human capital,
followed by the constituents. She recall in going to a
General Manager Executive Search Listening Session
with the employees that some areas of a 70% turnover
rate. She stated that she will be supporting this
because the employees are RTD’s best asset.

AND
Receives a 65% approval rating from a confidential
employee survey.

Director Walker stated he will not be supporting this
motion even though he does think it is very important
that the employees’ voices are heard. He does not
think the measure for this goal should have such a
heavy weight on subjective criteria. He thinks that the
measures in place now are objective and from people
who are not directly impacted by the decisions made by
the General Manager, some of which may be unpopular
but necessary. He does not want to put the General
Manager in a situation where he or she is being
measured by politics.
Director James believes this could result in flawed
criteria where the survey is reduced to a popularity
contest versus substantive feedback. He is also
concerned that this is being brought forward so late in
the process. This amendment has not been vetted
through the General Manager and Oversight Committee
thoroughly like the other goals have been.
Director Solano thinks this goal would be an
encouragement for a new General Manager to engage
with the employees. He shared that during his listening
session many employees did not know who the General
Manager was and were appalled to hear the amount of
money a General Manager makes. He believes the
person on the very bottom is just as important as the
person of the very top so he will be voting yes.
Director Francone shared that when she was out
campaigning she was really impressed with the people
she talked to who had been employees for 10, 30 or
even 30+ years. She was very impressed with an
Agency that could retain employees for that period of
time. She does not think some of the Board members
give enough credit to the employees. She believes they
would be giving an honest answer, not a political one.
She feels if there is such negativity from the employees
then it behooves the General Manager to change that.

Director Hoy stated that it is not the percent of
employees that like the General Manager that is
important. It is really the change in that percentage.
He said that the Board does not know what the number
is today so the Board cannot really say that 65% is a
good goal. He thinks the only way this works is to
consider it later when a baseline has been established.
Chair Sisk thinks it is a valid concern about how the
Board gauges the employees’ response to the General
Manager but agrees this is food for thought in
subsequent years.

FasTracks DBE/SBE/WIN goals are achieved; 3)

She thinks this is an important component of the 2016
goals.

Innovative programs in this area are pursued and
implemented; 4) FTA Triennial Reviews focusing on
these areas are exceptional; 5) Creates model and
implements structure to encourage graduation from the
DBE/SBE program; 6) Implements a hiring program for
people with disabilities.
Director Folska seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Director Menten indicated that her interpretation of the
General Manager contract is that these goals are used
in determining how much of a bonus the General
Manager receives; it does not affect the General
Manager’s salary. She asked if that was correct. Paula
Perdue, Executive Director to the Board, stated that
was incorrect. RTD does not pay the General Manager
bonuses. The Board can elect to award the General
Manager with a discretionary performance payout.
Director Menten asked if it was accurate that the last
discretionary payout made to the General Manager was
about $25K. Chair Sisk said that was the correct
amount.
Director Menten noted that if these amendments are
made then the Board would be asking the new General
Manager to perform at a level above General Manager
Washington, which she does not think is bad. She
believes now is a good time to make the changes
before there is a new General Manager.
Director Anderson thinks the idea of creating a model
and implementing a structure to encourage graduation
from the DBE/SBE program is great. She would like to
see people graduate and become bigger and better
businesses; however, the General Manager has no
control over the business plans of our DBE/SBE
contractors. Also, there is additional oversight to these
programs from CDOT and the City of Denver.

Director James thinks it is too late in the game to be
considering something like this. He said that however
much he agrees that pursuing this is a good idea it does
not belong in the goals this specifically.

Discussion:

Director Tobiassen stated that he would be voting no.
He said that much of the decision to fund a fiscally
sustainable low-income fare program comes back to the
Board. It really depends on how much the Board is
willing to take from one area to give to the program.
He does not feel this is something the General Manager
can control.
Director Hoy reminded everyone that there is a task
force currently working on this issue. He thinks it
would be nice to let them do their due diligence and
come back to the Board with a recommendation. He
believes this will work itself out as the dialog continues.

XVI. New Business
Director Lubow mentioned that there had been several very long meetings this month.
She pointed out that during the Executive Committee Meeting there was some discussion
that the meetings are too long; however, she is concerned that RTD is moving into an
incredibly busy year next year with the work already starting. To her what is better than
saying the meetings are too long is to ask how to deal with the work coming the Board’s
way. She suggested that if there is a huge amount of work for one week perhaps the
Board should think about the idea of having another meeting. She stated that she wants
to get the work done.
Director Menten agreed with Director Lubow. She felt the Board was really short changed
on the pass program discussion last week and it was just kicked down the road to the
Study Session. The Board needs to make sure they are doing the right things as elected
officials.
Director Menten shared with the Board that she had been receiving communications from
a woman, Amanda Chilton, who had been suspended from RTD property for trespassing.
She noted that Ms. Chilton was asking the Board and RTD for specific information. These
questions centered on incident reports and access to records. Chair Sisk stated that it is
terribly important that the Board does not become involved in a criminal process. Director
Menten said she would take her questions offline for John Tarbert, Acting Assistant
General Manager for Safety, Security and Facilities.

CFO/AGM,

&

Board Meeting Date: September 15, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.
BACKGROUND:
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in November 2014. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION:
Staff solicited the expertise, knowledge and recommendations of its investment advisor in reviewing the
current Policy. No changes are recommended this year other than updating some staff titles to reflect
the current organization chart.
The purpose of the Investment Policy (the “Policy”) of the Regional Transportation District ("RTD") is to
specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and systematic program for investments in
RTD’s operating and reserve funds. The Policy also provides for the investment of bond proceeds that
are authorized through bond resolutions or indentures of trust.
By following best practices with respect to the management of public funds, the primary objectives of
RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2) sufficient liquidity to meet
known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield (achieving a market rate of return). Although RTD must
legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1) it
has previously made a policy decision to implement its investment program in a more conservative
manner than is dictated by state statute through imposing stricter diversification limits.
A final version of the recommended policy is attached
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The Policy presents no negative financial impacts to RTD.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. The Board may authorize the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached. This is the
recommended alternative.

2. The Board may further revise the Policy.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement

The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:



Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:


Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

Attachment: Investment Policy FINAL 8-28-15 (2505 : Approval of Investment Policy)

1. PURPOSE

12.A.a

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.

The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to

2
Packet Pg. 89

Attachment: Investment Policy FINAL 8-28-15 (2505 : Approval of Investment Policy)

3.3 Yield

12.A.a

the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).

While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.

Packet Pg. 90

Attachment: Investment Policy FINAL 8-28-15 (2505 : Approval of Investment Policy)

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.

12.A.a

Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates
of indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America.
100% of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum
maturity for investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.

instruments of any Federal agency, instrumentality or United States governmentsponsored enterprise as described in CRS 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an “Agency” or
“Agencies”). Such securities shall be rated in one of the two highest rating categories (as
described above in the Credit Criteria section) by at least two NRSROs. No more than
75% of the Portfolio may be invested in Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities,
with no more than 25% being invested in a single issuer. Subordinate debt of any issuer
is not authorized. The maximum maturity for investments in Federal Agency and
Instrumentality Securities shall be limited to five years.

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,
diversification requirements, extraordinary events and other factors may be considered when
awarding investments.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized to provide investment services and it
shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from those authorized institutions and
firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary dealers reporting to the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

GM

Date:

September 3, 2015

Board Meeting Date: September 15, 2015

Subject:

Purchase Additional
Rail Vehicles

Seventeen

(17)

Light

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Siemens to purchase an
additional seventeen (17) Light Rail Vehicles and spare parts, at a cost not too exceed $64.5 million.
BACKGROUND
At the November 25, 2014 board meeting, the RTD Board authorized staff to begin negotiations with
Siemens to purchase twelve (12) expansion Light Rail Vehicles at a cost not too exceed $48million.
The vehicle specification was being reviewed and updated in the spring of 2015. The number of
additional LRV’s has increased by seventeen (17) due to the increased level of ridership demands
(cars added to existing consists) and the additional I-225/SE corridor extensions. Based on ongoing
correspondence with Siemens, we are negotiating a price for twenty-nine (29) vehicles at less than
$4million per vehicle which is much better than the original price point at twelve (12) vehicles. RTD
can realize a significant savings which would be in the best interest of the District.
DISCUSSION
The RTD Capitol Planning Team has analyzed and re-evaluated the current and future projections of
the Light Rail fleet demand. The evaluation has determined a reduction in the spare ratio to 5% in Q4
of 2017 with the existing fleet and initial vehicle deliveries. The requested additional vehicles will
return the fleet to a 17% spare ratio by Q4 of 2018. This is short of the industry standard spare ratio
of 20%. In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service
Delivery, including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Rail Operations requests to purchase a
total of twenty-nine (29) expansion Light Rail Vehicles in order to continue to provide the proper level
of service. Furthermore, adding these cars will provide the required number of spare vehicles needed
to properly maintain the existing fleet as it ages and preserves our service within the board-approved
service standards. Without the additional vehicles, RTD may be forced to open the new extensions
with lower service than has been projected. Each vehicle takes two (2) years to manufacture.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This acquisition is part of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) that was recently approved by the RTD
Board on August 18th, 2015. Funds are budgeted in years 2015 thru 2018. The funding for the
vehicles will be financed through the issuance of Certificates of Participation (COPS) that was
approved by the RTD Board in the July 28th, 2015 meeting. The COPS funding has been secured on
August 20th, 2015. Two (2) vehicles will be funded through Fastracks that has been recently
approved in the Annual Program Evaluations (APE). The remaining vehicles are funded through the
base system. Based on ongoing correspondence with Siemens, we are negotiating a price for twentynine (29) vehicles at less than $4million for each vehicle. RTD has included in this request the related
expenses, spare parts and a “Buy- America” audit, with on-site factory inspections during the vehicle
construction.

Packet Pg. 119

13.C

DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Siemens has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its
DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to finalize negotiations with Siemens to
execute a contract to purchase an additional seventeen (17) Light Rail vehicles in an amount
not to exceed the amount programmed in the SBP which is $64.5 million. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. Do not allow the General Manager to finalize negotiations with Siemens for the purchase of an
additional seventeen (17) Light Rail vehicles. This will delay the procurement process and
present a challenge to maintain the fleet, which is not in the best interest of the District.

Recommended EcoPass Pricing for 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
approves an 18.3 percent price increase for Business EcoPass and a 13.3 percent price increase for
Neighborhood EcoPass. These price increases are for 2016 contracts. In addition, it is recommended
that the current $2.50 DIA surcharge be eliminated for both the Business EcoPass and Neighborhood
EcoPass programs.
BACKGROUND
RTD staff has been working on an extensive Fare Study for the past year. The objective of the Fare
Study was to determine how to simplify RTD’s fare policies in an equitable and cost-effective manner to
better meet the needs of the District and its customers moving forward. In May 2015, the RTD Board of
Directors approved new fare policies that will go into effect on January 1, 2016. The new fare policies
adopted by the Board did not include any changes for pass program pricing.
The results of the Title VI equity analysis conducted as part of the May actions indicated that there were
Title VI concerns with the Business EcoPass program. Increases to Business and Neighborhood EcoPass
programs were not included in the recommendations that were adopted by the Board in May but staff
did communicate that commensurate price increases in the pass programs were assumed in the financial
projections and additional recommendations would be forthcoming.
Key members of the RTD Fare Study Task Force including several members of the Senior Leadership
Team began working closely with the Title VI Manager and General Counsel in May to better understand
the Title VI concerns related to the Business EcoPass program. This equity analysis suggested that
Business EcoPass riders are more likely to be non-minority or non-low income individuals than the RTD
ridership as a whole. In addition, the average per trip fare revenue generated from Business EcoPass was
less than the average fare paid by RTD passengers in general.
Therefore, the working group established the goal of developing a recommendation for Business EcoPass
pricing that would equalize the average fare paid among EcoPass riders and general RTD riders.
DISCUSSION
Staff described their current thinking to the Board in August which included a recommendation to
increase 2016 Business EcoPass contracts by 18.3 percent and Neighborhood EcoPass contracts by
14.4 percent. These price increases would result in EcoPass passengers having an average fare revenue
that was in line with the overall system average fare.
In addition, staff indicated that per the approach used to arrive at those increase levels it would make
sense to update the 2009 Board Policy for utilization based pricing of EcoPass with smart card data. The
2009 Board Policy is included as Attachment A. Per the methodology used to determine the percent

Packet Pg. 122

13.D

increase necessary to arrive at an average fare for EcoPass equal to the overall average fare, staff was
thinking that the 40 percent discount in the 2009 policy should be updated to 30 percent.
Staff then shared their thinking with stakeholders in advance of developing these final recommendations.
Many of the comments were focused on stakeholders feeling left out of the process. In addition, several
comments were provided that indicated there were other methods for analyzing pass program pricing
and how the increases should be related to the general fare increase.
Stakeholder feedback was considered in developing this final recommendation that includes an 18.3
percent price increase for Business EcoPass for 2016 contract and a 13.3 percent price increase for
neighborhood EcoPass. These increases will result in a projected average fare for Business EcoPass trips
that is equal to the average fare for all RTD passengers and will increase Neighborhood EcoPass pricing
in line with the overall fare increase adopted by the Board in May as Neighborhood EcoPass pricing was
not identified as having a current Title VI concern.
This recommendation does not include any changes to the 2009 Board Policy for future utilization based
pricing as staff is recommending that a 2016 Pass Program Working group be established. This working
group will include RTD staff as well as stakeholders from across the District. The working group will
define goals for pass programs as well as reevaluate the 2009 Board policy for utilization based pricing
to incorporate the new fare structure and average fare analysis once smart card tap data is available. In
addition, it is recommended that this group work closely with the Affordable Fares Task Force to better
understand the relationship between pass programs and the desire for more affordable income based
fares.
One of the concerns that we heard from stakeholders was that an 18.3 percent increase is a large
increase when the contracts are paid in full at the beginning of the year. To help alleviate these concerns
staff will introduce two new contract payment options that will give the businesses flexibility for making
payments over the course of the year. Businesses will be able to pay quarterly with the addition of a 1
percent administrative fee or pay semiannually with no additional fees.
Stakeholders also expressed concerns about the Neighborhood EcoPass prices increasing more than the
general fare increase. As noted above, since the original equity analysis did not identify concerns with
the Neighborhood EcoPass program, staff is recommending that the Neighborhood EcoPass contracts for
2016 be increased by the same percent as the general fare increase (13.3 percent). The new contract
payment options will also apply to Neighborhood EcoPass contracts.
As required by FTA for all fare changes, a Title VI equity analysis has been completed for the
recommendations included in this Board report. With the 18.3 percent increase for Business EcoPass and
the 13.3 percent increase for Neighborhood EcoPass, no Title VI equity concerns were found with the
recommended changes per the RTD Board adopted Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy.
The equity analysis will be submitted to FTA.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The fare policies adopted in May were forecast to generate enough revenue to meet the $131.3 million
revenue target identified for 2016 in the Board adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). Those revenue
forecasts included price increases for both the Business and Neighborhood EcoPass programs consistent
with the general fare increase. The current recommendation for Business EcoPass is to increase 2016
contracts by 18.3 percent instead of 13.3 percent. This additional increase in EcoPass pricing is
anticipated to generate approximately $1 million in additional farebox revenue.

ALTERNATIVES
1) Adopt an 18.3 percent price increase for Business EcoPass and a 13.3 percent price increase for
Neighborhood EcoPass for 2016 contracts. Eliminate the current $2.50 DIA surcharge from both the
Business and Neighborhood EcoPass programs. This is the recommended alternative.
2) Adopt an 18.3 percent price increase for Business EcoPass but phase it in over two years with a
13.3 percent price increase for 2016 contracts and an additional 4.4 percent price increase for 2017
contracts. Adopt a 13.3 percent price increase for Neighborhood EcoPass contracts all to be applied
in 2016. Eliminate the current $2.50 DIA surcharge from both the Business and Neighborhood
EcoPass programs. This is not recommended because it does not immediately address the Title VI
concerns regarding Business EcoPass passengers being more heavily subsidized than RTD riders in
general.
3) Adopt a 13.3 percent price increase for both Business and Neighborhood EcoPass for 2016
contracts. Eliminate the current $2.50 DIA surcharge from both the Business and Neighborhood
EcoPass programs. This is not recommended because it does not address the Title VI concerns
regarding Business EcoPass passengers being more heavily subsidized than RTD riders in general.

INFO

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board accept the
recommendations of the RTD Pass Committee for pricing of the Eco Pass and Neighborhood Pass
programs as outlined in Attachments A and B, to be implemented following the availability of
utilization data from smart cards. In addition, lift the current moratorium on new and expanded
contracts in the Neighborhood Pass program as described in Attachment B.
BACKGROUND
The RTD Pass Program Committee began meeting in May 2009. The purpose of the committee was
to develop viable pricing formulas for RTD Eco Pass and Neighborhood pass programs to be used at
such time as smart card data is available to provide actual utilization data. The committee was
comprised of four members of the RTD Board and four external representatives. The committee
met six times, with the last meeting held on September 30.
A joint staff working group, comprised of representatives from RTD, the city of Boulder, Boulder
County and the University of Colorado, was charged with developing a proposed pricing structure
for the business Eco Pass and the Neighborhood Pass programs that could be forwarded to the
Pass Program Committee for consideration.
DISCUSSION
The joint staff working group met a number of times to discuss the factors that should be
considered in pricing unlimited access pass programs as well as the appropriate level of discount
within RTD’s overall fare structure. After considerable discussion, the group developed a set of
recommendations for both the business Eco Pass and the Neighborhood Pass. Those
recommendations were forwarded to the Pass Program Committee and were endorsed by that
committee. The key recommendations for each program are outlined in Attachments A and B, along
with summaries of the key similarities and differences from the current pricing structure.

The financial impact of the proposed changes to pricing formulas for Eco Pass and Neighborhood
Pass will not be known until such time as utilization data from smart cards are available and used
for pricing the programs. In general, the pricing formulas as proposed will for the first time be
based on the value of service used by pass holders.

Packet Pg. 126

13.D.a

This proposed pricing structure as recommended by the RTD Pass Program Committee is consistent with
the two primary philosophies of the Eco Pass Program established by the committee: 1) that it is
financially sustainable to RTD, and 2) that it serves to increase transit ridership.
The pricing model proposed is a revenue based approach that used RTD’s existing fare structure and the
levels of discounts available through various fare media as the basis upon which the unlimited access
pass programs could be priced. The availability of ridership data through the use of smart cards will, for
the first time, give RTD the opportunity to price the Eco Pass Program based on actual ridership data.
A summary of the key recommendations and a broad overview of the primary similarities and
differences of the existing and proposed Eco Pass pricing structures are outlined below.
Key Recommendations
•
•
•

•

•

•
•

No changes to the Eco Pass pricing structure would be implemented until after adequate smart
card ridership data are available, unless there is a general RTD fare increase.
Continue to use the four current services level areas (SLA’s) as part of the pricing structure, but
use four levels of employer size (1-24, 25-99, 100-499 and 500+).
Continue to use a matrix of employer size and SLA to determine price. The value of trips taken
by all companies within a cell of the matrix will be used to determine the price for that cell. A 40
percent discount will be applied to the cash value of those trips which will be divided by the
total number of employees within that cell to determine a per employee price. This pricing
approach will be revisited for possible adjustments after three full years of smart card data are
available.
During the first two years of the new pricing structure, no company’s contract amount will
increase by more than 10 percent, unless there is a general fare increase. This limit does not
apply to contract minimums.
Contract minimums will use a blended rate that will use actual ridership data by service type
within an SLA to compute the cost of a hypothetical annual pass that reflects the actual
proportions of local, express and regional use. The contract minimum would be twice that
blended cost.
The $5 surcharge for trips to DIA will be eliminated when the new pricing structure is
implemented.
When the new pricing structure is implemented, call-n-Ride service areas will revert to SLA A,
except in cases where the 25+ trip threshold is met.

Differences
• The existing pricing structure was developed in 1990 and was based on company location,
company size and estimated ridership. The proposed pricing structure will still use company
location and size, but will use smart card data to determine actual ridership and the value of
trips taken.
• The existing structure uses a pricing matrix that has 20 cells, representing four SLA’s and five
different ranges of company size. The proposed structure will still use four SLAs but will have
only four different ranges of company size.
• The proposed structure will use actual utilization data to determine the value of trips taken by
all employees of companies within a pricing cell. A 40% discount would then be applied to the
cash fare value of those trips. The result will then be divided by the total number of employees
in that pricing cell to determine the following year’s per employee rate. The 40% discount rate is
in line with discounts offered through other RTD pass products and reflects the benefits that
accrue to RTD from the Eco Pass Program.
• The current contract minimums are approximately the cost of one annual pass for local, express
or regional fares, depending on SLA. The proposed contract minimum will use a blended rate
that will use actual ridership data by service type within an SLA to compute the cost of a
hypothetical annual pass that reflects the actual proportions of local, express and regional use.
The contract minimum would be twice that blended cost.

Attachment: RTD Pass Program Attachment A (2523 : Recommended EcoPass Pricing for 2016)

Similarities
• Both the existing and proposed pricing structures use the underlying premise that all employees
within a company are paid for and all are eligible to receive an Eco Pass.
• Both pricing structures use the size of the employer and the employer’s location (called Service
Level Areas or SLAs) to determine pricing level.
• Both pricing structures have contract minimums.

Key Recommendations
•

•

•

•

•
•
•

For neighborhoods currently participating in the program, no changes to the Neighborhood Eco
Pass pricing structure would be implemented until after adequate smart card ridership data are
available, unless there is a general RTD fare increase.
Neighborhoods will continue to be defined by contiguous blocks as the basis for pricing.
The value of trips taken by all residents within a contractually defined neighborhood will be
used as the basis to determine the following year’s price for that neighborhood. A 40 percent
discount will be applied to the cash value of those trips which will be divided by the total
number of households within that neighborhood to determine the per household price. This
pricing approach will be revisited for possible adjustments after three full years of smart card
data are available.
During the first two years of the new pricing structure, any increase to a neighborhood’s
contract price will be by no more than 33 percent of the difference between the smart card
calculated price and the pre smart card price, unless there is a general fare increase.
Contract minimums for each neighborhood will be set at $5,000 and a minimum of 40
households. Any existing neighborhood with less than 40 households will be grandfathered from
this requirement.
The $5 surcharge for trips to DIA will be eliminated when the new pricing structure is
implemented.
Prices for new neighborhood wishing to enter the program will be based a survey of existing
ridership patterns. The survey may be calibrated over time as smart card data are available.
Lift the moratorium on new or expanding neighborhoods in recognition of a $10,000 financial
contribution from the city of Boulder and the fact that smart card data will be available in future

Similarities
• Both the existing and proposed pricing structures use the underlying premise that all residences
within a geographically defined neighborhood are paid for and all are eligible to receive a
Neighborhood Eco Pass.
• Under both the existing and proposed pricing structures, survey results will be used to establish
the first year price for a new neighborhood joining the program.
• Both pricing structures have contract minimums.
Differences
• The existing pricing structure within the city of Boulder was developed in 1999 and was based
on travel diary information. The proposed pricing structure will use smart card data to
determine actual ridership and the value of trips taken, apply a 40 percent discount to that
amount, then divide by the number of households in the neighborhood to determine the per
household rate. The 40% discount rate is in line with discounts offered through other RTD pass
products and reflects the benefits that accrue to RTD from the Eco Pass Program.
• The current contract minimums are $5,600 per neighborhood. The new contract minimums for
each neighborhood will be set at $5,000 and a minimum of 40 households. Any existing
neighborhood with less than 40 households will be grandfathered from this requirement.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to amend
the SumTotal Systems, LLC (Contract Number 14D0002) to increase by $290,933.23 the contract
amount not-to-exceed limit from $343,003.80 to a total contract amount of $633,937.03.
BACKGROUND
RTD’s current union payroll time tracking (Hardware and Software) system, TruTrack, is over ten-years
old and has passed its end-of-life. The TruTrack brand is now known as SumTotal. Because of its age
and operations, this system has presented a range of continued challenges to RTD:
 The current system is unstable, difficult to support and has had multiple outages, at times
occurring daily.
 Replacement hardware does not exist to continue to repair the onsite (RTD) hosted system.
 Replacement time clocks are no longer available.
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, a manual time tracking and payroll generation effort
spanning multiple work groups would be required.
Early in 2014 it was determined, in consultation with the Business Unit, that replacement of the existing
TruTrack system was absolutely necessary to assure the future ability to meet union payroll. There was
significant concern that the TruTrack system would not survive the length of time required for the
normal open procurement process. RTD’s union payroll structure is extremely complex and the existing
TruTrack system was configured to address all of these unique practices. In addition, there was a due
diligence review of available alternative technical solutions, concluding the cloud base SumTotal product
was the logical replacement system. With that, a sole sourced contract was advanced with SumTotal
(May 2014) to replace TruTrack with SumTotal’s new Workforce Management (WFM) hosted time
tracking system. The sole source was approved and the original bid was within the General Manager’s
contract authority. The project kicked-off July 30, 2014 with SumTotal project team arriving at RTD.
RTD’s union payroll system will be hosted at SumTotal’s datacenter. General information on this
service:
 Located in Columbus, Ohio
 Exceeds Tier IV facility requirements
 SSAE 16 certified operations; DOD and HIPAA certified and ISO 27001:2005 certified facility
 Internet connections to multiple Tier-1 ISP backbones
 Servers monitored every 5 minutes

13.E




Redundant high-capacity power supplies. UPS systems and standby diesel generators capable
of supporting the site indefinitely.
SumTotal hosts over 1,600 customers operating globally

SumTotal has an established security program that has had preliminary RTD review, further review is
underway and this will be followed by regular monitoring of this hosting service.
DISCUSSION
Late last year as the functional requirements were in development, it became apparent the “out-of-thebox” SumTotal system would not fully address the unique union payroll needs. In the spring of this
year, the project was stopped by RTD, pending confirmation that all needed functionality was fully
identified and documented, understood by the vendor and the initial and life-cycle costs to implement
were known. This extremely detailed effort included the staff from payroll, materials management, and
IT technical and business analyst staff. From this analysis, twenty-one unique customizations were
identified as necessary to provide for each element of the union agreement. To make these
customizations SumTotal submitted a requested contract modification for the additional funds. The
authority increase also addresses future maintenance expenses. If approved, the modifications will be
done during the fall, testing will be conducted late this year into early next year and with normal end-ofyear activities the go-live will be April of 2016.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The additional cost will be met by existing capital and operational budgets. These expenditures are not
a diversion from other efforts or assignments.
ALTERNATIVES
Three alternatives were considered:


Continue with Existing Contract and Accept the Completion Proposal
The current staff assigned by SumTotal has aggressively worked with RTD to understand and
document the complete set of requirements and needed outcomes. They provided a proposal to
bring closure to this deployment. In that the system is hosted in the cloud, RTD and SumTotal
will have a long-term relationship.
SumTotal will be responsible for maintaining the system and minimizing downtime of the system;
responsible for implementing a failover plan; with the hosted system RTD should realize
operational cost savings over the life of the system. SumTotal now understands the full breath
and complexity of RTD’s union payroll structure.



Terminate Contract and Pursue an Open Procurement for a Replacement System
This alternative would terminate the SumTotal contract. In all likelihood this would require
eighteen-months to two-years to procure, develop, and deploy a fully functional replacement
system. During this time, the RTD hosted TruTrack system will need to remain operational. This
could also be followed by legal action to recover some portion of expense from the unsuccessful
attempt at deploying the SumTotal system. e.g. return of time clocks.

Packet Pg. 146

13.E

During the procurement and implementation of the new system the legacy system must continue
in operations. Staff has considerable reservations that the system could remain viable for 18
additional months. It is possible that an open procurement in addition to taking nearly two-years
may cost more than the cumulative cost with this contract increase. In addition, we would lose
the sunk cost of $343,000.


Terminate Contract and Revert to TruTrack System
This is not a sustainable option as this existing system will fail, it is a matter of when. This
option is not viable.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to execute a
five-year contract with Infax, Incorporated (Contract Number 15FH003) in the amount of
$1,788,655.39.
BACKGROUND
RTD uses Programmable Information Displays (PIDs) including monitors and LED signs, to disseminate
information to its riders on travel status. RTD’s current system uses monitors at a number of venues
including Denver Union Station, Civic Center Station, Boulder Station, Boulder Junction at Depot Square
and the Denver International Airport (DIA). There are also LED signs throughout the region.
These displays provide scheduled departure information for RTD fixed route service and light rail. With
the advancement of Real-Time Traveler information, in the future these data will be extended into the
PIDs system.
The current system was deployed over six-years ago, functions well and has been reliable. With the
Fastrack expansion, desire for additional functionality (e.g. real-time information) and the importance of
this rider service, a procurement was released to extend, enhance and/or replace in-kind the system.
DISCUSSION
RTD released procurement Request for Proposal (RFP) No. 15FH003, it was issued May 20, 2015 to
provide for expansion of RTD’s Programmable Information Display System (PIDs). The contract has a
6% DBE participation requirement. A well-attended vendor briefing was held June 2. The proposal
period closed June 26 and two proposals were received.
One of the vendors did not comply with the Buy America contract requirement, nor appropriately
advanced associated waiver provisions and was disqualified. Staff conducted a careful and through
review of the proposal of the remaining vendor, Infax, Incorporated. Infax is the incumbent PIDs
provider. The panel specifically considered:
 System functionality and use
 Proposed Work Program
 History of firm conducting similar assignments
 Qualifications of key staff
 DBE participation
 Price

The review panel met with Infax representatives. The panel unanimously recommended selection of the
Infax base of the following findings:
 Infax had a considerable background of similar systems in transit, air transport and judicial facilities.
 The proposed staff was well versed in the system and had prior working experience with RTD.
 The proposed system was an enhancement of RTD’s current system and was a cost effective move
to address future needs.
 The proposed system and services addressed all RFP requirements.
 Infax had a proven record working with the proposed DBE firm Servitech, Inc. at RTD and other
locations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract is structured with a series of options that support current operations and future needs.
While the overall contract authority is for $1,788,655.39, the first set of executed options will address:
support and/or provisioning of new or additional signage at DUS, full implementation at Boulder Junction
at Depot Square, Oak Street Station, and US 36. The option also includes system licensing and an
extended warranty. This first option is primarily funded by a federal grant that does include a local
match and operating funds will address future warranty expense. The total cost of the first set of
options is $681,510.99.
Subsequent options address Fastracks, integration of real-time information, and possible replacement of
current light rail platform signage. Executing these options will be made based on future needs and will
be funded through the operating and SBP budgets. Further option executions are exclusively at the
discretion of RTD and there is no guarantee of additional assignments.
ALTERNATIVES
The available alternatives include:
 Execute the Infax agreement. Infax has a proven record in this space, is financially
competitive and meets the agency needs. Executing the Infax agreement is staff’s
recommendation.
 Extend the current system using RTD staff. Current staff levels are inadequate to address the
anticipated demands. Further the content system contains proprietary software that cannot
be modified directly by RTD.
