UNANIMOUS CONSENT
A. Free Rides for Members of the Military
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free rides on RTD
for active duty members of the United States Military should be extended from the presently

Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary
to award both option years (years 4 and 5) for a kiosk systems support contractor to Counter
