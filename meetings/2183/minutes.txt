November Board Meeting Review
Phil Washington, Interim General Manager, reviewed the Board action items for
the November agenda. Director Martinez asked if the vendor fees were
reflected in the 2010 budget. Members of the committee indicated yes and
that Robert had shared that in the F&A Committee meeting. There was also a
question about what happens to the money that is awarded under work orders
if not spent. Interim General Manager Phil Washington indicated it goes back
into the general funds.
Director Daly inquired about if any revisions were made to the 2010 budget as
a result of the arbitrator decision ruling that most represented employees will
receive a $.15 increase in March 2011, with some receiving $1.00 increases.
A lump sum will also be distributed if 12-month sales tax receipts rise at least
2% above 2008 levels. Phil Washington explained this was received too late
to be included in the budget but that this change can be incorporated easily in
an amended budget in 2010. Interim General Manager Phil Washington also
indicated that he has gotten a number of questions on the arbitration findings
from the represented employees and he intends to publish a document that
will provide a full explanation.
Some of the Board members expressed concern over the impact of the
arbitrator’s decision on Holman’s Carter position as ATU President and shared
their support of him. We believe he should still be in good standing.



Acquisition of Property at Mineral Light Rail Station; 4-Car Platform
Extension (From Executive Session)

It was noted that an executive session was requested to discuss C.R.S. 246-402(4)(f) Personnel Matters. GM Committee Chair Busck provided this
explanation below.
II.

GM Transition Team Status
GM Committee Chair Busck shared that the General Manager Search
Committee had reduced the number down to about six of what they consider
viable candidates. Information on each of these candidates would be included
in the Board packet and will be discussed in the executive session on
November 17th. The goal is to identify some group of candidates that the
Board members want to interview as candidates.

III.

Description of Duties for Board Executive Committee Officers
Vice-Chair Martinez shared that he had made this request for information after
a number of inquiries/comments from people about the process used to select
the Executive Committee. This is intended as information especially to the new
Board members, on what the duties and expectations are of the Executive
Committee officers. Director Chacon added this helps to address the issues
posed by using a slate instead of letting each person decide on if they want to
run. Vice-Chair Martinez indicated that he and 2 nd Vice-Chair Busck had met to
discuss this issue and feel that a process improvement they would like to
present for 2010 is to set up a calendar where in November (after the
elections), Board members will email their interest in an Executive officer
position to the Board office . This can be a nominating or self-selection process
but it would minimize the risk of pushing the Board to a 2-party system which
could affect how the Board votes on various issues. 2nd Vice Chair Busck added
that the Executive Committee officer’s job description was the first step in this
process.
He agreed with the premise presented by Director Brohl for a process that is
open and transparent.
Director Daly queried if language on “no slates” should be placed in the Bylaws.
The Committee felt it would be more effective if the Board just came away with
some gentleman agreements about this item. Director Daly wanted it noted
that the process should work even for Executive officers who will be stepping
down.

Other Matters
 Interim General Manager Phil Washington displayed the plaque that we
want to give to Ron Dodsworth, AGM. This is not a retirement plaque
and will be presented in the Board meeting as a special recognition.
 Interim General Manager shared that a short time ago, the City and
County of Denver issued a proclamation on railroads that was passed.
The railroads, especially BN, were offended by this proclamation. RTD
had written a letter to the City and County of Denver stating we are
working cooperatively with them on a number of issues and listed some
of our outstanding items. The railroad was appreciative of this letter of
support.
 Interim General Manager Phil Washington will be presenting with his
senior staff the state of the district address in the November 24 study
session. They will present the top 3 achievements in 2009, the top 3
goals for 2010 and the top 3 challenges. Interim General Manager
Washington expressed he feels this should be an annual event.
Director Tayer will miss this session but asked if this could be taped and
recorded.

V.

Meeting agendas and timelines—The Committee expressed concerns that
the committee meetings agendas are too long and should be addressed.
Some of the actions include moving some items to study sessions as
appropriate, having committee chairs work together to shorten their
agendas when it appears to be too full, Interim General Manager working
with his staff to focus on the most important items, etc. It is incumbent
of each Committee Chair to be cognizant of time, move the agenda along
but also sensitive to when Board members have a strong need to express
their voice on an issue. Committees are the best place for this to occur
versus the Board meeting.
Cell Phone and telephone usage during meetings—Director Chacon noted
it is disrespectful to the staff, contractors and other presenters when
Board members are texting, using cell phones and obviously not focused
on what is being presented. She acknowledged herself as a major
offender but felt the Board need to start exercising more control over this
issue.
Chair Kemp indicated this is a housekeeping item and Committee Chairs
will be instructed to make such an announcement about turning cell
phones on vibrate or step outside the area if they need to use at the
beginning of each meeting.

Adjournment
The meeting adjourned at 1:05 p.m.
