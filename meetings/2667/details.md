#### 1. Construction Award for IFB 37-DH 001. Customer Care Call Center and Treasury Repair Facility.

It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to AD Miller Services in the amount not-to-exceed of $5,627,730 for the New Customer Care Call Center and Treasury Repair Facility project. Funding for this contract is included in the 2017 Amended Budget. It is further recommended that the General Manager or his designee be authorized to issue contract amendments in the total amount not-to-exceed the remaining approved project budget of $845,393 as needed.

Motion:               Director Tisdale made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the July 15, 2017 Board Meeting.

Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, introduced Robin McIntosh and Richard Rost to discuss this item with the Board.

Robin McIntosh, Senior Manager of Facilities, stated that he was acting in two roles: as a fill in for Henry Stopplecamp and as the Senior Manager of Facilities.  He explained that RTD needs to regroup, and staff is asking for the funds to build the new Call Center and Treasury because the current space is limited and employees are busting at the seams.

Director Francone asked if the total construction amount was $6,473,699 as there were two separate amounts listed.

Richard Rost, Facilities Engineering Manager, stated that the contract award amount was $5,627,730 and the $845,393 balance of the project budget would be used for contingency, furniture, and anything else that might require additional funds.

Director Solano asked where this facility was located.

Mr. McIntosh remarked that staff calls it the 711 building because it is at 711 W. 31st Avenue and it is located near 31st and Fox, near the intersection of 31st Avenue and Park Avenue West.

Committee Chair Lubow commented that in the Board Report three contenders were listed and the only information indicated for each vendor was their bid price.  She further asked why AD Miller Services was chosen as that information was not included.

Mr. Rost stated that the action item was based on an Invitation for Bid (IFB), not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  He added that no pre-qualifications were needed, so staff sought the lowest cost.

General Manager Genova stated that there are two types of procurement methods: IFB or RFP.  He said that RFP’s are mainly for design/build and professional services to get the best value.  He noted that IFB’s are for construction only, and no other professional services are attached.

Committee Chair Lubow remarked that this is a large sum of money and it is being decided by the difference of a few thousand dollars, which seems unusual.

Mr. Van Meter explained that having three bids in close range demonstrated that the design was well specified.

Director Deadwyler asked if any of the firms considered were Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE).

Mr. Rost noted that RTD’s DBE goal was 12% and AD Miller Services proposed 25%.

Director Broom asked if staff knows that a contractor usually performs subpar, would they still accept a bid from that vendor if they are the lowest.

Mr. Rost stated that RTD had not used AD Miller Services before, but there is a process in place to review their work afterwards to determine if they will be used again in the future for other projects.

Mr. McIntosh commented that RTD makes sure that vendors meet certain criteria, and if they do not, staff will not award them the job they have bid on.

Director Folska inquired if the location of this facility was in the way of the proposed I-70 expansion.

General Manager Genova stated that it was not in the direct area of the expansion and it would not be impacted.

Director Folska inquired as to what would happen if the contractor did not perform to RTD’s specifications.

Mr. Rost stated that it would be no different from any other RTD contract.  He added that staff must allow the contractor to perform, and then document everything if they did not.  He further added that there would be provisions in the contract if they did not.

Director Folska remarked that she is concerned about awarding a contract to any vendor unless there is a plan B, and a contingency plan in place.

Mr. Rost noted that this contract would have a performance bond in place.

Director Sisk commented that he agrees with Director Francone’s concerns about the amount of funds for contingency and that it appears to be outside of the norm.

Mr. Rost stated that the current estimate for furniture is $350,000, but staff must also be prepared to deal with any unforeseen issues or problems.  He added that staff does not anticipate spending all of the funds, but if there are funds available, the General Manager will have the authority to spend it.

Director Deadwyler commented that the explanation Mr. Rost provided made her uncomfortable.  She added that because of the cost of the building, the extra $845,393 needs to come before the Board before it is spent.

Committee Chair Lubow asked if Director Deadwyler wanted to amend the motion.

Director Deadwyler said yes.

Motion to

Amend:              Director Deadwyler made the motion to divide the question on the Construction Award for IFB 37-DH 001 Customer Care Call Center and Treasury Repair Facility by separating the contract amount from the contingency amount.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, stated that the motion made by Director Deadwyler is to separate the contract award amount of $5,627,730 from the contingency amount of $850,393 leaving the contract award without any contingency or change order capability.  He added that the second vote would include the funds for contingency, furnishings, and change orders.

General Manger Genova commented that any time RTD awards a contract it is for the contract value, which does not include contingency funds.  He added that the total contract budget for this project is $6,473,699, which was based off of staff’s internal cost estimate.  He further noted that, while the contract amount is $5,627,730, the positive aspect of having the additional $845,393 is that RTD would have the flexibility to amend the contract without stalling the project.

Committee Chair Lubow asked Director Deadwyler if she wanted to stay with her motion to amend.

Director Deadwyler commented yes, and no.

Director Deadwyler stated that she did not like the way the item was presented, and having the total project budget come before the Board in pieces has caused confusion, not just to her.

Director Walker remarked that he would vote no on the division of the question because contractors should not have to wait a month before the Board votes on a decision.  He noted that the contingency built into the project budget is for change orders, unexpected environmental or structure issues, and other amounts needed to cover items outside of the project scope.  He added that, based on his experience in construction for the past 11 years, staff presented this the best way possible.

Director Anderson agreed with Director Walker and stated that at this time staff does not know what is in that building and, considering its age, who knows what staff will find when the work begins.

Mr. Asphaug added that the motion is to separate the two funds.  He added that his concern is that if the vote to award the contract amount passes, but the vote for the contingency fund fails, there will be a stalled project.

Director Mihalik stated that it may be beneficial if staff could elaborate on other factors that need to be considered.

Mr. Rost remarked that the building is an existing facility that was built in the 1940’s.  He noted that while surveys have been completed on the site, staff will not know about all of the potential issues until the work begins.

Chair Hoy explained that this is a $6.4 million project and staff received a bid for $5.6 million.  He noted that staff will have a budget allotment of $6.4 million and there are a lot of items that the contractor is not providing.  He agreed with Director Walker and said that the Board cannot stall work.  He asked staff to provide final project totals once all of the work is completed so that the Board would have a better understanding of the total project costs.  He added that he would not vote for the motion to divide the question.

Director Tisdale stated that he would vote no on the division, and yes on the original motion.  He added that the language of the motion is confusing and could have been presented better.

Director Williams thanked staff for the work they have done on this item and added that she was not in favor of separating the amounts, so she would not vote in favor of the division.

Director Francone explained that the Board has a better understanding of the contingency amount and the distribution and added that the Board struggled with the language of this item.  She added that if the language had been clearer, it would have helped.

Director Deadwyler remarked that she understood the item better, and she would be voting against her own motion, or would withdraw it.  She asked staff to do a better job of ensuring that the Board understands where all of the funds will be spent in the future.

Mr. Asphaug noted that if there was unanimous consent, the motion to divide the question could be withdrawn.

Committee Chair Lubow asked the Directors for verbal confirmation that they agreed to withdraw the motion by Director Deadwyler.  She noted that every Director was in agreement, so the motion was withdrawn.

Director Menten noted that RTD had property which was acquired with the University of Colorado A line near 40th and Smith Road.  She asked if that property would eventually be sold.

General Manager Genova stated that is a likely possibility, but he would research the status of that property and report back to the Board.

Director Archuleta called the question.

Committee Chair Lubow stated that the Board was voting on the original motion.  She asked Directors Folska, Menten, and Sisk for their votes, and all voted in favor of the item.

Committee Chair Lubow declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. Pass Program Study

Mr. Van Meter said that at this point in time the Pass Program Study might seem a bit muddy, but through the process there will be clarity.  He noted that staff is making great progress and Michael Washington would be joining him for this presentation.

Michael Washington, Transit Equity Manager, stated that the Pass Program working group had met three times so far.  He added that staff had launched a web page to be transparent with RTD’s constituents in an effort to help them understand the process and what was involved in the study.  He noted that meeting agendas and minutes would be posted, including any presentations offered during the working group meetings.  He commented that Four Nines Technologies (FNT) was selected as the technical consultant to assist staff with revenue modeling and ridership figures from the options considered by the working group in order to help them determine a final recommendation for the Board’s consideration.  He noted that FNT was made up of the same group that lead RTD’s fare study in 2014-2015.

Mr. Washington said that the working group meetings have been included on the two-week calendar and public comment is allowed at the beginning of each meeting.  He remarked that the meetings are being convened throughout the district at a different location each time.  He commented that the first meeting occurred downtown at the Denver Metro Chamber’s office, the second meeting was at the Boulder County Commissioners office, and the third meeting was at the Shorter Community AME Church in the Park Hill neighborhood of Denver.  He stated that the first meeting introduced the working group members to one another and to the task at hand.

Mr. Washington noted that at the first meeting the group discussed:

- Desired outcomes such as equity, increase transit mode share, sustainability, simplifying access to programs, straightforward and transparent price calculations, SBP targets, and the appeal to all demographics.

- Shared values such as using transit to advance economic needs, protecting the environment, improve mobility, and optimizing land use

Mr. Washington stated that the second meeting was the first in which several members of the public attended.  He added that the General Manager was also there and reaffirmed the need for a fiscally sustainable recommendation.  He noted that public comments at that meeting centered on the value of the various pass programs, and questioned how to continue the pass program success in the future.

Mr. Washington remarked that staff presented the current state of the pass program portfolio and:

- Summarized revenue, pass distribution and administration by the pass program

- Introduced tap date for Eco, NECO, and College passes

He further noted that Boulder County presented the approach that Boulder government, businesses, and neighborhoods have taken to access, administration, and promotion of pass programs.

Mr. Washington commented that at the third meeting, the group focused on the future and considered concepts and options that they would like to explore.  He noted that the next meeting would occur on July 25th at the Adams County Western Service Center at 1:00 p.m. and reminded the Board that the final report would not be available until the first quarter of 2018.

Director Francone asked if she could get a list of the working group members offline.  She added that the Colorado School of Mines has been asking for the college pass program data and asked staff to provide that to them.  Lastly, she inquired as to when meetings had been scheduled in Highlands Ranch, Golden, Evergreen, and Conifer.

Mr. Washington stated that meetings are still being planned, but staff anticipates having meetings in those locations.

Director Deadwyler asked how much had been budgeted for this study.

Mr. Washington commented that the study was budgeted at $205,000.

Director Menten thanked staff for publishing the agendas, minutes, and presentations for the pass program working group meetings.

Director Sisk expressed his appreciation of staff for their outreach efforts.

Committee Chair Lubow stated that the business model of Eco-Passes seems to be inequitable, and with high school students not being able to get an equivalent, that inequity needs to be addressed.

Mr. Washington stated that is one of the reasons that the pass program working group is examining the different models.  He remarked that one item this group will create are white papers to discuss the differences between the various programs.

Director Anderson commented that at one time staff had presented the Board with a chart outlining the cost estimates of the Eco-Pass and the true cost of the program.  She asked staff to provide that chart again as a refresher.

General Manager Genova remarked that the day before, Mayor Hancock of Denver gave his State of the City address.  He noted that Mayor Hancock stated that the city would be providing free passes to 1,500 students.  He explained that the City and County of Denver purchased 1500 smart cards with a stored value to provide to the students and had paid the regular price for the smart cards.  He wanted to make sure it was clear to other jurisdictions and mayors that these cards were paid for.

##### a. Pass Program Study Update  - PCPFC Meeting - 7-11-2017

### D. Other Matters

Director Francone stated that she has heard rave reviews for the smart cards and everyone she has talked to has loved it and is excited about the program.

Director Francone then asked for an update on Mobility Choice.

Mr. Van Meter said that the three agencies, Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG), and RTD are drafting a memorandum of understanding (MOU).  He stated that CDOT, through their procurement process is working to create the scope of work.  He added that his staff along with the General Manager had reviewed some material earlier in the day, and they are all taking the Board’s direction seriously.  He noted that questions regarding the MOU should be directed towards General Counsel.

General Manager Genova noted that some of the items included in the MOU included having the meetings open to the public, creating a mobility choice website, and having meeting dates, agendas, and minutes available online.

Director Folska commented that Mr. Van Meter only mentioned three entities, and she thought there were four involved.

Mr. Van Meter explained that the funds from the public sector entities are managed separately from the Denver Metro Chamber’s funds.

Director Williams said that she ran into someone that day who received their letter to participate in RTD’s new Advisory Committee for People with Disabilities (ACPD) and they were very excited.

Committee Chair Lubow stated that she wanted to discuss the RTD Board’s commitment to finishing FasTracks. She noted that she had been trying to get rail for her district for the past four and half years and her constituents want to see tangible progress.  She noted that merely saying RTD is committed does not move things along very much so she complied a list of proactive measures that the Board could do, which were include in a resolution that she read aloud.

Committee Chair Lubow asked the Board to commit to:

Depositing FasTracks moneys coming into or generated by RTD over and above Operations and Maintenance expenses and funds needed to cover operational shortfalls into the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA); and

Promoting the use of revenues generated or to be generated out of state or regional ballot initiatives or referenda initiated by other entities for transportation or related purposes, into appropriate FasTracks projects; and

Urging RTD staff to research cost-saving ideas for unfinished FasTracks corridor construction and operation and creative funding mechanisms for the same; and

When excess cash flow is generated or forecasted to be generated due to an excess of RTD revenue, from whatever source, over expenditures, promoting the investigation and possible use of that money for bonding purposes to finish the FasTracks corridors in an expeditious manner; and

Urging RTD staff to investigate the creation of "bus bridges" or other non- permanent, alternative transportation services to the proposed corridors, as temporary compensation for commuters in unfinished FasTracks corridor areas; and

Confirming that completing the FasTracks corridors is a priority for RTD creating and annually funding in appropriate amounts a FasTracks escrow account with monies intended to be saved and used for the purpose of completing FasTracks corridors; and

Requiring RTD staff to annually report to the Board pro-active steps taken pursuant to this Resolution to support expeditious completion of the FasTracks corridors.

Committee Chair Lubow said that this would show RTD is serious and is taking the steps needed to complete FasTracks.  She added that Director Tisdale had already provided her with constructive feedback, and Director Folska suggested that 2% of the operating budget be saved annually.  She explained that the purpose of the resolution at this time is to open it up for discussion and to get a sense on how to move forward.  She noted that this was not going to be voted on that evening but was being presented for discussion.

Director Anderson commented that she understands the desire to finish FasTracks.  She noted that it was a law voted upon by the people of the district and RTD is obligated to the citizens of the region to use those taxpayer funds in the way that the citizens wanted.  She added that Directors take an oath of office to ensure they take care of the responsibilities to their constituents.  She stated that Committee Chair Lubow is sincere with her concerns, but at the same time, RTD has a robust budget process that goes out six years.  She said that this resolution implies that RTD’s budgeting system is not any good, and this will fix all of the problems, which is not true.  She further added that this is not a good way to do public policy.  She explained that there is a law which requires RTD to take care of all of the FasTracks corridors and this resolution, while well intended, would undermine any future Board’s ability to make decisions based on need within the region.  She said that she would not be in favor of any resolution like this.

Director Tisdale said that he had an opportunity to review the resolution in advance and said, at some point, the topic is one that deserves more than a one-off conversation, because it is important to be able to demonstrate to RTD’s constituency that RTD is taking steps to move forward.  He noted that he would revise the resolution as to not tie anyone’s hands but stated that the resolution needs to be framed in a way that works under the law and within the reality that RTD is operating in.  He added that he would be in favor of a resolution because the public needs to hear the Board say they are committed to FasTracks.

Director Broom stated that he did not see the proposed resolution until today and suggested that it be put on the next meeting’s agenda.  He added that the Board should not tie its hands, and by stating a firm amount, the Board could be tying its hands and deferring maintenance in order to comply with the resolution.

Director Folska agreed with Director Tisdale and said that the public needs to hear that the Board is committed to finishing FasTracks.  She inquired as to the status of sales tax revenue that RTD receives from the sale of marijuana.

Mr. Asphaug said that he had nothing to report on marijuana tax collection at this time.  He noted that staff is continuing to meet to determine what options are available and that, if any Director wanted to discuss this item further, he would be happy to set up a call with them.

Director Sisk noted that, while statutory requirements are in place, it would be nice to have a statement from the Board reaffirming their commitment to FasTracks.  He said that this is not just a Boulder County or Longmont issue, it is about finishing all of FasTracks.

Committee Chair Lubow thanked everyone for their comments.  She said that one of the items of most importance to her was the escrow account.  She noted that it was worthy of discussion, and she does not presume that this Board would bind future Boards, but she sees this as an annual discussion.  She said that it is very important to discuss a fiscally sustainable annual contribution of a decent amount each year. She noted that item six seems to have the biggest contention, but the Board is discussing a commitment to people in regions that do not have their rail.

Chair Hoy said that item six was important to him, but for a different reason.  He said that it is a direct conflict with FISA and RTD would run into problems if staff needed to access that money and were not able to.  He noted that the Board hears comments that they need to make a commitment to the public, and he said that however RTD needs to do it, it needs to be done.  He commented that he would change the entire resolution to say that the Board is committed to finishing FasTracks.  He further noted that the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) would be presented soon and the Board should see what that document has before committing to the language in this resolution.

Director Walker said that RTD offers other services such as the Flatiron Flyer and the Bolt.  He added that locking money away in order to finish a project does not accomplish the goal of moving people efficiently and providing riders with options.

Director Anderson stated that Chair Hoy brought up an important part of the budget hearing process, which is the APE.  She suggested that Chair Hoy appoint an ad hoc committee after the APE presentation if the Board feels that there is still a need to publicly announce its support for completing FasTracks.

Committee Chair Lubow remarked that the escrow account in item six was intended to be used as a leverage fund.  She said that her hope was that it would be used to leverage funds from private sources to fund the unfunded corridors.

Committee Chair Lubow said that more work needed to be done on this, and she asked Director Tisdale to assist her in drafting a more palatable resolution.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Lubow adjourned the meeting at 7:15 p.m.
