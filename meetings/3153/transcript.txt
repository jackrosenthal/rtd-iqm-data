Special Board Meeting â€“ Installation/Swearing In
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --evening, everyone. I now call to order the Tuesday, January 5, 2021, RTD
special Board meeting to order. The record will reflect that we are convened as of 5:41 PM Mountain
Daylight Time. I would like to respectfully ask everyone connected to this call to mute your phones and to
set your bringers to silent.
Please note that under the current circumstances, the official meetings of the RTD Board of Directors are
being held remotely in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare. During this time, meetings will be
primarily audio recorded. The audio recordings, along with the unofficial minutes of the meeting, will be
posted as soon as practicable on the Board's website. You can visit rtd-denver.com and scroll to the
bottom of the page for the link to the Board of Directors page.
Directors and members of the staff, for the sake of the record, if you would like to be acknowledged
during tonight's proceedings, I would like to ask you to please raise your virtual hand, or, if you are on the
phone, announce your name and wait for me to call on you before proceeding to speak. Speaking out of
turn will only add confusion to the record and to the proceedings. Please note that at the appropriate time
during our discussion and voting processes later on in the evening, I will call on each Director in turn. So
please know that you're time to speak will come, and, if possible, please hold your comments until that
time.
I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the hard work of our RTD staff in preparation for
this meeting. The staff has been working diligently to figure out all of the logistics, particularly those
related to the new Director installation and the election processes for this evening. And they have given
ample notice to both the returning and incoming Directors regarding tonight's proceedings.
So let me begin. Our first order of business this evening is the installation of our recently elected and
appointed members. I am pleased to welcome the Honorable Judge Ann Frick, who will once again
officiate for us and will administer the oath of office to the incoming Directors. Judge Frick has served as a
litigator, arbitrator, and mediator, and as Denver District Court Judge. She currently serves as a member
of the Colorado Civil Rules Committee and of the staff of the arbitrators at the Judicial Arbitrator Group
JAG.
At this time, I would ask the recently elected and appointed Directors to unmute your microphones and
turn on your webcams if you've not already done so. Judge Frick, I will now turn the proceedings over to
you. Please proceed when you are ready.
ANN FRICK: Good evening, everyone. I am Judge Ann Frick, and I am so sorry that despite a lot of
efforts, Randy and I somehow were never able to really get my Mac computer hooked in where I could
see you all. But this will still work. And so I'm going to ask all of you who are being installed this evening
to raise your right hand and to repeat after me in unison. First, say I, and then state your name.
ALL: I, [INTERPOSING VOICES].
ANN FRICK: Do solemnly swear or affirm.
ALL: Do solemenly swear or affirm.
ANN FRICK: That I am an elector who resides at, and then state your address--

ANN FRICK: --from which I was elected.
ALL: --from which I was elected.

ANN FRICK: Congratulations, Directors. Now, at this time please, proceed to sign-PAUL ROSENTHAL: OK, now show signing. So why don't you come around.
BARBARA MCMANUS: That's all of them.
KATE WILLIAMS: Will Kamala Harris have to do this, too?
[LAUGHTER]
I don't know what the process is there.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: I did it two times.
DOUG TISDALE: I got a computer too.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: Oh, you do? OK.
[INTERPOSING VOICES].
BARBARA MCMANUS: I am not seeing Director Sloan.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm not seeing Director-- I saw her a minute ago. Now, I don't see her
Director Sloan.
MARJORIE SLOAN: I'm here, and my video is on.
KATE WILLIAMS: She's right in the middle of my screen.
TROY WHITMORE: She sounds fine with me.
DOUG TISDALE: I see her now.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK, great. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I saw her, but she then left. Oh there you are Marjorie. I see you, Director
Sloan.
MARJORIE SLOAN: All right. I'm good.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Congratulations, everyone.
MARJORIE SLOAN: Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Well, really a hearty congratulations to all of you. Miss, McManus, I
guess now is the time-ANN FRICK: , Hello this is Judge Frick, and while I was at the very last part of directing you to sign your
certificates, a call came in onto my cell phone, and I got cut off from you all. So I apologize, but I'm
assuming that everybody understood that they were to go forward and sign the two certificates,

acknowledging that you have taken the oath. And then, I will come down to the RTD office within the
week and put my signatures on them or some other time that John wants me to do that, all right?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, thank you. Thank you, Judge.
MARJORIE SLOAN: Thank you.
ANN FRICK: Yeah. I'm so sorry for all these technological difficulties, but congratulations to all of you and
proceed with your meeting. Have a good year. Bye bye.

KATE WILLIAMS: Thank you, Judge.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: Thank you, Judge.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I am here. Thank you. OK. We have 15 present, no absent.

Our next item on the agenda this evening is the election of the 2021 Board officers. As stated in the
Board bylaws, in the first official meeting of the year, the Board will elect the officers of the Chair, First
Vice Chair, Second Vice Chair, Treasurer, and Secretary. You have all received a copy of the proposed
RTD officer selection process, which I will summarize now for the sake of the record.
Voting will begin with the position of the Chair, and I will open the floor for nominations for each position.
Those Directors who nominate candidates, and those seconding the nominations, and any of their
speakers will have up to three minutes to speak regardless of the candidates for each position. When
there are no additional nominations, the nomination phase will close. Our General Counsel, Miss Snyder,
will at that time insert the names of the nominees into a secure voting system and distribute the secret
ballots electronically.
Once the votes have been cast and recorded in the vote system, Miss Snyder will confer with Directors
Whitmore and Williams, who will serve as co-election monitors. And they will view the tabulated results in
the vote system and confirm the vote count. At which point, Miss Snyder will announce whether any
candidate has received at least eight votes and the name of any winning candidate. If no candidate for a
given office receives at least eight votes, we will repeat the voting process.
If we proceed into additional rounds of voting, Directors who wish to speak further on behalf of the
candidate by providing new or additional information may do so at that time. This will be done in a roundrobin fashion. And again, each speaker will be limited to three minutes. If only one person is nominated
for a given office, the Board may proceed to approve the person by acclamation rather than by using a
vote system.
Following the election for the Office of the Chair, the current Chair of the Board will preside over the
remainder of the special Board meeting. Are there any objections regarding this process?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Chair, this is Barbara McManus, we need to hold for just one moment if you
wouldn't mind.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Chair Rivera-Malpiede, this is Director Lewis.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Hold on one second, Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Well, I just want to let you all know that the line isn't working-- the call-in line-- that
people can only hear static.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. So Roger, are you on?
OPERATOR: Your response has been registered.
ROGER: Yeah. We're trying to figure out what the connection problem is.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Should we hold. We're going to need to hold on this part, Miss McManus.
ROGER: Just hold for one minute.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes. I do see Director Buzek's hand up though. He may have something relevant
to say at this point.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Buzek?
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you. I always have something relevant to say, but it has to do with the election
process. So we want to just wait-- I'm happy to wait on that. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I would prefer that you do wait until we're able to get the public involved.
VINCE BUZEK: Sure thing.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And Director Lewis, thank you so much for letting me know. So, you guys,
I'm so sorry that we're having some technical difficulties, but this has really been-- the post-COVID life
that we've all been dealing with is all of these different platforms. So if you will just bear with me for a
second we will get back to everyone.
And now it's just so quiet. (LAUGHING)
KATE WILLIAMS: I just like the fact that people just move around there. The squares shift. Now you see
them, now you don't. Now they're in the corner. Director Whitmore, you're right in the middle now.
VINCE BUZEK: For some reason, I only see nine people at any given time.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
KATE WILLIAMS: That's the most you can see.
VINCE BUZEK: Is that?
KATE WILLIAMS: Yeah.
VINCE BUZEK: OK.
KATE WILLIAMS: It's not just you.
VINCE BUZEK: I don't get to choose the nine, and I'm not liking that.
KATE WILLIAMS: No you don't, and they jump around. Now you see them, and then they go away, and-yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So if you go to the three dots on the top of the toolbar and you pick large gallery,
you see more folks.
VINCE BUZEK: I don't have that option when I hit the three dots.
BARBARA MCMANUS: In the dropdown?
KATE WILLIAMS: Oh, look at that.
VINCE BUZEK: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK.
KATE WILLIAMS: There's Director Cook.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No, I'm not seeing it. Sometimes I see that and sometimes I don't.
MARJORIE SLOAN: And Paul, you're really hazy. You don't have a house fire, do you?
[LAUGHTER]
PAUL ROSENTHAL: No. It's sort of dimmer light. Much as I've been on a number of Zoom calls, I've
never really established what's a really good light for being on Zooms. So that is kind of dim, but it's kind
of warm as well.
SPEAKER 2: There is a fire behind you.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: But-- and there is a fireplace behind me.
[LAUGHTER]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Hey, Miss McManus-PAUL ROSENTHAL: It's kind of surprising too. It's probably your internet or maybe mine.
MARJORIE SLOAN: Yeah.
KATE WILLIAMS: It's yours, Paul.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Miss McManus, looks like there's still a lot of people in the lobby as well. So
if you could get Brandy to allow them to get in, that would be great.

BARBARA MCMANUS: I'll have to ask her to do that, because I see a few people have been added to the
lobby. And there were only seven people on the Broadnet line, so we're trying to get them the Teams
number, so they can either be on both or-- to be listening in on the call.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Thank you. And all Board members did receive, this afternoon, all
the call-in information. If you need to send that out to your folks, that would be great.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ROGER SHERMAN: Angie, [AUDIO OUT]. Someone-- we're trying to now call in. Director Bouquet, I see
your Jean Bouquet on the interface. Can you check-- are they able to hear us now?
JULIEN BOUQUET: I will check with them real quick.
KATE WILLIAMS: My family said they could see us.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: Then they are probably in Teams, because there is no visual in Broadnet.
KATE WILLIAMS: Right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Yes ma'am.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I see your hand up.
DOUG TISDALE: Oh. My computer, because it's been on all day, because Chair Rivera-Malpiede and I
started earlier today with an APTA Transit Board member meeting. And so it's getting hinky. So let me
lower the hand. But, as I say, it's just a little clunky. But it's down now, I believe. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. OK. All right. If I could just announce, there is an alternative
Teams number, which is 720-443-6193 with the ID number of 948176812.
Let me repeat that. There is an alternative Teams number 720-443-6193 with the ID of 948176812
hashtag or whatever. This number can be shared with your friends, family, and we're doing it with the
public as well.
Roger, are we good in terms of the public being able to hear?
ROGER: I believe John McKay-- we've got someone calling in to double-check. We are connected on the
system, so we're not sure why-- if you and I can hear each other, so should the public, because we're off
music hold. So I'm not sure what's going on.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Director Lewis, can you check with your folks to see if they can hear
anything now?
SHONTEL LEWIS: I'm happy to.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
ROGER: John McKay has joined the call. We wanted to see if John can hear us.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: John, can you hear us?
ROGER: John? Oh, he said he can now. So I think we're good.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. I'm going to go ahead.
ROGER: Go move forward.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I just got the same message too, that they can hear now.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, great. Thank you. So I'm going to start again. I apologize for the
technology issues. We're trying to work them out. We're working through two different platforms.
Again, good evening, everyone, and congratulations to the new Board members, and the incumbents who
were reelected, and the appointed Board members. So welcome to the RTD Board of Directors. Our next

item on our agenda is the election of the 2021 Board officers. And as I said, and I'll just go through it
again, since there's spend a little bit of time, as stated in the Board bylaws, in the first official meeting of
the year, the Board will elect the offices of the Chair, First Vice Chair, Second Vice Chair, Treasurer, and
Secretary.
You've all received a copy of the proposed RTD Board officer election process, which I will summarize
now for the sake of the record. Voting will begin with the position of the Chair, and I will open the floor for
nominations for each position. Those Directors who nominate candidates, and those seconding
nominations, and any other speakers will have up to three minutes to speak regarding the candidates for
each position. When there are no additional nominations, the nomination phase will close, and General
Counsel Snyder will be, at that time, able to insert the names of the nominees into a secure voting system
and distribute the secret ballots electronically.
Once the votes have been cast and recorded in the vote system, Miss Snyder will confer with Directors
Whitmore and Williams, who will serve as co-election monitors. They will view the tabulated results and
the vote system and confirmed the vote count, at which point Miss Snyder will announce whether any
candidate has received at least eight votes and the name of the winning candidate. If no candidate for a
given office receives at least eight votes, we will repeat the voting process.
And if we proceed into additional rounds of voting, Directors who wish to speak further on behalf of the
candidate, providing new or additional information, may do so at that time. This will be done in a round
robin fashion. And again, each speaker will be limited to three minutes. If only one person is nominated
for a given office, the Board may proceed to approve the person by acclamation, rather than by using the
voting system.
Following the election for the Office of the Chair, the current Chair of the Board will preside over the
remainder of the special Board meeting. Are there any objections regarding this process?
VINCE BUZEK: Madam Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, Secretary Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks, Madam Chair. There has been some discussion among Directors leading up to
today, and I believe an email from Director Rosenthal regarding this process and a suggestion that we
modify the process, if we all agree, I suppose, so that if there are three or more individuals running one
position, that the low vote-getter at any round of voting will drop off before proceeding to the next round of
voting for that position. I'm just wondering if there's any interest among other Directors in proceeding in
that fashion? Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. I guess the best way to do this is to go through alphabetically
with the Board to see if they're for that or against that-- or whatever. So let me go ahead and start.
Director Bouquet.
JULIEN BOUQUET: I'm in favor.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Thank you. Director Broom?
BOB BROOM: I'd be in favor.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Secretary Buzek?
VINCE BUZEK: Yes, I'm in favor. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: First Vice Chair, Catlin?
PEGGY CATLIN: I'm in favor. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Second Vice Chair Cook?

SHELLEY COOK: I'm in favor. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Thank you. Director Davidson?
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you, Madam Chair. I am in favor.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Dishell.
BOBBY DISHELL: Thank you, Madam Chair. I am in favor. And just for clarity, we're only doing a second
round if one person does not achieve eight votes. So if three people ran and two got two-- or one got two
and another got two-- great, seeing lots of yes. I just wanted to make sure we were clear for the record.
Thanks
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Treasurer Guissinger?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes, I'm in favor.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lewis?
SHONTEL LEWIS: I'm in favor.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Rosenthal?
PAUL ROSENTHAL: Yes, in favor. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Sloan.
KATE WILLIAMS: Director Sloan, you're muted.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. Director Sloan?
MARJORIE SLOAN: I [AUDIO OUT] I apologize. Yes, I'm in favor. And I'm sure I'll do that again, even
though I don't want to. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Tisdale?
DOUG TISDALE: Yes, I am in favor as well. Thank you, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Yes, Madam Chair. I have to admit, I thought this was a procedure that we were to
follow to begin with. So obviously, I'm in favor. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Williams?
KATE WILLIAMS: Yes, ma'am, I'm in.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And I am in. So it's unanimous. So we will do-- it will go with two rounds.
And then whoever's the lowest will drop off. OK. Thank you, everybody. And Thank you for your patience
with all of this stuff.
All right. So now, as stated in the Board bylaws, first initial-- so we're going to be going through this. And
what I'd like to do now is go ahead and open up the floor. So let me go ahead and state this-- voting will
begin with the position of the Chair. We're going to open the floor for nominations for each position. Those
Directors who nominate candidates, and those seconding nominations, and any other speakers will have
up to three minutes to speak regarding the candidates for each position. When there are no additional
nominations, the nomination phase will close and our General Counsel will, at that time, insert all of the
names into the secret voting ballot.
So with that, what I'd like to do is open up the nominations for the Chairman of the Board for the RTD
Board of Directors. Do we have any nominations?
VINCE BUZEK: Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you, Madam Chair. My nomination for Chair of the Board is Angie RiveraMalpiede. Let me give you all a little background about my colleague. In her day job, Chair Rivera-

Malpiede is Vice President of the Stapleton Foundation, responsible for sustainable urban communities,
and is also Executive Director of Northeast Transportation Connections, a nonprofit transportation
management organization that provides transportation solutions to the communities of Northeast Denver.
In this role, Chair Rivera-Malpiede was recognized by DRCOG as an employer champion for
demonstrating leadership in promoting transit as an option to driving.
Chair Rivera-Malpiede has been the recipient of numerous awards for her community involvement and
her dedication to mobility options. Chair Rivera-Malpiede is a passionate advocate who is dedicated to
establishing sustainable transportation options that are inclusive across all socioeconomic levels. in
addition, Chair Rivera-Malpiede believes transportation access is vital for our health and wellness,
individually, as a community, and economically. But let's talk about her work at RTD. We can all agree
that 2020 was a year that challenged us in every aspect of our work and lives. But through all of the
various crises we at RTD faced, Chair Rivera-Malpiede proved to be a calm and steady leader that
helped guide us through the most difficult times.
Chair Rivera-Malpiede faced each challenge with a calm, collaborative professionalism that allowed RTD
to be successful in the face of great uncertainty. Importantly, to Chair Rivera-Malpiede, diversity, equity,
and inclusion are principles that must be a part of every decision that RTD makes. Let's take a look at
Chair Rivera-Malpiede's 2020 scorecard. First, she let us through the process of selecting our interim
General Manager, Paul Ballard, an outside agency candidate that did great things during his tenure at
RTD.
In January and February, faced with ongoing problems and delays attributed to the N Line contractor,
Chair Rivera-Malpiede convened a meeting with chief executives from the contractor entities and our
senior leadership team and put in place a plan to get the underlying construction completed. Because of
her efforts and the leadership of General Manager Paul Ballard, the contractor stuck to its schedule and
finished its work. Later, in September 2020, the N Line opened. And I'm guessing it was the only
commuter rail line in the nation that opened during the pandemic.
When our legislature pushed to impose its will on RTD, Chair Rivera-Malpiede worked with the legislature
and the governor's office to establish the Accountability Committee, thereby guaranteeing RTD a seat at
the table in the legislative decisions that will impact RTD. When citizens express concerns about our code
of conduct and proposed changes that could negatively impact marginalized communities, Chair RiveraMalpiede established a committee of external stakeholders to work with RTD to implement changes to
our code of conduct that serve not only RTD but the community as a whole. When citizens expressed
concerns about our security forces, Chair Rivera-Malpiede establish the Safety and Security Committee,
made up of internal and external stakeholders to explore the way we provide security to our operators
and passengers. And it's important to note that prior to this the abolishment of that committee, Chair
Rivera-Malpiede worked with our interim General Manager to start the Transit Safety Ambassador
program for rollout when the N Line opened. These ambassadors are unarmed personnel that Act much
like a conductor but also perform security functions when necessary.
Finally, Chair Rivera-Malpiede guided us through the process of selecting our first ever female General
Manager, Debra Johnson. The theme that is consistent through all these accomplishments is that Chair
Rivera-Malpiede is dedicated to transparency and inclusiveness. When a problem arises, she doesn't
seek to impose a solution, but brings together all relevant stakeholders so they can be a part of that

solution. Chair Rivera-Malpiede's dedication to inclusiveness has already begun paying dividends in
rebuilding trust with our constituents and stakeholders.
Chair Rivera-Malpiede has done exemplary work in guiding us through this difficult time. There is no one
else more qualified to lead us out of this crisis. And as she leads us out of this crisis, it's important to
recognize that Chair Rivera-Malpiede has already begun working with President-elect Biden's transition
team to ensure that RTD's voice is heard in Washington DC. Because of her exceptional leadership,
Chair Rivera-Malpiede deserves a second term. And because of her exceptional leadership, we need her
to have a second term. Thank you. That concludes my nomination.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Is there a second.
SHELLEY COOK: Madam Chair, I think we turned it over to [AUDIO OUT].
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So let me just say this-- as I've been nominated for the position of the Chair,
I'm going to turn the proceedings over to Director Catlin for the limited purpose of presiding over the
election of the Office of the Chair. Director Catlin, you have the floor.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Madam Chair. Is there a second to the nomination?
SHELLEY COOK: Second, Shelley Cook.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Cook. You have three minutes to add to what Director Buzek has
stated.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you. And I will take three minutes. It was so perfectly stated by Director Buzek.
In the midst of huge challenges, the work that Chair Rivera-Malpiede did is what helped us to pull through
to this point. And the points he made about being inclusive and helping in sort of-- this is the essence of
leadership, reaching out to people and involving them in the problem-solving as well. And then watching
the results that we've seen so far-- so happy to second. Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Cook. Are there other nominations for Chair?
PAUL ROSENTHAL: Hi, Director Catlin. This is-PEGGY CATLIN: Director Rosenthal.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: [AUDIO OUT].
PEGGY CATLIN: I'm sorry, you're breaking up, Director Rosenthal.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: [AUDIO OUT].
PEGGY CATLIN: I apologize, Director Rosenthal, [AUDIO OUT] from you at all. You're breaking up.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: [AUDIO OUT]. Near my server. Maybe that'll work. Can you hear?
MARJORIE SLOAN: That's better.
PEGGY CATLIN: No. Wait a minute. No.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: OK. Sorry. I have to go closer to the server. My bad.
MARJORIE SLOAN: That's better.
PEGGY CATLIN: We can hear you now.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: Is that better?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes, thank you.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: OK, cool. All right. So it is my honor to nominate Doug Tisdale as Chair. I have
known Doug for a number of years from his work in the international community of the Denver metro area.
And from what I can see from his work, he has been a very prominent attorney for the past about almost
20 years in the community, helping clients in hundreds of complex commercial transactions and litigation
in California, Colorado, France, Mexico. He is including corporate counseling, litigation, dispute

resolution, building effective relationships with all stakeholders, clients, adversaries, courts, negotiating
complex matters. So I think he brings a strong background to the Board, besides being a Board member
for already one term.
So I'm a new Board member, so I kind of have an outside view from both watching the Board meetings
when you did have them in person, but also listening in to the Board meetings. And what I would say is I
think he's particularly good at being inclusive of our diverse Board members. I think he's very good at
bringing people together. Hello? You there?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: OK. --bringing people together during particularly tough discussions, making sure
that everybody is heard, and that he's sensitive to the often difficult topics that we have to bring up. He
runs a very effective and efficient meeting. And he has been either a Board member or Chair of a number
of Boards, particularly working with DORA, the Neurological Institute, Denver Downtown Development
Authority. He is a Chair of a committee with APTA, with which RTD has a very important relationship with.
And I think that would elevate his standing with APTA.
He has chaired Boards of over a dozen companies, nonprofits, and associations. And I think, from what
I've seen, if something unexpected happens, when there's a conflict of some sort, he really is able to
address that and really bring it to sort of a calm moment to where the whole proceedings progress
professionally. So it is my honor and pleasure to nominate him, and I urge the other Directors to vote for
him as well. Thank you so much, everybody.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Rosenthal. Before I ask for a second, I got a message from John
McKay that says we'd encourage anyone experiencing lag to first mute your Teams meeting, and then,
second, dial into the meeting separately. And the numbers cut off my screen, but I believe it's 720-443610-- is it 2, John?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, wait a minute.
JOHN MCKAY: 6193-- let me read that again.
PEGGY CATLIN: 720-443-61-JOHN MCKAY: 93.
PEGGY CATLIN: 93. Thank you. It was cut off of my screen.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JOHN MCKAY: --as well.
PEGGY CATLIN: Could you say the ID number, since it cut off my screen?
JOHN MCKAY: Again, it's 948176812 and then the pound sign.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, John. I appreciate that. OK, is there a second to the nomination, please?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Hi. Director Lewis with a second.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Lewis. Would you like to speak in addition to Director Rosenthal's
SHONTEL LEWIS: I would. I've had the opportunity to serve on this Board for two years. And one of the
things that I value as a woman of color on this Board is an inclusive one-- an inclusive culture and one
that really prioritizes people over our politics, that prioritizes people above processes. And what I've seen
from Mr. Tisdale, Director Tisdale, is just that. When he and I-- and we don't agree on lots-- but when he
and I disagree, the conversation is never a conversation of a personal one, but one of communication and
an opportunity for us to understand where either of the two are coming from.

He has never been retaliatory. He's always been welcoming. And he has served as somebody that I really
appreciate having discussions and conversations with. And I think his leadership on this Board has been
evident and an opportunity for many new Directors, but particularly from my own vantage point, a Director
who truly prioritizes inclusivity above all.
Doug has been fair and balanced. Doug is willing to work with Directors that he disagrees with, no matter
what that disagreement looks like. And he's willing to pick up the phone to better understand the different
perspectives and experiences. I have been grateful for Doug and in ability to really focus on the policy
and not make any of the conversations that we have at the Board personal.
He has shown a true commitment and openness to equity, to diversity, to inclusion, and has been
someone who I have really looked to when I am thinking about my own desire to achieve racial and social
equity. And she's been so open to that. And so I'm honored to be able to offer the opportunity to work
alongside of Doug, because Doug has shown that even with the free rides on Election Day, that he
understood the importance of folks having access to transit even if we are on different sides of the aisle.
And so I would just like to second that nomination and Thank Doug for his leadership.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Lewis. Are there any other nominations for Chair? I see Director
Williams has a hand up. Is there something you would like to say Director Williams? Or, as we discussed
in our process, why don't we do around Robin discussion and go through the Directors one by one to
make their comments if you don't mind.
KATE WILLIAMS: I don't mind at all. I just would like to have an opportunity to speak.
PEGGY CATLIN: Absolutely. Director Bouquet, the floor is yours. And you can feel free to not say
anything, but we're going to give each an opportunity.
JULIEN BOUQUET: Thank you, Director Catlin. I have no comment at this time.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Bouquet. Director Broom, please.
BOB BROOM: Thank you. My only comment is that I prefer to have our leadership serve a two-year term
to avoid the turmoil in the organization for changeover. So I'm going to be voting to support those people
that are running for reelection to these various offices. Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Broom. Director Buzek, you've already had your three minutes,
unless you want to add anything.
VINCE BUZEK: I don't. Thanks.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Director Cook, please.
SHELLEY COOK: No thank you, Madam Chair.
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Davidson.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you, Madam Vice Chair. I have no material comment. I'd just like to Thank both
candidates for their service, and I look forward to working with the group. Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you. Director Dishell.
KATE WILLIAMS: Bobby, you're muted.
PEGGY CATLIN: And I think he's frozen too.
BOBBY DISHELL: I was too quick. No comment. Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Dishell. Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Sorry. I don't have any comment right now. Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you. And Director Lewis already spoke-- unless you want to add anything to
what you said.

SHONTEL LEWIS: No ma'am. Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Rosenthal, you nominated, do you want anything to add?
PAUL ROSENTHAL: No further support. He's great. Thanks.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you. Director Sloan, please.
MARJORIE SLOAN: Yes. I have no comment about the merits of the candidate, except to say I really
appreciate learning about these two remarkable people from the other Directors who have worked with
them.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Sloan. Director Tisdale, would you like to speak on your behalf?
DOUG TISDALE: Madam Chair, perhaps it might be best for me to defer until everyone else has
commented so that I might respond if there were anything that was appropriate.
PEGGY CATLIN: As you wish. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Two remarkable leaders and individuals. No further comments. Thank you both.
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Thank you, Madam Vice Chair. I'd like to preface my statement by saying I asked
Director Tisdale not to put me in this situation. But despite his reputation for inclusiveness, he declined to.
And so I need to say that Director Tisdale has been on the Board for four years, and two of those years
he was in the position of Chair, and he has never sat down to talk with me about anything in my district.
So I don't know-- he maybe is inclusive to Director Lewis, but he has not been inclusive to me.
I think he's a great guy. I have asked him to speak at events that I've had. But I think that when he ran for
his second term he was very adamant that the Chair needed to have two terms to be effective. He stated,
in his own words, that the Chair spends the first year getting their feet on the ground and learning what
works and what doesn't work. I think that Director Malpiede deserves the same respect and credibility that
Director Tisdale asked for when he was running for his second term.
I can't imagine that out of the 15 Directors that Director Tisdale is the most qualified to serve three out of
the most recent five years. I think that's unreasonable when we have a variety of very qualified people, all
of whom were elected. When I spoke to Director Tisdale about this, he made a great deal about his
relationship with APTA, which is the national organization. I personally think that in these times that the
national organization is a little removed from us here. We have a state organization that we are involved
in. I didn't hear Director Tisdale talk about that at all.
So I could go on at length, but I will not support Director Tisdale for a third term as Chair. Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Williams. Before I go to Director Tisdale, Chair Rivera-Malpiede,
would you like to speak on your behalf.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No, I have no comment. Thank you, Madam Chair.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Director Tisdale, please.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Suffice it to say, I do have a slightly different
recollection of some things than Director Williams, but I will defend to the death her right to say whatever
she chooses to say, as I have done in the past when she's been outspoken in meetings. I appreciate the
support. I would welcome the opportunity. And I thank you all in any event.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Tisdale. So with two candidates having been nominated, those
being Chair Rivera-Malpiede and Director Tisdale, for the Office of Chair, I would ask General Counsel,
Melanie Snyder, to please insert the names of the candidates into the vote system, finalize, and submit
the electronic ballots to the Directors. Now, am I correct that that is done via email? Right?

MELANIE SNYDER: Yes. Thank you, Madam First Vice Chair. This is Melanie Snyder, General Counsel.
I have entered those names now, and the ballots will be sent in just a moment. They will be sent out via
email. So if everyone could please take a few minutes. It may take a few minutes for those emails to
arrive. But when those arrive, please cast your vote.
And at this time, I am going to invite Directors Whitmore and Williams to please join me in the separate
Teams meeting so that we can review those votes as they come in. Thank you, Madam Vice First Vice
Chair.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, General Counsel. I, for one, am waiting for my email. When I get it, I will
then canvas Directors to see if they've received theirs as well.
OK. I receive mine. Have other Directors received theirs? Has anyone not received them? Speak up,
please.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I have not.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I have not.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Directors Lewis and Guissinger have not received them yet.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Just got it.
PEGGY CATLIN: We'll give a minute for folks to think about their votes and submit them.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I still don't have it.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I got it.
PEGGY CATLIN: Oh, good. So General Counsel, have you received all 15 votes? Miss Snyder, when
you're ready, feel free to just announce the results.
Dr. Guissinger, I don't believe your line is muted right now. Thank you.
KATE WILLIAMS: We'll be along. We're still working with technology here.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you for the update. First, I would like to ask, were all 15 ballots received?
Because it was a two-step process to submit.
Welcome back, Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Wow. Technology.
PEGGY CATLIN: So General Counsel Snyder, are you ready to give a report?
KATE WILLIAMS: She has to get back here, but she will be. Do we have Director Whitmore back? Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: Oh, that's right, you all had to enter a different Teams meaning. Got it.
KATE WILLIAMS: That's correct. And we had technological difficulties.
PEGGY CATLIN: Understood.
KATE WILLIAMS: Great transportation company, not such a great IT company. But I bet there's great IT
companies out there who don't run bus schedules so well. So.
BOB BROOM: Maybe we can mail-in ballots next time.
[LAUGHTER]
SHELLEY COOK: Courier ballot. But somebody has to pick them all up.
KATE WILLIAMS: I don't know where our General Counsel is.
MELANIE SNYDER: And I'm here right now.
KATE WILLIAMS: There you are. OK. Good job.

PEGGY CATLIN: OK. General Counsel, please.
MELANIE SNYDER: Yes, thank you. This is Melanie Snyder, General Counsel. Having conferred with the
vote monitors, Directors Whitmore and Williams, I can confirm that Director Angie Rivera-Malpiede has
received at least eight votes and has been elected to the position of Chair of the Board.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: Congratulations, Angie.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes. Congratulations to Chair Rivera-Malpiede. The floor is again yours. You're muted.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Catlin. And thank you, everyone. At this time, we're
going to proceed for nominations for First Vice Chair. Do I have any nominations from the floor?
KATE WILLIAMS: This is Director Williams.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Williams, please.
KATE WILLIAMS: I'd like to nominate Director Peggy Catlin for the position of First Vice Chair. And can I
speak to that?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, please.
KATE WILLIAMS: Director Catlin has a lot of experience in the field. She was previously a Deputy
Director at the Colorado Department of Transportation. And her unwavering support to both of the chairs
that she has served under has been a credit to the agency. She's a known and recognized transportation
professional who has admirably filled with all of her positions and I think would do us well in this position.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Madam Chair. And again, congratulations on your election. Thank you,
Director Williams, for those kind words. I'm very honored to be nominated as First Chair for the third
consecutive year. I have the privilege of serving two years, and I can honestly say that in spite of all of our
challenges in 2020, I'm extraordinarily proud of the work that this executive committee accomplished. The
teamwork was fabulous.
And although as much as I would like to continue in the role as First Vice Chair, I do believe that other
Directors should be given the opportunity to enjoy working with Chair Rivera-Malpiede as Vice Chair.
Therefore, I respectfully decline the nomination. But Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, First Vice Chair Catlin. And I would just like to say thank you for
all of your work as First Vice Chair for the RTD district. You did an outstanding job. So thank you. We look
forward to working with you continuously.
I would like to nominate Director Lynn Guissinger for First Vice Chair for RTD. Director Guissinger took
office in January of 2019, representing district O, which is the furthest Northwestern portion of the RTD
district. I'd like to share with you a little bit of information about Guissinger. She is a woman small
business owner, a former attorney with a broad experience in managing a business, financial analysis,
creative fundraising, and strategy.
Her business, Catalyst Communication, has partnered with city transportation departments across the
country, including Seattle, Cambridge, Denver, Boulder, Tucson, Anchorage, and others to market and
promote their transit, biking, and walking options. She has been a true TDM. Under Catalyst
Communication, they've worked for years in bicycle and outdoor industries, and she has worked tirelessly
with advocacy efforts towards modes of transportation.
She is a graduate from CU Law School, and has practiced law for a number of years, and clerked with the
United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. And after practicing law at Holland and Hart, she

taught land use planning and local government law at CU Law School. She's also a strong civic leader,
serving as the Transportation Advisory Board Chair for the city of Boulder, the Community Culture and
Safety Tax. She is a member of the Commuting Solutions TMO. She is a member of the Boulder Housing
Partners Foundation, and in fact is the current Board president. She is participating in the Colorado
Fourteeners initiative, and is a senior fellow with the Getches-Wilkinson Center for Natural Resource and
the Environment.
The other thing I'd like to share with you about Director Guissinger is she's a current member of the
executive committee serving as Treasurer, the Chair of the Government and Communications Committee.
She has been Vice Chair of the GM Oversight and Performance Committee, the Northwest Parkway
Highway Authority Board, and serves as ex officio for the Accountability Committee. It's my honor to
nominate this outstanding woman for First Vice Chair. Do I hear a second?
TROY WHITMORE: I will second the nomination. I have the privilege of working closely with Lynn on a
number of very time-consuming and very important roles, and I just try to keep up with her. She's such a
good example of servant leadership in working through Government Relations and the Accountability
Committee. I appreciate her energy, her sincerity, and her service to her constituents, but to all of our
constituents. So I wholeheartedly second the nomination. Thank you, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Catlin, I see your hand up. Oh, you're muted.
PEGGY CATLIN: I apologize. I did not mean to leave my hand up.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, OK. Thank you. Are there any-- Yes, Director Bouquet.
JULIEN BOUQUET: I'm curious if we're open to other nominations yet.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: First, are there any other comments around Director Guissinger? Seeing
none, Director Bouquet, you have the floor.
JULIEN BOUQUET: Excellent. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I'm more than honored, as my first
action on the RTD Board, to nominate Director Shontel Lewis as our First Vice Chair of the RTD Board.
Director Lewis has been a dedicated leader who has always been fighting for our RTD community. I've
heard from several riders and several drivers, who are of lifeblood of our agency, who have spoke with
me on the campaign trail and afterwards of how much time, how much dedication, and how much trust
Director Lewis has built in the RTD community.
Director Lewis is a leader who has fought for all forms of equality, who has fought for the safety of our
community, who has fought for the rights of our community, who has always been looking forward to the
future of our RTD. Right now, we are at a crossroads at RTD. We have the opportunity as a Board to
build back this agency. We have the opportunity to build back ridership. We have the opportunity to build
back for the coming times. And most importantly, we have the opportunity to build trust back with our
community.
I've heard from several Directors of the many accomplishments of RTD, and I agree with those
accomplishments. But right now, we need to send that message back to our community. Director Lewis
being on the executive committee would be the first step to building back. And there would be no better
move to elect Director Shontel Lewis as our First Vice Chair of the RTD Board. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Is there a second?
DOUG TISDALE: Madam Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Tisdale.

DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I'm happy to second the nomination of Director
Lewis to serve as First Vice Chair. I think that she has brought an energy and an intellectual curiosity of
great moment. I think her ideas and proposals, as she has said, have not always aligned with mine, but
our relationship has always been one of respect and goodwill. She's been civil and open.
You always know where she stands, and she is happy to dialogue with you about that. And she's open to
modifying her positions when she hears a better idea that will better serve the agency. There is no greater
qualification for this seat. I've seen her grow and mature in her position, improving at every meeting and
in between those meetings. So I would like us to continue our path of diversity and inclusivity by electing
Shontel Lewis as First Vice Chair of the RTD Board. Thank you, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Tisdale. Are there any other comments? OK. With two
candidates being nominated for the Office of first Vice Chair, I would like to ask our General Counsel,
Miss Snyder, to please insert the names of the candidates into the vote system, and finalize and submit
the electronic ballots to the Directors.
MELANIE SNYDER: Thank you, Madam Chair. This is General Counsel Melanie Snyder. I'll enter those
now, and you should be receiving those electronic ballots in just a moment.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, ma'am. Okay, Jen, I'm Sorry.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Director Rivera-Malpiede, I actually couldn't get my camera and my video off.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, I'm sorry, Director Lewis. There you are.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I'm here, and I actually did have-- I really am honored and grateful for Julien's
nomination, and I did have a nomination that I wanted to actually put forward.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: For First Vice Chair?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yes ma'am.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh. Wait a minute. General Counsel?
MELANIE SNYDER: Yes, Madam Chair. That's fine. We can accommodate that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, great. Director Lewis, you have the floor.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you. Thank you. I would actually like to take this opportunity to nominate
Director Tisdale for First Vice Chair, for many of the reasons that I stated earlier during this conversation.
Again, we don't always fall on the same side of an issue, but he is always willing to have conversations.
His leadership is one of both empathy and inclusivity. That's the way I've experienced him. And so I would
like to submit Director Tisdale for First Vice Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Lewis. Do we have a second? Director Bouquet, I see
your hand up.
JULIEN BOUQUET: My apologies. I just took it down.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, OK. Is there a second for Director Tisdale for the Office of First Vice
Chair?
BOB BROOM: Madam Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes. Please, Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: I would second it. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. So we have a first from Director Lewis and a second from
Director Broom. So General Counsel, if you could put the three names in for First Vice Chair of Director
Guissinger, Director Lewis, and Director Tisdale.

PAUL ROSENTHAL: A point of order, Madam Chair. I'm sorry. I have a question. I guess, maybe I didn't
hear correctly. I didn't hear if Director Lewis was accepting the nomination, because she nominated
someone else. Can we hear again, perhaps, from Director Lewis, just saying briefly she accepts the
nomination?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lewis?
PAUL ROSENTHAL: Thank you. [INAUDIBLE] wrong.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Rosenthal. Director Lewis, do you accept the
nomination?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yes, and I appreciate Julien's nomination.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, thank you. And Director Tisdale, do you accept the nomination?
DOUG TISDALE: Yes, Madam Chair. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And Director Guissinger, do you accept the nomination?
LYNN GUISSINGER: I do. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Thank you, Director Rosenthal. So General Counsel, you now have
the three names for the First Vice Chair.
MELANIE SNYDER: Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. Those ballots should be in your inbox very soon.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Thank you, ma'am.
TROY WHITMORE: Madam Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, please.
TROY WHITMORE: This is Director Whitmore. I have a glitch in the system. It has indicated that I've
already about balloted for First Vice Chair, and I have not had the opportunity. Is anybody else having
that issue?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Miss McManus or Mr McKay can-- or I think Brandy is actually on the
phone. Brandy, can you help us with this?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, actually, Steve, an engineer, is with Melanie, our General Counsel, to work
with any issues with the software.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
KATE WILLIAMS: I did not have a ballot yet for this position.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I've not received anything yet either. So, I guess, Director Whitmore, you're
the only one who's gotten. And you've already voted.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
I did just get mine.
TROY WHITMORE: I got a second email. So I'm good. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
KATE WILLIAMS: We don't have a vote yet from Director Lewis.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lewis, have you been able-- did you get your ballot?
SHONTEL LEWIS: I did. I submitted it. It even shows it's submitted.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Did you get a confirmation?
SHONTEL: OK. I didn't get-- I'm sorry. I didn't submit it. I didn't push the button. I'm so sorry.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That's OK. I just know that there's that confirmation thing.
MELANIE SNYDER: OK. Madam Chair, this is General Counsel Melanie Snyder.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please, General Counsel.

MELANIE SNYDER: Having conferred with the vote monitors, Directors Whitmore and Williams, I can
confirm that Director Guissinger has received at least eight votes and has been elected to the position of
First Vice Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Congratulations, First Vice Chair Catlin-- I mean, Catlin-Guissinger.
[LAUGHTER]
PAUL ROSENTHAL: Congrats, Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Thank you very much. And I would just say, thank you. And one of my big goals this
year is that as we move to New committees, I hope that every single person on the Board feels heard and
included and is engaged in their own piece of work, working together to move us all forward. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. With that, I would like to now call nominations for Second Vice
Chair. Do we have any nominations for Second Vice Chair? Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Thank you, Madam Chair. And I apologize for not raising my hand the last time I
spoke. I should be shamed like I was in kindergarten. So I appreciate the recognition. It's my pleasure to
nominate Shelley Cook to the position of Second Vice Chair. Many of us who worked with Shelley for a
number of years as Directors, but prior to that, in her service to the city of Arvada as a city council
member, and, I believe, a former mayor pro temp, she has always been very involved with transportation
issues, and in a strange sort of way actually had the G line before the G line was done by RTD her transit
service that she was involved with in moving folks from that part of the RTD district to the airport and to
the two other important places, and work very closely with our RTD staff, many years ago, probably prior
to even thinking about being an RTD Director, and provided such a great service to her community and
communities around the G line corridor and back into Adams County as well.
I just appreciate Shelley's sage advice. She is such a calm advisor, and collected, and succinct in her
thoughts, and such a great communicator, and is respected by so many folks in the region that we serve
in and other regions. You know, her strengths are many, but the one that I think of first and foremost is
her financial acumen and the deep dive that she takes on those kinds of matters that really serves us all
well. Works well with staff and challenges staff in a respectful manner, but also is very complementary
and works well with staff on those types of matters and those kinds of inquiries. She's supported Lynn
and I when she can with the finance subcommittee of the RTD Accountability Committee, and we really
appreciate that.
She's just a strong, strong civic leader, and again a good example to me. And I think she'll be a great tutor
for our new Board members. So I would strongly urge her reelection to the executive committee. It's very
important that she's a member of that very important committee. So please vote for Shelley. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Do I have a second.
BOB BROOM: Madam Chair, I would second.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm sorry?
KATE WILLIAMS: Director Broom seconded.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Broom has second the nomination. Are there any other nominations
for Second Vice Chair? Director Dishell.
BOBBY DISHELL: Thank you, Madam Chair. Do I sound OK?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. I can hear you.

BOBBY DISHELL: Great. Thank you, Madam Chair. It's my honor to nominate Director Lewis for the
position of Second Vice Chair. I think her work has been critical over the last two years to really focus on
equity and inclusion and continue to push this forward for [AUDIO OUT].
Having that voice on the executive committee is vital. I think it is important for us as an agency to have
her on there to be able to bring those ideas through the executive committee and not just from the floor,
and ensure that really all voices are heard, and we are being inclusive. This is not to say that Director
Cook would not do that, I just happen to feel strongly that Director Lewis would bring a much welcome
change, especially as our entire agency is continuing to [AUDIO OUT] leadership.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, Thank You. Dr. Bouquet.
JULIEN BOUQUET: I would second that if we're ready for seconds.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Are there any other nominations for Second Vice Chair? All right, I'm
not seeing any. So General Counsel, for Second Vice Chair I have two nominations, Shelley Cook and
Shontel Lewis.
MELANIE SNYDER: Thank you, Madam Chair. This is General Counsel Snyder. Those ballots should be
in your inbox very shortly.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
KATE WILLIAMS: I don't know. Did we remember to tell the new guys that one of the requirements for
being a RTD Director is patience?
[LAUGHTER]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, especially now with all this. Technology and understanding we're
using three different platforms right now, which is pretty quite extraordinary. So Thank you for being
patient, everybody. OK, here we go.
Did everybody get their ballot?
KATE WILLIAMS: I have not gotten one yet.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I did get mine.
MELANIE SNYDER: So it looks like we're [AUDIO OUT]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm sorry, you cut out General Counsel.
KATE WILLIAMS: This gives new meaning to multitasking. I have three different [AUDIO OUT] One to
see you all, one to read my voting thing, and want to do what Troy and I are doing.
TROY WHITMORE: And then my dog decides to bark. So yeah, it was quite [AUDIO OUT] during this last
go around here.
KATE WILLIAMS: That was me barking, Troy.
TROY WHITMORE: Oh, OK.
[LAUGHTER]
MELANIE SNYDER: OK. Madam Chair, this is General Counsel Melanie Snyder.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, Miss Snyder, please.
MELANIE SNYDER: OK. Having conferred with the vote monitors, Directors Whitmore and Williams, I can
confirm that Director Shelley Cook has received at least eight votes and has been elected to the position
of Second Vice Chair.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. I just want to correct for the record that it was Director Cook and
Director Lewis. You said Whitmore. OK. So Director Cook, congratulations, Second Vice Chair. Now, I
would like to take nominations for the Office of Treasurer. Do we have any nominations?
VINCE BUZEK: Madam Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Buzek, please.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you, Madam Chair. While I have only known Paul Rosenthal for a short time, I am
confident in nominating him for the position of Treasurer of RTD. Director Rosenthal is a seasoned
policymaker who understands the role of the Board as it relates to RTD operations. Director Rosenthal's
experience as an educator, business professional, state legislator, and community activist gives him a
unique perspective that we need on the executive committee. Director Rosenthal is calm, rational, and
thoughtful. These traits are essential to the success of all Directors, but are most important to those that
serve on the executive committee.
I know that Director Rosenthal will bring a fresh outlook to the executive committee, and his background
will be invaluable as we face the challenges ahead. Please join me in supporting Paul Rosenthal for the
position of Treasurer. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Do I [AUDIO OUT] second for that, or are you [AUDIO OUT] nominations?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm sorry?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Would you like to have a second for that or are you accepting nominations. We're
accepting nominations, but we'll take a second for Director Rosenthal's nomination.
DOUG TISDALE: Madam Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
DOUG TISDALE: If I may, I would very much be honored to second the nomination of Paul Rosenthal. As
has been mentioned, he has a distinguished career in the Colorado State House that he can look back
upon. And he is in fact a dedicated public servant in more ways than we could possibly express in this
short time.
He is knowledgeable and experienced in all aspects of government and human relations, and particularly
in very trying human relations. But I suppose the most important reason for me to second his nomination
is that anyone who was kind enough to think that I looked like I've only been practicing law for 20 years, I
have to second.
[LAUGHTER]
So I second the nomination of Paul Rosenthal.
VINCE BUZEK: That's this century, Doug.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you, Madam Chair. I would actually like to take this opportunity to nominate
Director Julien Bouquet. I think-- I believe that he would actually make a great Secretary. In my
experience, as a member of this Board, the importance of diversity in thought and experience is really
incredibly important, not to mention diversity in age and gender as well. And I think that has been missing
from the executive committee. I think we need someone who is committed to equality, not just in words
but in principle, and in action. And I believe that Julien has the opportunity to do this, to really move the
executive committee forward in his experience as an educator, in his experience as someone who utilizes
public transportation, which I think is really important for someone on the executive committee to really

bring a different lens, a different type of leadership moving forward. And so I would like to nominate Julien
for this position. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Lewis. Do we have a second? Director Catlin, I see
your hand up. Oh, you're muted.
PEGGY CATLIN: My hand was up because I believe that the position is Treasurer and not Secretary. So I
just-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, I'm sorry. It is Treasurer.
PEGGY CATLIN: I just wanted to correct that for the record. But I would be happy to second the
nomination.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Are there any other nominations for Treasurer? Director Lewis,
your hand is still up. I didn't know if you still wanted to speak.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I don't.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, OK. Thank you. Are there any other nominations for Treasurer? OK.
Seeing none, General Counsel, I have two nominations for Treasurer, Director Paul Rosenthal and
Director Julien Bouquet. So I will give those to you for the official vote.
MELANIE SNYDER: Thank you, Madam Chair. I'll get those submitted, and you'll receive those ballots in
your email in just a moment.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
[AUDIO OUT]
KATE WILLIAMS: Breaking news here. 2020 has just announced that it will not recognize 2021 as the
new year and refuses to leave the calendar.
MELANIE SNYDER: Madam Chair, this is General Counsel Melanie Snyder.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, General Counsel.
MELANIE SNYDER: Thank you, Madam Chair. Having conferred with the vote monitors, Directors
Whitmore and Williams, I can confirm that Director Rosenthal has received at least eight votes and has
been elected to the position of Treasurer.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Congratulations, Director Rosenthal.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: Thank you, everyone.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Our last nomination is for the Office of Secretary. Do we have any
nominations? Director Cook, I see your hand.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes. And before that, I didn't get a chance to thank the folks who nominated me in the
Board for electing me. And just to say it's an honor, and, as others have said, one that I take very
seriously. I mean to represent everybody on the Board in this capacity in the way that I represent
constituents. So I just wanted to say thank you and echo words about inclusion and so forth.
I'd like to nominate, if I may, for the Office of Secretary, Vince Buzek-- Director Buzek. And if you would
like me to talk before the-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. You know, we have several new members, so I'll go through his background in
some detail and to refresh others' memories. Vince is an attorney in private practice. He's more than 30
years of experience under his belt. He knows local government and the region, having served previously
on the Broomfield City Council and for two years, so far, as one of our reps at the RTC, the Regional
Transportation Committee at DRCOG. So knows the region-- he knows local government.

He, beyond that, knows board governance. He's served on the Colorado Gaming Commission as a
member and as its Chair and for six years as an Adams County Planning Commissioner, filling in as
member, serving as Chair, and Vice Chair. And in the two years since he's been on the RTD Board, in
addition to the RTC, he's really shown himself to be knowledgeable and committed. I'll just give an
example-- he was the alternate to the General Manager executive search committee, and yet he attended
and contributed to every single meeting. And there were, I'm sure, a couple of dozen.
He's an effective and plainspoken Board member. He's the kind of person who has a gift for kind of going
right to the gist of a matter and being effective in relaying whatever point or opinion that he's aiming to
make. And he's been a leader in key efforts that we've seen in the past couple of years, including the N
Line promotional fare pilot program that was the first of its kind for RTD. And it involved negotiations and
working through with other Board members, with members of the legislature, and with members of our
intergovernmental team-- intergovernmental relations team. And he has also been our choice, in more
than one instance, to represent the Board in negotiations.
Finally, he brings to all things-- and this is my particular take on this, but he has a welcome sense of
humor. And I've mentioned this before, but that sounds like it's a nice to have. But in my experience, with
the Board, working on difficult issues, that's the sort of thing that builds goodwill, that allows people to
assume good motive, and enables compromise. So it's the kind of thing that when you have somebody
helping to make us all laugh or take ourselves a little less seriously, that really does make problemsolving possible.
So I would just urge a second year for him as Secretary. He's done a terrific job in that respect on the
executive committee and as Secretary itself. He's ventured downtown during the pandemic, sometimes
as much as two or three times a week in order to sign the checks. So thank you, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to second the nomination. Oftentimes-- and
I've shared this with a few of the new Board members-- I'm called Vince. And I take that as quite a
compliment. So vicariously, if you elect him, then I get to live a few moments, every once in a while, as an
executive committee member. So I appreciate that. And (CHUCKLES) sorry, in all seriousness, I
appreciate the Director Buzek skills and his skill set. And he's launched himself into a number of pretty
tough chores early on in his tenure on the Board, and I appreciate the camaraderie that we have and the
teamwork. And I think he's a fine member of the executive committee.
And I'd like to echo Director Broom's comment. I think it's good to have a little bit of continuity. So I'd like
to see Vince going back to Denver several times a week. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Do we have any other nominations for office of the Secretary?
Director Cook, your hand is still up. I am seeing no other nominations for office of the Secretary. Given
that, the Board really can proceed to approve the person by acclamation, rather than using the voting
system. So Miss McManus, I guess, what we do is we all raise our hand. Or how do you want us to
proceed?
BARBARA MCMANUS: You can just ask if anybody-- I would reiterate whether or not there is a second
nominee. Otherwise, I would just declare the vote.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Is there a second nominee for office of the Secretary? OK. Seeing
none, I'm going to declare Secretary Vince Buzek for a second year. Congratulations Secretary Buzek.

VINCE BUZEK: Thanks, Madam Chair. And thanks for the kind words from Second Vice Chair Cook and
Director Whitmore. I look forward to working with the Executive Committee, especially Paul Rosenthal.
Welcome, and welcome aboard. Thanks, all.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. OK. Well, listen, congratulations to everybody. And I want to
thank the Board members who submitted their names for running for the Executive Committee. It really is
all 15 of us that will move this agency forward together, collectively and collaboratively. And I look forward
to working with every single one of you in being open, inclusive, transparent, and really looking at
different ways of working with our community and providing transportation for this region which we all
love.
So thank you so very much, and I am so honored to be selected for a second term as Chair. It is probably
the most humbling experience I've ever had in my life. And I promise to work very hard and to always
have my door open. So Thank you very much.
We do have a couple of other recommended actions. We're going to proceed to just a few procedural
items that the Board discusses at the first meeting every year. The first item is the bank account signature
authorization agreement. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Auditing Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the-- you have all received-- the attached bank account signature
authorization agreement, otherwise known as the agreement. Do we have a motion.
DOUG TISDALE: Move to approve the resolution.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
KATE WILLIAMS: Second, Director Williams.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Is there any discussion on this motion? I'm going to go through.
Director Bouquet.
JULIEN BOUQUET: That mute button is very far away. No. No further comment.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Broom. Director Broom? All right. I'm going to go on.
Secretary Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: No questions, no comments. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: No questions, no comments.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: No questions or comments. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Davidson.
ERIK DAVIDSON: No questions or comments. Thank You.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Dishell.
BOBBY DISHELL: Nothing from me. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Nothing from me. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I will restate this, because General Manager Johnson is new to our agency. While I
understand that this is procedural, in the past. I have raised concerns about us banking with Wells Fargo.
It's my understanding that we don't carry lots of money in our Wells Fargo account. However, if we are
committed to racial justice and social equity, it would be a great opportunity for us to look at that account

and really invest our dollars in the folks who invest in our most marginalized and vulnerable and don't
prey upon them. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Lewis. Director Rosenthal.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: No comments at this time. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Sloan.
MARJORIE SLOAN: No questions or comments.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: No questions or comments, Madam Chair. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: No questions or comments. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: No questions or comments. I will have something to comment when we get to other
matters, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Thank you so much. With all of that, is there anyone opposed to us
doing the agreement? If so, state now. Otherwise, we will go for the regular vote. OK. Seeing none,
Director Bouquet.
JULIEN BOUQUET: Aye, in favor.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Cool. Dr. Broom.
BOB BROOM: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Davidson.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Dishell.
BOBBY DISHELL: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Rosenthal.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Sloan.
MARJORIE SLOAN: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Yes.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And I am a yes. So it is unanimous, 15 votes to move forward. The second
is the selection and location of posting of the Board notices. The RTD Board of Directors designates the
entryway kiosk of the RTD administrative office at 1660 Blake Street as its official location for the posting
of notices of all public meetings in 2021 as required by CRS 24-6-402 (2)(c). In addition, to the maximum
extent feasible, notices of public meetings will be posted on the RTD meeting portal. Do I have a motion.
BOBBY DISHELL: So moved. Dishell
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And Director Dishell. So I have movant as Director Whitmore and a second
of Director Dishell. Is there any discussion on this item?
[INTERPOSING VOICES].
MELANIE SNYDER: Excuse me, Madam Chair. Excuse me, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
MELANIE SNYDER: This is General Counsel Snyder.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Go ahead.
MELANIE SNYDER: So I apologize. But it looks like your script has the wrong designation. So the
recommended action designates the Board meeting portal as the official location.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, OK. Then I do have the wrong script. I'm so sorry. So can Mr McKay or
Miss McManus please read the proper one.
MELANIE SNYDER: Madam Chair, this is General Counsel Snyder. I can read the recommended action
for the motion.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Thank you, ma'am.
MELANIE SNYDER: You're welcome The RTD Board of Directors designates the Board meeting portal
http://rtd.iqm2.com as its official location for posting of notices of all public meetings in 2021, as required
by CRF 24-6-402 subsection (2)(c).
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Thank you. Do I still have the movant as Director Whitmore for this
and the second as Director Dishell? Are you guys OK? Could you just thumbs up. OK, great. Is there any
discussion. And I saw Director Lewis.
KATE WILLIAMS: Shontel, we're not hearing you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. Director Lewis, I think you might be-- well, you're not muted, but I
don't see you anymore. OK. Let me go ahead with Director Rosenthal. I'll come back to you, Director
Lewis.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: Thank you, Madam Chair. So as I look at the RTD website, and I know if I scroll
down it does say RTD Board, and you can probably drill down from there in order to find information
about our meetings. But realistically, it's not that easy. I mean, my sense is anybody who's going to the
website, it should be on the main page about our meetings. So maybe if somebody does scroll down, and
it says RTD Board, maybe have it scrolling or something to say when our meetings are or something like
that. I just thought something a little bit more obvious than just click down multiple levels and you'll get our
information.
So my hope is for the folks-- and I know the folks who design that website probably get a lot of
suggestions, but I'm hoping for our meetings to be a little bit more obvious on the main page. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Williams.

KATE WILLIAMS: Thank you, Madam Chair. Director Lewis has let me know that her laptop died, and she
will try and come back other ways. She's OK with this proposal. I had the same thought as Director
Rosenthal, that since we are doing all of this remotely, we ought to have some kind of a spot on the front
page that makes it much more obvious to get to where things are happening. We are reacting differently
than we have in the past, and so I would like to also see something more obvious. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you so much. Director Dishell.
BOBBY DISHELL: I'm going to speak slowly, and hopefully it won't break up. I echo Director Rosenthal's
comments on the need for a more obvious place. I also understand the need to have a reliable system in
place and one that we know works. So I'd encourage us, as an agency, to really consider not just posting
on what's required but going above and beyond that, continuing to push out when our meetings are
through sources like, Nextdoor which allows a government agency to have an official account that can
blast out to all neighborhoods on places like Facebook, on Twitter, on other social media platforms, where
people can access us, instead of just meeting our bare minimum statutory requirement for public
engagement.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. All Right. Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Madam Chair. I really appreciate Director Dishell's comments. Also,
Director Lewis, I believe she's signed in as a guest and not officially in the meeting as a Director. But she
did send a message that she is not OK with the proposal. So I think maybe if we give her a chance to get
the technology correct, that perhaps she wants to make her point.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Absolutely. Director Lewis, I'm showing you muted. Oh there,
you're unmuted. Do you want to speak, please?
Director Rosenthal, your hand is still up, as is you, Director Catlin.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: My apologies.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That's OK. It's this technology. And Director Lewis, do we have you on the
line?
BARBARA MCMANUS: If Director Lewis can hit star 6. I'm not seeing that anybody needs to be waiting in
the waiting room. But if she tries star 6, she might be able to speak. I'm not sure what difficulty she's
having.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Director Lewis, if you can hear me, if you can hit star 6. And
Director Catlin, if you wouldn't mind texting her and telling her if she can hit star 6.
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Lewis just sent a message that she said don't worry, feel free to move on.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. OK. Well, with that in mind, I'm going to call for the question. First of all,
is there any additional discussion on the portal for the meeting minutes with the additions to what's been
added? All right. Seeing none, I'm going to call alphabetically. Oh, Director Dishell.
BOBBY DISHELL: I have-- Shontel, are you here?
SHONTEL LEWIS: I'm here.
BOBBY DISHELL: Can you hear Director Lewis?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I can.
BOBBY DISHELL: I'll let her go then.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Go ahead, Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Hi. It's says that I'm on this. For some reason my videos is muted. But I just wanted to
add-- it sounds like you all were having the same discussion that I was hoping to have about access ion

the time of COVID. And so I would like to see us do more social media outreach [AUDIO OUT] and not
just at the 1600 building. But Twitter or Instagram, because I've found that those are great engagement
tools. But that's what I wanted to add. Thank you so much Director Dishell.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Any other comments from any other Director? Director Dishell, if
you could put your hand down. And Director Lewis's hand is still up, but OK. So I'm going to go through
the roll call-- all in favor of this with all of these additions to it. Director Bouquet.
JULIEN BOUQUET: I'm in favor.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm sorry?
JULIEN BOUQUET: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Thank you. Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Davidson.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Dishell.
BOBBY DISHELL: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lewis. I would say-- I think she would say yes, correct?
KATE WILLIAMS: Somebody want to text her?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes. [AUDIO OUT] going. Director Rosenthal.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Sloan. Director Sloan.
MARJORIE SLOAN: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Williams?
KATE WILLIAMS: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And I'm a yes. Were you able to get a hold of Director Lewis?
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
KATE WILLIAMS: I texted her, but I haven't heard back. I don't know if anybody else has.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm hitting go. 14 ayes and one absent. It moves with 14 and 1 absent. The
next thng is the-BOBBY DISHELL: Madam Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.

BOBBY DISHELL: Does this mean [AUDIO OUT] issues going forward, we will be counted as absent
from the meeting and in votes?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No, no, no. It just means that she didn't vote on this one piece. She's
already been in the queue for being-- we did roll call it the very beginning of the meeting for all the Board
members in attendance.
KATE WILLIAMS: I see Director Lewis is back, perhaps she can vote now. Director Lewis, can you
unmute yourself and-BOBBY DISHELL: She said she's on the phone. She said, she's a yes, but she's on the phone. I'm
asking, because with tech difficulties, I'm curious if we will-- if we have a tech difficulty during a vote, but
we were present for the entirety, if we'll be counted as an absence-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No.
BOBBY DISHELL: --for the convenience of time?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No. And because we're in this post-COVID stuff, with all of these different
platforms, it's very different for this. But Miss McManus, do you want to address that?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes. If we were in regular chambers and someone stepped away for the vote,
they would be marked away, and there would be no vote for that person, regardless of whether they were
in the rest of the meeting or not.
DOUG TISDALE: Point of order, Madam Chair, if I may, Director Tisdale.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please.
DOUG TISDALE: I see the Director Lewis has in fact in the chart for this meeting indicated that she's a
yes vote. In addition to that, when in doubt, if we do have a visual of the Director, it is perfectly
permissible, because we don't have a restriction to that effect, for a Director to give a thumbs up
indicating a yes vote or a thumbs down indicating a no vote. Thank you, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Tisdale. So I agree. I just don't see Director Lewis on
my screen at all. So I think her camera is not working. I think her laptop went down-KATE WILLIAMS: No, I can see-- I'm sorry. I can see her, and she just gave the thumbs up.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, great. Thank you. I do not see her. All right. The next piece is the
approval of the Board meeting minutes from December 15, 2020. May I please have a motion to approve
the minutes from the regular Board meeting of December 15, 2020?
VINCE BUZEK: Motion approved.
DOUG TISDALE: Motion to approve.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm sorry, who moved?
VINCE BUZEK: Buzek, move to approve.
DOUG TISDALE: Tisdale second.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Is there any discussion on the minutes? All right. Hearing none,
we're going to proceed with a voice vote. Are there any no's to the approval of the Board minutes?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Can you hear me, Chair Rivera-Malpiede?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I can. Go ahead, Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you. I would just like to remind folks that-REPORTER: I want to go Fort Collins right now, because there's new reporting on the increasingly tense
relationship between outgoing President Trump--

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, I'm sorry. Somebody's got on their news report. OK. Go ahead, Director
Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you. It's recorded in the minutes that I voted Yes on an action last month that I
actually didn't have access to if you all recall. [AUDIO OUT] the meeting continued, although you all could
not hear from me. So it doesn't indicate away, it does indicate that I was affirmative in my vote. And so I
just wanted to bring that to you to you all's attention, and I wanted for that to be reflected correctly in the
record.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Duly noted. Mr McManus.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We'll make that correction and we'll republish tomorrow.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Lewis. Are there any no votes for the meeting minutes
for December 15, 2020? Hearing none, with the one correction, they are approved. Next is other matters.
Is there any other matters to come before the Board this evening? Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Thank you, Chair. I've been asked to provide some information from the Colorado
Cross Disabilities Council, that they are looking forward to working with the new and existing Board
members and with Debra Johnson to make RTD as successful as possible this year. They feel that the
services are critical to the disability community.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Any other matters to come before the Board? All right. Seeing
none, I will now entertain a motion to adjourn. Do I have a motion?
ALL: So moved.
[LAUGHTER]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Anyone opposed? OK, we are officially adjourned at 7:55 PM.
Congratulations to the new Board members and the new Executive Committee. Be safe, everybody.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: Bye. Congrats.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you.
KATE WILLIAMS: Thank you. Goodnight.
