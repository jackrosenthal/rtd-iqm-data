BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Bank Signature Authorization

Board Meeting Date:
January 5, 2021
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Board of Directors approve the attached Bank Account Signature
Authorization Agreement (the “Agreement”) to authorize certain staff members and Board Officers to
sign payments exceeding certain thresholds regarding checks, Automated Clearing House (ACH)
payments and wire transfers.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD has several internal controls in place throughout the procurement, invoicing and payment process to
ensure budgetary controls are met and to prevent incorrect payments. Requiring authorizations for
certain large payments are one such control for which payment thresholds have been established that
require specific signatures in order for those payments to be processed by the RTD Accounts Payable
Department and RTD’s commercial bank.
Board approval is necessary to authorize those individuals that may sign these payments. Wells Fargo,
as the District’s commercial bank, requires prompt notification of all modifications in the authorized
signatories on the District’s various bank accounts. In order to reflect any changes in District personnel
and the election of new Board Officers, the Agreement is updated at least annually and periodically as
otherwise required.
DISCUSSION
The attached recommended Agreement has been modified from the previously approved Agreement to
reflect the new Board Officers and that the Controller is currently acting in the capacity of the Chief
Financial Officer.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This Recommended Action has no financial impact to the District.
