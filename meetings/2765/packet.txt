January 1, 2017 Valuation Highlights
(the plan is in funding peril)
• Contributions are not sufficient to fund the liabilities

– The amount of insufficiency has decreased
– Total Actuarially Determined Contribution (ADC) is 23.63% (prior year
was 25.69%); 18.0% scheduled for receipt in 2017
– The contribution deficiency decreased, from 7.69% of payroll to 5.63%

• Fund is projected to be fully depleted by 2040; last year was 2035
and the prior year was 2039
– Assuming 6% earnings the depletion date is 2035

• Actuarial Accrued Liability increased by $11.5 million
– From $436.3 million to $447.8 million

• Actuarial Value of Assets returned 6.35%, short of the assumed
7.0%
– Increased by $2.8 million, from $211.4 million to $214.2 million
– Market value increased from $202.2 million to $203.8 million

January 1, 2017 Valuation Highlights
(the plan is in funding peril)

• Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability increased by
$8.7 million
– From $224.8 million to $233.5 million

• The ADC as a dollar amount increased 5% from
the prior year

– There were gains due to anticipated lower benefits
than expected and due to new hires having a lower
normal cost;
– There were losses due to contributions less than the
ADC, the change in the mortality assumption, and
investment earnings less than assumed
– These two sources offset each other

1.C.1.a

January 1, 2017 Valuation Highlights
• The normal cost decreased from 10.31% of pay (including admin
expenses) to 9.65%
– The scheduled contribution is 18% of pay

• Actuarially determined contribution (ADC) decreased by 2.06% of
pay
– The decrease is due to the population growth from the prior year.
More members are now in the new tier.
– ADC will continue to have upward pressure as the actuarially
determined contributions are “missed”

• Funded ratio decreased from 48.5% funded on an actuarial basis to
47.8%
• Total active participant count grew by 226

– From 1,623 to 1,849 (966 in Tier 2)
– New hires continue to “bend down” the normal cost, so more funding
can go to the unfunded accrued liability

Long-Term Funding-Reforms to improve the
plan
•
•

Total ADC is 23.63% of payroll compared to the total scheduled contribution rate
of 18.00% of payroll.
Amendment #22 was adopted in 2010 with the following changes in effect for
participants hired on or after January 1, 2011 (Tier 2):
– New benefit schedule listed in Section 6.01 of the Plan provisions
m
m
m

m
m

Vesting is changed from 5 years to 10 years
The benefit multiplier is changed from 2.5% to 1.0%
Unreduced retirement is changed from age 55 with 20 years of service to age 60 with 20 years of
service
Early retirement reduction is changed from 5.0% from age 55 to 2.5% from age 60
The maximum service included in the benefit calculation is reduced from 30 years to 25 years

– Sick and vacation payouts are no longer included in the pension benefit calculation
– Interest on employee contributions is changed from 5% to 3%

•

Due to amendment #22, a drop in the normal cost rate is expected as new hires
enter the plan.
– The normal cost last year was 10.31 % and this year it is 9.65%.
– Normal cost is expected to decrease to 5.18% in the long term.

1.C.1.a

RTD/ATU Summary
• Pension reform (Amendment #22) is decreasing the normal
cost but the unfunded is “outrunning” the solution
– Decrease in the normal cost while UAL payments grow faster
– Trust depletion date moved from 2035 to 2040

This is a highly volatile calculation; one year of poor returns could
bring that number much closer to today
m At depletion in 2040, benefit payments are estimated at $40 million
per year which is approximately 25% of projected payroll
m

– Asset losses (investments not meeting the assumed 7%)
continue to increase the unfunded accrued liability
m

There are $10.5 million in deferred market losses still to be recognized

– Contribution shortfalls continue to increase the unfunded
accrued liability

Information

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the second quarter of 2018 attached.
The U.S. economy and household spending continued to expand at a moderate pace during the second
quarter of 2018. The U.S. unemployment rate declined modestly over the period to 4.0% and general
inflationary pressures remained tame.
In order to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Federal
Reserve chose to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1.75% to 2.00% in June. The
Federal Reserve stated “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting
strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to two percent inflation”.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

2nd Quarter
