#### 1. Enter into Contracts/Agreements to Contribute Funding Towards the Mobility Choice Blueprint

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer and authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into any and all contracts or agreements required to provide $500,000 in Regional Transportation District funding in support of the Mobility Choice Blueprint as articulated in this Board Report.

Motion:               Director Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the September 27, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, stated that the Mobility Choice Blueprint is a collaborative effort.  He remarked that three public agencies have been requested to each contribute $500,000 and that all public agency dollars are for the purpose of funding the study.  He added that the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) and the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) have already funded their portion of the study and that the focus of the study is to understand the future of transportation technology trends.  He stated that in terms of governance, RTD, CDOT and DRCOG will all have a leadership role.  There will be a four (4) person oversight committee and RTD will have one Mobility Choice Board Member appointee.  He added that none of Mobility Choices’ recommendations will be binding and the RTD Board can choose to accept or reject the recommendations.

Director Bagley stated that RTD has partnered with CDOT and DRCOG on many things in the past and it is imperative that RTD participate in this effort.  He said if not, RTD will be missing a great opportunity.  He added that first and last mile issues as well as Uber and Lyft are all topics that need to be discussed and addressed and this study will accomplish that.

Director Solano asked if there was anyone in the audience from Mobility Choice that could speak to the Board.

Don Hunt, Executive Director of Mobility Choice Blueprint, stated that he was pleased to be able to address the Board.  He noted that he was the former CDOT Director and had worked with RTD for the Union Station project and US36 express lanes.  He said that technology has impacted so many aspects of our lives, and he has addressed various entities for the past year and half discussing how technology will change our futures.

Kelly Brough, Denver Metro Chamber President and CEO, commented that the chamber has had a long history working with RTD.  She noted that the chamber wants to continue that relationship and plan for the future to build a system to benefit employees, families and children.  She added that it would be an honor to work with RTD to create that vision together.

Director Solano stated that RTD has not had a good track record with studies in the past.  He asked what this study would offer RTD that the previous studies have not.

Director Lubow commented that this is an issue of great importance, but she has concerns about the path being proposed.  She said RTD is going through a financial crisis, but the Board is being asked to fund a third of the study costs.  She added that she does not think it is necessary to create a separate non-profit entity and remarked that the Mobility Choice Board would not be representative of RTD’s ridership.

Director James stated that he has been watching new technologies come along.  He said that joining this study is a strategic move that RTD needs to make.  He added that society is on the threshold of change and RTD can be fundamental to that change.  He remarked that RTD needs to partner with our peers to see what types of services we have today that are in danger of being cannibalized by the new types of services available.

Director Francone remarked that one of the reasons she voted no on this item at the DRCOG RTC meeting was that the composition of the Mobility Choice Board is primarily Denver and Boulder.  She stated that there is no representation from many counties, low income, ADA, or elderly communities.  She added that RTD would only have one vote on that Board and our voice could be silenced.  She stated that the study duplicates previous efforts by RTD, CDOT and DRCOG and she would be voting no on this item.

Director Lasater stated that he too has a concern with the make-up of the Mobility Choice Board.  He said if the study is going to discuss how to make transportation better through technology, there will be problems if people do not know the right questions to ask.  He added that spending a lot of money with people whose understanding of technology is limited, is not good.

Director Sisk commented that these are people who have stepped up to serve.  He said RTD’s choice here is to be a part of something for the future, or allow the $500,000 price tag to thwart us.  He said that RTD should be respectful of the people who have come forward to be a part of this team, and if RTD wants to be leaders in transportation, we need to get together and move forward.  He said that for RTD to not be a part of this partnership would be unfathomable.

Director Folska said that the Denver metro area has some of the brightest minds in transportation.  She added that she would like to see the collaboration continue, but without the $500,000 price tag.

Director Anderson remarked that she has a deep concern about spending money but then putting the plans on shelves, but recognized that RTD needs to make sure that it is building for the future.

Director Hoy stated that he struggles with this, but he understands that RTD needs to look at the future.  He said that he grapples with the general concept of studies and RTD needs to focus on how it is going to maintain and sustain our operations.  He added that he will not be supporting this item as money is tight and those funds should be used elsewhere in the Agency.

Director Solano added that RTD is in a situation where it is trying to fund the unfunded corridors and it should choose its constituents over a study.

Director Bagley suggested that the Mobility Choice Study should have a citizen advisory committee to provide feedback to the appointed Board to better address the diversity concerns expressed by the RTD Board Members.

Director James indicted that the metro area and RTD will suffer if RTD is not a participant in this study.

Director Walker commented that the purpose of this study is to examine technological options to bring forth efficiencies for mobility.  He added that this study is to further the mission of moving people and goods faster and easier, and he will be supporting this item.

Director Anderson said that the Board needs to embrace this study and look to the future.  She added that the $500,000 price tag is a small price to pay to be a part of the future.

Director Folska voiced concerns that the study was not ready for prime time.  She recommended that staff speak to Google and Tesla to use Denver as an experiment, and have them pay for the study.

General Manager Genova stated that there has been a lot of dialog about creating a project advisory committee to discuss items important to various communities and ensure diverse, broad representation.  He said as it relates to deliverables, he has stressed that the deliverables need to be actionable.  He added that this study is a great opportunity to collaborate with our peers.

#### 2. Budget Transfer for SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit Environmental Clearance and Basic Engineering

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a transfer of $3.5 million from the Planning expense grant project budget to a new capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Corridor, which will permit staff to seek consultant services for assistance in the preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Advanced Basic Engineering services.  A total of $1.5 million in funding for this project was approved in the 2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense grant budget, and the remaining funds are planned for 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).

Motion:               Director Deadwyler made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the September 27, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration, stated that staff is requesting advance funding for this project.  She said that the original plan was to have the funding available over a three-year period, but in order to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) all of the funds need to be available at one time.  She noted that it will mean additional dollars are available in 2017 and 2018.  She stressed that this did not change the project as originally approved but just consolidated the funding into one year.

Director Hoy stated that the Board is being asked to spend more money while tightening our belt.  He said that he would not be supporting this item.

Director Solano said that he would support this to advance the northwest corridor.

Director Anderson stated she was in favor of this as this is a recommendation that came out of the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS).

Director Folska remarked that RTD does not have the funds to support this and it is a distraction from building out FasTracks.  She stated that she would not be supporting this item.

#### 3. 2016-014 : Enter Contract to Purchase Cybersecurity Consulting Services

It is recommended by the Financial, Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into contract negotiations with Parsons Corporation to retain this firm for work order-based cybersecurity consulting services to support RTD’s cybersecurity program. The estimated cost of the Cybersecurity Services Work Order Contract of $1,818,700 includes security risk assessment, technical testing, control design, and control implementation activities and will be funded from the cybersecurity operations and maintenance budget approved for 2016 forward.  Actual expenditures will be based on work orders constructed and issued by the cybersecurity project team, but are not to exceed the total budgeted for this contract.

Motion:               Chair Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the September 27, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Heather Copp remarked that the cyber security funds have already been budgeted for 2016.  She indicated that staff followed RTD’s procurement process and a selection committee evaluated and identified the best candidate, Parsons Corporation, to meet RTD’s needs.  She stated that staff would like to award a two-year contract to Parsons, with three one-year options.

Director Folska asked if this contract would have any type of integration with the Xerox contract and the Smart Card program.

Sheri Le, Manager of Cyber Security, stated that cyber security is an oversight function and is not an integration or development function.  Heather Copp indicated that Parsons was being brought on board to look at the entire RTD system.

Director Solano inquired as to the last time RTD had a significant cyber security impact or breach.  Sheri Le stated that RTD has not had a significant breach that we know of.  She remarked that RTD needs to improve its capabilities to detect if there is a breach and to be proactive to stay ahead of the curve.

Chair Tobiassen stated that he has been pushing RTD to become aggressive in the Information Technology and Cyber Security realm.  He pointed out that this is work order based and only the money that needs to be spent is spent.

Director Francone remarked that she was impressed with the information presented during the executive session and agreed that there is a definite need for this.

Director Anderson stated she would be supporting this as she is in favor of anything that protects our customers.

Director Solano inquired if this was even necessary as RTD received federal funds.  He thought that would mean RTD falls within the prevue of Homeland Security.  Sheri Le explained that while Homeland Security is great at finding areas for improvement, they do not provide the resources to make those improvements a reality.

#### 4. 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).

This action item meets policy requirements and the General Manager’s goals of Fiscal Sustainability/Financial Plan by effecting current and long-range budgeting in a timely manner.

Motion:               Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the September 27, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Heather Copp stated that the Board has seen the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) for the past three months.  She added that Jannette Scarpino will discuss the one update to the SBP.

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, commented that the final draft of the SBP was presented to the Board in August.  She stated that it was necessary to update the August version of the SBP for accelerated fleet purchases.  She remarked that the fleet purchase was moved from 2021 to 2018, with the fleet arriving in 2019.  She commented that the 2018 fleet purchase will be done by available cash flow, grants, and the Capital Replacement fund.  She reminded the Board that the SBP is balanced over the six (6) year period, but there are factors outside of RTD’s control such as: sales tax revenue, cost of fuel, economic conditions, etc.  She stated there may be additional expenses or reductions, but staff will be challenged by the unpredictability of consumer spending behaviors.

#### 5. Discussion and Action of the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial Plan

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial Plan as outlined below.

Motion:               Director Deadwyler made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the September 27, 2016 Board Meeting.

Chair Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Heather Copp stated that the September 20, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Packet included a new option that it is a modified Baseline scenario.  She commented that one of the main concerns from RTD’s stakeholders was that the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) was being eliminated.  She stated that the additional scenario provides some assurances that RTD is trying to fill up the FISA and that it will not be eliminated.

Director Bagley noted the only difference for the modified Baseline scenario is that money was moved from one account to another, and it was called something different.  He asked staff to display the Baseline scenario with the modified Baseline scenario side by side for the Board Packet.

Director Solano stated that the FISA was promised to the unfunded corridors and RTD needs to use those funds for what they were originally intended to be used for.

Director Sisk indicated that he is concerned about the money in the FISA account going away.  He stated that these funds were supposed to be set aside for FasTracks projects and he is worried about the perception the public will have with the Board.  He said that staff has done a good job to try and account for financial shortfalls, but he is not satisfied.

Director Lubow thanked staff for addressing the stakeholders concerns, however, she does not think what is happening with the FISA account is appropriate and RTD has a responsibility to give the citizens what was promised.

Director Hoy thanked staff for their meetings with the stakeholders and sees this as a step in the right direction.  He added that he will vote no on this item tonight as he feels that there is room for more dialogue.

##### b. Revised Attachment B - 09-21-16

#### 1. 2017 Requested Budget

Jannette Scarpino stated that this is the first draft of the 2017 Requested Budget.  She commented that RTD must post the 2017 budget for public review and comment by October 15, 2016 to meet Colorado legal requirements.  She added that an update will be provided at the October 18, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit (FAA) committee meeting, and the final budget will be presented at the November 15, 2016 FAA committee meeting with staff requesting adoption at the November 22, 2015 Board Meeting.  She remarked that the Base System and FasTracks budgets are still fluid.  The funding sources include: fare revenue estimates, sales taxes, grant revenue, and capital expenditures for both new capital and capital carry forward amounts.  She stated that Operating expense will likely be revised for specific items that were not included in the SBP.

##### a. 2017 Requested Budget-Exhibit I

#### 2. Second Quarter 2016 Performance Report

Jannette Scarpino indicated the report was included in the September 20, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet so she would just speak to some of the areas where we did not meet goal.  She commented that through the second quarter, there was a small increase in the passenger accidents of which three were preventable.  She stated that customer complaints were 4.2% and overall, the system complaints met the goal, but three independent carriers did not.  This is attributed to the dropped runs due to lack of bus operators.

Director Francone asked if there are consequences for failure to comply with RTD’s service goals.  Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager of Contracted Services, said yes, and added that RTD has liquidated damages in our contracts with our contractors.

Committee Chair Menten indicated that she would be speaking with staff off line about the facility elevator complaints.

#### 3. Smart Media Technology (SMT) Monthly Update

Heather Copp stated that staff received the report from the independent auditor regarding cyber security.  She said that the reason the portal has not gone live was because of concerns about cyber security and she remarked that the report was not good.  She stated that in response to the report, staff has provided Xerox with a Notice to Cure.  She commented that Xerox has until Friday, September 23rd to respond.  She explained that until staff hears back from Xerox they do not know what action will be taken next.  She said it is serious, but it forces Xerox to respond to staff’s list of concerns.

Director Lubow asked if there is a new timeline for the portal going live.  Heather Copp said no, there was no timeline until the cyber security issues are fixed.

Committee Chair Menten asked if Xerox was providing any other services to RTD.  Heather Copp stated that Xerox is only working with RTD on the Smart Card project.

Director Sisk inquired how staff was communicating to the public that the Smart Card is not going live.  Heather Copp remarked that staff did not publicize the July 1st go live date.  She added that the pilot program users have inquired about a web portal, but staff never made a public announcement.  Director Sisk stated that staff should be proactive and let the public know that this project is in the works, but there are issues that need to be resolved.

Chair Tobiassen said that another matter is the King Soopers/Albertsons-Safeway program.  Heather Copp indicated that RTD is ready to go into the pilot stores.  Tonya Anderson, Manager of Electronic Fare Operations, remarked that there are three stores that will enter the pilot program.  She stated that King Soopers is not willing to open the program to the rest of their stores until the web portal is live.

#### 4. July 2016 Monthly Financial Status Report

Doug MacLeod, Controller, indicated that the Monthly Financial Status Report still shows a lot of red, but the variances are smaller.  He stated there were sales tax refunds in February and July which negatively impacted our sales and use tax revenues.  He remarked that ridership was 11.9% short, but the fare revenue aligned with the Amended Budget for the month.  He added that CU Leeds will attend the October 18, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee to provide the Board with their September forecast.

#### 5. Quarterly Audit Update

Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager of Internal Audit, stated that staff had included the Quarterly Audit Update in the September 20, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee packet.

Chair Tobiassen commented on the earlier Cyber Security briefing and noted that most assessments are done independently and added that staff should have a cyber-security auditor in the audit department.

### D. Other Matters

Director Bagley said that even though the Board voted against the Mobility Choice action item, he still wants General Manager Genova to serve in the best way he can on the Mobility Choice Board.  He asked that the General Manager provide updates as they are available so that the RTD Board can stay informed.  He added that because the Board did not vote in favor of that item, it did not mean that he should not participate on the Mobility Choice Board.

Director James concurred with Director Bagley and stated that General Manager Genova should continue his work with Mobility Choice.

Chair Tobiassen stated that his tenure on the RTD Board will be ending in a few months, but he hopes that he too can participate with the Mobility Choice Board in some capacity.  He said technology is rapidly changing and he fully supports General Manager Genova being involved and staying in touch with technology as we move forward.

Director Bagley added that he spoke to Don Hunt prior to the committee meeting and stated that he too would like to be involved in any way to assist the Mobility Choice Board.  He recommended that Directors James and Walker do the same.

Director Walker shared in Director Bagley and Director James’ statements.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Menten adjourned the meeting at 8:54 p.m.
