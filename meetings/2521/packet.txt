Board Meeting Date: September 27, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a budget transfer and authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into
any and all contracts or agreements required to provide $500,000 in Regional Transportation District
funding in support of the Mobility Choice Blueprint as articulated in this Board Report.
BACKGROUND
At the June 14, 2016 Operations & Customer Service Committee meeting, RTD staff briefed the Board
regarding the efforts being led by the Denver Metro Chamber to undertake the Mobility Choice Blueprint
study effort. The Board was informed that RTD staff has been participating in discussions with the
Denver Metro Chamber, CDOT and DRCOG about forming a partnership to create an environment
embracing advanced transportation technologies to improve future mobility. To advance this goal, it is
proposed the partners fund a study, called the Mobility Choice Blueprint, to further understand the future
of transportation technology and what is needed to prepare the region for its inevitable expansion.
DISCUSSION
The stated purpose of the Mobility Choice Blueprint is to: Maximize existing investments in the metro
Denver transportation system by leveraging technology to meet future workforce mobility needs,
resulting in enhanced economic opportunity and quality of life. Attachment 1 details the purpose and
outcomes of the Mobility Choice Blueprint initiative.
Once the study is complete, the Blueprint, which includes a significant public involvement process,
would be used to recommend investment priorities for RTD, CDOT and DRCOG intended to assure that
the agency’s investments are well-coordinated and aligned to support future technological and related
advances in transportation. The Blueprint recommendations would not be binding on any participating
agency and it will be at the Board’s sole discretion to accept or pursue any of the plans or
recommendations contained within the report. The plan is for the study to initiate late in 2016 and to be
substantially complete by early 2018.
The Blueprint development would be overseen by a Mobility Choice Board of Directors and the Chamber
will finance the operations of the Board and hiring an executive director. The Board will be made up of
private and public sector leaders and RTD will be a member (See attachment 1 for a list of Board
member names and organizations). The estimated cost of the Blueprint study is $1.5 million and is
proposed to be equally shared among the three public agencies (DRCOG, CDOT and RTD).
Consequently, RTD’s share would be $500,000. The success of this endeavor is contingent on all three
public agencies contributing funding.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

To date, CDOT and DRCOG have taken actions to secure their $500,000 shares. RTD Board approval of
this funding request will allow RTD to have an equal voice with our planning partners in the oversight,
direction and management of the Blueprint.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project is available from projects funds rolled forward from 2015 to 2016 that are no
longer required for that purpose and are available for this priority ($400,000) and expense funds from
the General Manager’s ($50,00) and CFO’s budgets ($50,000).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into
any and all contracts or agreements required to provide $500,000 in Regional Transportation District
funding in support of the Mobility Choice Blueprint as articulated in this Board Report.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not allocate $500,000 to the Mobility Choice Blueprint.
This action is not recommended as it would result in RTD not having a role in the study and could
run counter to RTD’s interests.

MOBILITY CHOICE BLUEPRINT INITIATIVE
FOR THE METRO DENVER AREA
How we move is changing. In the post-war history of mobility in our region, personal cars have
been central to nearly every trip. Getting a driver’s license was a major rite of passage for most
Americans, and owning a car was part of living the American dream. Accordingly, transportation
planning processes were built around that expectation, with a focus on maximizing and
increasing the amount of cars our roads can hold.
But technology is changing these values. Today, Americans spend on average 17 percent of
their household budgets on transportation, largely toward owning and maintaining a car.
Driving is an unproductive commitment of personal time. Meanwhile, connected cars are
already being produced, driverless cars are coming faster than anticipated and the sharing
economy is growing. With that, transportation planning must change.
We are proposing a mobility planning effort that takes into account the types of changes we are
experiencing due to advancing technology and shifting values. By uniting the public and private
sectors we can better plan for the mobility needs of our future workforce. If we don’t act now,
our growth and congestion could work against us when it comes to attracting tomorrow’s
employers.
The Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, the Colorado Department of Transportation, the
Regional Transportation District and the Denver Regional Council of Governments are ready to
embrace a new approach to planning for connected mobility in the metro Denver area.

Our Purpose
Maximize existing investments in the metro Denver transportation system by leveraging
technology to meet future workforce mobility needs, resulting in enhanced economic
opportunity and quality of life.

The Mobility Choice Organization
Mobility Choice is a partnership among the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, Colorado
Department of Transportation, Regional Transportation District, and Denver Regional Council of
Governments. Mobility Choice is the non-profit overseeing the preparation of the 2030
Blueprint, supporting a process and generating a document that will articulate how metro
Denver can join together public and private interests, incorporate technological change and
opportunity, and provide alignment for strategic transportation investment.

Budget Transfer for SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit
Environmental Clearance and Basic Engineering

CFO/AGM,

Date: September 13, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 27, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a transfer of $3.5 million from the Planning expense grant project budget to a new
capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Corridor, which will permit staff to seek
consultant services for assistance in the preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
review and Advanced Basic Engineering services. A total of $1.5 million in funding for this project
was approved in the 2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense grant budget, and the remaining
funds are planned for 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
BACKGROUND
RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), in April 2013. The purpose of the study
was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the
Northwest-area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and businesses, on cost effective and
efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area. On June 24, 2014, the Board approved
a resolution which accepted the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the NAMS stakeholders
for priorities within the Northwest Study Area. One of the highest priorities, as described in the
Final Consensus Statement, was to proceed into advanced planning, environmental clearance and
preliminary engineering to establish Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor from Longmont
to Boulder.
As part of the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) process, the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) included the SH 119 BRT Corridor in the Fiscally Constrained 2040 RTP.
Inclusion of the corridor in the RTP is required before National Environmental Planning Act (NEPA)
clearance can be completed.
In order to advance this effort, DRCOG awarded RTD $1 million in Congestion Mitigation / Air
Quality grant funds for Fiscal Year 2016 to further environmental planning and engineering efforts in
the corridor. RTD would need to obligate these funds by September 2017 or risk losing the funding
to another project.
The cost to establish BRT in the corridor is estimated to be approximately $57 million in 2013
dollars. Staff assumes that grants will provide funding for approximately half of this cost. The
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) includes $60 million in Base System funds (with $30 million assumed to
be from grant sources) for construction of the corridor beginning in 2022.
This action fits within the General Manager Goal to Improve Service Delivery, specifically the sub
goal of enhancing or expanding operations, as the eventual completion of BRT in the SH 119 corridor
will increase service reliability, ridership and cost effectiveness of the service.

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.2

DISCUSSION
RTD will require extensive consultant services to complete the NEPA environmental clearances and
basic engineering prior to BRT construction in the SH 119 Corridor. Staff estimates those consultant
services to cost $3.5 million. RTD has received $1 million in DRCOG grant funds for Fiscal Year
2016 for this effort, with RTD providing the remainder of the project cost. Staff expects the effort
to span approximately 2.5 years, and these funds were programmed in the 2016 expense budget
and in the years 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 SBP to match the anticipated project schedule.
However, the full contract amount must be appropriated up front in order to issue a Request for
Proposals (RFP) because the project is a capital project. The budget transfer will allow staff to issue
an RFP for consultant services in November 2016 and award the contract in February, 2017. Based
on the 2.5 year schedule described above, the environmental clearances and basic engineering would
be completed by July 2019.
Should RTD pursue BRT construction in this corridor, as prioritized by the NAMS Final Consensus
Statement, the SH 119 BRT project would be subject to approval by a two-thirds vote of the RTD
Board. In addition, DRCOG SB 208 approval would be required as this project would be defined as a
rapid transit corridor project. The expectation is that the funding breakdown for future BRT
construction in the corridor would be as follows:



50 percent from RTD Base System Funds; and
50 percent from grant sources, such as DRCOG Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)
funds, and/or Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Small Starts funding.

Project construction would occur within the 2022 to 2025 timeframe. And, as noted, future Board
action would be required to approve construction of BRT in this corridor.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding that will be used for this project is available from projects funds rolled forward from 2015 to
2016 that are no longer required for that purpose and are available for this priority. Because these funds
were programmed in 2017 and 2018 SBP, funds will be made available in those years by funding the
project now.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a transfer of $3.5 million from the
Planning expense grant project budget to a new capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) Corridor, which will permit staff to seek consultant services for assistance in
the preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Advanced Basic
Engineering services. A total of $1.5 million in funding for this project was approved in the
2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense grant budget, and the remaining funds are
planned for 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer at
this time. Instead, include this request as part of the 2017 Recommended Budget. This
action is not recommended since it will delay the procurement of consultant services for the
SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor by at least two months.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer;
instead wait until the full $3.5 million for consultant services is available in 2018 on the
schedule included in the SBP. This action is not recommended since it would delay

Packet Pg. 8

1.B.2

procurement of consultant services for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor until early
2018 and would likely delay future construction of the corridor, thereby subjecting
construction to cost escalation. This action would likely cause the forfeiture of the $1 million
in DRCOG TIP funds, which were awarded to advance the NEPA / Basic Engineering effort in
the corridor, which would increase RTD’s local funding required to advance the project.
4. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer and
do not proceed forward with procuring consultant services to assist staff in the preparation of
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Advanced Basic Engineering services for
the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor. This action is not recommended given the
considerable commitment on the part of RTD and the Northwest Area stakeholders to reach
the consensus prioritizing SH 119 as the highest-priority BRT corridor in the Northwest Area.
Furthermore, this action would require RTD to forfeit $1 million in DRCOG TIP funds, which
were awarded to advance the NEPA / Basic Engineering effort in the corridor.

Purchase

Cybersecurity

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial, Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into contract negotiations with Parsons
Corporation to retain this firm for work order-based cybersecurity consulting services to support
RTD’s cybersecurity program. The estimated cost of the Cybersecurity Services Work Order Contract
of $1,818,700 includes security risk assessment, technical testing, control design, and control
implementation activities and will be funded from the cybersecurity operations and maintenance
budget approved for 2016 forward. Actual expenditures will be based on work orders constructed
and issued by the cybersecurity project team, but are not to exceed the total budgeted for this
contract.
BACKGROUND
The Cybersecurity Manager and IT leadership require the support of a qualified subcontracting firm to
uncover and address security deficiencies and improve the sustainability of security controls within
RTD’s technology environment. RTD has identified cybersecurity as a priority for 2016 and onward,
and with good reason: assessments from 2014, 2015, and 2016 revealed that some of RTD’s
critical systems require some level of retrofit in order to secure them to the latest industry standards.
Designing and implementing ongoing, sustainable security controls that keep RTD’s technology
secure and well-monitored reduces the risk of operational disruptions that could result in loss of
service to our customers, reduces the risk of a breach of confidential information, and enhances the
overall safety and reliability of our system.
This work order contract will allow RTD to retain the services of a single security firm and their team
of technical consultants to assist with the implementation of RTD-defined cybersecurity projects.
Service categories included in the scope of the contract include:
 Security Risk Assessment
 Security Technical Testing (Vulnerability Testing or Penetration Testing)
 Security Control Design
 Security Control Implementation
Despite the best efforts of the onboard cybersecurity staff, RTD requires external assistance to fully
and effectively address control and compliance gaps that were identified in past years’ assessments
as well as continue to mature the cybersecurity program. The primary areas targeted for continued
assessment and enhancement, such as control systems and fare collection systems, employ
specialized technologies and/or are subject to regulatory compliance requirements. Security
assessment and control design in these areas requires the involvement of personnel with specific
certifications and expertise that RTD does not presently have on staff. Security control
implementation furthermore requires a full-time dedicated project team to make reasonable progress
in retrofitting security controls to our existing environments as well as to develop self-sustaining
systems and processes to ensure systems do not fall into disrepair.

Packet Pg. 10

1.B.3

Parsons can not only provide the required certified expertise, but also bring to bear the necessary
volume of technical resources needed to plan and implement security improvements in a timely
manner. Parsons’ staff will work in conjunction with and at the direction of RTD’s Cybersecurity
Manager and Senior IT Security Analyst to ensure their efforts align with RTD’s agency-wide, IT, and
cybersecurity objectives and that resulting processes and maintenance recommendations are
realistically executable by RTD’s current and future staff following the project closure.
DISCUSSION
The intent of the Cybersecurity Services Work Order Contract is to provide a vehicle to engage
skilled cybersecurity resources using an abbreviated procurement process (work orders) in order to
maintain the necessary engagement agility to meet the District’s needs with a firm with whom we
can build a consistent, sustained relationship anchored by our cybersecurity program objectives. Past
major assessments and security retrofits within the RTD technology environment, such as the
assessment and improvements to the fare collection environments, were individually contracted on a
project-by-project basis to outside firms. It was discovered through this experience that the general
Request for Proposal process was neither agile enough, nor was contractor engagement consistent
and sustained enough, for RTD to react in a timely manner to urgent security needs driven by
business problems or incidents, or to benefit holistically from security program improvements. The
work order process will allow us to collapse wait times and sustain program development efforts by
working with one pre-approved retained firm.
Following RTD’s Procurement process, the Information Technology department issued a Request for
Proposal to identify a qualified cybersecurity firm. A selection committee evaluated and identified the
best candidate, Parsons Corporation, to meet RTD’s needs. The proposed partnership would allow
RTD to retain Parsons for an initial period of two (2) years with an option to extend services for three
(3) individual years, for a total potential contract period of five (5) years. Given that this is a work
order contract, it will be RTD’s responsibility construct, issue, and negotiate individual work orders
with Parsons for specific security services over the course the engagement period.
The requested funds include tiered consultant staff hours (i.e. project manager, senior, specialist,
intermediate, and junior) that were estimated by RTD as needed to support RTD projects among the
aforementioned service categories at the time the proposal was drafted. Actual expenditures for the
engagement will be determined by the type, scope, and number of work orders issued by RTD and
vetted by Parsons, though they shall not exceed RTD’s total budgeted amounts.
It is worth noting that the current RTD cybersecurity team consists of the Cybersecurity Manager
and the recently added Senior IT Security Analyst, both reporting the Information Technology
department. This team will provide direction and leadership to the contracted consultants. It is
expected that as RTD’s internal cybersecurity resources increase, reliance on the external contracting
firm will decrease over time.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total estimated cost of the Cybersecurity Services Work Order Contract, with options, is
$1,818,700. This amount bridges the five (5) year potential contract period. For 2016 and 2017,
$758,200 of the total amount (the base cost) was budgeted and approved for this purpose via the
Strategic Budget Planning process. Future years’ operating expenses will be reflected in future
years’ Strategic Budget Plan.

Packet Pg. 11

1.B.3

Any additional funding planned or anticipated to implement hardware or software improvements
recommended by the consultant technical team to improve security are separately budgeted in the
appropriate category (capital or expense) for 2017 forward.
ALTERNATIVES
The available alternatives include:
 Approve the work order contract with Parsons Corporation. This is the recommended action
to ensure that RTD has the immediately available and consistent support of a qualified
cybersecurity contractor to meet current and future needs.
 Increase internal cybersecurity staffing. At least five (5) immediate full time employees will be
required to fulfill the service and skill requirements that would otherwise be fulfilled by the
work order contract. While it is recommended that we augment the internal cybersecurity
team over time, foregoing services in favor of staffing is not the recommended action because
current employment market conditions may make it difficult to find qualified staff in the near
term, and our security improvement efforts will consequently be indefinitely delayed.
 Do not approve the contract with Parsons Corporation and do not increase cybersecurity
staffing (do nothing). This is not the recommended action because the onboard staff does not
currently have the human capacity to perform the identified security improvement work in a
timely, effective manner, and RTD requires specialized skill sets to complete some of the
necessary work.

2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 13, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 27, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
This action item meets policy requirements and the General Manager’s goals of Fiscal
Sustainability/Financial Plan by effecting current and long-range budgeting in a timely manner.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statement – Capital Improvement Policies 1, Budget Policies 13 and 14
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement states that “On an annual basis, RTD will
prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital
construction and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and
operating programs.”
The SBP is RTD’s six year financial plan. Updated annually, it provides important cash flow planning
information used to determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as
services that the District can provide using projected financial resources. The first year of the SBP
serves as the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
Each year during the SBP process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed to
support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal and
interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the District. The
other major component of the SBP is the estimate of available revenues during the six-year time period.
These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will have adequate
resources to meet cash flow needs.
Per RTD Fiscal Policy Statement, RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use
tax forecasting containing projections for the short term (one year), medium term (SBP) and long term
(FasTracks APE). RTD has contracted with the University of Colorado-Leeds School of Business for this
service. See “sales and use tax” in Discussion below.
Capital and operating/maintenance projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits,
relative need, and to what extent they meet the RTD mission statement; projects are constrained to
operate within the forecast of revenues and funding sources available for their completion and operation.

Packet Pg. 13

1.B.4

The SBP also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit funding through the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council of Governments.
The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal funding. RTD
cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying SBP projects are included in the TIP.
The 2017-2022 SBP includes service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales and use
taxes. Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2017-2022 are presented
separately in the FasTracks financial plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached SBP incorporates the 2016 amended budget and includes all known adjustments and best
estimates at this time. The SBP was presented to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee on
August 9th for discussion; final presentation follows on September 20th with staff recommendation for
Board adoption on September 27th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2017-2022 projected cash flow through the extension of the
2016 Amended Budget.
The column titled “Adjusted Amended Budget 2016” in Exhibit I
incorporates revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget and by amendment
to the Amended Budget, and subsequent known items.
The SBP is balanced through the six year period after incorporating into the projections 1) the March
sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business, 2) minimum/must-have SBP requested
projects including minimum fleet requirements, 3) reductions, eliminations or deferrals of non-critical
SBP requested projects, 4) use of the Capital Acquisition reserve fund to support planned fleet
purchases, 5) restoration of reserve funds, and 6) no new debt issued. No service reductions are
proposed in the SBP through this period.
Exhibit I summarizes the 2017-2022 projected cash flow activity based on the staff recommendation
incorporating the following:
 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $117.5 million in 2017 is projected to be unchanged from 2016. The
year 2016 is budgeted to have an 8% fare revenue increase due to the fare rate
restructure and increase. Future fare revenue increases are planned for 2019 and 2022
per the Board policy of consideration of a 10% fare rate increase every 3 years. After
2016, which contains a 1.5% ridership increase, the SBP conservatively assumes no
increase in ridership through 2022. (Line 1)
 Sales and use tax incorporates the March semi-annual update from the CU-Leeds School of
Business for the years 2016-2022. The year 2016 is budgeted using the low growth
Below-Trend forecast and years 2017-2022 is projected using the medium growth
Baseline forecast. (Line 2)
o CU-Leeds presents probabilistic high and low forecast bounds in their forecasts that
incorporate possible errors, computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a
0.67 probability exists that the interval between low and high forecast values will
contain the actual value of the variable being predicted. The upper bound estimate
is 6.8% higher than the medium baseline forecast. This shows that it is not
impossible or unrealistic that revenue could grow somewhat strongly over the next
2 years. Likewise, economic threats pose downside risk to the forecast with a
6.8% lower bound.



Grant revenue estimates are based upon past trends, formula allocations, known proceeds,
and recent congressional actions. Amounts are escalated at the area Consumer Price
Index (CPI) (obtained from Moody’s) or as identified. (Line 3)
 Other income consists of on-going advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, and IGA and
miscellaneous rental income, escalated at the CPI beginning in 2017. (Line 4)
 Operating expenses (excluding depreciation):
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates and then adjusted for known items and
necessary reductions. The area CPI rates follow: (Line 6)
2017:
3.0%
2018:
3.1%
2019:
3.0%
2020:
2.7%
2021:
2.7%
2022:
2.7%
 Service increase consists of the cost of new CMAQ-funded service projects to be operated
by RTD in years 2016-2019 to include service enhancements on Routes L and 324, Route
73 extension, Superior and Broomfield call-n-Ride services, and Anschutz Medical Campus
Shuttle. These services are included in the DRCOG TIP. RTD costs will be reimbursed in
full by CMAQ grant funds and contributed funds from the applicable municipalities.
Determination will be made in future years whether to continue such service at RTD’s
cost. (Line 7)
 Costs of operating the West Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide I-225, the H-Line
extension and SERE are allocated from Base to FasTracks based on resource drivers on a
full-allocation basis in years 2017-2022, and thus, Base total expenses are reduced by the
amount of the allocation. In years prior to 2017, the allocation was made on an
incremental basis, to be changed to full allocation including administrative and support
costs beginning in 2017. (Line 8)
 Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated amount through
2017 plus an adjustment at the CPI in to capture current higher costs, and then escalated
at the CPI rate for 2018-2022. (Line 9)
 Diesel fuel is forecast at an estimated lock price of $2.00/gallon in 2017 and then
escalated at the national CPI rates as follows: (Line 10)
2018:
3.0%
2019:
2.8%
2020:
2.5%
2021:
2.3%
2022:
2.3%
 Gasoline is forecast at $2.65/gallon in 2017 based on recent average prices plus an
upward adjustment, and then escalated at the national CPI rates above. (Line 10)
 In the line item for expense projects (O&M), the following are included: 1) specifically
identified minimum/must-have operating and maintenance projects (also termed “expense
projects”), detailed in Exhibit III, 2) an amount for new operating projects brought into the
SBP based on available cash flow; specific projects will be determined from the deferred
project list in Exhibit IV. (Line 11)
 The FasTracks service increase, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base System,
increases by the CPI rate serially each year. (Line 12)
 Interest income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in investable
balances and forecasted interest rates per forward rate curves. (Line 15)

Packet Pg. 15

1.B.4

 Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each year (for
current debt and future debt as applicable) by using debt amortization schedules. Interest
expense is forecast only on existing debt balances because the plan assumes no new debt
issued through 2022. (Line 16)
 In the line item for capital expenditures, the following are included: 1) specifically identified
minimum/must-have capital projects plus the minimum required new fleet, detailed in Exhibit
II; dollar amounts of the new fleet will be determined so as not to exceed cash flow
constraints determined in the SBP model, 2) an amount for new capital projects brought into
the SBP based on available cash flow; specific projects will be determined from the deferred
project list in Exhibit IV, and 3) COP- or bond-funded carry-forward capital expenditures. (Line
19)
 The Fiscal Policy Statement establishes a Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement
fund.
 Staff recommends that funding of the Board-appropriated fund be maintained at a
minimum of $3 million each year until the fund reaches a balance of $35 million, projected
to occur in 2021. (Lines 20 and 33)
 Staff recommends that the capital replacement fund be refunded nominally to $2.7 million
in 2017 per available cash flow, used in years 2018-2020 for fleet purchases, then
replenished to $20 million in 2021 and the entire balance used to support fleet
expenditures in 2022. Per the 2016 Amended Budget, the capital replacement fund was
used in its entirety in 2016 for fleet acquisition. (Lines 21 and 34)
 The Fiscal Policy Statement in Fund Balance Policy 4 allows for the designation of an
unrestricted operating fund used to respond to unanticipated events, including revenue
shortfalls. The unrestricted operating reserve is established in 2017 and funded with available
cash flow. The plan will apply available dollars toward the operating fund so it reaches a
minimum $25 million in 2020, and reaches $46.4 million in 2022. (Lines 22 and 35)
 The Board-appropriated fund and unrestricted operating reserve fund (and not the capital
acquisition fund) in total are projected to reach $81.4 million in 2022.
 A placeholder is established for Transfer to FasTracks for Base System support of FasTracks
operations. Any transfer to FasTracks is not expected to occur until after 2022. (Line 23)
 Financing proceeds represent COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition in
accordance with fleet schedules, net of grant funding and use of capital acquisition fund. No
new debt is issued during the SBP term in order to maintain required debt service coverage.
(Line 25)
 Principal payments on debt are derived from individual debt instruments outstanding during
each year (for current debt and future debt as applicable) by using debt amortization
schedules. Principal payments are forecast only on existing debt balances. (Line 26)
 Other line items consist of the roll-over of the unrestricted fund ending balance at 12/31/15,
estimated changes to restricted reserves, and the use of previously-issued COP-bond proceeds
for future year capital expenditures. (Lines 29, 30, and 31)
 The SBP is balanced during the six-year period as shown by the positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance. The objective is to maintain a nominal unrestricted year-end fund balance of $2
million each year through 2022 while supporting a minimum critical level of capital and
expense projects and building reserve fund balances. (Line 32)

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its SBP for any Title VI
impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the SBP will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior to
final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the SBP, Title VI impacts are
reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements (repairs,
replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. The Title VI review will be provided and a
statement from the Planning Department to this effect is attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff-recommended SBP provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance in each year of the SBP while substantially growing reserve fund balances. However,
uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales tax revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and supplies, as well
as economic conditions will continue to have an impact on the SBP and may challenge staff to present
new options and solutions during the 2017 budget period.
Current key financial (fund balance) indicators for the SBP are:

ALTERNATIVES

Packet Pg. 17

1.B.4

1. Adoption of the 2017-2022 SBP, incorporating all items currently in the recommendation by staff and
the other items identified above. This is the recommended action.
2. Defer the adoption of a 2017-2022 SBP to a later date. This is not recommended because the SBP
identifies the capital programs, expenditures, and service guidelines for the 2017 budget process and
adoption of the SBP serves as a confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for the 2017 Budget.
3. Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2017-2022 SBP.
This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the SBP adoption and possible delay in the
2017 budget process.

In 2013, Rail Operations and the Planning Department
Districtwide
determined that eighteen (18) Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs)
would need to be purchased in order to meet the demands of
the existing LRT system and accommodate the opening of the
I-225 line in 2016. This analysis led to the current
procurement of twelve (12) vehicles that was included in the
2015-2017 capital budget plan. In order to bring the spare
ratio to a desired 20% minimum and meet the anticipated
growth in ridership, we need to purchase seventeen (17)
additional vehicles by 2020 (2 will be purchased by
FasTracks). This will increase the fleet from 184 to 201. The
order for these vehicles was placed in 2015.

In the years of 2016 and 2017, RTD will receive a FASTER
grant stipend from CDOT for State of Good Repair type
projects. These funds will be used to fund RTD projects that
would otherwise have been funded by RTD Base system
funds. However, as part of this stipend, CDOT expects RTD to
provide an additional $150,000 of grants to local governments
for transit projects. The funds from this SBP request will be
added to the SBP Local Government pool so that RTD can
meet the terms of the FASTER stipend and have a meaningful
pool of funds to respond to local government requests.

Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, is a
technology consisting of computer components and recording
media used to retain digital information. It is a core function
and fundamental component of computers. The central
processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates raw
information by performing computations. In practice, almost
all computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but
expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and
slower but larger and cheaper options farther away.
In computing, a portfolio of storage products, including online
storage, near-online (nearline) storage, storage networking,
archiving, de-duplication, storage and backup software are
required to run the Enterprise.

database servers also host the TIES, CAD/AVL/REALTIME
and other application databases. All these business
applications will benefit and will be supported on the new
Exadata Servers. 2. Replace 3 Exalogic X3-2 application
Servers with 3 Exalogic X5-2 servers in 2018 .
TIES/REALTIME/SINGLE SIGN-ON/CONTENT SERVER/

Rider Alert System

Communications is looking to implement a Rider Alert System Blake Street
in order to communicate up-to-the-minute service alerts for
Office
our riders in timely manner. The system will include a webbased interface that allows staff to create and manage the
thousands of service alerts that are sent out each year. The
Alert System will be intuitive and fast to use, allowing simple
alerts to be created in seconds. At the same time, the system
will offer fine-grained control over selecting the specific route,
branch, trip, or stop an alert applies to, when an alert is in
effect, and by what channels (like emails, text messages,
electronic signs, agency website, General Transit Feed
Specification real-time feeds and third party apps) the alerts
should be disseminated. The system will use templates to
automatically generate appropriate messages for all the
dissemination channels.

Mobile Ticketing

This project is a GM initiative to enhance fare products by
Blake Street
offering a mobile application for the purchase and use of fare Office
and parking products. Mobile ticketing applications are
available from many third parties and can be used on any
mobile device. There is very little need for infrastructure or
customization of software. A user simply downloads the
mobile ticketing application to their device and purchases and
manages any of RTD's fare products or pays for parking. The
user purchases the product needed with a credit card and
receives the value of their payment on their mobile device for
immediate use. The user then activates (validates) each ride
by simply selecting the fare product to be used each time a
boarding occurs. The mobile application vendor maintains the
software and is the administrator of payments thereby
meeting PCI compliance. Any of RTD's fare products may be
used with mobile ticketing which offers a single, convenient
source and use of products. The vendor manages the data
and payments and sends a single payment for all transactions
during a given time period to RTD. Vendors also provide data
and analytical tools regarding the transactions on the
application. Industry standards for cost structure are an initial
small set-up fee then a % of mobile ticketing sales.

CCTV Retrofit on LRV

This project is requested to replace 189 LRV CCTV recorders Districtwide
and cameras that have surpassed their useful lives and install
new system configuration. This retrofit has been designed to
match CCTV systems that are currently specified within the
new bus orders for standardization. These modern systems
also provide the ability to remotely retrieve video from the
Security Command Center. Installation includes a complete
removal of old analog systems and re-wiring to work with new
digital technology. This includes new mobile network video
server/recorder, high definition cameras, mobile network
switches, and mobile routers. In addition, the LRVs are to be
outfitted with forward facing and cab operation cameras to aid
in the investigations of accidents. Forward facing cameras will
assist by providing information as to the status of signals,
switches and crossings as vehicles move along the rail
system. This request is to provide funding to complete the
upgrades over a period of 5 years.

alignment is 22 years old and has been in service since
inception. For the most part this infrastructure has reached its
potential lifespan. There are several projects in place to make
repairs and replace the worst of the defects but an overall
plan is needed to replace all track, turnout switches, street
crossings, concrete flat work, etc. Please see the attached
report from MOW and SGR, highlighting the condition of the
infrastructure in the area. This is a six year plan. The
alignment will be divided into segments that can be
completely refurbished within the span of one construction
season. Our estimates are at a cost of $2,000,000 per year
for 6 years.
Many of the existing metal halide, glow top, pole light fixtures Southwest Rail

Property Survey
Records System-Wide

Currently whenever RTD acquires or disposes off any
Districtwide
property right (fee simple, easement, or license agreement), it
utilizes an external survey firm (Jacobs) to establish the
location of that property right on the ground, and prepare
Right-of-Way maps, legal descriptions and exhibits. The
contract with Jacobs will expire at the end of 2016. Jacobs
has surveys, Computer Aided Design (CAD) files, information
on adjoining properties, subdivision plats, ALTA surveys, legal
descriptions, and other electronic and paper records
regarding RTD properties going back to 1997. The extent of
this information is estimated to be 2 to 4 terabytes, which
could be equated to 76,000 to 152,000 bankers boxes of
information. These documents also include information on
utilities that cross or service RTD stations, rail lines, Park-nRides, and other properties.

This project is to sort through Jacobs property survey records,
bring this information within RTD, and organize it on an
engineering GIS platform. Initially, the system will house
information on properties, utilities, track, pnRs, crossings, and
structures. The system can be expanded to include other
items such as catenary system. The property survey
information is critical to the system and needs to be brought
within RTD. This project will strengthen the foundation of
many District-wide efforts by obtaining and organizing RTD
property rights, utility, and other information in an easily

project. RTD would be required to provide a 25 percent local
match of $250,000. Given the results of the Northwest Area
Mobility Study, which showed substantial bus ridership
increases from modest capital improvements made to arterial
corridors, there has been much interest from other areas of
the District for RTD to make arterial BRT investments in other
corridors. The purpose of this study will be to examine the
potential for arterial BRT investments throughout the entire
District and prioritize for future capital investment those
corridors which perform the highest.

- pedestrian improvements
- bike access improvements
- improved bike storage
- expanded or new drop off/pick up areas

The RTD Continuous Improvement program is a "lean process Civic Center
improvement for government" initiative undertaken in
Plaza (CCP)
response to employee concerns voiced in the 2015 Employee
Survey. The initiatives have met with exceptional early
success improving communication and collaboration by
addressing employee frustrations through training in process
improvement and continued support from staff to employ tools
that identify and eliminate waste and frustrations.

Risk, Resiliency & Sustainability Analyst
This position would assist and/or complete risk analyses on
assets not in a state of good repair and other projects, work
with engineering and designers to make our assets more
resilient to major weather events like floods, blizzards, etc.,
along with being part of the current sustainability processes.
Process Improvement & Quality Assurance Analyst
This position would participate in managing change throughout
the District by supporting operations in deviation management
(investigations, root cause analysis) corrective and preventive
actions, process improvement, performing internal audits, and

1 FTE: Continuous
Improvement Manager

RTD Policy Analysis staff began piloting the training and
support in November 2015 based on the City and County of
Denver's Peak Performance model. By the end of February
2016, 140 employees have received the four-hour "Green
Belt" training and another 28 employees the week-long "Black
Belt" training with principal efforts focused in Platte Bus
Maintenance and Customer Care pilots. These pilots have
identified more than 100 potential innovations to date with an
estimated $750,000 in soft dollar (efficiency) savings and
more than $20,000 in hard dollar (capital) savings. Last year,
Denver’s program realized $4.5 million in savings through the
program. Staff has also begun Continuous Improvement
Alliances (CIA) pilots in Rail Operations and will soon conduct
"Rapid Improvement Event" workshops on specific issues
affecting the agency, e.g., the hiring process, performance
management, etc.

The ADA Manager continues to boost involvement on
accessible design (plan reviews, site visits, and inspections)
District-wide. The need for a perspective on accessible design
has been well received and needs more and continued
attention and support. This proactive approach ensures
compliance and mitigates potential problems. This
effort/involvement has been effective in identifying and
preventing costly and litigious issues from escalating, but
efforts are spread thin and not all projects receive this type of
attention.
Currently whenever RTD acquires or disposes off any property Districtwide
right (fee simple, easement, or license agreement), it utilizes
an external survey firm (Jacobs) to establish the location of
that property right on the ground, and prepare Right-of-Way
maps, legal descriptions and exhibits. The contract with
Jacobs will expire at the end of 2016. Jacobs has surveys,
Computer Aided Design (CAD) files, information on adjoining
properties, subdivision plats, ALTA surveys, legal
descriptions, and other electronic and paper records regarding
RTD properties going back to 1997. The extent of this
information is estimated to be 2 to 4 terabytes, which could be
equated to 76,000 to 152,000 bankers boxes of information.
These documents also include information on utilities that
cross or service RTD stations, rail lines, Park-n-Rides, and
other properties.
Organizations that have assets in various geographic
locations typically utilize Geographic Information Systems
(GIS) to record and analyze their asset base. Utilities and local
municipalities are examples of such organizations. RTD has
been using GIS systems for about 15 years. Currently, these
systems are used mostly used by the Telephone Information
Center (TIC), Scheduling (Transtar), and CAD/AVL. RTD is
also getting started on projects like real-time train arrival
information, which would also need GIS support.

Information Storage Unit RTD relies heavily on its storage units to house 95% of all
District information and computing services. A wide range of
Replacement
departments and applications use these storage units to store
mission-critical data.
Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, is a
technology consisting of computer components and recording
media used to retain digital information. It is a core function
and fundamental component of computers. The central
processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates raw
information by performing computations. In practice, almost all
computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but
expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and
slower but larger and cheaper options farther away.
In computing, a portfolio of storage products, including online
storage, near-online (nearline) storage, storage networking,
archiving, de-duplication, storage and backup software are
required to run the Enterprise.

will be intuitive and fast to use, allowing simple alerts to be
created in seconds. At the same time, the system will offer finegrained control over selecting the specific route, branch, trip,
or stop an alert applies to, when an alert is in effect, and by
what channels (like emails, text messages, electronic signs,
agency website, General Transit Feed Specification real-time

features of the interface will include:
● General:
○ Integration with RTD website, email communications, text

○ Intuitive and fast-to-use interface
○ Differentiation between detour, disruption, emergency,
service change, event detour, etc.
○ Ability to send out stop, route, branch, trip alerts

This project is a GM initiative to enhance fare products by
Blake Street
offering a mobile application for the purchase and use of fare Office
and parking products. Mobile ticketing applications are
available from many third parties and can be used on any
mobile device. There is very little need for infrastructure or
customization of software. A user simply downloads the
mobile ticketing application to their device and purchases and
manages any of RTD's fare products or pays for parking. The
user purchases the product needed with a credit card and
receives the value of their payment on their mobile device for
immediate use. The user then activates (validates) each ride
by simply selecting the fare product to be used each time a
boarding occurs. The mobile application vendor maintains the
software and is the administrator of payments thereby meeting
PCI compliance. Any of RTD's fare products may be used with
mobile ticketing which offers a single, convenient source and
use of products. The vendor manages the data and payments
and sends a single payment for all transactions during a given
time period to RTD. Vendors also provide data and analytical
tools regarding the transactions on the application. Industry
standards for cost structure are an initial small set-up fee then
a % of mobile ticketing sales.

RTD needs technology to operate efficiently and to compete
Civic Center
effectively. But as reliance on IT grows, the resources needed Plaza (CCP)
to support this increasingly complex IT environment may not.
In many areas, IT resources are limited and can be quickly
overwhelmed. We have seen from prior instances that if we
fall behind in keeping up with things such as backups, patches
and security, the odds greatly increase that RTD will face an
IT outage or another problem down the road that will
negatively impact RTD business. For instance, once RTD rolls
out real-time information to the customer and we have an
outage, it will negatively impact customers' view of RTD.
Another example is constantly keeping up to date with security
patches which, if not applied, will leave security vulnerabilities
open in the system. Managed Services support will help IT to
keep current with all these patches on a regular basis.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather
Copp,
Administration

Date:

September 12, 2016

Subject:

Discussion and Action of the 2016 Annual
Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial Plan

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 13, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 27, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial Plan as outlined below.
BACKGROUND
RTD has been conducting an Annual Program Evaluation since 2007. Given the challenges of managing
a multi-billion dollar capital program, it is desirable to perform a complete analysis of the cost of the
program. The APE captures all project expenditures to date and all planned expenditures through the
year 2019 on a project-by-project basis. It essentially provides a baseline capital budget for boardapproved projects currently underway or planned in the near future.
Since most of the funded FasTracks projects are complete or under construction, the major effort of the
APE has shifted from developing accurate estimates of costs to one of managing the projects within the
Board-approved budgets for those projects and ensuring that RTD will have the future financial capacity
to operate the corridors and meet its debt service obligations. Therefore, the FasTracks financial plan
provides an overall long-term financial plan for RTD, and includes forecasts for both FasTracks and the
base system through 2040. The staff provides the Board with regular updates on the FasTracks projects
throughout the year.
DISCUSSION
The project-by-project cost along with the amount spent through 2015 is shown in the attached
presentation. The total FasTracks budget through 2019 is approximately $5.6 billion, and approximately
$4.3 billion of this total was spent through the end of 2015.
Since most of the funded FasTracks projects are complete or under construction and are being managed
within the Board approved budgets, the project cost changes to this APE are relatively small. The
changes primarily reflect updates to project scope and timing, or work that has been completed under
budget, as shown on the attached presentation (Attachment A).
The project cost changes for the 2016 APE are summarized below:





Changes to the timing and project scope for the US 36 BRT:
o Funding for BRT vehicle enhancements deferred from 2018 until 2030 to coincide with
the replacement of the current bus fleet
o Deferral of the Church Ranch platform relocation
o Addition of additional vertical circulation at the Broomfield station, to be completed by
2018
Increase in unit cost for the additional light rail vehicles
Additional funds required for project closeout staffing

Packet Pg. 44

1.B.5







Projects with environmental and planning work completed under the 2015 APE budget:
o Northwest Rail Segment 2
o Southwest Corridor Extension
o Central Corridor Extension
Other projects completed under the APE budget:
o Existing Corridor Improvements (Southeast, Central, CPV)
o Railroad ROW
o Communication System Upgrades
o Northeast Area Transportation Evaluation (NATE)
Reduction in program wide capital costs

Future implementation of projects not included in the current APE would require identification of funding
sources for construction and operations, and would require approval of the Board. Therefore, the APE is
a dynamic tool, which is updated as projects move towards completion and any changes approved by
the Board are incorporated.
The FasTracks financial plan incorporates updated revenue forecasts that show a decrease in short and
medium-term revenue forecasts for both FasTracks and the base system. With these updated forecasts,
annual revenues are projected to be lower than the 2015 APE forecasts in each year through 2025. In
addition, the total cumulative revenue forecast is lower than the 2015 APE forecast through 2034.
Between 2035 and 2040, total forecast revenues are projected to be higher than the 2015 forecast.
This reduced revenue forecast is expected to have multiple impacts on the financial plan. RTD’s net
debt service coverage is expected to be close to the 1.20x Board policy limit through 2022. As a result,
once the remaining FasTracks debt approved in May 2016 is issued, RTD will not have the capacity to
issue additional bonds or Certificates of Participation (COPs) until 2023.
In 2012, the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) was established and “all funding identified
through the process will be added to the FISA until enough funding is accumulated to complete and
operate additional projects.” In addition to completing and operating additional projects, the specific
project goals of the FISA were to:
 Complete the US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project:
 Construct North Metro to at least 72nd;
 Any remaining funds above the $300 million goal could leverage potential grants or private sector
contributions for FasTracks partially funded projects (at the RTD Board’s discretion)
However, in 2021 through 2024 all FISA funds available will be needed to fund FasTracks corridor
operations and maintenance. In 2024 through 2030 base system funding is also needed to fund
FasTracks operations and maintenance. After 2030, FasTracks revenues are projected to cover all
operations and maintenance of the FasTracks corridors. At that time, positive fund balances begin to
accumulate on both the base system and FasTracks, with the larger share accumulating on the base
system.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The project cost changes in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation are projected to result in a total cost
savings of $14.7 million. Approximately $1.2 million of these savings will be offset by the loss of a
CDOT FASTER grant for the Church Ranch platform relocation. The net savings of $13.5 million will be
restored to the FISA between 2016 and 2018.

1.B.5

After listening to input from the Board and stakeholder, the staff recommended option is the modified
baseline option. It is listed below (See Attachment B).








Need to take a total of $130.8 million from the base system in 2024-2030 to balance FasTracks
Issue COPs in base system in 2023 for $59.2 million for bus purchases. All other base capital
expenditures through 2040 are pay-go
Build Board appropriated and operating reserves in base systems to maintain equivalent of 3
months of operating reserves consistently through 2040
FISA is utilized to fund FasTracks operations and maintenance in years 2021-2024
Keep FasTracks reserves equivalent to 3 months O&M
As FasTracks unrestricted balances start to accumulate in 2031, those balances are transferred
to the FISA. No balances are transferred in years 2038 or 2039 as funds are need to fund
FasTracks EIS commitments
At year-end 2040, Base System unrestricted fund balance is projected to be $1,317.2 million,
FISA is projected to be $518.1 million, and FasTracks unrestricted fund balance is projected to be
$21.5 million for a total projected balance of $1,856.8 million

Funding from the FISA and FasTracks unrestricted fund balances would be used to fund the remaining
unfunded FasTracks corridors which have not been prioritized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adoption of the 2016 APE and Financial Plan, incorporating the recommendation by staff.
This is the recommended action.
2. Adoption of the 2016 APE and Financial Plan, incorporating the original baseline
recommendation by staff. This is not the recommendation action.
3. Defer the adoption of the 2016 APE and Financial Plan to a later date. This is not the
recommendation action. The financial plan must be adopted by the Board in September in
order to deliver the financial plan to the rating agencies. The rating agencies require the
financial plan in order to issue bond ratings to RTD. Those ratings are required for our
upcoming bond sale in October. Delaying approval would delay the bond sale, which could
lead to an undesirable cash position.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather

Date:

September 12, 2016

Subject:

2017 Requested Budget

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 13, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 20, 2016

BACKGROUND
Staff is required to present the 2017 Requested Budget to the Board of Directors prior to posting
it for public inspection. RTD must post its 2017 Requested Budget for public review and
comment by October 15, 2016 in order to meet Colorado legal requirements (CRS 29-1-101).
The preliminary 2017 Requested Budget is included in this document in order to comply with
these requirements.
At this time, Staff is presenting the preliminary first draft 2017 Requested Budget. Preliminary
2017 Requested Budget numbers are subject to further revision and a budget update will be
presented at the October 18th Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting. The 2017
Recommended Budget will then be presented at the November 15th Financial Administration and
Audit Committee meeting with Staff requesting approval to move to the Board of Directors for
ratification of the 2017 Adopted Budget on November 22nd.
DISCUSSION
The Board has requested that staff keep it informed on key budget issues that RTD is facing and
provide opportunities for Board members to offer early input during the development of the 2017
annual budget. Our previous communication included the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP), the first year of which forms the basis for the 2017 budget and which is scheduled to be
approved by the Board on September 27th. The budget is driven by the three top strategic goals
established for the GM by the Board of Directors for 2017, which consist of fiscal sustainability,
workforce/human capital, and state of good repair.
During development of the 2017-2022 SBP for the Base System, staff presented a balanced
budget to the Board for 2017. Staff has worked to develop a preliminary proposed budget for
the Base System as set forth in the 2017-2022 SBP. Staff also incorporates FasTracks budget
numbers for both FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations. The FasTracks budget is
developed separately from the SBP in the Annual Program Evaluation (APE). Both the Base
System and FasTracks preliminary budget make up the 2017 Requested Budget presented here.
The 2017 Requested Budget is compared to the 2016 Re-Amended Budget below with change
from period to period (in thousands). The summary data is from the attached Exhibit I.

Overview
The 2017 Requested Budget is a first draft budget and includes estimates for sources and uses.
The budget items will continue to be reviewed and the final version incorporating any necessary
adjustments will be the 2017 Recommended Budget scheduled for adoption in November. This
Requested Budget will be updated for items such as fare revenue estimates, sales taxes, grant
revenue, and capital expenditures for both new capital and capital carry forward amounts.
Operating expenses will likely be revised for specific changes.
As stated earlier, staff has developed the 2017 Requested Budget based on guidance from the
SBP for 2017 for the Base System and by incorporating the FasTracks 2017 budget. The 2017
Requested Budget on a combined basis includes the following:

Packet Pg. 67

1.C.1

(1) Fare revenue:
a. Farebox revenue for the Base System is expected to show no increase over 2016.
For FasTracks, fare revenue is budgeted to increase by $20.2 million to $32.9
million in 2017 due to full-year operation of the FasTracks service corridors brought
on-line in 2016. Overall farebox revenue is budgeted at $150.4 million in 2017.
Ridership growth is expected to be flat as well on the Base System with any
ridership increases attributed to FasTracks. Ridership projections are derived from
RTD’s planning model and the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation.
(2) Other operating revenue:
a. This amount includes advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, rental income, and
miscellaneous operating revenue.
b. Other operating revenue is increased at the CPI over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget
and adjusted for known items. The amount will change if more information
becomes available for the 2017 Recommended Budget. The current run rate for
other operating revenue is generally on track with the 2016 budget.
(3) Sales/use tax:
a. Combined sales/use tax of $601.9 million is budgeted to increase 5.6% over the
2016 projection, concurrent with the CU-Leeds School of Business March forecast.
The 2017 growth rate is the CU-Leeds Baseline forecast.
b. The 2016 projection shows an increase in sales/use tax of 5.2% over 2015
actuals; this is the CU-Leeds School of Business Below Trend forecast.
c. The September update from CU-Leeds School will be incorporated in the 2017
Recommended Budget.
(4) Grant revenue:
a. Total grant revenue is estimated at $317.7 million, a decrease of $37.2 million
from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget.
b. Operating grant revenue is $89.6 million the Base System and $2.5 million for
FasTracks. Base System operating grant revenue is budgeted to decrease $5.6
million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due to fluctuations in funding in fixed
guideway, bus facilities funding, CMAQ, CDOT, and FASTER grant funding for
specific programs. FasTracks operating grant revenue is budgeted to increase $0.9
million due to an increase in CMAQ funding for the Eagle Project offset by a
decrease in STAMPS grants.
c. Remaining grant funds consist of capital grant revenue of $225.5 million. Of this
amount, $15.7 million is budgeted in the Base System and $209.8 million is
budgeted in FasTracks. Combined capital grant revenue is expected to decrease
$32.6 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget with most of that coming from a
decrease in CMAQ grants for FasTracks.
d. Capital grant revenue does not include carry forward grants at this time. As more
information becomes available and the capital carry forward budget is finalized,
capital grant revenue estimates will change accordingly in the Recommended
Budget.
(5) Investment income:
a. Combined investment income totaling $4.2 million is projected to be largely flat
from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due to continued low short term rates along
with deployment of invested funds. Unrestricted investable fund balances are
projected to decline as project funds are drawn down for fleet purchases and
construction projects. An expected small increase in interest rates will stabilize
investment income.

Packet Pg. 68

1.C.1

(6) Other (non-operating) income:
a. Other non-operating income will decrease from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due
to non-recurrence of $9.0 million released from TABOR reserves in 2016, offset by
full-year payment by the University of Colorado for naming rights on the A Line and
an increase in DUS rental income.
b. Recurring non-operating revenue is increased at the CPI (with the exception of the
Build America Bonds subsidy) over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. The amount will
change if more information becomes available for the 2017 Recommended Budget.
The current run rate for other income is generally on track with the 2016 budget.
(7) Operating expenses:
a. District-wide operating expenses (including expense projects) of $607.9 million are
budgeted to decrease $30.3 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. Base
System operating expenses are budgeted to decrease $7.3 million, FasTracks
Project expenses are budgeted to decrease $43.6 million, and FasTracks Operations
expenses are budgeted to increase $20.6 million. Base System operating expenses
at this time are target amounts derived from the SBP but may change in the final
2017 budget as deemed necessary.
b. Note that the expense projects carry forward (previously approved expense
projects) is not included in the 2017 Requested Budget; this will be identified and
included in the final 2017 budget.
c. FasTracks Capital Programs will account for $42.5 million of the decline in
FasTracks Project expenses due in large part to completion of several FasTracks
projects.
d. Costs of operating the West Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide, I-225, the
H-Line extension and SERE are allocated from Base to FasTracks based on resource
drivers on a full-allocation basis in 2017, and thus, Base System total expenses are
reduced by the amount of the allocation. In years prior to 2017, the allocation was
made on an incremental basis, to be changed to full allocation including
administrative and support costs beginning in 2017. The amount of the allocation
in 2017 is $36.8 million.
e. FasTracks Operations also includes a $71.2 million estimated service payment to
Denver Transit Operators for Eagle operations and maintenance which began in
2016. The expense is included in the Rail Operations budget.
f. Diesel fuel is budgeted at $2.00/gallon, which is $0.23 less per gallon than the lock
price in 2016, resulting in an incremental savings of approximately $2.9 million
from 2016.
g. Gasoline is currently budgeted at an average cost of $2.65/gallon, which is $0.35
less per gallon than the price used in the 2016 Re-Amended Budget for an
incremental savings of approximately $0.7 million.
h. Certain items in the 2017 Requested Budget totaling around $4.0 million
materialized after the SBP was approved, including LRV major spare parts, and
various other smaller dollar items including CBA negotiation services and an
increase in off-duty police hourly rate. These items will be discussed and prioritized
with senior management and it will be determined if funds can be made available to
support these expenditures.
(8) Debt:
a. Budgeted principal payments of $58.9 million on a combined basis are $2.8 million
lower than the 2016 Re-Amended Budget.

Packet Pg. 69

1.C.1

b. Base System principal payments of $48.6 million are $3.3 million less than the
2016 Re-Amended Budget due to scheduled amortization of the Base System COPs
issued for fleet purchases.
c. FasTracks principal payments of $10.3 million are $0.5 million lower than the 2016
Re-Amended Budget due to refundings and scheduled principal amortization on
current debt.
d. No debt issuance is anticipated for either the Base System or FasTracks in 2017.
Both Base System and FasTracks will draw from previously issued debt to fund
major capital purchases and construction in 2017.
(9) Interest expense:
a. Interest expense is budgeted at $113.4 million, a decrease of $3.9 million from the
2016 Re-Amended Budget due to the effect of refundings and scheduled
amortization.
b. Of total interest expense, $28.3 million is budgeted for Base System and $85.1
million is budgeted on FasTracks.
c. Capitalized interest is budgeted at $32.9 million, no change from the 2016 ReAmended Budget. Capitalized interest is the interest expense associated with
construction projects that is capitalized as part of the asset value on the balance
sheet.
(10) Capital expenditures:
a. Base System new capital expenditures total $66.6 million. This is the amount
approved in the SBP for minimum “must-have” projects and is escalated at the CPI
of 3.0%.
b. FasTracks new capital expenditures are estimated at $235.6 million. This is a
preliminary amount subject to change in the Recommended Budget as estimates for
project expenditures in 2017 are reviewed and completed.
c. Capital carry forward (previously approved capital) is not estimated at this time but
will be included in the Recommended Budget because it is based on the 9/30/16
close of RTD’s financial statements.
(11) Reserves:
a. The combined TABOR reserve is budgeted at $23.2 million.
b. The FasTracks contingency reserve is budgeted at $15.9 million at year-end. This
reserve was set at $30.0 million in the 2016 Re-Amended Budget and was reduced
by a Board-approved transfer to the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) project. In
2016, the SERE transfer will be replenished and the reserve will be drawn down by
$14.1 million for North Metro which was approved in the Annual Program
Evaluation.
c. The FasTracks construction reserve is budgeted at $56.3 million. The FasTracks
start-up operations reserve is reduced to $0 in 2017 from $25.0 million, eliminated
in order to meet debt service coverage.
(12) Fund balances:
a. Base System:
i. Increase of $7.0 million to Board-appropriated fund per the SBP for a total
fund balance of $17.4 million.
ii. Increase of $2.7 million to capital acquisition fund per the SBP for a total fund
balance of $2.7 million.
iii. A first-time contribution will be made to an unrestricted operating reserve in
the amount of $4.6 million.
iv. The unrestricted year-end fund balance is budgeted at $2.0 million, which is
the fund balance estimated in the SBP. The objective is to arrive at a

Packet Pg. 70

1.C.1

budgeted unrestricted fund balance as close as possible to that estimated in
the SBP, regardless of further expenditure adjustments and any revisions to
revenue.
v. Fund balances are increased in a manner consistent with Board policy and the
SBP. The total of the above fund balances is expected to be 5.8% of
projected Base System operating expenses, or $26.7 million by the end of
2017.
b. FasTracks:
i. The total of the Board-appropriated fund, the capital acquisition fund, and the
unrestricted fund is $24.3 million and reflects 2 months of operating expenses
for both FasTracks Project/Construction and FasTracks Operations.
c. District-wide:
i. The total combined fund balances are expected to be 8.4% of projected
District-wide operating expenses by the end of 2017.
The preliminary 2017 Requested Budget and Fund Balance report which shows the operating and
capital sources and expenditures of the District for Base System and FasTracks is included as
Exhibit I.

Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Second Quarter of 2016. These year-to-date
measures provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its
passengers and the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 33
performance measures tracked for the GM, RTD met 25 of the goals in their entirety in the second
quarter. Of these, 3 are measured on an annual basis. The following is a discussion of the
exceptions.
Goal 1.1 – Safety Incidents
Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 miles
First Transit-Commerce City and First Transit-Longmont did not meet goal in Q2. There were a
total of twelve passenger accidents reported through Q2. Three of those accidents were
preventable. First Transit-Longmont had four passenger accidents with one preventable, and First
Transit-Commerce City had five passenger accidents with two preventable. Although Transdev
had one passenger accident and First Transit-Denver had two passenger accidents, neither carrier
exceeded goal.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District as a whole did not meet its goals for bus on-time service in Q2, but performance is
stable compared to Q1. In Local on-time service, First Transit-Denver and First Transit-Longmont
exceeded goal while the remaining carriers did not meet goal. Carriers RTD and Transdev
improved over Q1. Regional on-time performance did not meet goal but was stable to Q1.
Staff will continue its targeted efforts in studying the worst performing routes and identifying the
resources needed to improve, such as service changes and operator training.
Overall Light Rail service performance exceeded goal for both on-time service and service
availability.
Goal 4.2 – Level of Customer Complaints
Overall system complaints met goal, but individually, three carriers did not. Although they did not
meet goal, First Transit-Commerce City and First Transit-Denver improved in level of customer
complaints over 2015 while Transdev declined. Transdev, however, did improve over Q1,
reflecting improvements in staffing levels in Q2. All three carriers had a high number of

Packet Pg. 78

1.C.2

complaints related to missed service or late service (no show, bus late, discourtesy, passed up
passengers at stop). We also noted a decrease in ridership for all carriers (including RTD)
compared to each quarter in 2015. Transdev especially showed a large increase in “no show”
complaints, most likely due to the number of routes that were dropped or returned to RTD due to
lack of operator availability.
In Q2, the two carriers RTD and First Transit-Longmont exceeded goal. Staff provides an analysis
of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer Services report.
Goal 5.1 – Improve ADA On-Time Performance
Staffing challenges has caused fluctuations in on-time performance.
Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
The ridership goal is established with the 2016 Amended Budget. Although the goal was not met
in Q2 on a year-to-date basis, this measure is more properly assessed annually. We will monitor
and look forward to more data post-FasTracks roll-out in 2016.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
The fare revenue and operating revenue goals are established with the 2016 Amended Budget.
Although the goals were not met in Q2 on a year-to-date basis, these measures are more properly
assessed annually. We will monitor and look forward to more data post-FasTracks roll-out in
2016.

An accident is considered preventable any time the operator was not driving in full compliance with all applicable
laws and regulations and in such a manner as to avoid involvement despite adverse conditions of road, weather or
traffic or the errors of pedestrians or other drivers.
2
Bad weather in March resulted in a higher number of preventable accidents. Four of the total nine preventable accidents
that occurred in March happened when the roads were icy/snow-packed.
3
Of the total 12 passenger accidents reported through Q2, three were preventable. First Transit-Longmont had four
passenger accidents with one preventable, and First Transit-Commerce City had five passenger accidents with two
preventable. Transdev had one passenger accident and First Transit-Denver had two passenger accidents, but neither
carrier exceeded goal.

Three carriers did not meet goal and although First Transit-Commerce City and First Transit-Denver improved over
2015, Transdev worsened. Transdev showed a large increase in “no show” complaints, likely due to the number of
routes dropped or returned to RTD due to no operator available. Coupled with overall low ridership, TransDev achieved
a higher number of customer complaints per boardings. TransDev showed some improvement in Q2 reflecting
improvements in staffing levels.

The Smart Card Program continues to gather taps for EcoPass (business and neighborhood) and
CollegePass riders since the program’s launch on January 2, 2013. There are approximately 474,377
active cards in circulation. During the month of July, 2016, 1.07M taps were recorded, and in the
month of August 2016, 1.42M taps were recorded. The decrease in total taps for the month of July is
attributed to the College and University summer break.
The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public currently
enrolled in the public pilot program to pay for transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored
Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards. These cards can be loaded with certain dollar amounts and
used much like a gift card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar
amount on the card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card at RTD
sales outlets.
Starting the morning of Monday January 4th, cards were being dispersed to the public pilot program
participants at the RTD retail outlets. As of September 1, 2016, a total of 1,910 cards were issued of
which 1,510 (79%) were full fare and 400 (21%) were discount cards. The average initial stored value
loading is $46.14 with a total value loaded including reloads of $251,000. There have been 84,750
boardings using these MyRide cards with fare payment value of $186,200. Of these boardings; 69%
were local, 28% regional and 2% airport.
All bus installations were completed for operational service. Additional validators will be installed as
buses purchased.
Additional platform validators were installed for the University of Colorado A Line and B line to
Westminster. More platform validators will be installed on the G Line to Wheat Ridge and the R line to
Aurora. All 191 Light and Commuter Rail platform validators have been installed and are operational.

administrative action to extend their
usability. Remediation was made to
some of these cards in March 2016
which yielded positive results.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
BUS and LIGHT RAIL TRAIN OPERATOR SAFETY
COLORADO STATE AUDITORS PERFORMANCE AUDIT
FOLLOW-UP of PREVIOUSLY AGREED UPON CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
AUDIT REPORT # 16-05-03

During 2015 the Colorado State Auditors contracted with Two Hills Accounting & Consulting, a
local Denver firm, to perform an audit at RTD covering ‘Bus and Light Rail Train Operator Safety’.
The final report was issued in September 2015.
Several recommendations and corresponding agreed upon corrective actions were included in
the report. Internal Audit recently completed follow-up testing to determine the status of those
actions, as all were to be implemented by the end of June 2016.
AUDIT SCOPE
We reviewed the current status of all six previously reported findings and performed appropriate
testing to validate if corrective actions have been implemented as agreed.

CONCLUSION
Internal Audit found that five of the agreed upon six corrective action items have been
implemented, with one item considered to be “Implemented and Ongoing.” Going forward,
management will ensure that the results of reviews to validate that appropriate drug and alcohol
testing, which is performed at contracted bus sites, is reported to the RTD Board on a quarterly
basis.
Internal Audit recommended in their Internal Report, that employees who perform compliance
reviews at contracted bus sites develop a standard approach to testing, documentation, and
reporting; thus ensuring a consistency amongst the staff.
CURRENT STATUS
We will review the status of these actions as part of our normal follow-up during the fourth quarter
of 2016.

FREE RIDE COUPONS AUDIT
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT #16-02-01

The Management Directive on Complimentary Passes and Free Ride Coupon was revised on
4/1/10. The directive was established to set policy and provide procedures and guidelines for the
issuance of complimentary passes and free ride coupons. The directive categorized the request
for passes and listed the various users and the types of passes typically used. Free ride coupons,
special services coupons, and guest passes are parts of non-revenue generating product
offerings at RTD. The fixed-price contract for Security Printing of RTD Monthly Passes, Special
Passes, Ticket Books and Special Tickets was entered into in July 2015 with a contract not-toexceed amount of $1,310,541.00 for a period of three (3) years.
SCOPE
The Audit Scope was intended to be limited to the use and control of Free Ride Coupons however,
other complimentary passes were included on a limited basis as they are similar in nature.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit included but were not limited to:



Determine whether internal controls have been properly designed and implemented to
control distribution and use for the coupons
Review the strategy for setting limits on the number of coupons available and determining
the cost of program administration.
CONCLUSION

Complimentary pass programs are used by many Transit Agencies in the US. Audit obtained
information from eight (8) Transit Agencies that have complimentary pass programs however, the
Free Ride Coupons Program is not used continuously by any of them.
Free Ride Coupons have been used for the following purposes:





Introduction to new lines or introduction to public transit
Marketing and Promotion of RTD
Facilitating other Transit Agency dignitaries visiting the Metro area or attending
conferences
Customer relations issues.

Attachment: FAAC September 2016 with attachments (2896 : Quarterly Audit Update)

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

Audit agrees with the limited use of the Complimentary passes for the above purposes as they
relate to RTD business purposes.

Packet Pg. 108

1.C.5.a

Control of the program should be centralized to accommodate tracking and reconciliation and to
ensure the complimentary passes are only requested and distributed by a limited number of
individuals and used for RTD business purposes only.

Attachment: FAAC September 2016 with attachments (2896 : Quarterly Audit Update)

In line with the above recommendation the Complimentary Pass Policies and Procedures should
be updated to include more restrictive controls that facilitate central control, accountability and
reconciliation.
