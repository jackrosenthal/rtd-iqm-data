Board Meeting Date: December 8, 2020

Subject:

Salaried Employee Trustee Appointments

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Resolution No. ______ reappointing Sylvia Francis and William Weidenaar to a
term expiring December 31, 2022 and appoints Bob Broom and Peggy Catlin from the Board of Directors
to a term expiring December 31, 2022 as Trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e.,
Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Plan.
GM Goals
Mission-Oriented Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 1 Series of 2008 providing that
a screening committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee Pension Trust
Fund and the Finance Chair (i.e., Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit Committee) will screen
applications from the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management salaried
employee class and will bring recommendations back to the Board.
In 2010, Resolution No. 27 made modification to state that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have
served satisfactorily and in whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not
necessary to seek applications for renewal, and instead the application process established by the RTD
Board of Directors in 2008 will be used on those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or
appropriate to appoint new salaried Trustees to the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008 Series of 2016, the RTD Board of Directors amended the
Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Trust, to end the “senior” and “middle” management
distinction, and instead authorized the Board of Directors to appoint two employee Trustees who
participate in the Pension Plan and two who participate in the Defined Contribution Plan, in addition to
the two Board members who are appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a
permanent member of the Trusts, to serve as the same set of Trustees on both of the Trusts.
Sylvia Francis’ and William Weidenaar’s current terms expire on December 31, 2020. Both Ms. Francis
and Mr. Weidenaar meet the criteria from Resolution No. 2017, Series 2010 for reappointment.
In
addition, both Board of Director appointments to the Trusts expire on December 31, 2020. The Chair of
the RTD Board of Directors appoints Director Bob Broom and Director Peggy Catlin as Trustees.

Subject:

Budget Transfer for Commuter Rail Third Party
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
approve budget transfers totaling $3.122 million from the North Metro operations budget to the Eagle
operations budget for third party reimbursable projects to allow RTD to compensate Denver Transit
Partners (DTP) for costs it will incur for work associated with third party agreements.
This action addresses two of the General Manager’s goals for 2020:
Mission-Oriented Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Mission-Oriented Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
Since the T-Rex project, RTD has worked with third party partners, including stakeholders, local
governments, and private entities, on betterments associated with its construction projects. These
betterments have included enhancements to RTD rail lines and facilities or adjacent areas beyond the
original construction plans and concurrent construction of associated facilities for third parties. The third
parties requesting the work reimburse RTD for all costs associated with these betterments, so these
betterments are done at no net cost to RTD.
With the opening of the Eagle P3 commuter rail lines, RTD also has seen service impacts from third party
construction projects that require access to the right-of-way. These could include utilities that pass
under the track, or construction on bridges over the track. In these instances, DTP may be required to
provide access to the track or to modify service and incur the associated costs to allow the third party
construction to proceed in a safe and timely fashion.
The Concession Agreement between RTD and DTP requires that RTD reimburse DTP for costs incurred
related to third party projects. RTD, in turn receives reimbursement from the third party resulting in zero
net cost to RTD. This process occurs because RTD is the owner of the alignment while DTP is
responsible for operations. Under the Concession Agreement, any changes, such as payment for third
party work, to monthly scheduled availability payments to DTP for providing service and capital
financing, are negotiated and agreed to with RTD. These changes in payments are called Memorandums
of Relief (MORs).

DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 8

1.B.2

Under RTD’s budgetary controls, budget transfers exceeding the General Manager’s authority must have
Board approval. These budgetary controls ensure the integrity of the budget appropriation process and
that budgeted funds are used for their intended purposes. However, there are some unforeseen and/or
unquantifiable activities, such as third party projects, that arise after the budget has been approved by
the Board which necessitate an appropriation for expenditures through a budget transfer.
RTD currently has several open third party projects that impact operations on the Eagle P3 alignment and
necessitate payment to DTP for costs incurred. These impacts include construction of the actual
betterments, provision of flaggers to ensure safety along the corridor for third party construction, power
shutdowns at the locations of the improvements, and relocation of utilities within the right of way.
Examples of some of these open third party projects include modifications by the Park Creek Metro
District at Central Park, construction work by SEMA Construction at Smith and Dahlia, the Mountain
Gateway Development Project, glass replacement and sign removal by DIA, etc. This budget transfer
will allow RTD to pay its current and future invoices on these open projects, and allow RTD, DTP, and
the third party partner entities to continue work on these projects in a timely manner.
It is important to note that these transfers only cover existing agreements with third party partners. Any
future new agreements will require additional budget revisions and Board approval.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no net financial impact to RTD because RTD will be reimbursed by third parties for all costs
incurred on their behalf. In addition, this budget transfer will move existing approved 2020 budget
funds from the North Metro project to the Eagle P3 cost center.

Contributions to the FasTracks Fund Balance

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
redirects certain future funding sources (detailed below) from being deposited in the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA) and instead be deposited in the FasTracks unrestricted reserve for future
shortfalls in operations and maintenance costs.
This action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Mission-Oriented Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
In 2012, the RTD Board of Directors created the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA). At that
time, the Board directed certain funds to go into the FISA reserve to build funding for future FasTracks
capital projects. Since that time, contributions have been made in accordance with that direction.
DISCUSSION
In October and November 2020, staff presented information to the Board that shows that it is doubtful
that FasTracks will be financially solvent over the next six years and beyond without utilizing all of the
existing reserves and future “rubber tire” contributions. Even with these funding sources, it is projected
that FasTracks revenues will be less than what is required to operate existing lines.
Allowing the use of the following estimated future anticipated funding sources to be used for FasTracks
operations and maintenance rather than adding them to the FISA reserve will help to offset the
anticipated shortfalls that are anticipated in the future.

2021 Interest Savings from Refinancing the Series 2012A Bonds and TIFIA loan

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Using these potential sources of funds for FasTracks operations and maintenance rather than setting
them aside in the FISA for future FasTracks projects will help offset the projected future year deficits
and mitigate the size of the drawdowns of reserves.

Update on Sales and Use Tax Forecasting RFP

Information

BACKGROUND
In 2011, RTD began contracting with outside parties to provide sales and use tax forecasts for
budgeting and forecasting purposes. Prior to 2011, RTD staff produced these forecasts. Use of
qualified, independent outside firms was desired due to RTD not having the necessary economic
expertise and information in-house.
The most recent sales and use tax forecasting contract with the University of Colorado, Leeds School
of Business, Business Research Division (Leeds) will expire on December 31, 2020. Leeds presented
their final sales and use tax forecast to the RTD Board of Directors in October. That contract was for
three base years and two-one year extensions which were exercised.
On October 30, 2020, RTD released a Request for Proposals (RFP) seeking qualified firms to provide
future sales and use tax forecasting for RTD. Responses were due back to RTD by December 1,
2020.
The RFP scope of work includes semi-annual forecasts to be provided to RTD in March and September
to coincide with budget and forecasting cycles. In addition, the selected firm will present their
forecasts to the Board of Directors.
Proposals for this three year contract plus two option years will be evaluated using the following
criteria:
30% for Technical Approach to Sales and Use Tax Forecasting
25% for Experience and Qualifications of Project Manager and Key Staff
20% for Expertise and Qualifications of the Firm
20% for Cost (including options)
5% for Client References

DISCUSSION
The purpose of this information is to provide a status update to the Board on the contracting progress.
In response to this RFP, RTD only received one proposal and is currently reviewing it. RTD staff
expects to make a decision by December 31, 2020.

Finalization of this contract falls within the General Manager’s contracting authority and staff will
inform the Board of the results of their proposal evaluation.

the G Line opened on April 26, 2019 and the Southeast Rail Extension opened on May 17, 2019. Fares were suspended on April 5, 2020 and resumed on July 1, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic
The N Line opened on September 21, 2020. Fares are suspended for the first week and then will be only local fares for the first six months.
The second quarter 2020 SB154 ratio is 12.1% which is lower than the statutorially required 30% ratio. The low ratio is caused by the absence of fare revenue and reduction of taxes due to COVID.

(1) Variance is due to lower parts, suppliers and purchased transportation.
(2) Variance is due to lower labor, repair parts and purchased transportation.
(3) Variance is due to projects budgeted evenly across year but not yet started.
(4) Variance is due to timing of project expenses not yet incurred, many of which are grant-funded.
(5) Variance is due to lower outside security services costs.
(6) Variance is due primarily to timing of outside counsel costs related to litigation.
(7) Variance is due to timing of outstide IT services costs for projects.
(8) Variance is due to timing of outside printing costs for schedules, other outside services and special events.
(9) Variance due to purchasing card costs that initially get coded to this cost center until they can be coded to each cost center where they were incurred
(10) Variance due timing of hosting services charges for MinuteTraq.

LiVE Update

Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program transitioned to
new rules after December 31, 2019.

DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

Packet Pg. 24

1.C.3

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.

As of October 31, 2020, 13,091 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 8,105 have been
approved, 3,832 have been denied, 1,132 are pending and the remaining 22 have been closed for other
reasons. Of the 3,832 denied, 2,236 were denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65
and older which entitles them to a better discount, 479 were denied because their address was out of
District, 87 were denied because it was a duplicate application, 97 were denied because the applicants
were already enrolled, 704 were denied because they did not respond to requests for a photo or
additional information, and 229 were denied because they did not meet the income threshold. Of the
1,132 pending applications, 1,131 lack an uploaded photo and 1 is pending income verification by
Denver Human Services.
In the month of November 2020, 400 applications were approved.
The decrease in ridership caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the suspension of fare collection from
April to June 2020 have had a significant impact on the program. The number of approved applications
went from an average of 230 per week in the first two weeks of March to an average of 100 in April,
50 in May and June, and 110 from July to November.
The 8,105 individuals who were approved for the LiVE program between July 2019 and October 31,
2020, provided a mailing address1 in the following counties: Denver 3,869, Arapahoe 1,791, Jefferson
906, Adams 762, Boulder 378, Douglas 98, Broomfield 34, and Weld 36. Note that some counties are
only partially in the RTD District. 231 participants reside in the RTD District but provided a mailing
address in a county outside of the District, which is acceptable under the program rules.
From the implementation of the LiVE program through October 2020, we issued 650 LiVE MyRide cards
that were used for 16,760 trips. 3,330 mobile app users bought 44,000 mobile 3-hour passes and day
passes. Nonprofit organizations bought 145,200 LiVE paper tickets. We do not know how many
individual riders received LiVE tickets from nonprofit organizations since the number of tickets issued to
each client depends on the organization and the client’s situation.

Packet Pg. 25

1.C.3

We compared sales of LiVE mobile tickets and LiVE MyRide stored value to assess the drop in LiVE
ridership related to COVID-19. These sales only decreased by 13% between February and October 2020
(42% if adjusted for the fact that there were more LiVE participants in October than in February). This is
a significantly smaller decrease than the 64% COVID-related decrease in sales for the same fare
products across RTD’s entire customer base.

In addition to going live on July 29, 2019, the following actions have been completed:

LiVE fares are available through RTD’s mobile ticketing application.
LiVE fares are available on LiVE MyRide smart cards. The cards can be ordered through the
MyRide portal and have been made available for purchase at RTD sales outlets as well as
King Soopers and Safeway stores.
LiVE airport upgrades are available on buses and from Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs).
Order forms for LiVE 10-ride tickets have been made available to organizations in the RTD
nonprofit program.
RTD Operations staff and Security staff have been trained on the LiVE fares and eligibility
requirements.
Marketing, training, product readiness and communications activities have been deployed.
Step-by-by step instructions for applications as well as other materials are available
through the RTD LiVE web page. A LiVE Program handout has been created, printed, and
uploaded to the web page. The instructions and handout are available in English and
Spanish.
The LiVE application process in PEAK is available to applicants in both English and
Spanish.
RTD customer service is answering LiVE program questions and referring customers to the
appropriate parties for assistance.
Denver Human Services is verifying income for those not categorically income-eligible
through public assistance programs.
Denver Human Services is providing LiVE eligibility customer service by phone and e-mail.
RTD staff are performing quality control, making any needed adjustments for uploaded
photos, working with applicants if a better photo is required, and assisting customers
whose cards have been lost or stolen.
The livecard@rtd-denver.com mailbox is active and being utilized to communicate with
customers about photos and cards and to field questions. Community partners can request
printed LiVE handouts through this email address.
A feedback form about the LiVE application experience is available on the RTD website.
RTD staff have promoted the LiVE program and answered questions at community events.
Denver Human Services has provided information about the LiVE Program and application
at community events and to community partners and caseworkers.
RTD hosted live and webinar training by PEAK Outreach (Boulder County) for nonprofit
organizations that are interested in helping their clients apply for LiVE.
RTD has refined the communications plan for LiVE and is expanding outreach and

marketing activities.
The team has identified requirements for PEAK enhancements related to the LiVE
application and application processing.
Negotiated the scope for enhancements to the LiVE application and application processing
in PEAK with the State’s software vendor. These enhancements will include revised
verbiage in the LiVE application based on feedback. Due to the pandemic’s impacts on the
RTD budget, this project was put on hold.
RTD kicked off a broader marketing campaign about all fare discounts, including LiVE,
starting with in-vehicle advertising and social media posts. In June, RTD issued social
media posts for each fare discount. We also included information about the fare discounts
in the communications and outreach related to resuming front door boarding and fare
collection on July 1.
We worked with Denver Human Services to adjust procedures due to the COVID-19
situation. The LiVE eligibility technicians are processing applications and provide customer
service remotely while the Denver Human Services offices are closed to the public. In
addition to the online application on PEAK, interested individuals have the option of
applying by phone, at least until the offices re-open.
Executed an amendment to the intergovernmental agreement with the City and County of
Denver to add the services of an Outreach Coordinator at Denver Human Services. The
person in this new position will assist eligible riders who face barriers to completing a LiVE
application. We plan to offer this service at rotating locations throughout the District, for
example in homeless shelters.
Created new LiVE informational materials based on feedback by customers, Denver Human
Services, and community-based organizations. This included a comprehensive questions &
answers document and short videos with basic information, how to apply, and how to use
the program. Updated the LiVE website for clarity and ease of use and added the new
materials and a new “partner toolkit” area.
Launched a new round of communications about the LiVE program. This included issuing a
news release and posting the new LiVE videos on social media. New communications
about the program and partner toolkit were emailed to community partners and RTD
Nonprofit Program customers. PEAK Outreach and Denver Human Services disseminated
the information through their email lists as well.
We conducted a survey of LiVE participants asking for feedback on all aspects of the LiVE
program in November 2020. We asked for information about the effectiveness of RTD
communications, customer service provided by DHS and RTD, application experience, fare
products, demographics and income level, and suggestions for improvement. The survey
closed on November 25; results are being compiled.

On-Going:
•

RTD is working with the State’s software vendor and Denver Human Services to work out
remaining “bugs” from the initial implementation in PEAK.

Packet Pg. 27

1.C.3

•
•
•

•

•

RTD is evaluating next activities for the marketing campaign about the discounts offered
by RTD, in accordance with the LiVE/All Discounts Communications Plan.
On-going communications with organizations in the RTD Nonprofit Program about program
rules, the application process, feedback, and changes due to the COVID-19 situation.
RTD is working with organizations that serve those with immediate needs (homeless
service providers, domestic violence shelters, and correctional institutions) to develop and
implement a temporary LiVE ID card. Organizations that serve individuals in immediate
needs/emergency situations will be able to issue temporary LiVE ID cards to their clients.
We are working on procedures.
Working with the City and County of Denver to add the services of an application outreach
worker who will help individuals apply for the LiVE Program at partner locations
throughout the District.
On-going discussions with Auraria Higher Education Center about fare payment options.
These discussions include information about all RTD fare discounts, especially youth
discount and LiVE.

Next Steps:
•
•
•
•

•
•
•

Reach out to institutions of higher education that are not participating in the CollegePass
program to make sure they are aware of the RTD fare discounts.
Denver Human Services is in the process of hiring a LiVE Outreach Coordinator.
Create policies, procedures, and agreements for the temporary LiVE ID card described
above.
Compile and analyze results of the survey of LiVE participants to determine common
themes and assist customers who indicated that there is an issue with their application or
LiVE ID card that was not resolved.
Prepare a program report after the LiVE participant survey information has been compiled
and analyzed.
RTD will continue to refine communications materials and outreach activities.
The team will use participation and usage numbers as well as feedback from customers,
partner organizations, and RTD staff to consider further enhancements to the program.
This will include re-assessing which fare products are available for LiVE.

1

In order to limit RTD’s handling of personally identifiable information for LiVE participants, RTD only
stores the mailing address of participants but not the home address. In most cases, however, home
address and mailing address are the same or in the same county.
