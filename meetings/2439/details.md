Chair Tobiassen noted there were two retirees this month with one in attendance.   Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, and Mike Gil, former Deputy Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, introduced Richard Lindsey, a bus operator with 27 years of service.  Bruce Abel recognized Richard’s wife, Pam Lindsey, who was also in attendance and thanked her for sharing Richard with RTD.

Mike Gil shared that Richard worked out of Platte and East Metro.  He said Richard recently began working nights and decided he wanted to retire.  Richard will be relocating to Nevada with his wife and two year old daughter.  Mike Gil stated he was one of RTD’s best operators and will be missed.

Richard Lindsey said it had been a joy even through it was not always the easiest job.  He appreciates the opportunity and feels very blessed.

Chair Tobiassen recognized Carol Fusaro, the Reduced Fare Program Coordinator with 24 years of service, who was unable to attend this evening.

## V. Public Participation

Chair Tobiassen stated that public participation was open to anyone that wanted to address the Board.  He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.

- Doug Gragg, Denver, said he had a capital idea for RTD.  He pointed out that since 1982, RTD has been located at 1600 Blake Street, well before it was a commercialized area.  He stated RTD was the forerunner in developing the Lower Downtown area.  He said he has decided RTD should move its official headquarters to Civic Center so RTD can do the same thing for Upper Downtown that was done for Lower Downtown.

- Dre Chiriboga-Flor, 9 to 5, said she was at the meeting to speak on behalf of a member who was unable to attend.  This member lives in Aurora and is retired, but she does not qualify for a discount pass.  She hopes RTD can address the issue of an affordable pass for low income people.  This member says it is hard to pay $4 per day to ride the bus.  She cannot go anywhere that is not a necessity.  People should be able to use buses as much as they want and not have to worry about also being able to afford food.  This member’s daughter lives with her but is not working.  It is difficult for her daughter to find work as often she cannot afford to take the bus to interviews.  She asked the Board to think about how fare increases are affecting the community.

Dre Chiriboga-Flor shared that she has recently been reading the minutes from past RTD Committee and Board Meetings.  She commented that she was seeing support from many of the Board Members; however, there seems to be no momentum or talk of an affordable fare recently.  She encouraged the Board to put in the effort to create a timeline for when an affordable fare will be implemented.

- Maggie Gomez, 9 to 5, said she was at the Board meeting to speak in favor of an income based pass program.  She stated 9 to 5 and their many partners, who are trying to improve the public service that is RTD, have some asks that are not new, but need to be reiterated for the record.

o        Continue to work with the Affordable Fares Task Force and maintain a commitment to figuring out not how, but when, an income based passed will be available

o        Ensure an annual commitment to an income based pass by including funding in the Strategic Budget Plan

o        Speak positively about the emerging program in the public to assist with the external fundraising as well as actively supporting these efforts

o        Set a timeline for a Board vote and target program launch

She indicated, as a community organizer, she works with women who are homeless or stuck in low wage jobs because they do not have the basic protections they need.  There is one member who is exceptionally qualified to work at the Children’s Hospital but she cannot get a job there because she cannot afford to take the bus.  Maggie Gomez stated that in this economy Colorado is leaving people in the margins.  People need to have access to quality jobs.  She thanked the Board for their time and asked them to help ensure that all riders can afford to experience RTD.

- Jared Hall, Boulder County Transportation Department, asked RTD to consider reconvening a pass program working group.  He noted this working group did a lot of great work over the past year, but there is still more work that needs to be done.  He hopes this group will cast a wide net to look at all pass programs, including a low income pass.  He thinks it is important to keep the conversation going.

Chair Tobiassen thanked everyone for their comments.

Interim General Manager Genova informed the Board that this would be General Counsel Marla Lien’s last formal Board Meeting.  He wanted to take a moment to acknowledge her 25 years with RTD.  He stated that Marla has played a major role in every RTD project and her contributions are too many to name.

Marla Lien received a standing ovation.  Chair Tobiassen thanked her for her hard work.  He appreciates everything she has done for the District.

Marla Lien stated it has been a phenomenal ride and what the Agency has allowed her to do is remarkable.  She thinks everyone dreams of jobs where you can do something that matters.  She cannot think of a greater opportunity than she has had at RTD to help work to change the face of the region.

Director Lubow indicated she finds it confusing that there seems to be doubt as to what is causing the drop in ridership.  She would think that low gas prices are an obvious culprit; however, there seems to be continuing conversation about this.  Interim General Manager Genova explained that lower gas is the obvious factor but there are probably other causes as well.

## XIV. Executive Session

There was no executive session.

## XV. Old Business

Director Solano pointed out that RTD had no contingency plan in place for the Broncos winning the Super Bowl, which is what lead to the gridlock and eventual free fares during the parade.  He felt this should have been in place weeks before the event.  He stated that RTD needs to have a plan in place for how we will move a million people should this come up again.

Director Folska shared that while she did not have any personal experiences as she did not come Downtown from the parade, the feedback she has received has all been recognizing the outstanding job staff did when our resources were pushed to the limit.  She thanked staff for a job well done.

Director Lasater noted it was an interesting experience as he was at Lincoln Station, which had a preponderance of people.  He said there were a lot of good lessons learned.  He recognized two employees who evaluated the situation with the ticket vending machines and took the initiative to tell people to ride for free due to the multiple safety issues.  He has asked Interim General Manager Genova to send them a formal commendation letter.  He stated that overall everyone worked well together and did a great job.

Director Walker indicated from the comments he received and his own personal experiences the logistics were fantastic at getting people Downtown.  He thought everything went well.

## XVI. New Business

Director Bagley noted the Study Session on February 23 was cancelled and there was no meeting scheduled for March 1 so the next meeting will be March 8.  He requested that staff, specifically RTD’s Government Relations Officer Sherry Ellebracht, provide the full Board a full outline of the visits scheduled during the APTA Legislative Conference along with who will be speaking and the issues to be discussed.  He believes it is important for the entire Board to understand as there are only five Directors who will be attending.  He asked this be provided to the Board at the March 8, 2016 Government Relations Committee Meeting.

## XVII. Adjourn

Chair Tobiassen adjourned the meeting at 6:15 p.m.
