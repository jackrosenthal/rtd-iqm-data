Overview of the Real Property Division (Stopplecamp)
Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, indicated that
there was not a formal presentation this evening; however, Susan Altes, Manager of Real
Property, would be providing an overview of the Real Property Division of Capital
Programs.
Susan Altes explained that Real Property was one of four divisions that made up Capital
Programs and is also the smallest division. Real Property consists of her, three real
property specialists and an administrative assistant. She said they are charged with
acquiring all property necessary for the District’s projects for both FasTracks and Base
System. When FasTracks was initiated it was determined by the Board that RTD policy
would require all real property acquisitions to follow the Code of Federal Regulations even
if a purchase is not federally funded so that uniform and equitable treatment is conducted
in all transactions. Susan Altes explained that eminent domain is the right of government
to take private property for public use. RTD’s eminent domain authority is part of RTD’s
enabling legislation. She stated that the eminent domain process is also managed by Real
Property.
Susan Altes noted that property acquisition has been different on every corridor. She
explained that the goal during the eminent domain process is to continue negotiating with
the property owner to try and reach a settlement even if condemnation and trail
proceedings have begun. She outlined the number of properties needed for each project
along with the number of condemnations and trails as follows:
 West Line – 193 acquisitions, 36 condemnations, 9 trials
 Denver Union Station to Pecos – 23 acquisitions, 5 condemnations, 1 trial
 Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility – 6 acquisitions, 2 condemnations, 1 trial
 East Line – 93 property acquisitions, 23 condemnations, 5 trials (1 is pending)
 Gold Line – 70 acquisitions, 9 condemnations, 2 trials
 Northwest Rail – 22 acquisitions, 2 condemnations, 1 trials (pending)
 I-225 Line – 64 acquisitions, 14 condemnations, 6 trials (5 are pending)
 North Metro Rail – 32 acquisitions, 5 petitions, 2 trials (both are pending)
Susan Altes summarized that to-date for FasTracks there have been 503 acquisitions, 96
condemnations, 19 trials, 8 pending trials, and 69 settlements. This means that just 3.1%
of all acquisitions went through the full condemnation and trial process. She noted that in
addition to managing the acquisitions her team also manages the trials in coordination with
the eminent domain attorneys and appraisers RTD has under contract. She pointed out
that when considering the number of acquisitions this means there has been at least one
closing every week since 2008 that Real Property has handled.

6.A

Susan Altes shared that RTD is required to provide relocation benefits to displaced
residential parties or businesses. She said this is also something Real Property oversees.
She said this can take a tremendous amount of effort and time as every tenant must be
relocated before a property is released for construction. She explained the process is also
difficult as her team must find a comparable property, apartment, storage unit, etc. similar
in cost and location to what they had previously. In the event this is not possible RTD
must also provide supplemental relocation benefits. Tenants have 18 months to claim
their relocation benefits so this is a process that can go on for a significant period of time.
Susan Altes stated that Real Property manages close to 100 revenue leases that produce
just over $1.5 million annually for RTD. Real Property also manages all necessary licenses,
permits and easements for things like electric lines, water lines, fiber optic cables, etc.
Currently there are over 3,500 licenses or permits for utilities that cross RTD’s tracks.
She said that her team also manages any encroachments on RTD’s property, agreements
for bus access on private property and day-use permits.
Susan Altes pointed out that in addition to being responsible for RTD’s property
acquisition, Real Property is also charged with disposing of RTD’s surplus property. She
reminded the Board of the pilot program that was established in 2013 where 4 properties
were selected to be sold through different methods. The properties selected were:
 Alameda and Havana Park-n-Ride
 13th and Zuni – remainder property from Siegel Oil
 104th and Riverdale
 13525 Weld County Road 8
Director Walker shared that this is very similar to the types of activities he does in his day
job. He said it was important to note that not all condemnations are adversary. Susan
Altes agreed that RTD has done many friendly condemnations. An example might be a
situation where the financial institution is slow to respond so a condemnation can help
clear the title for the property owner to move forward with the sale.
Director Bagley asked Susan Altes to provide the Board with the detailed information she
reviewed as to the property acquisition process for each FasTracks corridor. He noted
that property acquisition on the funded corridors is mostly complete. He does not see the

Packet Pg. 6

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 26, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Susan Altes explained that as part of the eminent domain process, fair market value of a
property must be determined. RTD has appraisers under contract that appraise all property
needed to be acquired on behalf on RTD. If a property has a value of $5K or higher the
property owner can elect to receive their own appraisal at RTD’s expense as well. The
appraisals are reviewed by the review appraiser who makes a fair market value
determination. Offers are made to the property owner based on the fair market value.

6.A

Director Solano wondered how the Real Property team worked with people who are
receiving Section 8 housing assistance. He also wondered what happens if we cannot
find a new house, apartment, etc. for someone we are relocating. Susan Altes explained
that Real Property works with whatever agency is providing the housing assistance. She
said that even if there is a high demand for housing it is still RTD’s responsibility to find
something. She noted that in extreme cases she has known agencies that have had to
build new housing.
Director Archuleta inquired as to the size of the property at Zuni. He also wondered as to
its appraisal value. Susan Altes stated that the property was about 1.6 acres. She
explained that the appraisal value is kept confidential during negotiations.
Director Hoy asked about RTD’s obligation to give money back to the federal government
if we sell a property that has a federal interest. Susan Altes said it would depend on the
terms of the grant agreement. If property was sold and the grant was still an open grant
the proceeds would have to go back to that grant. If the grant is closed the proceeds
could be put to another project. Director Hoy wondered what RTD’s incentive to sell
properties was if the funding had to go back to the federal government. Marla Lien,
General Counsel, explained that typically RTD does not receive the maximum percentage
of federal grant allowance. For example, a grant could be authorized to fund 80% of a
project but RTD only received 50%. She said RTD could take the funding from the sale of
property to increase that percentage.
Director Menten noted that on the West Line property acquisitions there was an
ombudsman who assisted the property owners and hired by the City of Lakewood. She
inquired if this has been done on other lines or if it was just because the West Line was
more challenging. Susan Altes explained that the City of Lakewood made the decision to
hire an ombudsman.
Director Menten wondered if there were any buildings that RTD owned and was leasing
out entirely or if all these locations also have RTD operations. Susan Altes stated that
there are no properties currently that RTD is leasing that could be sold instead. Director

need for many more acquisitions in the near future unless we find the funding for
additional extensions. Susan Altes agreed that the acquisitions are very close to being
done. She explained that during the acquisition process her team was augmented by
consultants so there is a strong core group left to manage the other Real Property
functions. Director Bagley recognized there was still much for Real Property to manage
but felt it important for the Board to understand that RTD is moving predominantly out of
the acquisition arena.

6.A

Director Menten asked how often RTD has used the 50% special benefit rule to our
advantage when negotiating with a property owner. Susan Altes said there is only one
instance during the FasTracks property acquisitions that she is aware of the appraiser
finding a special benefit. She pointed out that just because an appraiser finds it does not
mean it has to be part of the negotiations. Director Menten inquired as to what happened
in that case. Susan Altes explained that often the special benefit can be used in the
negotiations but it is not clearly spelled out in the final agreement. She said that the
property owner and RTD came to a settlement that was to everyone’s satisfaction.
Director Menten noted that early in the West Line project there had been plans to acquire
property near the Red Rocks Station for a Kiss-n-Ride stop. She said she often gets asked
by citizens why there is not something for someone to pull off when it is a dangerous road
as it is. She wondered why we did not move forward with a Kiss-n-Ride. Susan Altes
stated she was not aware that there was ever additional property near that station that
was going to be acquired. Henry Stopplecamp stated that the decision to pull out the
Kiss-n-Ride was made very early in the West Line planning process.
Director Menten asked how long it typically takes to get concurrence from the FTA when
selling a property that has a federal interest. Susan Altes said it typically takes 60 to 90
days.
Director Menten wondered how involved Real Property would be with the Electronic
Content Management (ECM) currently being undertaken by the agency. She hopes that
property records can be available in the near future to even those outside the agency.
Susan Altes explained that it is a difficult process as it is not just a matter of making the
deed available. There can be actions that are taken after the acquisition of a property that
also need to accompany the property records. She shared that she has met with the ECM
team several times and will be again as the project progresses.
Director Menten commented that there is property around the Federal Center that has
been pretty controversial. She wondered if RTD was in negotiations with Lakewood for
that property. Bill Sirois, Senior Manager of Transit Oriented Development and Planning
Coordination, explained that there was an agreement with Lakewood that they would be
included as part of the master development process; however, the development around
Federal Center has gone a different direction than initially envisioned. He said he has
reached out to Lakewood for further conversation because RTD has been contacted by a
private entity that is interested in the property.

Menten asked if it was correct that there were vacant buildings owned by RTD. Susan
Altes stated that was correct.

6.A

Director Bagley commented that there are station area master plans in development by the
City of Littleton at the Mineral and Downtown Littleton Stations. He hopes that staff has
been contacted by Littleton and will be participating in the efforts. Bill Sirois shared that
he was on the selection panel for the consultant. The process is just beginning but RTD
will be actively participating.
Chair Tobiassen thanked staff for their presentation.

III.

Other Matters
Interim General Manager Genova reminded the Board that at the last Board Meeting the
April 2016 Service Changes had to be amended to remove the increase in service on
Route 324. This was due to the anticipated grant funding from DRCOG not yet being
approved on DRCOG’s end. He said that since the Board Meeting, DRCOG has approved
the funding so staff will be bringing the recommendation to increase service on Route 324
to the Board for approval at a Special Board Meeting.
Interim General Manager Genova asked Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of
Planning, to provide the Board with a brief update on the Southeast Rail Extension. Bill
Van Meter informed the Board that staff was recently contacted by the FTA to inform RTD
that they plan for the Southeast Rail Extension to switch from a New Starts Grant to a
Small Starts Grant. He stated that this was good news for several reasons. He explained
that the New Starts process is more onerous through the entire life of the project as there
is significantly more FTA oversight. He noted that the terms of the grants are the same
but the streamlined process of the Small Starts Grant will allow RTD to proceed with the
project sooner.
Director Bagley passed out a map outlining the construction activity surrounding Denver
Union Station (DUS) that is periodically prepared by the Denver Union Station Project
Authority Board (DUSPA). He noted the tremendous development that is occurring around
DUS that no one predicted would come to fruition so quickly. He reminded the Board that
currently sales and use tax is over 600% higher than what was projected in 2009 and
property tax revenue is about 250% higher. He stated that this is fantastic, not just for

Packet Pg. 9

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 26, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director James pointed out that in the private sector people can find a variety of ways to
increase the value of a property. He wondered what opportunities there were for RTD to
do something similar and what limitations there might be on RTD as a public entity. Susan
Altes explained that it would depend on the property as there would need to be an
investment from RTD whether that be staff time, rezoning fees, etc. She shared that
investments to increase a property value had been made in the past but there would need
to be a strong justification for the up-front investment.

6.A

Director Deadwyler thanked Director Bagley for bringing this to the Board’s attention. She
thinks it is fantastic to know that so much around DUS has been developed. She asked if
anyone has quantified the amount that has come to RTD operations through this
construction around DUS. Director Bagley stated that RTD sold five parcels for a
cumulative value of about $30-35 million. Additionally, there is the long term lease with
Sage Hospitality that generates revenue for RTD. He believes the revenues are in excess
of initial projections but he said he cannot quantify the numbers.
Interim General Manager Genova indicated he would ask Heather Copp, Chief Financial
Officer, to quantify the revenues and report to the Board.
Director Lubow asked if it was accurate to assume that with all the activity of businesses
and residences it means RTD is probably collecting more taxes. Director Bagley stated
that sales and use tax would generate income for RTD but property taxes would go to pay
off the loans used to build DUS.
Chair Tobiassen expressed that the progress is stunning.

Motion:

Director Lubow made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 16, 2016
Board Meeting.

Discussion:

Director Francone said it was her understanding that Senate
Bill 16-011(SB 16-011) had already passed its second reading
in the Senate. She asked for an explanation as to the
ramifications of approval of SB 16-011 for RTD and why it
was coming before the Board so late. Sherry Ellebracht,
Government Relations Officer, explained that SB 16-011 was
moving very quickly through the process. She pointed out
that this is the first Government Relations Committee Meeting
since SB 16-011 was introduced. She stated that currently
RTD receives a minimum of $3 million annually under the
Funding Advancements for Surface Transportation and
Economic Recovery Act of 2009 (FASTER). RTD also has the
opportunity to compete for funding from a statewide pool of
$2 million. She stated that passage of SB 16-011 would have
a significant impact on RTD’s funding.
Director Francone inquired if her understanding was correct
that the funds received under FASTER are to be used
specifically for improvements to roads and bridges. Sherry
Ellebracht said that FASTER allocates $15 million for transit
funding. Marla Lien, General Counsel, explained that there is a
broad definition of projects that can be eligible for FASTER
funds. She indicated that they had to be roadway related, so
RTD could not use the funds to buy light rail vehicles, but
funds had been used for things like the Mall Shuttle
transitway, DUS, Park-n-Ride improvements, etc.
Director Menten thought that if SB 16-011 passed, the funds
would go back to CDOT for road improvements and safety.
Sherry Ellebracht said she thought that was correct. Director
Menten wondered if that meant these funds would be used to
improve a bridge where our buses traveled over. Sherry
Ellebracht stated that it would depend on what area of the
state CDOT decided to use the funding, and on what projects,
but it was possible.
Director Anderson pointed out that many of our riders use the
vehicles to get to Park-n-Rides to use our service. She
believes passage of SB 16-011 would hinder projects that held

C. Updates

• Local Update - CRL Associates
Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, shared that he attended the Metro Mayors
Caucus (MMC) Retreat on January 9th. He commented that transportation
was a major topic in a number of ways. He said there was a presentation
regarding a new non-profit called Mobility Choice with the goal of creating a
vision for the future of mobility in the Metro area. Roger Sherman said this
non-profit will be analyzing the feasibility of a 2018 ballot measure to fund
the vision that comes out of this group. He said the second presentation
related to transit was by Build a Better Colorado, which is the statewide
conversation that is occurring around various constitutional challenges and
funding/fiscal policies. He noted that one of the items being discussed is a
potential debrucing of the State which would provide new funding. One of
the other items under discussion is targeting some of those funds for
transportation. There was also a general discussion of transportation led by
Mayor Jim Gunning.
Roger Sherman pointed out that transportation is a major focus for our local
elected mayors, but what is different is that there are very different opinions
than we saw leading up to the 2004 election. He stated that the MMC is
meeting on February 3, 2016 as well to hear a presentation related to polling
that was completed by the Colorado Contractors Association. He said this
polling has shown some favorability for a statewide sales tax for
transportation. He shared that there is interest in pursuing that for the 2016
ballot. He explained that there is the risk that competition between the
various transportation funding ideas could end up killing all of them. He

Committee Chair Folska pointed out that many on the Board
are concerned with a low income fare. She thinks no longer

dependent.

stated that there is agreement that there is a transportation funding
challenge but very differing opinions about how to move forward.
Roger Sherman shared that he will be attending the Colorado City and
County Managers Association Conference at the end of February. He
believes it is very important for CRL to maintain those relationships.

Director Francone said she was glad to hear that transportation is on
everyone’s mind. She wondered if there was any indication of the hot
button issues for the MMC. She wondered if it was bike trails, the bullet
train from Cheyenne to Pueblo, etc. Roger Sherman commented that the
group never got into that level of detail; however, there were a lot of
differing opinions that started to surface depending on where they were in
the region and based on party affiliation. He believes if there is a solution
that encompasses everyone’s needs it will be harder to reach than the
FasTracks tax ballot was in 2003/2004.
Director Lubow asked if there was any specific discussion related to transit
itself related to the Mobility Choice non-profit. Roger Sherman stated that
there was discussion about partnering with RTD, CDOT and DRCOG to talk
about funding priorities. There was also a discussion related to looking the
FasTracks projects that had not yet been finished and looking at all the
alternatives. He noted another primary focus is first and last mile
connection and if there is a way for the public and private sector to partner
in those connections.

• State Update - Brandeberry~McKenna
Jenifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry~McKenna, thanked the Directors who
were able to attend the Legislative Event at Denver Union Station. She
thought it was very well attended, and not just by legislators from the Front
Range. It was a great opportunity for educating the legislators and
networking.
Jenifer Brandeberry noted that the legislature is now up and running. She
shared that on the third and final reading House Bill 16-1008, roadway
shoulder access for buses, it passed out of the House to the Senate. She
pointed out that this is a bipartisan bill that CDOT is leading along with
support from RTD and DRCOG. She expects the bill will continue to move
forward quickly.

Roger Sherman informed the Board that he will be reaching out to them soon
to schedule one-on-one meetings to begin preparing for the telephone town
halls. He said the plan is to start early so that everyone feels prepared.

Jenifer Brandeberry anticipates Senate Bill 16-037 dying this week in the
Senate. This is a bill by Senator Kefalas and Representative Pabon related to
the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA). She explained that there is a lot of
concern surrounding the way it has been drafted and the burden that would
be placed on the public entity in terms of how they needed to compile
information. She noted that this is a very complicated issue but thinks the
time is right for there to be a stakeholder process to update CORA so it
reflects current technology.
Director Bagley commented that the Resolution related to the Board’s
position of opposition of SB 16-011 passed 12 to 2. He wondered if it was
appropriate for members of the Board and staff to testify before the House
on RTD’s position. He thinks this bill is of critical importance to RTD. Marla
Lien, General Counsel, stated at this time the Board had not taken a position
related to SB 16-011 as it had only passed the Government Relations
Committee. She said that assuming the Board passed the resolution any
Board member or staff member could testify relative to RTD’s position;
conversely, any Board member can testify as to their own personal position
as long as they make it clear they are not testifying on behalf of the Board
or RTD.
Jenifer Brandeberry indicated she would be happy to work with members of
the Board to craft appropriate testimony. She reiterated that the likelihood
of this bill passing is slim. She pointed out that Director Menten testified in
support of SB 16-011. Jenifer Brandeberry said she wanted to thank
Director Menten for the way she conducted herself. Director Menten made
it clear she was there as a personal citizen providing her personal opinion.
Director Francone asked of Senate Bill 16-037 related to CORA was the bill
requiring that records are provided in an electronic formal. Jenifer
Brandeberry said that was correct. She reiterated that this bill will die in the
Senate as it was not written right; however, she thinks there will be a
second bill introduced later after a stakeholder group is established.
Committee Chair Folska noted that SB 16-037 could have a real impact on
RTD as we process many, many CORA requests. Jenifer Brandeberry
explained that there is a demand from some groups that would like to
require certain types of burdens on public entities to format the records in a
way that would benefit those groups. The public entities are concerned
about privacy issues, work that goes into preparing the records, etc. She
believes that most public entities recognize the need to update CORA to
Packet Pg. 16

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 2, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Jenifer Brandeberry reiterated that this session is going to be marked by bills
being introduced in one chamber and killed off by the other. She said that
bigger issues like transportation funding will come after the March forecast.

6.B

Director Menten shared that SB 16-037 is a bill she strongly supports. She
pointed out that there have been several stakeholder meetings since early
December that were started by open records advocates. She thinks the
public entities are overreacting to this bill. She hopes this bill does not die
and she will be working on her end to move it forward. She stressed that
there has been a lot of stakeholder input. She believes there has been a
great deal of misinformation about what the bill is actually doing. Jenifer
Brandeberry agrees the conversation will continue. She thinks it is a matter
of striking a balance between what makes sense from a cost standpoint and
a fairness standpoint. She stated that Brandeberry~McKenna would
continue to monitor the issue and report back to the Board.
Director Bagley wanted to note that when Director Menten said ‘we’ related
to SB 16-037 she was not speaking on behalf of the RTD Board. He
expressed concern that within the RTD Committee and Board meetings
when someone used the term ‘we’ there was a tendency for that to mean
the RTD Board. Director Menten did not believe she implied she was
speaking in reference to the RTD Board but instead she was speaking of a
stakeholder group.
Director Anderson believes everyone’s wishes need to be respected and an
agreement needs to be reached related to updating CORA; however, it
should not just be special interest groups that are dictating the changes.
Director Solano wondered what House Bill 16-1097 was trying to
accomplish by changing the oversight for permits for Medicaid transportation
providers. Jenifer Brandeberry explained that there is a program for recipient
of Medicaid to receive transportation services. She stated that on the Front
Range the program works pretty well; however, in rural communities there
have been issues surrounding how these people get services. The permitting
process for entities that want to provide those transportation services has
been pretty laborious. The goal of this bill is to streamline the process for
service providers in rural areas. She explained that sometimes there can be
confusion between the Medicaid transportation services and Access-a-Ride
so they monitor the discussion.
Director Menten requested that it be made clear that the Resolution of RTD’s
position on SB 16-011 passed by a vote of 12 to 2 in any testimony from
RTD Directors or staff.
Committee Chair Folska thanked Brandeberry~McKenna for their work on
the Legislative event. She thought they did a great job. She also thanked
the Directors that were able to attend. She noted that Director Bagley put

time.

together some wonderful information about Denver Union Station. She
encouraged the Directors that were not in attendance to make sure they
received a copy.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Sherry Ellebracht commented that there was not much to report from
Washington as there has not been much activity. She said the next big
thing coming up is the President’s Fiscal Year 2017 budget proposal that will
come out in February. She anticipates the Eagle P3 will be in the proposal
but Squire Patton Boggs will be watching it very closely and report back.

Director Francone reported that on January 20 she attended the Hispanic
Contractors of Colorado’s annual dinner. She shared that they were very excited to
have someone from RTD in attendance. She thought it was a wonderful outreach
and noted that the Hispanic community, especially the small business, are very
anxious to do business with RTD.

B. Recommended Actions

• RTD Citizens Advisory Committee
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors change the name of the RTD FasTracks Citizens Advisory
Committee to the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee and revise the structure
accordingly.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 16, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, commented that he was
filling in for the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Co-Chairs
who were unable to make the meeting due to weather. He
explained that this recommendation was the result of
extensive conversation with the Board and CAC Members. He
said the goal of the recommendation was to broaden the role
of the CAC while maintaining the original intent. The CAC will
begin to focus on RTD’s Strategic Plan which will allow the
CAC to always be aligned with what the Board has identified
as RTD’s priorities. He stated that the membership and
selection process will remain the same. The CAC has held off
on filling its recent vacancies until this action was approved.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

C. Updates
Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs,
said that while it might seem early to be discussing the operations and
maintenance of the North Metro Line since it will not be opening until 2018,
staff will be coming to the Board in March with a request for approval to
enter into an agreement with Denver Transit Partners (DTP) to maintain the
12 rail vehicles that have already been purchased for the North Metro Line.
He explained that staff wanted to hear the Board’s input and questions so
they could be sure to cover everything when they bring the request before
the Board.
Henry Stopplecamp shared that the operations and maintenance of the North
Metro Line had not yet been determined. At this time there are three
options staff is considering which are:
 RTD forms a commuter rail division under Rail Operations
 RTD issues a Request for Proposals for a third party to operate the
North Metro Line
 RTD Enters into a contract with Denver Transit Partners to operate
the North Metro Line in conjunction with operating the Eagle P3 lines
He reiterated that staff is still in the beginning phases of discussing the
North Metro Line operations and maintenance and will come back to the
Board to brief them once there are more definitive plans.
Henry Stopplecamp said he had Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager
of Rail Operations, and Greg Straight, Eagle P3 Engineering Project Manager,
with him to answer any questions.
Committee Chair Hoy summarized that RTD took advantage of purchasing
these 12 trains in conjunction with trains for Eagle P3 to get bargain pricing,
which means that while we got them at a bargain we now also have to do
something with them until they are needed.

Packet Pg. 21

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 2, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

• North Metro O & M Update

6.C

Director Bagley said that his understanding was the same as that of
Committee Chair Hoy. He noted that these trains will not just be sitting on
siding track somewhere but will be incorporated into the Eagle P3 fleet until
they are needed.

Director Lubow wondered if this took away from these vehicles useful life.
Henry Stopplecamp stated that any miles traveled by a vehicle will reduce its
useful life; however, he explained that we needed to run the trains to ensure
we discovered any issues before they were out of warranty. Additionally,
he noted that it is bad for a vehicle to sit for too long. He said that they
would be integrated into the fleet to keep the running and guarantee they
had the proper service intervals.
Director Folska asked staff to prepare a cost-benefit analysis of the three
options outlined for the North Metro operations and maintenance when it is
brought back to the Board.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley wished Director Anderson a happy belated birthday.
Director Sisk thanked Committee Chair Hoy and Committee Vice-Chair James for
cancelling the FasTracks Monitoring and Planning and Development Committee
Meetings in January. He thought it was a good sign of the Board working to
eliminate unnecessary meetings. He believes the Board will see somewhat of a
convergence between the FasTracks Monitoring and the Planning and Development
Committee Meetings as more FasTracks projects are completed.
Committee Chair Hoy thinks that convergence is really an appropriate term. He
stated that he and Director James will be very cognizant of only having meetings
that are necessary.

B. Recommended Actions

• RTD Director District Precinct Assignment
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the revised Director District boundary between
Director District F and Director District G so that all of Arapahoe County
Precinct Number 356 falls within Director District G, where a majority of the
precinct already lies. This alternative would affect the fewest number of
households.
Motion:

Chair Tobiassen made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 16, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Lasater asked staff to make sure they notify the
county to make sure the proper ballots were sent to the proper
Districts. He shared that when he was running for the Board
last year there was an issue and a special ballot had to be sent
to the people who were moved to District G.
Paula Perdue, Executive Director to the Board of Directors,
agreed with Director Lasater. She stated this is a major issue
as RTD goes into an election year. She explained that once
this was approved by the Board, staff would be working with
the counties, Secretary of State, etc. to follow the proper
notification procedures.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the revised boundary map of the District and
authorize the Board Secretary to certify the boundary map and description.
It is further recommended that the areas newly annexed to RTD pursuant to
the provisions of CRS 32-9-106 be designated as follows:
a. The two Erie annexations – the Spallone No. 5 Annexation and the
Andalusia Annexation – are recommended to be included in Director
District I (Director Lubow); and
b. The Parker annexation – Todd Drive – is recommended to be included
in Director District G (Director Lasater).
Motion:

Director Sisk made the motion to move this item
to the full Board at the February 16, 2016 Board
Meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Solano wondered how many people would be added
to Districts I and G as a result of these annexations. Chris
Quinn, Planning Project Manager, stated that in the case of the
annexations in Parker (District G) it would just be adding rightof-way. He said in Erie (District I) one of the annexations was
vacant and the other was very small but he did not know the
exact number of people it contained. Committee Chair James
noted the number of people added would be quite small.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

C. Updates
Michael Washington, Title VI Manager, reviewed a Power Point presentation
that is available in the February 2, 2016 Planning and Development
Committee Agenda Packet. He reminded the Board that in September, 2015
the Board committed to convene an RTD and Stakeholder Pass Program
Working Group with approval of the EcoPass fare changes. He said the pass
programs that would be reviewed by the working group include both the
individual passes (Day, Month and Valu) as well as the group rate passes
(Eco, Flex and College).
Michael Washington outlined the guiding principles of the working group as
established by staff as follows:
 Increase Ridership
 Meet SBP Revenue Targets
 Provide RTD Revenue Certainty
 Improve Customer Convenience
 Promote Greater Brand Loyalty
 Simplify Passenger-Operator Interaction
 Cost Effective Administration
 Sustain Equitable Access
Michael Washington indicated that the first step of the study process would
be to finalize the pass program objectives and guiding principles with input
from the Board. A facilitator and technical consultant would be hired prior
to assembling and engaging stakeholder groups and developing policy
recommendations.
Director Folska stated that she finds the pass program to be very
complicated. She can understand why staff feels like they need help;
however, she is not inclined to support hiring an outside facilitator and
technical consultant. She pointed out that staff has been working on the
fare for over a year. What RTD needs is a low income fare as there is
already a Day Pass, Eco Pass, etc. She feels this is redundant.
Director Menten suggesting holding off on looking to hire a facilitator until
February of 2017 so that there is a full year’s worth of data on the current
pass programs. She does not think there is enough data at this time for an
accurate evaluation. She wonders what else can be done to let people know
that they need to be tapping their badge as the people she speaks with still
do not know what they need to do. She thinks this is premature. She

• Pass Program Study Update

6.D

Director Lubow shared that she does not have an opinion one way or the
other about hiring a facilitator. What she is interested in is helping low
income individuals have better access to our discounts. She said the Board
has been listening for two years about how much they need help. She said
that the Board and staff have seen through the Affordable Fares Task Force
that our programs do not go far enough. Director Lubow expressed that she
would like to see people from the Affordable Fares Task Force be included in
the Pass Program Working Group. She thanked staff for being willing to
work on these important issues.
Director Solano does not believe we need to hire a new facilitator and
technical consultant. He stated that staff has been looking at our fares and
pass programs for quite a while. He hopes that staff can conduct an
analysis of what the new fare structure has done both positively and
negatively but he reiterated that we do not need to hire someone. He
agrees with Director Lubow on the importance of helping our low income
riders.
Director Francone indicated that she was disappointed with this presentation
as she thought staff was going to be presenting the Board with information
on a low income pass program. She echoed the thoughts of Directors
Folska and Menten. She thought RTD was done studying the pass programs
with the implementation of the fare increase in January. She stated that
one way or the other she would like to see something with respect to a low
income fare program.
Chair Tobiassen believes that there are many stakeholders that are
interested in reviewing the passes that are important to them. He said it is
his expectation that in reviewing these passes a low income pass would be
incorporated at the same time. He stated that it is important that this
process is extremely transparent because RTD is dealing with taxpayer
money. He said it is also important that the cost of these programs does
not have an impact of the level of service provided. RTD cannot cut routes
or maintenance to support pass programs. Chair Tobiassen stressed the
importance of receiving public input on all the pass programs.
Director Walker expressed that this is a huge, gargantuan effort because
there are so many forces at work that make our fares unaffordable. He feels
it would be beneficial to have an outline of factors affecting the low income.
He thinks it is prudent to hire a consultant so RTD is removed from the issue
since it affects RTD directly. He said that so far he likes what staff is

stated that she is not fond of spending money on a facilitator, especially
when it is too early in the process.

presenting. He recognized that it will grow and change and morph but this
is a good first step.

Director Folska stated that she does not want staff to have the impression
that she is not supportive of streamlining our passes and getting public
feedback; however, she hopes there is not any redundancy in doing what
has already been done. She stated that she is still waiting for the customer
satisfaction survey that RTD paid $1.4 million for and it has been over two
years. She thinks staff can look at data we already have obtained in this
analysis.
Director Menten said it was her understanding that the Stakeholder Pass
Program Working Group was created because there were people who felt
that the cost of the EcoPasses jumped forward to quickly. She stated this
Working Group has nothing to do with low income fares. She asked if she
was wrong. Michael Washington stated she was not.
Director Anderson said that it was her understanding that this is coming up
because there was a Title VI issue. She expressed that she does not want
to open up things like the Day Pass that have already been settled. She
agrees with Director Menten that there needs to be a year’s worth of data
before there can be proper analysis. She understands people in Boulder
want more input in the EcoPasses but she does not want to go through all of
our passes again. She said that as far as a low income pass is concerned,
the Board continually hears about many things that do not apply to transit
like wage inequality, housing, etc. She stated that those are issues that
need to be addressed by the US Congress and our State Legislature. The
role of RTD is to provide transit. She agrees with Chair Tobiassen that
routes should not be cut to give someone a free or discounted pass.
Director Lubow shared that she has been in touch with Boulder County
Transportation who was concerned about the EcoPass costs increasing
much more than the other passes. She noted that they have told her they
are very interested in making sure there is a low income piece to whatever
analysis is done on passes.

Director Hoy believes that RTD has a pretty robust Non-Profit program right
now. He pointed out that RTD allocates millions of taxpayer dollars to this
program. He said it was his understanding that typically some of that
money goes unused. He commented that there are groups that could go
through the process to become eligible but do not. He feels that until the
system in place is expended he does not think there is a great deal of
incentive to throw taxpayer money at a similar system. He encourages
continued dialog but is not enthusiastic about the direction.

Marla Lien, General Counsel, stated that the Title VI issue was addressed
when the EcoPasses were increased by 18%. Marla Lien pointed out that
the Board has not adopted the guiding principles that were outlined in the
presentation. She understands that the Board is feeling a little pass and fare
fatigue; however, staff is trying to be proactive in establishing the guiding
principles so staff has a place to work from going forward. The Board can
elect to add more principles about affordability, access, etc.
Interim General Manager Genova agrees with comments that had been made
that it will be important to have a year’s worth of data, especially with the
new fares and five openings. He recognized that this would be a charged
topic which is why staff is recommending a facilitator. He shared that staff
has heard from many stakeholders that they would like one as well. He
explained that hiring a facilitator and technical consultant brings an unbiased
third-party into the analysis.
Committee Chair James thinks RTD should keep the momentum going on
aggressively analyzing what we are doing in a balanced, transparent way.
He thanked staff for the update.
Director Lubow thanked Marla Lien for her explanation of the importance of
looking at the passes. She said she would like the last guiding principle to
read “sustain and promote equitable access” rather than just “sustain
equitable access”.
Interim General Manager Genova thanked Director Lubow for the input. He
encouraged the other Board members to send their input to Michael
Washington for incorporation into the guiding principles and objectives.
Michael Washington introduced Shantel Lewis, the new Title VI Specialist,
that was just added to the team.

Interim General Manager Genova explained that the Stakeholder Pass
Program Working Group will be looking at RTD’s existing pass programs.
RTD made the commitment to form this group when the EcoPass pricing
was approved in 2015. He stated that this would not look at the fare
structure, just the passes. He stressed that staff will continue to meet with
the Affordable Fares Task Force. He said that as the Board is aware, the
major issue is to find a sustained funding source.

Zamy Silva outlined the goals for the Civil Rights Department in 2016 as
follows:
 Create and implement Standard Operating Procedures
 Small Business Office (SBO) will collaborate with the City and County
of Denver and CDOT to increase SBE participation in RTD projects
 Complete the Triennial DBE Goal Methodology for the Small Business

 Complete and submit all EEO reports on-time
 Execute an Intergovernmental Agreement and Memorandum of
Understanding with Colorado Community College and the Urban
League of Metro Denver for further support in the community with
the award of the FTA grant for WIN
 Report to the FTA on the WIN Innovative Workforce Development
team
Director Francone remembers there being an Internal Audit conducted last
year on the WIN program. She wondered if a copy of that had been
provided to the Board. Interim General Manager Genova explained that he
was not sure where that was in the audit process, but he would follow up
with staff. He said he would make sure the Board had a copy if it was
complete.
Director Francone wondered if there were any plans to outreach to other
communities, not just the City and County of Denver. Zamy Silva stated
that for the WIN program, Martell Dyles, WIN Program Manager, would be
doing outreach to various communities, not just the City and County of
Denver and Urban Metro League of Denver. She shared that the City and
County of Denver and CDOT are charged with certifying all DBEs, so
collaboration with these two entities is critical to reach more DBEs within
the Metro region.

Director Sisk indicated he was sorry to see in the newspaper that former
RTD Senior Manager of Civil Rights Kenn Hardin had been found guilty of
three counts of bribery. He asked for further information as he feels this
casts RTD in a bad light even though he was not doing anything in his
official capacity at RTD. Marla Lien stated that at no point was there any
implication that RTD had acted improperly in the way we conducted
business. She stressed there was no evidence he effectuated any decisions
nor were there any awards of contracts made because he received a bribe.
While Kenn Hardin was charged criminally, there was neither investigation of
RTD nor any allegation of any inappropriate activity on the part of RTD.
Director Sisk stated that he was not suggesting RTD did anything wrong;
however, there are people that jump to certain conclusions because Kenn
Hardin was an employee of RTD. He hopes the RTD Board and staff are
reminded how their own personal actions can be perceived.
Committee Chair Deadwyler inquired if the application process for the WIN
program was the same for people with disabilities. Interim General Manager
Genova stated that the application process is the same for anyone applying
to RTD, including the WIN program. Zamy Silva shared that staff has meet
with the ADA community to talk about the WIN program and how it can be
made more accessible. She said that information had been created in braille
and large print but it had not yet been distributed. She stated that the WIN
program plans to develop more outreach efforts but have not implemented
anything at this time.
Committee Chair Deadwyler wondered why the goal for 2016 for the EEO
department to collaborate with HR to outreach to minority and women
organizations about job opportunities did not also include ADA organizations.
Zamy Silva explained that RTD is required to do workforce utilization
analysis looking at various job categories, as defined by the federal
government, to determine if we are deficient in hiring women and minorities.
The FTA does not require RTD to determine if we are deficient in hiring
people from the ADA community because RTD cannot force people to report
if they have a disability. She said that RTD is deficient in several areas
which is why EEO will be working with HR to address the deficiencies. She

Director Menten asked for a list of all positions at RTD that do not require
100% use of physical abilities such as walking, hearing, etc. Interim
General Manager Genova explained that he would have to work with HR to
provide that information as it would be necessary to manually review every
job description. Marla Lien, General Counsel, pointed out that at the request
for Director Folska, HR has been reviewing RTD’s job descriptions every time
a job is posted to see if some of the requirements that were previously
considered boilerplate, like being able to lift 25 lbs., are really necessary.

noted that outside of that requirement, it is the goal of Civil Rights to do
more outreach with our ADA community as well.

Director Solano suggested establishing an emphasis on ethics. He thinks
that sometimes people forget their focus on the common good. Marla Lien
explained that as part of RTD’s required training, all employees are required
to take an ethics class. Employees must also receive and sign the Code of
Ethics.

C. Updates

• Salaried Employee DB Pension Plan
Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of
Finance and Administration, introduced Wendy Londa of Rael and Letson
who reviewed a Power Point Presentation that was included in the February
9, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.
Wendy Londa reminded the Board that the Salaried Employees’ Pension Plan
is reviewed each year by an Actuarial and a fund status is provided. She
explained that as an Actuarial she is required to adhere to generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP). This fund status is based on a snapshot in
time along with a comparison of what happened over the year versus the
Actuarial assumptions.
Wendy Londa reviewed the following valuation highlights as of January 1,
2015:
 Total participant count decreased by 15 (716 to 701)
o Plan closed to new participants on January 1, 2008
o Active population decreased from 382 to 361
 Actuarial Accrued Liability increased by $12.9M (from $133.6M
to $146.5M)
 Actuarial Value of Assets increased by $7.2M (from $113.7M to
$120.9M)

Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability increased by $5.8M (from
$19.9M to $25.6M)
Funded ratio based on the Actuarial Value of Assets decreased
from 85.1% to 82.5%
Funded ratio based on the Market Value of Assets decreased from
93.5% to 88.7%
Recommended contribution increased by $1.1M from $5.47M to
$6.8M

Wendy Londa reminded the Board that in 2013 the Board approved a
funding policy which was changed from a percent of payroll (9% cap) to the
actuary’s recommended contribution amount of up to $3.1 million annually;
however, due to poor investment performance in 2015 and a significant
salary loss in 2014, the Plan is not projected to achieve 100% funding with
a $3.1 million annual contribution. She noted that based on the projections,
the Board approved a $4.1 million contribution for 2016 while the actuary’s
recommended contribution was $6.8 million.
Wendy Londa explained that the Plan experienced a $3.5 million salary loss
in 2014 due to an 8.21% average salary increase for continuing activities
compared to an expected average increase of 4.0%. Additionally,
investment return in 2015 fell well short of the 7.50% assumption at -0.5%
for 2015. She stated that based on the January 1, 2015 valuation results
and a -0.5% return on assets for 2015, if all Actuarial assumptions are met
each year the Plan is projected to reach 100% funding in 2043. She
stressed that future investment returns will have a significant impact on
when the Plan will reach 100% funding.
Director Archuleta inquired as to who funds the pension. He wondered if
the employees paid into it. Wendy Londa stated that RTD contributes to the
Defined Benefit (DB) pension plan. Marla Lien, General Counsel, noted that
this valuation was only for the Salaried Employees’ Pension Plan (Plan). She
explained for this Plan employees do not pay into it.
Committee Chair Menten believes part of the problem is that there were
average salary increases of over 8%. She commented that the average
person in the workforce has not had an 8% salary increase. She wondered
what safeguards are in place to protect the taxpayers as the contributions to
the Plan are essentially taxpayer money. Heather Copp reminded the Board
that between 2008 and 2011 there were no pay increases. She stated that
employees pay was falling below market level, so in 2012 progression
increases were implemented to move people closer to that level. In addition,
in 2014 employees began receiving results based pay raises, which were
also done in 2015 and 2016. She believes at this time there has now been
a leveling out of people reaching a more reasonable market rate. She does

Director Anderson wondered if an employee would stay in this Plan if they
moved to a different position. Heather Copp stated they would stay in the
same plan. Director Anderson shared that in her experience, plans similar to
this, once closed to new participants, get more actuarially sound because
there are fewer and fewer people in the plan. Wendy Londa pointed out that
it still depends on the funding.
Director Hoy said he did not believe there were many new jobs created last
year, so he wonders how promotions affected the salary increase so much.
Heather Copp explained that there could be a scenario where someone was
in the new retirement plan, left RTD, and then someone from the Pension
Plan was promoted to that position. She said that overall, the total
percentage of salary increases related to people that got promoted was
12%.
Director Hoy wondered if staff had given any thought to a third plan.
Heather Copp said no as staff was very happy with the new plan. It is
working very well and does not have a pension liability.
Heather Copp stated that when looking at other pension plans she feels our
plan is in pretty good shape. She noted there is always the risk that the
return on the assets will be lower than anticipated as what happened in
2015; however, that was one of the reasons the trustees recommended the
contribution be raised to $4.1 million for 2016.

• Represented Employee DB Plan
Doug MacLeod, Controller, noted that this fund status was for the Union
Pension Plan. He asked Leslie Thompson of Gabriel Roeder Smith &
Company to review the Power Point Presentation included in the February 9,
2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.
Leslie Thompson pointed out that this plan does have funding from the
employees. She stated that as she informed the Board last year, this Plan is
still in funding peril. She explained that the fund was in better shape than
last year but wanted to make sure the Board understood the fund was still in
funding peril.

Packet Pg. 40

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

not anticipate there will be the same salary increase in the future. She
pointed out that there were also employees who were promoted which
added to the salary increase. She does not think that should be
discouraged. Heather Copp explained that salary increases are approved by
the Board annually through the budget process.

Leslie Thompson reviewed the following valuation highlights as of January
1, 2015:
 Contributions are not sufficient to fund the liabilities
o Total actuarial requirement is 25.21% while 18.0% is
scheduled for receipt in 2015
 Fund is projected to be fully depleted by 2040 while last year it was
2036 and the year before was 2032 assuming 7.0% earnings
 Actuarial Accrued Liability increased by $1.0 million
 Actuarial Value of Assets returned 7.36%, exceeding the assumed
7.0%
 Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability decreased by $3.5 million
 The normal cost decreased from 11.81% of pay to 10.79%
 Funded ratio increased from 48.7% to 49.6%
 Total active participant count increased by 106
Leslie Thompson stated that the funded ratio of 49.6% is a low, funded
ratio as the national average is around 80%. She indicated there are signs
that the pension reforms made, such as the changes in benefits for
employees hired after 2010 and the funding increases in 2013, are working;
however, she reiterated that the plan is not out of the woods yet. She
stressed that she did not want to leave the Board in a relaxed stated based
on the improvements the Plan has seen. She pointed out that a few bad
years of returns on assets could bring the fund to zero very quickly.
Committee Chair Menten stated she would worry about anyone that felt
relaxed after that presentation.
Director Solano expressed that it seemed odd to him that the salaried
employees do not pay into their retirement plans but the represented do. He
feels like this is an inequality between the two groups. Heather Copp noted
it was true that the salaried employees do not pay into their plan; however,
on the salaried side RTD only pays 9% of an employee’s salary while on the
union side RTD puts in 13%, so the ratio is higher. Director Solano thinks it
is important to look at this Plan because we do not want to go broke like
other organizations have.
Committee Chair Menten asked how honest the discussion is at the Union
Pension Trustee Board Meetings about the state of their Plan. She wonders
if the union knows how bad the outlook is. Doug MacLeod shared that he is
on the Trustee Board and they do have those very frank discussions. Leslie
Thompson gives them periodic presentations as well. He stated that
everyone is very well aware of what is going on with the Plan. He pointed
out that the contributions are dictated by the Collective Bargaining

Agreement (CBA) so he is not sure there is much that the Trustee Board can
do.

Committee Chair Menten said that in talking to the bus drivers they do not
seem to understand the situation.
Chair Tobiassen asked if there were other retirement that union members
could participate in. Doug MacLeod indicated there is a retirement plan that
they can elect to participate in and determine their contribution. He noted
that RTD employees also contribute to Social Security, which many
government agencies do not.
Director Archuleta wondered what RTD planned to do about the funding of
the Plan. He stated that the situation did not sound good. Doug MacLeod
noted that the Plan has been extended through some of the measures that
have been taken. Marla Lien explained that the collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) is what defines the funding commitments of RTD while
the Trustee Board defines the benefits. RTD does not set the benefits nor is
RTD liable to pay for anything other than the amount defined in the CBA.
Interim General Manager Genova believes the Pension funding will be one of
the main items during the next CBA negotiations along with wages.
Director Solano believes that during the CBA negotiations the wages of the
salaried employees also need to be evaluated so things are more equitable.
Director Hoy asked if it was a fair synopsis that it really was the union
employees’ pension. The Trustee Board decides what the benefits are for
retiring employees. RTD is only responsible for the contribution outlined in
the CBA. Interim General Manager Genova said there are three salaried
employees on the Trust Board and three union members. The Trustee Board
must reach consensus for any changes. Marla Lien explained that if the
union trustees do not agree to proposed changes the only way to make
those changes would be to force arbitration. Heather Copp reiterated that
RTD’s liability is the 13% of union salaries that we have agreed to
contribute.

Marla Lien indicated that what Doug MacLeod reviewed is what happens at
the Trustee Board Meetings. She explained that RTD does not know what
the Union Trustees share with the union as RTD management is constrained
as to how they communicate with union members. She stated that while
RTD does not know what the union members know, the union officers are
aware.

• December Monthly Financial Status Report

Doug MacLeod stated that December is usually our best month for sales and
use tax so staff was surprised to see it at 8% under budget. He shared that
staff immediately contacted the Department of Revenue who explained that
there were 1400 returns filed electronically that were corrupted. The
Department of Revenue is working to provide an estimate of how much RTD
is owed from those returns. Heather Copp commented that the hope is to
count this revenue for December; however, if that is not the case then the
January sales and use tax will probably be higher than expected.
Doug MacLeod stated that we have about an $11 million shortfall in revenue
compared to the budget. Heather Copp said that staff had been estimating
between $8-10 million with a worst case scenario of $14 million. She noted
that even with the missing returns revenue was better than the worst case
scenario. She shared that staff had made provisions to cover this shortfall.
She indicated that as soon as the books were closed she would provide the
Board with the actual budget shortfall.
Director Archuleta wondered how we count extra money that someone
might pay in fare. For example, if the fare should be $2.60 and a person
puts in $3.00, he asked how the extra $0.40 is recorded. Doug MacLeod
said that the extra money is not really recorded. Bus drivers record if
someone pays a fare but not if they pay too much.
Director Sisk inquired if RTD had a claim against the State in terms of
fiduciary responsibility as these corrupted records have really affected our
finances. Heather Copp explained that something like corrupted files are
items that they do not have much control over. She does not think there are
any claims against the State but the State will owe RTD interest. Director
Sisk asked staff to look to make sure RTD does not have a claim.
Director Solano shared that several months ago he received a copy of a
whitepaper produced by St. Louis Metro Bus Service about analytic
measures they use that are not used at RTD. He believes these are good
analytical tools that should be utilized and asked staff to look into it. He
said he could provide a copy of the whitepaper if needed.

Doug MacLeod reviewed the Monthly Financial Status Report that was
included in the February 9, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit

December and year-to-date we were under budget for sales and use tax,
ridership and fare revenue. He said YTD we were down 1.8%, 4.3% and
1.7% respectively. For the month we were down 8%, 7.1% and 4%.

Committee Chair Menten asked when staff would come back to the Board
with budget adjustments for 2016. Heather Copp anticipates that 2016 will
be lower than what is budgeted based on the trend of the past 6 months.
She said that staff will come back with an amended budget in the June/July
timeframe.
Committee Chair Menten asked staff to send the Board the updated sales
and use tax numbers as soon as it was available.

Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments, noted that the
report was included in the February 9, 2016 Financial Administration and
Audit Committee Agenda Packet. He shared that it was an interesting
quarter in the bond market with the Federal Reserve raising rates. He stated
that investment return outperformed both indexes; however, for the
enhanced cash tier both the benchmark and RTD’s enhanced cash had
negative returns for the 4th quarter. Year-to-Date both the liquidity tier and
enhanced cash tier were positive.
There were no questions from the Directors.

• SmartCard Project Update
Heather Copp shared that out of the 913 people that were participating in
the pilot, 495 cards had been loaded for a total of $31,900. The total
boardings using Smart Cards were 5,160 for an average fare of $2.21. She
shared that the steering committee has agreed to issue up-to another 1,000
cards next week and the following week as staff felt more cards were
needed to gather meaningful feedback.
Heather Copp noted that negotiations with King Sooper’s were supposed to
start after the Super Bowl; however, they have asked that this be delayed
until March. She noted the following status changes from the report:
 Day Pass Printers changed to yellow until the random issues that
have been periodically happening are systematically addressed
 Handheld Smart Media Readers changed to yellow as staff is
monitoring this closely since RTD is relying on two vendors and ontime delivery of the iPhones

Committee Chair Menten wondered if there would actually be a difference in
our sales and use tax after the Department of Revenue reviewed the
corrupted files. Heather Copp stated that staff was unsure at this time. She
said the returns were statewide returns so many may not be within the
District; however, because the numbers were so low compared to what staff
was expecting they do believe it will make some difference.



Stabilization and Enhancement of Current Operating Pass System was
changed to yellow as previously we have seen issues when people
return to college so staff wants to monitor this

Director Sisk asked if the Board should be concerned about the statuses that
changed from green to yellow or if staff was just being overly cautious.
Heather Copp explained that staff wanted to make sure they were being
very transparent. She indicated that even though these are just routine
issues the team thinks it better to err on the side of caution and keep the
Board informed.
Director Sisk wondered what he should tell people who ask him when the
SmartCards will be fully implemented. Heather Copp stated that the
deadline for people to be able to get SmartCards loaded online or at our
sales outlets is June 30 and for passes it is December 30.
Director Deadwyler inquired how staff is advertising that the SmartCards will
be available June 30 as she has many people asking her. Heather Copp
stated that advertising would not begin until closer to rollout.
Director Deadwyler asked if it was a possibility that we would miss the
deadline. Heather Copp indicated that it was “all hands on deck” everyone
was working toward that deadline. Director Deadwyler said she hopes that
is the case as many of her constituents are excited to get the $0.25
discount. Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, pointed
out that there is already a $0.25 discount built into the Access-a-Ride fares.
Fixed-route passengers can take advantage of the discount through the
purchase of ticketbooks until SmartCards are available to the general public.

• Denver Union Station Update
Heather Copp indicated that information on Denver Union Station was
included in the February 9, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit
Committee Agenda Packet to provide the Board with further information.
There were no questions from the Directors.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley reminded the Directors about an email sent regarding additional
classes that the Financial Administration and Audit department planned to host. He
asked if staff could provide more information as he believes it is critical for the

Board to understand RTD’s finances. Heather Copp explained that there had been
quite a few Directors who approached her about wanting more time to really dive
into certain parts of the Strategic Budget Plan, revenue, etc. so staff put together
several classes. She hopes the Board will be able to take advantage of them as she
is very excited to offer them. Paula Perdue, Executive Director to the Board of
Directors, said she would send additional information to the Board as the dates got
closer but they would be starting in March. These workshops are listed on the
Board Two Week Calendar.

B. Recommended Actions

• Access-a-Ride Eligibility Assessments
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager, or his
designee, to enter into a contract with Easter Seals Colorado for the
provision of ADA paratransit eligibility functional assessments.
Performance under the contract is for a five year period and shall not
exceed $2,490,070.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 16, 2016
Board Meeting.
Chair Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
stated that RTD currently contracts with Easter Seals Colorado
to provide the functional assessments for Access-a-Ride
eligibility. The contract with Easter Seals Colorado will expire
on March 31, 2016. On November 6, 2015, RTD issued a
Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price
proposals to provide eligibility assessments. Proposals were
due on December 18, 2015. Only two firms submitted follow
up questions, which were responded to by November 27th. As
a result, only one proposal from Easter Seals of Colorado was
submitted. He indicated that the evaluation committee
deemed they were proficient and the price was reasonable.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Directors Folska, Lasater and Lubow were absent.

6.G

Therefore, staff is recommended entering into a new five year
contract.

Director Francone noted in the Financial Impact section of
the Board report it reflected a higher proposed cost and
asked for additional clarification. Bruce Abel stated that
the cost proposed by Easter Seals was slightly higher than
what was originally budgeted. He believes funds will be
available through a transfer or staff will come back to the
Board through the amended budget process. Director
Francone asked how much higher the Easter Seals costs
were compared to the budget. Larry Buter, Manager of
Paratransit Services, said he would get back to the Board
with that information.

C. Updates

• Final Gold & Northwest Corridors Service Plan
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, explained we
have a number of commuter rail services opening in the Denver region. The
first milestone was the Flatiron Flyer that opened in January of 2016. Last
year the Board approved the rail line service between DIA and Denver Union
Station (DUS). However, tonight’s focus will be on the upcoming Gold Line
(G Line) and Northwest Line (B Line) corridors. He mentioned to the Board
that the information provided in tonight’s Board packet was not the full plan

Packet Pg. 49

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Solano asked staff how they compared the cost of
the Easter Seals proposal with that of other competitors or
what other non-profit agencies pay for similar service.
Bruce Abel explained that since there was only one
proposal, staff compared the dollar amount proposed with
what RTD pays today and what staff expected given
inflation and additional tasks Easter Seals was asked to
perform.

6.G

Doug Monroe, Service Planner and Scheduler, started with the Northwest
Line (B Line) rail service. Doug stated his team expected the commute time
to be 11 minutes from Westminster to DUS. He said peak period service
would be every 30 minutes, which is slightly different from other rail lines
which have 15 minute frequencies. The Gold Line (G Line) line will run
from DUS to Wheat Ridge/Ward in approximately 25 minutes. Doug stated
the two main bus services being replaced by the Gold Line are the 55L and
72L. Currently, there are no plans to replace any bus routes with the
Northwest Line.
Doug Monroe explained that new bus routes were also being introduced to
enhance the mobility in both corridors upon the opening of the Gold and
Northwest rail lines. These routes are:
 Route 53 – replaces Route 51 north of US 36 & Sheridan Station
 Route 55 – new service to operate between Olde Town Arvada
Station and Arvada Ridge Station
 Route 99 – replaces alignment previously served by Route 100 south
of Federal Center Station
 Route 125 – new service from Federal Center Station to 64th/Quaker
via Wheat Ridge-Ward Station
Public Hearings were scheduled in November at Blake Street, South
Westminster, Arvada, and West Arvada. Overall the feedback was positive
but there were concerns about discontinuance of Route 92 west of Sheridan
and Route 72L.
Doug stated the Gold and Northwest Resources Plan is revenue neutral and
the change in service hours is less than 1%.
Doug updated the Board on the timeline. He explained that most of the
steps had been complete. Staff will be asking the Board to approve the final
service plans in March with implementation of the Northwest Line in summer
followed by the Gold Line in fall of 2016.

Bruce added his team has briefed the Board periodically to keep them up-todate on the service plan revisions. He plans to seek Board approval at the
March Board of Directors meeting.
Committee Chair Anderson commented on the process and how the G Line
plan has been thoroughly vetted with all the transportation committees in
Arvada and through the public hearings. She said she is very enthusiastic
Packet Pg. 50

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

but focused on the changes made to the plan since the last Board meeting
as a result of the stakeholder and public input process.

6.G

about this plan because it is going to serve people who have not been
served before. Committee Chair Anderson noted there was some angst
about the changes in the community, but she believes once people get used
to the new plan they will see it serves the area better than previous plans.

Director Francone asked how many parking spaces are at the 41st and Fox
and Arvada Ridge Park—Rides as she anticipates the majority of people will
access those stations by car. Jessie stated he did not have this information
tonight, but would provide to the Board tomorrow.
Chair Tobiassen was curious about the Paratransit service and wanted to
know if there would be a negative impact to existing riders because of
changes to the current service. Bruce said the new service up in the
Northwest area may add some Paratransit service that is not currently
provided. Doug explained that the coverage area is actually about the same.
There is the discontinuous of a small area of fixed-route service but only one
Paratransit rider used Access-a-Ride during the previous year. The changes
to the overall plan are not increasing or decreasing, but rather are
strengthening the core routes.
Committee Chair Anderson stated there are some at risk populations and
now we will provide them with more transit service. She feels this is a huge
and positive change. In her mind, it will provide a safer and better way to
access the bus services and is much more convenient.
Chair Tobiassen thanked Committee Chair Anderson for her feedback.
Director Solano asked if Route 92 was discontinued in conjunction with the
Flatiron Flyer opening. Doug stated that it was not actually discontinued. In
developing the Gold Line service staff reviewed the entire Northwest area in
Jefferson and Adams County. He said that because of Route 92’s proximity
of the Westminster station staff initially proposed cancelling it but has since
revised the proposal. Jessie Carter asked everyone to keep in mind Route
92 has a lot of turns, which provides challenges. He explained that staff
had wanted to streamline it but has since decided to see how it performs
with the G Line opening before making changes.
Director Solano asked why staff decided to keep Route 92. He wondered if
it was due to pressure from the constituents. Doug stated that was correct.

Packet Pg. 51

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Hoy wanted to know if staff had discussed the changes with the
City of Westminster. Doug said they met with Barbara Opie, Assistant City
Manager, last September and she is aware of the changes.

6.G

Director James wondered what the expected ridership was for the
Northwest Line and Gold Line. Doug said it would be between 700-800 for
the Northwest Line and on the Gold Line to be roughly 12,000.
Committee Chair Anderson stated this will provide great connections not just
north and south but east and west as well.

Bruce Abel stated in 2014 RTD entered into a Settlement Agreement with
Colorado Cross Disability Coalition (CCDC). This agreement related to
concerns with access to our fixed-route buses for those using mobility aids.
Part of the settlement was implementation of a tracking mechanism for
when a person with a mobility aid was denied access to our fixed-route
services and provide the Board with this information annually.
Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager of Contracted Services, stated 2015 data
showed 83% of passengers with mobility aids trying to utilize our buses
were passed up due to the securement area being full with other passengers
using mobility aids. She went on to say we are seeing improvements with
our bus operators showing more empathy toward passengers with mobility
devices. Carolyn Conover stated operators are required to complete
paperwork to track these passengers who are passed up. To ensure that
operators understand the importance of completing the paperwork, every
operator is required to meet with management for each incident where a
form is not completed or turned in, and the operator is addressed as needed.
For the private contractors, RTD issues Liquidated Damages if the paperwork
is not provided to RTD.
RTD’s bus operators went through an ADA refresher training. The training
served to raise operators’ awareness of the needs of passengers with a
variety of disabilities and mobility challenges. Additional ADA refresher
training will be given to all operators in 2016.
Carolyn Conover stated last year we noticed several bus mobility device lifts
were inoperable. One positive thing is the majority of these busses with the
lifts will being retired and replaced with low-floor ramp equipped buses.
Overall, from what the data states our new procedures are having a positive
impact on our bus operators.
Committee Chair Anderson thanked staff for providing them with this annual
report. She thought it was very easy to read and understand.
Chair Tobiassen asked if, as part of the original settlement agreement, RTD
would pay a fee per incident or violation. Bruce Abel stated we would if we

did not follow policy. A recent analysis found RTD has not had any policy
violations.

Bruce Abel stated in the last Committee meeting the Board requested an
update on where we are with Recruiting and Hiring. He mentioned training
has been put in place to occur every other week. He provided two
spreadsheets outlining information such as the number or people schedule to
start training, number who actually started, people who began driving, etc.
for both bus and rail. The training is a six week program. There is a
seventh week added if the person will be driving the Mall Shuttle or
mountain routes. Bruce Abel pointed out that entering 2015 the number of
people entering a training class was in the single digits to low double digits.
He mentioned three years ago we were losing about 15 people a month. He
said over the past year it has gone up to about 25. Over the next 3-4
months staff wants to hire 20 people every two weeks, meaning we need to
put 30 people in each training session.
Bruce Abel mentioned on the retention side, we are offering referral bonuses
and implemented hiring bonuses to be paid out over an 18 month period.
Staff also introduced a split-shift differential for employees working shift
splits. His thought was, if we can keep an employee for a year, this should
increase our odds in retaining the employee long term.
Director Hoy wanted to know if all RTD bus drivers start at the same hourly
wage. Bruce Abel said yes, they all start at $15.64 an hour.
Director Solano asked what the average age of new hire was. Bruce Abel
indicated he could not provide an average age; however, he can say we are
not appealing to the younger folks. He said there are many people who are
coming to RTD as a second career.
Director Menten asked if there was a difference between the starting pay for
RTD employees and contractors. Bruce Abel said there was. He indicated
that contractors start in the vicinity of $12 per hour.

• Lost Service Update
Bruce Abel stated at the last Committee meeting there were questions about
lost service. He indicated that detailed information was provided to the
Board in the February 9, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee
Agenda Packet. He reminded the Board that late in 2014 to early 2015 we
were missing around 10 hours of service per day out of over 10,200 total
hours. In the summer it was up to 40 or 50 and in November of 2015 it
went all the way up to over 500 hours. He pointed out that since December

6.G

this figure has been trending down but is not sure what February will hold
with the recent snowstorm.

Committee Chair Anderson thanked staff for this detailed report.
Director Menten commended Gina Callahan, Acting Deputy Assistant
General Manager of Bus Operations for her assistance with customers that
have experienced hardships.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley stated the Board should recognize the extraordinary work our staff
provided to our customers during the recent blizzard. He is really pleased with the
efforts with the staff across the board.
Committee Chair Anderson also thanked RTD for their efforts today because of
their efforts for the Denver Broncos parade even though there were long waits.
Director Sisk stated we performed in a spectacular way, stepping up and providing
services for our passengers.
Several members of the Board stated David Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO, made a great decision to provide free service on buses and light rails until
8:00 p.m. Interim General Manager Genova stated it was a combined effort and
kudos went out to the entire team. Today was an extreme special event situation.
Bruce Abel mentioned there were between 750-800K people lining the streets
today for the Bronco Parade and we were operating at maximum capacity.
Director Deadwyler extended Kudos to the RTD staff and stated the crowds were a
mess. She was disappointed we did not get mentioned by any of the local news
channels regarding RTD’s efforts.
Director Solano extended his Kudos out to all of RTD staff.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Bruce Abel noted that the Board was provided with an analysis of dropped
service by route. He explained that this information is also broken down by
operating division. He said from his experience this seems to be cyclical as
even though First Transit Commerce City is one of the divisions with the
highest lost service last month, back in April they were helping us to pick up
our dropped runs. He stated that this is analyzed as one complete system
(RTD and contractors) as everyone deploys resources as best we can to best
serve our customers.

Chair Tobiassen called for a review of the February 16, 2016 Board meeting agenda.

Motion:

Director Hoy made the motion to approve the February
16 Board agenda.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Francone expressed for the recommended
action on SB16-011, her objection has to do with the
language. The statute is clear this should be for
bridges and roads. Director Solano asked if any
amendments could be made to this and Dave
responded that the Senate could make amendments as
appropriate. However, this is not a RTD bill.

Bronco Day—Director Solano shared that he is receiving calls from constituents
concerned about RTD’s decision to make this a free ride day. Their concern is we
are using taxpayer’s monies to advance private enterprise. He thinks we should
have conversation with the City of Denver and the Broncos around reimbursement
for the cost of providing this free transportation. Interim General Manager Genova
shared that he had made his call after consultation with his team and a concern
around safety hazards that the people were creating around our buses and light rail
stations. His team is assessing the situation. The only similar situation he can
recall is an incident the last day of the Democratic National Convention. He has
asked Heather Copp, CFO, to see if she could ascertain any financial impact. Chair
Tobiassen concurred this was a public safety issue. The call was appropriately
made to allow people to move. This was a good drill for future emergency
situations that might call for public transit. Director Deadwyler added she agrees
with the decision but felt RTD was slighted in getting credit for what they had done
to move all these people effectively and safely. IGM Genova indicated he will be
having a meeting with Mayor Hancock soon and he will certainly mention the RTD
role.
IGM Genova shared that RTD will be testifying before the House Transportation
Committee February 24 on Access-a-Ride.
IGM Genova shared that DTP had given RTD a date for when they would hand the
B-Line to RTD. That date is Monday, July 25. We normally like to schedule our
opening events on a Friday so the team is discussing how to best work with this
date and the scheduled opening activities.
Director Deadwyler inquired about the A-line opening. IGM Genova indicated the
Save the Dates had been sent. The Committee members appeared surprised that
they had not received this information. Director Hoy shared that he had received
this info as a member of a community organization. Dave Genova indicated he
would follow up on these Save the Dates for Board members. Director Deadwyler
said that she had heard that DTP was left out of these celebrations. She thinks
that would be a shame as they have done great work. IGM Genova stated he does
not think this is true as they have been a sponsoring partner for a couple of events
already. He would check into this. IGM Genova reviewed some of the opening
dates and activities for these events.
IGM Genova shared that he and a few members of his staff had met with
Councilwoman Gilmore around her concerns for some type of global ECOpass
offering for the Montbello/DIA workers. One of the ideas they had discussed was a

Retiree Awards
Chair Tobiassen noted there were six retirees this month, three or whom were present.
He said that while we are always happy for our retirees, we do hate to see them go as
they have much institutional knowledge. He would like to congratulate them on their
years of service and a job well done.
Interim General Manager Genova indicated that there were two retirees from Bus
Operations and one from Rail Operations in attendance. He asked Bruce Abel, Assistant
General Manager of Bus Operations, to begin the recognitions.
Bruce Abel asked Steve Gieske, General Superintendent of Maintenance, to join him in
recognizing Lonnie Barlow, a General Repair Mechanic with 22 years of service. Bruce
Abel shared that Lonnie has been married for 40 years with six children. He said Lonnie
plans to get good use of his camper trailer visiting the Midwest.
Steve Gieske stated that Lonnie worked out of the Platte division as one of RTD’s
dedicated Mall mechanics. He said that by and far Lonnie was a leader who took care of
those vehicles as if they were his own. He does not believe RTD would have gotten the
same level of performance out of the Mall vehicles over the years if it had not been for
Lonnie’s dedication.
Lonnie Barlow said his 22 years have been good years and RTD has been good to him. He
is happy to hear that RTD thinks he has been good for the company as well.
Bruce Abel commented that in the old days he would ask Mike Gil, former Deputy AGM of
Bus Operations, to join him, and in the new days he would ask Gina Callahan, Acting
Deputy AGM of Bus Operations, to join him but neither were able to attend this evening.
He acknowledged Kerry Ross, a Bus Operator from the Platte division with 24 years of
service. He shared that Kerry has a new dog named Billy as well as two children and

several grandchildren. In retirement Kerry plans to do more fishing, skiing, hiking and
geological searching, travel to Europe, and learn to play the piano. Bruce Abel thanked
Kerry for his years of service to the District.
Kerry Ross thanked the Board and everyone at RTD. He said it has been a wonderful time.
He loves dealing with the public and made many friends. It was always a very satisfying
job. He wanted to especially thank everyone at RTD for the pension plan. He stated that
it makes everything more secure for him in retirement. He thinks it is a great plan and
benefit and he is sincerely grateful for the plan. Kerry Ross also believes the deferred
compensation plan that was started in the late nineties is a wonderful addition to the
pension plan.
Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, asked Greg Pennington,
General Superintendent of Rail Infrastructure, to join him in recognizing Darren Callahan, a
Track Maintainer with 30 years of service.
Greg Pennington shared that Darren worked on the bus side in the service and cleaning
area for about half of his career and moved over to light rail in 2000. He said that Darren
was very much someone you went to when you needed to get a job done. Greg
Pennington noted that Darren was one of the people involved with the development of
RTD’s track maintenance program. He stated that Darren would be missed.
Darren Callahan thanked the Board and RTD, and especially Terry Emmons and Greg
Pennington as they were great to work for.
Chair Tobiassen recognized Beth Cooke, Fare Inspector with 29 years of service, Leonard
Ford, Body Mechanic with 18 years of service, and Anthony Quintana, Bus Operator with
25 years of service, who were not able to attend the meeting. He thanked them for their
outstanding service to RTD.

V.

Public Participation
Chair Tobiassen indicated that the public participation section of the Board Meeting was
open to anyone who would like to address the Board. He reminded everyone that each
speaker would have three minutes.
 Susan Dolph, DRMAC, stated that overall she gives RTD an A+ for outstanding
service; however, she is concerned about the proposed changes to the 16th Street
Mall Shuttle. Oh behalf of those with mobility and other types of disabilities she is
asking the Board to give serious consideration to leaving the 16th Street Mall
Shuttle as is. She thinks it would be very problematic for people with disabilities to
need to go to 15th or 17th Streets to catch the shuttle. She also wondered what
RTD planned to do with the X, Y and Z stops if the Shuttle was moved.
 JM Fay from Arapahoe County had Nate Currey, Senior Manager of Public Relations
and Public Information, read her statement on her behalf as she is unable to speak.
JM Fay wanted the Board to know that there are a lot of problems with RTD but

Packet Pg. 62



due to the three minute time constraint she would just provide the highlights. She
outlined the following issues:
o Too many buses are not showing up, especially the Route 73 in her
community.
o Buses are late or deliberately do not wait for passengers to make
connections and transfers only last for three hours. This is a problem when
someone misses their connection.
o Route 73, 11, 38 and 76, among others, are set-up in a manner where one
bus is always 10 minutes after the others so passengers miss it.
o Her area can only access the light rail through Route 21, which only runs
once per hour on weekends, which is a problem.
o Fares were raised by 20% but only the 10-ride ticket books are discounted
at King Soopers; passengers should be able to use two discounted tickets to
purchase a day pass or be able to purchase discounted 5-ride day pass ticket
books since Smart Cards are not available to everyone.
o With elimination of Route 86X the buses are now overcrowded and
passengers have to cross over an icy overpass.
o The Trip Planner is not working and it is difficult to deal with Customer Care.
She expressed that the buck stops with the Board. The community does not want
to hear that RTD is short drivers due to screwy schedules which are causing drivers
to quit. People need to get to their destinations. She said this will come out as
many of the Board members are up for reelection and people are unhappy.
Sharon Quigley, Boulder, indicated that she was here this evening to represent the
countless FF4 commuters who were unable to attend. She said that she was going
to address the Board; however, she has learned from staff that there might be
proposed changes so she would just submit the riders’ comments and petition she
gathered.

Chair Tobiassen asked Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, to
explain the proposed FF4 changes as he through this might address many of the public’s
comments.
Bruce Abel explained that one of the major changes that took place with implementation
of the Flatiron Flyer was the way passengers at Broomfield and Westminster could access
Civic Center. Previously these passengers would ride the BF or 86X to Union Station and
then use the Metro Ride or 16th Street Mall Shuttle to get to Civic Center. He said staff
attempted to provide a single seat service from Broomfield and Westminster to Civic
Center through the FF4. He stated that the demand for this service has been
unexpectedly high. As a result, staff hopes to eliminate the Westminster stop along the
FF4, which would address the overcrowding that occurs and allow the buses to utilize the
infrastructure improvements along US 36. A short-turn service between Westminster and

Bill Silberstein, Boulder, shared that he has been riding RTD for 35 years. He is
here this evening to address the FF4 complaints. He appreciates the quick
response in making changes; however, it is not a complete solution for former HX
riders. Stopping in Broomfield still adds to the travel time. He said that to him Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT) means getting back and forth quicker. Even with staff’s
amended plan his trip is now a slower trip. He hopes RTD will continue to be open
to changes to this service.
Nick Clabbers, Boulder, has been riding RTD for 4 years. He said he recently
graduated from law school and accepted a full time position near Civic Center. Part
of his reason for deciding to remain living in Boulder was because of his public
transportation options. He said the change from Route HX to the FF4 was pretty
disappointing. He appreciates the efforts to improve the issues. He is in agreement
that continuing to stop in Broomfield is not a full solution but he is willing to give
the service another shot. He thinks this will be much less intrusive than also
having to stop in Westminster.
John Desmond, Executive Vice President of the Downtown Denver Partnership,
noted that the Board had received a letter of support of the 16th Street Mall Shuttle
service changes to accommodate the Meet in the Street events. He said he wanted
to stress what a positive relationship the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP) has
had with RTD and the City and County of Denver (City). He stated that it is so
important that the overall Downtown Denver experience is positive for everyone.
The DDP believes the Meet in the Street events as proposed will help enhance
people’s experiences as they come Downtown. He indicated that DDP plans to
continue to work with RTD and the City to make sure the Meet in the Street events
are a win-win for everyone involved.
Dawnalyn Edgar, Denver, said she was here to protest the practice of dropping a
bus route if RTD does not have a driver for that route. She considers RTD’s
schedule to be a contract with the riders. She shared that two days in a row she
had a bus that did not show up which is inexcusable. She stated that she did not
know what needed to be done but it was unprofessional for RTD to drop service.
Brad Buchanan, Executive Director for Community Planning and Development for
the City and County of Denver, pointed out that the 16th Street Mall Shuttle
proposal for the Meet in the Street events has been in discussion for over a year.
He noted that there were questions about why the City and DDP were asking for
having the Mall Shuttle moved for more days than last summer. He explained that
last summer helped the City work with its consultant to define the questions for
and goals of the events in the upcoming summer. He noted that there was also a

Packet Pg. 64

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 19, 2016 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of January 19, 2016)

Civic Center would also be added during peak periods. He stated that staff is attempting
to find resources and vehicles in the near-term but it would definitely occur by April with
the approval of those service changes.

concern from RTD about funding. He shared that the City and DDP have been
working with RTD to determine the cost for RTD to create equivalent service on
15th and 17th Streets, which will be $27K. The City and DDP have agreed to pay
for that service. He said at the end of the events they plan to debrief the
experience and analyze the data. He asked the Board for their support of the Meet
in the Street events.
Doug Gragg, Denver, said conceptually he has no problem with the idea of trying to
get people Downtown by the City and DDP. He thinks Downtown could use some
excitement. He shared that his problem is a personal one as moving the Mall
Shuttle means he has to walk an additional two blocks. He feels this will be an
issue for other people as well. He expressed that the Meet in the Street concept is
good but the mechanics have not yet been worked out very well.
Yolanda Begay, Denver, reminded the Board that she spoke at a Board Meeting
several months ago. She recognized that many of the Directors were upset and felt
threatened by what she and others had to say about poverty but she feels many of
the Directors do not understand. She stated that many RTD riders work minimum
wage jobs. The community has been asking for a date when RTD will implement
an affordable fare but they have not been given one. She is very disappointed with
many of the Directors and is starting to get fed up with RTD. She said she is
getting sick of having to come to the Board Meetings every month to try and
reason with the Directors to understand where she is coming from. She extended
an invitation for the Board to attend an upcoming 9 to 5 event.
Candace Johnson said she works for an organization called Jobs with Justice,
which is a coalition of labor, community, faith and youth organizations that come
together to advance workers’ rights and social justice. She noted that for a while
her organization has been hearing from its members that RTD’s fare increase is
beyond what they can pay. She stated that as a responsible advocate she was
going to continue to urge the Board to consider an income based pass. She
expressed that as elected officials, many in the community look to the Board to
make transit a public good. As it currently stands she feels RTD falls short of being
a public good. RTD falls short of ensuring people have access to affordable
transportation. She noted that many organizations have vowed to work with RTD
but she feels that every time they address the Board, their comments are rebuffed
and pushed to the side. She stated that the transit reliant are RTD’s most reliable
customers and they deserve to have the Board’s support. The decisions of the RTD
Board have a major impact on people’s lives.
Daniela Villarreal said she is a community organizer with the Colorado People’s
Alliance, one of the members of the Affordable Fares Task Force. She urged the
Board to support the community by approving an income based pass. She asked
the Board to make this a priority and allocate money within the budget. She feels
there are several items that the Board will be voting on this evening where the

Packet Pg. 65



funds could instead be used for an income based pass that would impact a
significant number of riders. She applauded RTD for the improvement of the NonProfit Program but indicated that resources are still limited. She asked the Board to
give their commitment by putting a timeline in place for when an income based
pass could be implemented.
Dre Chiriboga-Flor, 9 to 5, was at the meeting to share the experiences of a
member who was unable to attend. This member does not have a car and is
completely depending on RTD. If she buys a day pass for $5.20 it will end up
costing her over $100 by the end of the month. This member feels frustrated that
she is paying $5.20 for a day pass when the buses do not run all day. Dre shared
that recently this member wanted to attend church but realized she did not have
enough money for bus fare for her and her daughter.
Dre Chriboga-Flor acknowledged that the Board has an upcoming retreat. She
hopes an income based pass is something that is discussed. She shared she
recently attended an Operations and Customer Service Committee Meeting and was
disappointed that affordable fares were not brought up once. She asked the Board
to put their heads together and give the community a timeline.

Chair Tobiassen thanked the public participants for their remarks.

Director Walker noted that, similar to some of the speakers, he too knows how it
feels when your bus does not show up. He indicated that this happened to him
recently and he had to wait half an hour for the next bus. He said that when the
next bus did arrive there were problems with the fare collection system. He
wondered how widespread these types of problems were and the prognosis for
fixing them. Interim General Manager Genova stated that there was an issue with
some of the pass validators that affected around 200 buses. He believes this issue
has been addressed. There was also an issue with some of the day pass printers
and the paper jamming. He said that staff had a solution to the issue and were
working to implement it.
Interim General Manager Genova stated that as it relates to dropped routes, staff
will begin presenting information on this to the Board monthly along with
information on the hiring of operators and maintainers. He said there is no excuse
for a dropped route but unfortunately it is a labor issue. He expressed that staff is
working very hard to increase hiring.
Director Folska inquired when additional automated announcement information
related to transfers would be available on the buses and trains. Bruce Abel
explained that the capability is available but it is still in the development process.
He stated that staff is working to determine the standard for the exact information
that is announced. Director Folska indicated she would like to talk about this more
offline.
Director Folska feels that with regards to hiring there needs to be better
communication and the process needs to be more streamlined. Interim General
Manager Genova shared that in addition to applying online or via paper applications,
RTD is also offering a “one-stop-shop” where people can come in to fill out the
application, go through the interview and do the prescreening tests in one location.
He said this allows staff to hire on the spot. He noted that these have been
happening at Blake Street and District Shops but staff was hoping to expand them
as well. Director Folska asked that the Board be emailed the dates of those events.
Director Lubow reiterated that the no show buses are a problem, but the idea of
people not being notified is an even bigger issue. She hopes staff will really look at
this as it is a time sensitive issue. Interim General Manager Genova indicated that
staff is having conversations about the best mechanisms to get this information out
to the customers. Director Lubow wondered if this was something he thought
could be addressed in several weeks. Interim General Manager Genova said he was
not sure there would be any advancements on this issue within a few weeks.
Director Lubow noted that there is a requirement for bus operators to have had a
driver’s license for two years. She wondered if this length of time was really
necessary. She shared that she works with the refugee community where there is
interest in becoming bus drivers but they have not had a license for that long.

Interim General Manager Genova said he would look into the requirement but
typically RTD follows the federal regulations.
Director Solano said he sees a severe problem when our riders are waiting in the
cold and there is no avenue for them to find out if their bus has been dropped. He
thinks this is outlandish. He thanked Director Lubow for her comments about a
way to notify passengers.
Director Archuleta asked how much drivers are paid when they start as this could
be part of the problem. Interim General Manager Genova stated that drivers start at
$15.67 per hour but he believes wages will be looked at during the next contract
negotiations with the Union.

Chair Tobiassen reminded the Directors that there is always the option to move items from
the unanimous consent agenda. He asked for a motion to approve items A through D.

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend the Transdev On

Prior to asking for a motion to approve the April 2016 Service Changes, Chair Tobiassen
asked if there was unanimous consent for the division of the recommended April 2016
Service Changes as currently constituted to remove the staff recommendation regarding
the 16th Street Mall Shuttle service detours for the Meet in the Street events, and to treat
this particular recommendation as a separate, free-standing recommendation from staff to
be acted on independently by the Board. In asking for a show of hands there was not
unanimous consent to divide the two items. Chair Tobiassen asked if someone would
make a motion for this division.

recommendation as a separate, free-standing
recommendation from staff to be acted on
independently by the Board.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Director Bagley made the motion to approve the
amended April 2016 Service Changes with the removal
of the 16th Street Mall Shuttle detours.
Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Primary Motion
to Amend:

Director Sisk made the motion to amend the April 2016
Service Changes to address issues relating to the newly
introduced Flatiron Flyer service as follows:

“Under this amendment, the Flatiron Flyer 4 would be removed from US 36
& Sheridan Station (Westminster), relieving the passenger demand issues
currently experienced during the busiest times in the peak period. This
change will also allow the FF4 service to utilize the HOV lane for a longer
period of time, with entry and exit of the HOV at US 36 & Broomfield
Station rather than US 36 & Sheridan Station.
This proposal also creates a new service, proposed to operate between US
36 & Sheridan Station and Civic Center Station. Temporarily designated the
Flatiron Flyer 86, this new pattern would begin in the morning peak at US
36 & Sheridan Station in Westminster, as did the former Route 86X. The
FF86 is proposed to provide four peak period trips, both morning and
evening, utilizing articulated coaches and operating between US 36 &
Sheridan Station and Civic Center Station.
The estimated cost of this proposal is projected to be approximately
$215,000 annualized.”
Director Folska seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Chair Tobiassen pointed out that this is the amendment
outlined by Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations, during public participation.
Director Hoy stated that he wants to assure that his
constituents are not standing at the Westminster
station watching the FF4 go by and not having enough
service themselves. He asked Service Planning and
Scheduling to monitor the FF86 closely. Bruce Abel

Director Lubow asked for confirmation that the new
service from US 36 & Sheridan would be both in the
morning and evening peak periods. Bruce Abel stated
that was correct. Director Lubow expressed that these
changes sound wonderful. She urged staff to continue
to monitor the FF4 and FF86 as well. She hopes staff
will be willing to make additional changes if it is
determined they are needed.
Director Francone asked for clarification as to what
Bruce Abel meant earlier by short-term service to US
36 & Sheridan Station. Bruce Abel apologized for the
confusion. He explained that it is actually a short-turn
route that only operates between the US 36 & Sheridan
Station and Civic Center Station.
Director Sisk thanked staff for being nimble in terms of
responding to our constituents. He said that as we
continue to open new lines we will need to monitor the
new service and make modifications accordingly. He
appreciates everyone who provided their input
throughout this process.

Primary Motion

Secondary
Amendment:

Director Sisk made the motion to amend the primary
amendment to the April 2016 Service Changes to
remove the proposal to increase service on Route 324
due to the deferral of the anticipated grant funding from
DRCOG.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Lubow commented that the increase in service
for Route 324 would really benefit the people in the
city of Longmont. She said they are looking forward to
the change but understand it cannot happen until RTD
gets the funding from DRCOG. She urged staff to be
vigilant and that staff be ready to move when DRCOG
is ready with funding.
Chair Tobiassen noted that DRCOG is still planning on
funding the increase in service but unfortunately the
timing was not right.

days on five (5) consecutive weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) starting Saturday, June
25, and running through Sunday, July 23, contingent on the City and County of Denver
(City) contributing $27,000 to help defray the cost of maintaining existing 16th Street Mall
Shuttle frequency on half (5) of those days.

Director James made the motion to approve the detour
of the 16th Street Mall Shuttle as recommended by

Discussion:

Director Francone thought that Mr. Buchanan from the
City and County of Denver said that the City was
willing to pick up the full cost of maintaining the 16th
Street Mall Shuttle frequency; however, the
recommendation read by Chair Tobiassen indicated the
City would only cover the cost for half of the days.
Bruce Abel explained that staff is hoping to learn if it is
really necessary to maintain the frequencies. As a test,
the service frequency will be maintained for only half of
the days, which the City will cover the full cost of.
Interim General Manager Genova noted that the City
and Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP) would be
paying the $27,000. Director Francone thanked the
City and DDP for recognizing RTD’s expense and
working with staff on this matter.
Director Lubow pointed out that there was another
issue around the estimate that RTD might lose up to
$150K in FTA funding if ridership was reduced. She
noted that this is a very fluid figure that RTD will not
know until after we have moved the 16th Street Mall
Shuttle to 15th and 17th Streets. She inquired if staff
had discussed getting that money from the City. Bruce
Abel stated that ridership is one of the factors that is
used in the formula for FTA funding. He said that
staff’s hope and expectation is that ridership loses will
be offset by promoting the rest of the system for
people to use to come and participate in the Meet in
the Street events. He noted that there have been
conversations with the City and DDP but there is no
concrete resolution to those conversations. It is the
collective desire of all parties to increase ridership
systemically.
Director Lubow wondered what would happen if RTD
did lose FTA funding. Bruce Abel stated that was a
possibility. He explained that the maximum loss to RTD
as calculated by the Planning Department was between
$115-$150K if there were no ridership gains elsewhere

in the system. Interim General Manager Genova
indicated that staff wanted to make sure the Board was
aware that the potential to lose funding exists;
however, he noted that there are several things
different than the previous year, such as a different
configuration and Meet in the Street events happening
the same time as other events downtown, so staff
believes these losses will be minimized.
Director Lubow reiterated that there is still the issue of
RTD losing money and asking the City to help. Interim
General Manager Genova stated that it was a
concerned that was shared with the City.
Director Deadwyler expressed that she had similar
concerns as those of Director Lubow.
Director Bagley believes this is a work in progress. He
thinks that the Directors need to accept the fact that
there is the potential for some FTA funding loss, but
this will not be the last time the City and DDP are going
to have a request for the Meet in the Street events. He
said if there is a loss this year then that will provide a
basis for an ask in future years. He feels that staff is
working with our partners to not just address this but
things like safety, urban camping, etc.
Director Folska pointed out that for over the last year
she has heard people come to the Board and ask for an
income based fare for people that cannot afford to use
the system. She said that during that time the Board
has approved spending money here and there. Many
votes are for a smallish amount of money but it adds
up. Her concern is that the Board just keeps spending
money without addressing the most important problem
of keeping fares affordable. Director Folska said that
she would support the recommendation but wants to
see our partners compensate us for any funding
shortfall. She stated if that does not happen she will
not be in support of any further studies.

Director Walker wondered if there was any data on the
impacts of other events like the Colfax Marathon where
our service is diverted for some period of time. He
stated that he does not see any harm in diverting the
16th Street Mall Shuttle for these five weekends as we
need to have real world evidence on the impact of
these types of detours. He noted that if the Meet in
the Street events are successful it will not be in the
City’s benefit to short RTD. He believes they will find a
way to make RTD whole. He thinks the Board owes it
to the District to try new things. It is a small cost for
this experiment that could have large benefits for the
entire District.
Director James agrees with Director Walker’s
characterization of this as an experiment. He
appreciates the opportunity to partner with the City and
DDP. He pointed out that in comparison to some of our
other service changes this is a small dollar amount. He
believes this is a worthwhile experiment. Director
James shared that in his day job he has found that
activities like the Meet in the Street events can help in
eliminating some of the less desirable activities on the
Mall.
Bruce Abel stated that the sentiments expressed by
Directors Walker and James are very reflective of
staff’s sentiments. He said the recommendation of 5
weekends allows RTD, the City and DDP to collectively
look at our mutual objectives while evaluating any
issues. He shared that there will also be events before
and after Meet in the Streets to evaluate what happens
when the Mall Shuttles are running on the Mall.
Director Sisk thinks this is an opportunity to partner
with the City and DDP. He sees this as being a positive
experience while recognizing that there are risks. He
believes this is a way to continue our relationship
building, which is what makes this region so strong.
Director Hoy appreciates the City and DDP’s spirit of

Packet Pg. 79

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 19, 2016 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of January 19, 2016)

8.A

cooperation in contributing $27K to RTD. He feels this
shows that they are invested in this partnership. He
believes the outcome of this year will help to determine
how this is approached next year. He thinks at this
point it is best to see what happens this year and
adjust in the future if needed.
Director Bagley asked for a summary of the total
economic impact of this action, in addition to the April
2016 Service Changes, as there were so many
amendments. He thinks that trying to have a nexus
between this action and something like a low income
pass just is not correct as these are different items.
Director Francone encouraged the City and DDP to
consider what they have heard from several Directors
about their concern of losing federal money. She said
she was excited to experiment with them to bring more
vitality to the Mall. She hopes that the City and DDP
would consider an active marketing campaign
throughout the entire District to encourage people to
attend and use RTD.
Chair Tobiassen thanked everyone for the lively and
spirited conversation. He said he looks forward to
working with the City and DDP. He appreciates the
partnership that RTD has had with them over the years.
It is fun to come Downtown on RTD to enjoy these
types of events.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

WHEREAS, House Bill 16-1008 was drafted and submitted to the General Assembly by the
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), in partnership with RTD, and the State
Highway Patrol. This bill will change language in the CDOT enabling legislation, as CDOT has
direct control over the ability of vehicles to operate on the shoulders of state roadways. The
bill was heard on January 27, 2016, in the House Transportation Committee and passed by a
vote of 11-2.
WHEREAS, The provisions of House Bill 16-1008 will give RTD bus operators the option of
driving on the shoulders of US 36 only under certain conditions. Bus travel on the shoulders
can be done only when traffic in the general purpose lanes is travelling 35 miles per hour or
less, and it is up to the bus operator to determine if these conditions exist and if it is safe to
drive on the shoulder. The bus can then travel on the shoulder at a speed only 15 miles per
hour above the speed of the traffic in the general purpose lanes.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that RTD Board of Directors adopts a position in support of
House Bill 16-1008 that will permit the Bus On Shoulder operations along US 36 for the voterapproved Bus Rapid Transit service, which is a part of the Board-approved Flatiron Flyer service
package.
Passed and adopted by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District on this
16th day of February 2016.

RTD Citizens Advisory Committee

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors change the
name of the RTD FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee to the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee and
revise the structure accordingly.
BACKGROUND
On April 22, 2004, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 5, Series of 2004, directing, in
part, staff to create a FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC). On Dec.13, 2005, the RTD Board
of Directors approved the structure of the CAC including its mission and function, the duties and roles of
its members, the selection process for members, and organizational and meeting procedures for the
committee. On Dec. 16, 2008, the RTD Board of Directors increased the number of members of the
CAC from eleven to seventeen.
Since its creation in 2005, the mission of the CAC has been to review the progress of the FasTracks
Program in relation to established schedules, budget allocations, DBE goals and quality management
guidelines; to provide region-oriented advice to the Board of Directors on issues related to the
implementation of the FasTracks program; to review and provide comment on the DRCOG SB208
Annual Report; and to promote public awareness and understanding of the voter-approved FasTracks
program and its implementation.
As the District completes more elements of the FasTracks Program, opens five new projects in 2016,
and works to integrate new rail service into existing operations, the issues that input from the CAC
would be relevant and meaningful to the District are increasingly agency-wide.
Therefore, based on the CAC’s individual meetings with board members conducted earlier this year,
input from staff and extensive discussion by the committee, the members of the FasTracks Citizens
Advisory Committee recommend the Board revise the structure for the Citizens Advisory Committee as
follows:
Regional Transportation District
Citizens Advisory Committee
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) is made up of residents
and business persons from around the region. Members are appointed by RTD Board of Directors and
volunteer their time to advise the District on a range of issues that affect citizens and impact the region.
Committee Role
The role of the Citizens Advisory Committee shall be to:

Committee that the RTD Board of Directors change the name of the RTD FasTracks Citizens
Advisory Committee to the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee and revise the structure
accordingly.

Subject:

RTD Director District Precinct Assignment

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: February 16, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
revised Director District boundary between Director District F and Director District G so that all of
Arapahoe County Precinct Number 356 falls within Director District G, where a majority of the precinct
already lies. This alternative would affect the fewest number of households.
BACKGROUND
On February 21, 2012, in accordance with CRS 32-9-111(1)(a), the Board approved a revised Director
District map to reflect changes in the District’s population as reflected in the 2010 Census. The
redistricting process required that, among other things, the individual Director Districts would be
comprised of whole general election precincts, as established by the boards of county commissioners of
those counties wholly or partially within the district and by the election commission of the City and
County of Denver and the City and County of Broomfield.
From time to time, the individual counties adjust precinct boundaries. Typically, the adjusted precincts
remain completely within individual Director Districts; however, Arapahoe County has adjusted its
precincts so that Precinct Number 356, all of which was previously in Director District G (Director
Lasater), now falls across the boundary of District G into District F (Director Tobiassen). See attached
map. A vast majority of the precinct remains in District G. The precinct in question lies slightly west of
South Powhatan Street, north of County Line Road. In order to change the Director District boundaries,
the Board must take action.
DISCUSSION
CRS 32-9-111(1)(a) states the following: “No general election precinct may be split into two or more
director districts.” Arapahoe County’s new precinct map places Precinct Number 356 over the boundary
of District F (Director Tobiassen) and District G (Director Lasater). In order to conform to statute, the
Board must adjust the Director District boundaries so that the new precinct lies exclusively in one
Director District. If the Director District boundaries were adjusted to follow the new precinct line, District
G would become marginally larger; conversely, Director District F would become marginally smaller. If
all of Precinct Number 356 is placed in Director District G, it appears that the adjustment would impact
only one household, which would become part of Director District G from District F. An alternative
option would be to expand Director District F to encompass the entirety of Precinct Number 356, which
would then expand that Director District to now include approximately 100 additional households that
were previously part of Director District G.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial associated with this action.

ALTERNATIVES
1.

Accept the Recommended Action by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the revised Director District boundary between Director District F and Director
District G so that all of Arapahoe County Precinct Number 356 falls within Director District G,
where a majority of the precinct already lies. This alternative would affect the fewest number of
households.

2.

Do not accept the Recommended Action by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors and do not approve the revised Director District boundary between Director
District F and Director District G so that all of Arapahoe County Precinct Number 356 falls within
Director District G, where a majority of the precinct already lies. Instead, the Board could expand
Director District F to encompass the entirety of Precinct Number 356, which would expand that
Director District to now include approximately 100 additional households.

RTD Boundary Certification
District Designation

Assistant

Board Meeting Date: February 16, 2016
and

Director

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
revised boundary map of the District and authorize the Board Secretary to certify the boundary map and
description. It is further recommended that the areas newly annexed to RTD pursuant to the provisions
of CRS 32-9-106 be designated as follows:
a. The two Erie annexations – the Spallone No. 5 Annexation and the Andalusia Annexation
– are recommended to be included in Director District I (Director Lubow); and
b. The Parker annexation – Todd Drive – is recommended to be included in Director District G
(Director Lasater).

BACKGROUND
In 1994, the Colorado legislature approved a bill to allow the annexation of land into RTD concurrent
with annexation into a municipality if any part or all of that municipality was in the District boundaries.
As new areas enter the district via municipal annexation, the newly annexed areas must be assigned to a
specific Director District. The Board must approve the designation of those areas to be in specific
Director Districts.
DISCUSSION
In December 2015, RTD found that three annexations had occurred whereby the District Boundary
would expand as follows: two annexations were made by the Town of Erie; the third was made by the
Town of Parker. Since these newly annexed areas have not been assigned to specific director districts,
Board action will be required. The two Erie annexations – the Spallone No. 5 Annexation and the
Andalusia Annexation – are directly adjacent to Director District I (Director Lubow). The Parker
annexation – Todd Drive – is directly adjacent to District G (Director Lasater). Since each of the three
annexations directly connects to only one Director District, it appears appropriate that those areas are
assigned to the connecting Director District. The attached maps depict the annexed areas and the
adjacent director districts to which staff recommends they be assigned.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact is anticipated with the requested action.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

WHEREAS, Senate Bill 16-011 eliminates annual transfers of $15.0 million for transit projects
from fee revenue imposed under the Funding Advancements for Surface Transportation and
Economic Recovery Act of 2009 (FASTER). This includes a $10.0 million transfer to the
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) for transit related projects and $5.0
million for local transit projects.

WHEREAS, Senate Bill 16-011 is currently making its way through the Colorado General
Assembly. This bill would have a negative effect on RTD. RTD receives a minimum $3 million
allocation annually and then can compete in the approximately $2 million statewide
competitive pool. If RTD did not receive these additional funds each year, various projects
could not be completed. Projects that are currently in the pipeline for future allocations would
have to be delayed, or funds would need to be diverted from other capital projects to complete
the necessary work.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the RTD Board of Directors takes a position in
opposition to Senate Bill 16-011.

Passed and adopted by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District on this
16th day of February 2016.

Access-a-Ride Eligibility Assessments

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Easter Seals
Colorado for the provision of ADA paratransit eligibility functional assessments. Performance under
the contract is for a five year period and shall not exceed $2,490,070.
BACKGROUND
RTD requires all potential applicants for Access-a-Ride services to participate in an in-person
functional assessment.
Formal functional assessments allow RTD to base an individual’s
determination/certification for eligibility for ADA paratransit services on the three categories of
eligibility under the ADA; the functional inability to get to or from the bus stop or light rail platform;
the ability to board and alight the bus or light rail car; or the ability/inability to understand how to
travel on fixed-route bus or light rail due to cognitive limitations.
Since its inception in 1992, the Access-a-Ride program has certified nearly 100,000 users. Of those
certified, approximately 15,000 individuals have used the service in the past year. RTD is currently
providing, on average, 2,800 Access-a-Ride trips per weekday.
The total number of assessments, which include re-certifications and new applications, for the last
five (5) years are as follows:
2015
2014
2013
2012
2011

-

4296
4547
4054
4357
3897

RTD currently contracts with Easter Seals Colorado to provide the functional assessments for
Access-a-Ride eligibility. The contract with Easter Seals Colorado will expire on March 31, 2016.
On November 6, 2015, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price
proposals to provide eligibility assessments. The RFP was downloaded from the RTD website by the
following firms:
MTM, Inc.
IPS Lynx

Easter Seals, Colorado
Innovative Paradigms

First Transit

Two of the firms submitted follow up questions which were responded to by November 27th. The
proposals were due on December 18, 2015.

Packet Pg. 106

13.F

DISCUSSION
One proposal was received in response to the RFP for eligibility evaluations. The Proposer was the
incumbent eligibility contractor, Easter Seals Colorado.
An evaluation committee was formed to evaluate the proposal based on the following evaluative
criteria: understanding of the RTD’s requirements and objectives (35%), experience (35%), and cost
(30%). The evaluation team consisted of Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager of Contracted Services,
Larry Buter, Manager of Paratransit Services and Carol Coe, Paratransit Services Coordinator. Each
member of the evaluation team individually reviewed the technical proposals submitted and assigned
a score for “Understanding of RTD’s requirements” and for “Experience.” Based on the average of
the individual scores received in these categories, Easter Seals of Colorado was deemed technically
qualified for an award. The score for the “Cost” element was calculated by RTD procurement staff
and was then added to the technical score of the proposal to determine the overall total score or
rating.
Easter Seals Colorado’s experience with providing eligibility evaluations for RTD and the experience
of their staff were key elements of their proposal. Proposed pricing was based on an estimated
amount of assessments provided by RTD in the RFP. These estimates were based on historical data.
The first year numbers are as follows:
Re-certifications
In person assessment
Indoor assessment
Outdoor assessment

1243
103
2334
948

The negotiated first year rates proposed by Easter Seals for the rebid of eligibility assessments are as
follows:
Re-certifications
In person assessment
Indoor assessment
Outdoor assessment

$17.42
$84.64
$102.78
$151.16

The five-year contract price is $2,490,070. It was the consensus of the evaluation team that Easter
Seals, Colorado presented a proposal which successfully addressed their understanding of the
project, proposed management team, and approach to delivering the requested service. A variety of
factors influenced their costs to come in slightly higher than the current contract plus inflation.
These factors included, increased administrative functions, an increase in time to complete the
assessment process per applicant, as well as an increase of costs for goods and services such as
language interpreters.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for 2016 are currently available and budgeted. Due to the higher proposed costs, it may be
necessary to request additional funds for 2016. If additional funds are required, staff will make that
request through the amended budget process. Subsequent years are subject to Board budget
approvals.
