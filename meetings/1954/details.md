#### 1. Eagle P3 Project Update

Brian Middleton, Consultant for FasTracks Project Management, recognized Aaron Epstein as the new Denver Transit Partners (DTP) project director for the Eagle Project.  He said that Greg Amparano, the former project director, will still be involved in the project as Fluor’s representative on the DTP Board of Directors.

Brian Middleton presented the Eagle P3 Project Update included in the FasTracks Monitoring Committee packet for September 2, 2014.  The updates presented included design and system status, commuter rail vehicles, commuter rail maintenance facility, East Rail Line, Gold Line/Northwest Rail, bridges and coordination with adjacent projects.

Brian Middleton noted that an Eagle P3 team review identified a problem on the Jersey Cutoff bridge, just south of I-70 on the Northwest/Gold Line track alignment.  He said that DTP found deficiencies with the bridge design.  DTP determined that it is in the best interest of the project to demolish and rebuild the bridge.  RTD staff agreed with the decision.  He stated that at no time there was any danger to the public.  He also said that neither RTD nor the region’s taxpayers will incur any cost for this work as DTP is taking full responsibility for both the cost and the work.

Committee Chair Hoy reminded the Directors to keep the questions and comments on topic.  He also asked them to wait until all Directors have had a chance to speak before asking to speak for a second time.

Director Anderson said she was very interested in the lessons learned from the Jersey Cutoff bridge.  She noted that she understood that incidents happen but that this one seemed to be of a greater magnitude.  Director Anderson wondered if the fault in the construction had anything to do with construction through the wetlands.  Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, replied that his team will work with DTP on what happened and how to move forward.  Brian Middleton added that the wetlands had no impact on the deficiencies.

Director Anderson said that she appreciated the staff’s work with the City of Arvada.  She noted that the parking garage has gone through several reiterations.  She stated that the parking garage is an important component for the City of Arvada’s Transit Oriented Development.

Director Rivera-Malpiede asked if the rebuilding of the Jersey Cutoff bridge would have any impact on the 2016 openings.  Brian Middleton answered the demolition and rebuilding will not have any impact on revenue service.  Committee Chair Hoy added that DTP is as motivated as RTD to complete the project.

Director Bagley noted that there have been problems with bridges in the past.  He said that RTD has a thirty (30) plus years design, finance, build, operate, and maintain agreement with DTP.  He asked what the design life of the projects’ bridges is.  Brian Middleton answered that it is in excess of sixty (60) years.  Rick Clarke added that the length of time is specified in the contract.

Director Menten asked for clarification on the structure of the Jersey Cutoff bridge.  Brian Middleton replied that the bridge is only for RTD commuter rail use.  Rick Clarke added that the bridge goes over BNSF tracks called Jersey Cutoff.

Director Menten asked for more details on other problems encountered during bridge constructions as she was not familiar with other cases.  Brian Middleton answered that about eighteen (18) months ago the Sand Creek Bridge on the East Rail Line and another bridge, which he did not recall the name, needed to be restored.  DTP took full responsibility for the redesign, reconstruction, and replacement.

Committee Chair Hoy pointed out that the check and balances process of the Private Public Partnership (P3) works.

Chair Sisk asked for details on how RTD was made aware about the deficiencies of the Jersey Cutoff bridge.  He also asked for the estimated replacement cost.  Brian Middleton replied that RTD was made aware while going through the P3 process.  As areas of concern were identified they were brought up to DTP.  Upon DTP review, they agreed to demolish and start again.  Brian Middleton hesitated in stating a replacement cost.  He said that the cost to RTD is zero (0) dollars.  Rick Clarke added that under a P3 the private entity assumes full risk.  He added that RTD would not have done this well under any other design delivery method.

Director Lubow asked if these types of design problems are common or if this should be interpreted as a red flag.  Brian Middleton said that the design process is intricate.  Checks and balances are in place to ensure the quality of the process.  He noted that this is not the worst situation he has seen on a project.  He gave credit to DTP for accepting full responsibility and fixing the problem.  Rick Clarke added that the findings triggered an independent review of all the bridges in the project.  No other problems have been identified.

Director Daly said he appreciated DTP’s honesty and responsibility.  He asked if there was a problem with the subcontractor.  Brian Middleton answered that he was not sure but he did not think so.

Director James said that the Jersey Cutoff bridge incident is both a problem and an opportunity.  From RTD’s perspective the problem is minimal as the agency benefits from the P3 structure.  The opportunity is showing the public that a P3 is effective.  He suggested the staff looked into how to make the most of P3s in future projects.  Rick Clarke added that his team will assess the lessons learned from the project, both positive and negative.

Director Rivera-Malpiede noted that the Jersey Cutoff bridge was in District C which she represents.  She asked if there was a plan of action for public outreach.  Brian Middleton replied that DTP is working to develop public outreach.

Director Folska noted that one of the reasons RTD has a P3 is the hard work of the staff.  She asked for a description of the bridge and what makes it unique since there are so many bridges in the nation.  She pointed out a bridge in Washington, D.C. that is 5 miles long.  Brian Middleton said that the bridge design is unique for the project, not the nation.  The original design for the 500 feet bridge had a supported deck.  The new design will be more traditional.

Committee Chair Hoy reiterated that this P3 is working properly.  RTD chose their partners carefully.  DTP stepped up and owned the responsibility.  He said that he could not ask more from contractors.
