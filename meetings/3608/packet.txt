BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Front Range Passenger Rail District Annual Report

February 27, 2024

PRESENTER
Andy Karsian, General Manager, Front Range Passenger Rail District
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Front Range Passenger Rail (FRPR) District was created by Senate Bill 21-238 (SB238) for the
purpose of planning, designing, developing, financing, constructing, operating, and maintaining an
interconnected passenger rail system along Colorado’s front range. The FRPR District is the successor
organization to the Southwest Chief and Front Range Passenger Rail Commission established in 2017.
The FRPR District Board of Directors is comprised of 25 members representing a wide-cross section of
interests. RTD’s GM/CEO serves as the agency’s nonvoting representative on the FRPR District Board.
SB238 directed the FRPR District to work collaboratively with RTD to ensure interconnectivity with any
passenger rail system operated by or for RTD and with Amtrak on interconnectivity with Amtrak’s
Southwest Chief, California Zephyr, and Winter Park Express trains. The bill further stated that, if
deemed appropriate by the RTD Board of Directors, the FRPR District may share with RTD capital costs
associated with shared use of rail line infrastructure in the Northwest Rail line corridor for passenger
train service.
DISCUSSION
FRPR District General Manager Andy Karsian will present an update to the RTD Board of Directors
regarding historical efforts to develop FRPR as well as current FRPR District initiatives and strategies.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this presentation.

LETTER FROM
THE GENERAL
MANAGER
Front Range Passenger Rail (FRPR)
wouldn’t be where it is today without the
efforts of so many Coloradans working
together to bring passenger rail to our
great state.
I invite you to browse this annual report to learn how
the FRPR District is advancing a future of reliable and
efficient travel along the Front Range.
Accomplishments from this past year include:
• Establishing the administrative structure and
processes for the largest special district in Colorado.
• Entering the federal Corridor Identification and
Development Program, which unlocks once-in-a-

Andy Karsian

General Manager

lifetime sources of funding and technical support
to implement new passenger rail corridors.
• Securing $2 million from the state for additional
FRPR District capacity building and outreach.
• Continuing our Service Development Plan to define
the where, when, and how for our future rail service.
• Meeting with stakeholders and policy leaders
across the state.
As we look ahead to 2024, the FRPR District is excited to
broaden our outreach and engage in deeper coalitionbuilding. It will take all of us to start a new passenger rail
service, and we’ll continue to rely on your support.

Corridor Identification
and Development Program
In December, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) selected the FRPR
District to be part of its Corridor Identification and Development Program (CIDP).
This acceptance signals that FRPR is a priority corridor for federal investment.
CIDP is a three-step program
specifically designed to create a
pipeline of passenger rail projects ready
for implementation. By being selected,
the FRPR District receives an initial half
of a million dollars for start-up support

and is now in a preferential position
to secure additional dollars through
discretionary grants with minimal local
match requirements of only 10-20%.
Colorado enters CIDP ahead of
the curve – many other states are
at the starting line when it comes
to developing new passenger rail
corridors while Colorado began
working with the FRA and developing
its Service Development Plan (SDP) in
2020. The SDP is the second step in the
CIDP. With strong state support, the
unprecedented funding opportunities
established through the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law make this a once-ina-lifetime opportunity to build, operate
and maintain passenger rail along
Colorado’s Front Range.

Working Together:

The FRPR District and Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) are
working together on a Service Development Plan (SDP) for the FRA. An
SDP is a process that defines the where, when, and how for our future rail
service. This data-driven plan is key to secure new federal funding.

$2 Million Secured
in State Budget
During the 2023 legislative session, lawmakers dedicated
state revenues as matching funds for local governments
interested in applying for infrastructure grants through
the federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
In Senate Bill (SB) 23-238, the legislature also set aside $2 million for the
FRPR District. The governor signed the bill, alongside CDOT and FRPR
District representatives on May 22.
Building upon the support of SB 23-283, the FRPR District is maximizing
federal funding opportunities through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
Three immediate opportunities exist in the Railroad Crossing Elimination
Program, Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements
(CRISI) Program, and CIDP. General Manager Andy Karsian is working with
RTD, the Governor’s office, CDOT, local governments, regional partners,
and others to further grant applications toward a successful outcome.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Senate Bill 24-032 Support Position

February 22, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
February 27, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt a support position on Senate Bill 24-032 (SB32), Methods to
Increase Transit Use.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD developed its Board-adopted 2024 Legislative Program to serve as a guiding document for staff to
pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A Legislative Program serves as a living document
that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to provide an avenue for Board-adopted policy
positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
SB32 was introduced by the Colorado Senate on Wednesday, January 10, 2024, heard in the Senate
Transportation and Energy Committee on Monday, February 5, 2024, and referred as amended to the
Senate Finance Committee. The full text of the Preamended version of the bill, which depicts the bill as
introduced and incorporates the amendments approved by the Senate Transportation and Energy
Committee that will be considered by the full Senate at a later date, is appended as Attachment A.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends the Board of Directors support SB32 in alignment with RTD’s Community Value
Strategic Priority.
SB32 extends the Ozone Season Transit Grant Program that is set to expire July 1, 2024, creates a
grant program to fund zero-fare for youth programs statewide, and creates an exploratory committee to
produce a viable proposal to create, implement, and administer a statewide transit pass (exploratory
committee).
RTD participated in the Ozone Season Transit Grant Program in 2022 and 2023, which program funded
the Zero Fare for Better Air initiative. SB32 moves the administration of the grant program from the
Colorado Energy Office to the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT).

Packet Pg. 64

17.A

Regarding the creation of the “youth fare free grant program,” the newly created grant program would
be administered by CDOT. RTD is eligible to receive grant program funding so long as the agency offers
uninterrupted year-long zero-fare transit services to individuals 19 years of age or younger within the
service area.
Lastly, the creation of the exploratory committee would be led by CDOT. The exploratory committee
would be comprised of three representatives from among the state’s five largest transit agencies as well
as other representatives outlined in the bill. In performing its work, the committee must take into
consideration Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the American with Disabilities Act of 1990. On
or before July 1, 2026, the committee must submit a proposal to CDOT’s Executive Director and
members of the Transportation Legislation Review Committee.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
SB32 could result in a financial impact to the agency should RTD implement a Zero Fare for Better Air
initiative in 2024 that exceeds the amount of grant funding available through the Ozone Season Transit
Grant Program. Staff intends to return to the Board of Directors to seek approval for a potential future
grant application to receive funding and implement the 2024 Zero Fare for Better Air period.

members of the committee.
In producing a viable proposal for the creation, implementation,
and administration of a statewide transit pass, the committee is required
to solicit input from specified subject matter experts and interested parties
across the state.
The committee is required to submit its proposal for the creation,
implementation, and administration of a statewide transit pass, including
recommendations for any necessary legislation in connection with the
proposal, to the executive director and the members of the transportation
legislation review committee of the general assembly on or before July 1,
2026.
Ozone season transit grant program. The ozone season transit
grant program was created in the Colorado energy office in 2022. Section
2 makes the following changes to the ozone season transit grant program:
!
Relocates the ozone season transit grant program to the
department;
!
Requires the transit association that receives money from
the state and uses the money to make grants to transit
agencies to consider grants that have been or will be
awarded to the transit agency through the youth fare free
transit grant program, created in the bill, when making
grants to ensure that transit agencies do not receive grants
through the ozone season transit grant program for services
that are paid for with grants from the youth fare free transit
grant program;
!
Requires the state treasurer to transfer $7 million to the
ozone season transit grant program fund on July 1, 2024,
and on July 1 of each year thereafter; and
!
Makes the ozone season transit grant program permanent
by repealing the statute that would repeal the ozone season
transit grant program on July 1, 2024.
Youth fare free transit grant program. Section 3 creates the
youth fare free transit grant program in the department to provide grants
to the regional transportation district (RTD) and a transit association to
provide fare free year-round transit services for individuals who are 19
years of age or younger (youth).
To receive a grant, a transit association or the RTD must submit
an application to the department in accordance with the policies
established by the department. A transit association that receives a grant
may use the money to make grants to eligible transit agencies. The
eligible transit agencies and the RTD may use the grant money to provide
operating support for its transit operations and general transit programs,
so long as the eligible transit agency or the RTD provides uninterrupted
fare free year-round transit services for youth riders.
The RTD is required to report to the department and an eligible

transit agency that receives a grant from a transit association is required
to report to the transit association regarding the estimated change in youth
ridership during the year in which fare free services were offered
compared to previous years, any changes that the RTD or the eligible
transit agency would make in how it provides fare free transit services to
youth or in its use of the grant money based on its experiences, and how
the RTD or the eligible transit agency marketed the fare free transit
services for youth. The transit association is required to submit to the
department a summary of the reported information for all eligible transit
agencies that received a grant through the transit association.
The bill creates the youth fare free transit grant program fund
(fund) and transfers $7 million from the general fund to the fund on July
1, 2024, and on July 1 of each year thereafter. The money in the fund is
continuously appropriated to the department for the youth fare free transit
grant program.
The department is required to establish policies governing the
youth fare free transit grant program and to report to the house of
representatives transportation, housing, and local government committee
and the senate transportation committee, or their successor committees,
by December 31 of each year of the program.
Income tax credit for the purchase of a transit pass. For income
tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2024, but before January 1,
2029, section 4 creates an income tax credit allowed to any taxpayer in
an amount equal to 30% of the amount spent by the taxpayer to purchase
one or more transit passes for use by the taxpayer during the income tax
year for which the credit is claimed.
To claim the credit a taxpayer is required to include a credit
certificate issued by the department with the income tax return filed with
the department of revenue. The credit certificate that the department
issues must identify the taxpayer and certify that the taxpayer purchased
one or more transit passes for the taxpayer's use during the income tax
year for which the credit is claimed.
The amount of the credit not used as an offset against income taxes
in the current income tax year is refunded to the taxpayer.
No later than January 1, 2025, and no later than January 1 of each
year thereafter through January 1, 2029, the department is required to
provide the department of revenue with an electronic report of the
taxpayers receiving a credit certificate.

12

or replace funding for free transit services that the eligible transit agency

BOARD CHAIR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Board Meeting Accessibility Pilot Policy

February 22, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
February 27, 2024

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the attached Board and Committee Meeting Accessibility Pilot Policy.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Board Chair
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD complies with Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prevent
discrimination based on disability, as well as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits
discrimination on race, color, and national origin (including language proficiency). These federal laws and
regulatory compliance requirements set forth by the Federal Transit Administration establish provisions
for language access as well as auxiliary aids and services to ensure meaningful public involvement with
persons with disabilities and linguistically diverse communities. This is of relevance with respect to the
meetings of the Board of Directors (Board).
To ensure compliance, all Board meeting agendas are published with the following language:
The following communication assistance is available for public meetings:
Language Interpreters
Sign-language Interpreters
Assisted listening devices
Documents in alternative formats and language translations
Please notify RTD of the communication assistance you require at least 48 business hours in
advance of a RTD meeting you wish to attend by calling 303.299.2307
Currently, the Board Office works closely with the Civil Rights Division to arrange for any requested
language assistance services. The last meeting during which language interpretation services were
provided was the June 2023 Board Meeting before which the Board Office received a request to provide

Packet Pg. 94

17.B

Spanish language interpretation. There is a centralized agency-wide budget to pay for the cost of
language assistance service providers within the Civil Rights Division, and the Board Office coordinates
with the Civil Rights Division to have appropriately submitted any language assistance requests for Board
meetings received by the Board Office.
While it is noted that Board meetings are in compliance with Titles II and III of the ADA and Title VI of
the Civil Rights Act, the Board Office has fulfilled requests for Communication Access Realtime
Transcription services to be provided at recent Board and Committee meetings and has paid for those
services from the Board Office operational budget. Additionally, the Board Office has made coordinated
investments from the Board Office budget into information technology hardware, third-party service
providers, and audio/visual (AV) equipment in Board meeting spaces to ensure greater baseline levels of
public accessibility at Board meetings.
The Board Office and the Civil Rights Division surveyed other transit agencies to gain insights into best
practices for providing CART and Spanish translation services. Capital Metro (Austin, TX), Long Beach
Transit (Long Beach, CA), Jacksonville Transportation Authority (Jacksonville, FL), Kansas City Area
Transit Authority (Kansas City, MO), TriMet (Portland, OR), Utah Transit Authority (Salt Lake City, UT)
all provide translation services upon request. Likewise, the above agencies provide CART services upon
request, except for Long Beach Transit which constructed its new board room with embedded closed
captioning technology.
Likewise the Board Office and Civil Rights Division reached out to other local governments to understand
the levels of accessibility those entities provide at their meetings. The City and County of Denver and
Commerce City provide language translation and CART services upon request. The City of Aurora
provides Spanish interpreters automatically at the public comment portion of its city council meetings so
that attendees can provide council comments in Spanish that are translated to English by an interpreter;
if an attendee wishes to have language interpretation available for any other portion of the agenda, they
must request those services in advance. The City of Aurora provides CART services upon request. The
Colorado General Assembly provides CART services upon request.
The Board discussed what it would like to see in a policy during the January Executive Committee
meeting as well as the January full Board meeting. At that time, the Board provided direction to staff to
bring back a pilot policy stating that CART and Spanish language interpretation would be provided at all
Board and committee meetings.
DISCUSSION
Based on additional information gathered following the Board’s discussions in January, the Board Office
is proposing the attached meeting accessibility pilot program policy for 2024, which calls for CART
services and an automatic translation of the CART transcript into Spanish, at all board and committee
meetings. Additional accessibility services will continue to be provided upon request.
The Board is asked to review the proposed policy, discuss its merits, and vote on the proposed policy.

Packet Pg. 95

17.B

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Board Office and Civil Rights Division have sufficient funding allocated for the 2024 fiscal year to
provide accessibility and language assistance services upon request so long as the volume and nature of
those requests mirror historical averages/anticipated requests.
The Board Office estimates the cost of providing CART services with automated Spanish translation for
all anticipated Board and committee meetings in 2024 to be at least $29,100 ($177 per hour).
In anticipation of a policy change, the Board Office has initiated a procurement process for CART
services. The Civil Rights Division has already concluded a procurement process for language access
service providers based on anticipated needs across the agency.

2024 RTD BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING AND COMMITTEE MEETING
ACCESSIBILITY PILOT POLICY

PURPOSE
To provide enhanced accessibility at RTD Board of Director committee and full board meetings,
while ensuring continuing compliance with the federal and state laws and regulations.

POLICY
During the 2024 board and committee meeting accessibility pilot, the Board of Directors, shall
automatically provide remote Communication Access Real Time Translation (CART) services in
English with an automated translation of the CART transcript into Spanish at all of its meetings.
Additional accessibility services, including the provision of language interpreters, sign-language
interpreters, assisted listening devices, documents in alternative formats, and document
translations will continue to be provided upon request. Requests are to be made 48 hours in
advance by contacting the Board Office Executive Manager.

SCOPE
This policy applies to all noticed meetings in 2024 of the Board, including but not limited to: standing
committee meetings, independent audit committee meetings, ad hoc committee meetings, board
study sessions, board retreats, special board meetings, and regularly scheduled board meetings.
During the pilot program the Board Office will work to compile data related to the usage of
accessibility services to provide the Board with additional information with which to make a longterm decision regarding the level of accessibility services it automatically provides at its meetings.

RESPONSIBILITIES
The Board Office will be responsible for ensuring the provision of CART services as outlined above
and that requests for additional accessibility services are met. The Board Office will work closely
with the Civil Rights Division as the subject matter experts.

TIMEFRAME
The pilot program shall be in effect until the board takes further action or December 31, 2024,
whichever is first.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Near-term Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project

February 27, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Central Corridor (corridor) is the oldest rail segment in the agency’s light rail system, having
officially opened on October 7, 1994. The corridor extends 5.3 miles, from I-25●Broadway Station to
30th●Downing Station. With the corridor now approaching its 30th year in continuous revenue service,
several track segments require full-depth reconstruction, and associated rail infrastructure requires
replacement.
Prior to 2024, RTD previously completed several rail maintenance and repair projects throughout the
corridor over the rail infrastructure’s useful life, with 14 projects having taken place at key intersections
between 2016 and 2023 to replace sections of curved rail, switches, crossings, signals, and other
infrastructure.
DISCUSSION
In commencing the Near-term Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project (project), RTD is striving to meet
the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success, as well as the
2023-24 Strategic Initiatives of Back to Basics and Welcoming Transit Environment.
The project is a multi-phase effort to undertake previously deferred maintenance activities along the 30year-old segment of the light rail network. This major reconstruction effort is the first of this nature in
RTD’s history. Maintaining RTD’s rail infrastructure is essential to preserve the region’s transit
investments and maintain the long-term integrity of the rail network. Moreover, RTD will further
undertake many more such maintenance efforts across the rail network as the balance of the
infrastructure reaches maturity, as informed by the Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan.
The project will take place over four phases, which the latter three may occur simultaneously:
• Phase One: Downtown Loop Intersections
• Phase Two: Midblock Reconstruction Downtown Loop
• Phase Three: Colfax Avenue Alignment Reconstruction
• Phase Four: Welton Street Corridor

Packet Pg. 98

18.1

Commencing May 2024 and scheduled to conclude September 2024, Phase One of the project will
involve full-depth rail reconstruction of five roadway/rail intersections in the Downtown Loop, a segment
of the rail network located primarily within Denver’s Central Business District that is part of the original
corridor alignment:
•
•
•
•
•

15th St. and Stout St.
17th St. and Stout St.
15th St. and California St.
17th St. and California St.
Broadway and Welton St.

The Downtown Loop is currently served by the D, H, and L lines. Light rail consists in this area run
adjacent to pedestrian and vehicular traffic. While light rail, bus, motorist, and pedestrian movement in
the vicinity will be impacted for the duration of Phase One of the project, the work will proceed via
planned closures as opposed to unplanned service disruptions.
Along with construction efforts, staff and contractors will engage in comprehensive communication and
outreach efforts to garner public understanding and generate public awareness of the importance and
impact of the project. RTD will host a series of virtual and in-person community meetings, both in
English and Spanish, near impacted light rail lines. Public meetings will commence in March 2024 and
run through the project’s duration. Additionally, RTD will launch a project webpage, paid media
campaign, and employ a robust public relations strategy, all of which will launch prior to the project.
The latter three phases of the project will commence in 2025 and will similarly involve full-depth rail
reconstruction, both in the mid-block areas in the Downtown Loop and along the Colfax Alignment and
Welton Corridor rail segments. The project team comprised of staff and consultants will develop project
plans for the latter phases over the coming months.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total cost of the Near-term Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project is anticipated to be $152 million.
Funding for the project is appropriated in the 2024 Budget; funding for the latter three phases will be
accounted for in the 2025 Budget via capital carryforward.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
May 2024 Service Change Proposals

February 27, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager of Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) shared between RTD and the Amalgamated Local Transit Union Local 1001, the May
2024 Service Change Proposal facilitates both an opportunity for RTD bus and rail operators to vote new
work assignments and the opportunity for Service Development staff to adjust the operations plan for
RTD’s transit network.
Along with the continued people power challenges, light rail projects related to the coping panel
replacement in the Southeast Corridor and the first phase of the downtown rail reconstruction project on
the Central Corridor are primary considerations shaping the service change recommendations for May
2024. Both projects are expected to span from May 2024 until the following service change, having
significant impacts to rail service delivery and the transit network serving the downtown Denver area.
DISCUSSION
The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, reductions, and adjustments aimed at
addressing the reliability of the system network and preserving transit access during major rail
maintenance efforts. Notable recommendations include proposals to reduce service frequency on
Southeast Corridor, including the E and H lines, in response to reconstruction activity limiting speeds and
track access in the construction area. Additionally, rail services on the D and H lines are proposed to be
redirected from the Central Corridor to instead serve Denver Union Station (DUS). L Line service is
recommended to be suspended during the construction period, with alternative service available on the
Route 43 – Martin Luther King Jr/Gateway bus route. Reintroduction of the Free MetroRide is also
recommended, supported by reductions in service on the Free MallRide to provide better circulation
between Civic Center Station and DUS.
Following the guidelines contained in the Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Customer Excellence
and recognizing the RTD’s people power challenges, the proposals herein are directed at improving ontime performance, maintaining CBA compliance and adjusting service levels to match anticipated
seasonal, i.e., summer, customer demand.

Packet Pg. 136

18.2

The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
A summary of the list of service proposals are provided below, which are detailed in Attachment A.
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES
Services Proposed for Light Rail Projects
The coping panel replacement project, which commenced in Q2 2023 and paused during cold weather

paused during the cold weather months, will resume in May 2024 and conclude September 2024. The
rail reconstruction project, expected to commence in early summer 2024, is a project to reconstruct rail
infrastructure in downtown Denver. The first phase of this project involves replacing track at five
intersections in the vicinity of the Welton Corridor downtown Denver. This phase is expected to be
concluded in September 2024. Additionally, light rail service spans are recommended to be reduced; in
