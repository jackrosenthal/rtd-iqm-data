It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2015 to amend and appropriate funds for the
proposed 2015 Amended Budget, to increase the appropriation by $134.670 million to
$1,520.186 million as detailed below in the overview of the 2015 Amended Budget, and
to decrease the appropriation of Capital Carryforward (previously approved capital funds)

She noted that her firm is working with the Transportation Legislation
Review Committee (TLRC) to set a date for an RTD presentation. The
TLRC’s next meetings will be on July 7th–8th and September 29th–30th. No
agendas have been set. Jenifer Brandeberry pointed out that there is
interest for corridor tours during the fall.

has not been any action regarding HB15-1098 on Red Light Cameras.
Megan Wagner, Director of Client Services for Brandeberry~McKenna,
informed the Directors that the Council of State Governments (CSG) invited
RTD to their conference on Monday, July 27, 2015 to join the discussion on
transportation. The panel discussion will be held at the Westin Hotel.
Director Francone asked who will be speaking on behalf of RTD at the panel.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs, informed the Directors that MAP-21 was
extended for two months. The length of the extensions was dictated by the
level of funding remaining in the Highway Trust Fund. He added that the
fund will probably expire in August. Mike Dino foresees another extension
when it expires and maybe an extension until the next Presidential
campaign.
He noted that Congress is back in session after the Memorial Day recess.

Director. She mentioned that he has an extensive transportation background
as a house staffer and the former liaison to the Colorado Department of

Rapid Transit (BRT) investments. Mike Dino replied that he sees no real
effort on reauthorization language. His firm continues to reiterate this issue
with the appropriate committees and delegations. He added that the current
BRT definition limits what RTD can do. A more flexible definition would
open up new Federal funding opportunities.
Director Walker wondered if there is any conversation at the Federal level on
Oregon’s Road Usage Charge Program. Mike Dino said that there is no
conversation about it in Washington, D.C. Mike Dino mentioned that Former
Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood liked the idea but was not able to
get President Obama on board.
Director Menten asked for a copy of the Highway Trust Fund’s line items.

beginning on October 1. None of the amendments offered by Democrats
were adopted. These amendments would have increased funding for New
Starts and TIGER Grants, among others. This decreases the funding by
almost $550 million from what the President proposed. This will affects
new Full Funding Grant Agreements and the Southeast Rail Extension. The
Eagle P3 project will not be affected. Mike Dino added that the Senate has
not made it known how they will work with these changes.

C. Updates

• FasTracks Quality Management
Kevin Diviness, Director of Quality Assurance, reviewed the Quality
Management Update presentation included in the FasTracks Monitoring
Committee agenda packet for June 2, 2015. The presentation included the
Quality Management System components, contractor requirements, focus on
process and product, performance matrix, RTD Oversight Summary,
explanation of the ISO 9001 Certification, Rocky Mountain Performance
Excellence Recognition, and an overview of the Quality Management team.
He pointed out that Kiewit has started using RTD’s performance matrix at
their corporate level.
Committee Chair Hoy pointed out that this presentation shows what a great
organization RTD is as it points out why we do things the right way.
Director Folska asked for clarification on Kevin Diviness role and who he
manages. Kevin Diviness confirmed he is an RTD employee who manages 3
RTD employees and 2 consultants: Delcan and Kumar.
Director Folska suggested including the United States Access Board (Access
Board) as a helpful addition to quality standards. She said that when he
mentioned concrete on the RTD Oversight Summary she thought of the Yale
station, which has lots of not well cured stairs and no elevators. Including
quality standards from the Access Board would assist in these areas.

Director Folska inquired regarding lessons learned from the Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) on the I-225 rail line. Rick Clarke, Assistant General
Manager for Capital Programs, replied that part of Kevin Diviness efforts is
an end of year lessons learned report. Rick Clarke added that overall the EIS
on I-225 has held up pretty well except for the Fitzimmons area. Director
Folska said she assumes that the lessons learned will be shared with other
corridors and extensions. Rick Clarke told Director Folska that his team will
go to the Yale station and examine the stairs. He noted that the station
does have a ramp. Director Folska pointed out the station needs an
elevator.
Director Lubow asked which of the tools presented was used to determine
the problems on the Jersey Cutoff bridge. Kevin Diviness explained that the
private contractor owned the risk of the bridge. That particular bridge was
produced at an offsite location. During the process the contractor did not
implement their own quality process appropriately. He noted that RTD
submitted comments concerning safety. An independent source was
contracted to assess the problems. Since RTD had not accepted the bridge
Denver Transit Partners (DTP) was able to demolish and reconstruct. Kevin
Diviness added that it was a painful, costly process for DTP. Director
Lubow asked if in his opinion the process worked. Kevin Diviness replied
that yes it worked in that the bridge was never in use. What did not work
was the contractor’s quality process. Director Lubow asked if RTD staff
would do anything differently. Kevin Diviness replied that staff would do
more process audits. He added that some of the staff who worked on that
project are now working on the North Metro line, bringing with them their
experiences.
Committee Chair Hoy thanked staff for their great job. He added that the
North Metro rail line staff is very aware of the concerns Director Lubow

Pauletta Tonilas, Senior Manager for Public Relations (PR) and Public
Information (PI), reviewed the FasTracks Monitoring Committee Public
Information Update presentation included in the FasTracks Monitoring
Committee agenda packet for June 2, 2015. The presentation covered
FasTracks PI Transition, PI Plan, 2015 Year to Date Media Monitoring and
Mentions, Social Media Activity, Community Presentations and Education

Director Folska noted that the presentation made reference to the Federal
Transit Administration (FTA) guidelines but not to any Federal Railroad
Administration guidelines (FRA). Kevin Diviness explained that due to the
amount of Federal funding through grants, the Eagle P3 project needs to
abide by the FTA guidelines. The FRA has requirements in order for the line
to be open for service, but there are no quality guidelines.

including the use of mock rail crossings, Focus in Year Ahead, Coming Soon
Events, and video collaboration with Im’Unique.

Committee Chair Hoy said that the video was great and very impactful.
Pauletta Tonilas pointed out that Stefon Matthews was the dancer during
the Stand Up 4 Transportation rally. Tyrone Beverly noted that his
organization would like to continue the partnership with RTD through an
event at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on July 25, 2015. The idea is
to have people meeting in one location and traveling via RTD to get there.
Committee Chair Hoy thanked Tyrone Beverly for such a great project and
thanked him for leading the Stand Up 4 Transportation rally so well.
Director Folska thanked Tyrone Beverly and noted that man is usually the
biggest barrier to most things. Regarding the presentation, she said that she
found the Media Monitoring and Mentions spreadsheets very informative.
Director Folska asked for more details on the use of mock crossings for
education as light rail and commuter rail technologies are different. Pauletta
Tonilas said that commuter rail education will be using the same mock
crossings that were prepared by the body shop for the West line education.
Dave Genova, Interim General Manager, added that the technology is
different but the treatment is similar: flashing lights, gate arms, bells that
ring, etc. The idea is to get students and adults familiar with these basic
elements. Director Folska asked if commuter rail crossings have gates for
pedestrians. Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs,
pointed out that some locations do have gates for pedestrian and not just
motor vehicles. He added that crossings near schools and high pedestrian
traffic are the key areas for education. He noted that the Federal Transit
Authority (FTA) lauded this aspect of the program. Dave Genova added that
our light rail system follows FTA guidelines for operations, maintenance, and
inspections as it is the only body that has standards. Director Folska noted
the importance of education as some people try to go around a train without
noting another incoming train. She requested that the Directors experience
the mock crossing training.
Director Walker shared how the video reminded him of trains and buses after
8 o’clock at night when they become very friendly. He asked Pauletta
Tonilas if she thought her team had enough staff to do outreach for 5 lines.

Pauletta Tonilas introduced Tyrone Beverly, Executive Director of Im’Unique.
Pauletta Tonilas mentioned that Tyrone Beverly was the Masters of
Ceremony for the Stand Up 4 Transportation rally. Tyrone Beverly
introduced a video piece title “The Road to Change”, which features dancer
Stefon Matthews as well as members of the Im’Unique community. RTD
collaborated in the production of the video by providing a special bus and
use of a bus stop. The video featured public transit as an agent of change
helping communities move forward.

Even if the lines are not opening at the same time, it seems like there is so
much education that needs to happen. Pauletta Tonilas replied that without
a question having another body would be great; however, she praised her
team as high-performing and involved in many community life aspects:
schools, clubs, festivals, exhibits, electronic newsletters, media, milestone
events, elected officials on the corridors, etc. She added that the
communication and education process is ever evolving and that her
responsibility is to use our resources wisely. Dave Genova reminded the
Directors that Denver Transit Partners is responsible to develop a lot of the
outreach and education alongside with RTD staff. Director Walker said that
if staff is comfortable with the resources then he is comfortable. Pauletta
Tonilas mentioned the contractors are part of the PI team.
Director Francone thanked Pauletta Tonilas for the map she requested.
Director Francone thanked Tyrone Beverly and requested the lyrics of the
video for her son as they watched it together the night before. She asked if
the focus will remain on rail education as the PI team transitions to PR.
Pauletta Tonilas replied that safety education is big picture and includes
buses, light rail, commuter rail, construction, etc. She noted that a key
message is that safety is a two way street; you have to participate to be
safe.
Director Francone said that RTD could use more of these kinds of videos.
She asked for the amount RTD contributed to the production of the video.
Pauletta Tonilas answered that RTD’s contribution was coordination, use of
bus, use of bus stop, and outreach/publicity for the video as it conveys
transit’s role in breaking barriers. Director Francone inquired for the plan to
promote the July 25, 2015 event. Pauletta Tonilas replied that RTD will
work with Im’Unique to create another video project to promote the event.
Director Francone asked if RTD has an advertising relationship with the local
Evergreen newspaper. Pauletta Tonilas shared that RTD does not do a lot of
media buying but more of public awareness campaigns as lines open.
Director Francone informed staff that the local Evergreen newspaper would
like to have a relationship with RTD and reminded staff about the upcoming
Summerfest in Evergreen as a great opportunity for education.
Director James thought the video was a great idea. He thanked the PI team
for assisting him with materials when he does presentations. Director
James wondered how RTD works with Transportation Management
Associations (TMAs) and Organizations (TMOs) to leverage and maximize
the growing interest in communities around the first/last mile concept and
other subjects of interest. Pauletta Tonilas shared that her team works
frequently with TMAs and TMOs noting that a lot of them helped with the
Stand Up 4 Transportation rally and will help out with communication during
the line openings. For the first/last mile issue, RTD is developing a

relationship with Uber. She added that another education aspect is
redefining travel time as what you can do while you commute using public
transit as opposed to driving.

Director Tobiassen thanked Tyrone Beverly for the video adding that he
would be sharing it on his Facebook page that evening. He thanked the I225/R line PI team for all their community meetings and outreach during the
height of construction. He suggested an I-225/R line outreach event on
September 19th, Talk Like a Pirate Day. Director Tobiassen invited the
Directors to Aurora Kidspree on Saturday, Jun 6th as the mock crossing will
be available at the event. He suggested training police officers to enforce
gate running summons.
Director Folska suggested using the Oktoberfest theme for all the BRT
station parties scheduled for October. She also suggested working with
Boys Scouts and Girls Scouts using RTD to earn badges. She shared her
experience working with the Girls Scouts and the power of peer to peer
education.
Committee Chair Hoy thanked staff for their work. He mentioned how he
still gets comments on the Denver Union Station (DUS) opening and how
people refer to it as “our” DUS even if they do not live within the City and
County of Denver boundaries. This denotes the great work in PI and
education.
Pauletta Tonilas invited the Directors to be at DUS on Saturday, June 6th at
10:30 a.m. as the Make-a-Wish Foundation (Foundation) will be fulfilling the
dream of Jack, a 7 year old who wants to be a super hero. RTD has
partnered with the Foundation to provide the use of the Great Hall and the
Bus Concourse for the event. Director Menten asked if spectators were to
dress in green and take part of the action. Pauletta Tonilas encouraged any
participants to dress in green as Jack’s super hero name will be the “Green
Blaze”. The Foundation will have signs on hand to cheer him on.

C. Updates

• Real Property Unsolicited Proposal Policy
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager of Transit Oriented Communities (TOC), and Kate
Iverson, Manager of Transit Oriented Development (TOD), reviewed a Power
Point with the Board that is available in the June 6, 2015 Planning and
Development Committee Agenda Packet.
Bill Sirois noted that in addition to RTD’s Policies governing RTD real
property (Resolution 10 of 1984 and Strategic Plan for TOD), we are also
governed by State Enabling Legislation (C.R.S. 32-9-101) and Federal
Regulations (Circular 5010.1D – Real Property Disposition and Circular
7050.1 – Joint Development). He reminded the Directors about the Real
Property Pilot Program and TOD Pilot Program that staff are currently
implementing. Bill Sirois stated that in reviewing our governing
policies/regulations and pilot programs staff had several observations:
 Resolution 10 is outdated and needs to be updated
 Federal regulations affect the process and should be recognized and
dealt with early
 Need for consistent and transparent process when dealing with
people inside and outside RTD
 Existing unsolicited proposal policy excludes real property and its
structure for capital projects and materials and services proposals
 Important for real property process to have some flexibility because
each project is unique
 Obtaining current valuation and title work may take time and should
be initiated early in the process
Packet Pg. 20

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 2, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lasater participated via phone. Directors Anderson and Bagley were absent.

Kate Iverson stated that this is really just the beginning of a discussion
around the proposed framework for a Real Property Unsolicited Proposal
Policy. She said that staff will be coming to the Board over the course of
the year with more information and process progresses. She said the
proposed next steps are to:
 Replace existing Resolution 10
o Clarify administrative (General Manager) versus Board level
approvals for real property interests
o Conform to FTA regulations for disposition and joint
development
o Incorporate a policy for unsolicited real property proposals
 Develop an unsolicited proposal policy for real property
o Establish a formal, streamlined process for evaluating
proposals that encourages innovation in leveraging real
property assets
o Clarify differences in process for excess property disposition
versus joint development
o Establish criteria for accepting sole source joint development
proposals
She explained that staff is currently looking at the following criteria for sole
source justification:
1) The proposer owns or can demonstrate legal control (such as a
purchase option or long term lease) of property contiguous to RTD
property;
AND
2) The proposed development concept leverages that contiguous
ownership to provide benefits to RTD that could not be achieved by
EITHER i) a standalone development of the RTD property, OR ii) by a
development proposed by another contiguous property owner.
Kate Iverson reiterated that this would be a multi-step process during which
time they would keep the Board informed of their progress. She also noted
that staff planned to involve RTD’s TOD Assessment consultants to review
the draft resolution and unsolicited proposal policy.
Committee Chair James thanked staff for the flow chart that outlined the
unsolicited proposal process. He thought it really helped demonstrate the
logic behind the process. He wondered what legal restraints there might be
on RTD related to our participation in joint development. Marla Lien, General
Counsel, stated that joint development is something that RTD does fairly
often. Examples of this are Federal Center, Boulder Transit Village and
Denver Union Station, just to highlight a few. RTD partners with an
adjacent property owner to jointly install infrastructure or provide for

Director Lubow inquired if there was a practical or legal presumption that we
prefer competition and sole source only happens when competition is not
advisable. Marla Lien stated that from a practical perspective RTD would
prefer competition. She said that since we have so much federal interest in
what we do there is a very strong presumption that all sources of material,
contracts, uses and services are to be competed unless you meet more
limited sole source criteria.
Director Lubow asked if before going to sole source RTD would need to
justify that we meet federal criteria for establishing preference for sole
source. Marla Lien explained that the FTA does not have sole source
criteria. RTD must ensure the disposition gets fair market value or fair return
on the investment but they do not preclude sole source. Director Lubow
expressed concern that RTD might be setting a policy that is unnecessarily
restrictive as it relates to sole source. She suggested creating some type of
task force to get public feedback about the policy.
Committee Chair James asked for confirmation that a sole source does not
happen just because an entity owns adjacent property. There must also be
transparency, being fair, maximizing value to RTD, etc. Kate Iverson
explained that it is a two-step process for a sole source. First, the entity
must own property immediately adjacent to RTD property. But, there must
also be a clear benefit to RTD. She believes that there are parcels that could
be developed as stand-alone so staff needs to evaluate every proposal to
make sure we are not foregoing a better offer.
Director Menten noted that while the presentation was titled Real Property
Unsolicited Proposal Policy, there was also a great deal related to RTD’s
overall excess property disposition through Resolution 10. She was
wondering if RTD would give a former property owner first rights to regain
property they previously owned prior to putting it out for a competitive bid.
Susan Altes, Senior Manager of Property, explained that when RTD acquires
property under eminent domain the regulation does not really provide for the
ability to offer the property back to the property owner. She shared that
previously the Board did pass a resolution that the Ft. Lupton properties
could be sold back to the original owners; however, there was absolutely no
interest. Marla Lien stressed that the Ft. Lupton land acquisition and
resolution happened within a year. She acknowledged that a lot of what
Director Menten was asking about related to RTD only needing a portion of
someone’s property. She reminded the Board that in those instances the
Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 2, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

maintenance of walkways, landscaping, etc. in way that are much more
effective and efficient than if we were doing them on our own. She
explained that in terms of co-ownership there are constitutional prohibitions
against RTD having legal partnerships with a private entity but we can
always enter into long term leases.

6.C

Director Menten wanted to make sure that we always advertise property the
old fashioned way by sticking a “for sale” sign in the ground. She
recognized that technology is moving forward but the sign in the ground can
still grab a lot of people’s attention. Susan Altes reminded the Board that as
part of the Real Property Disposition Pilot Program there were four distinct
approaches selected to test in the disposition process so that did not happen
for every property; however, it was very effective at the Ft. Lupton
property. Kate Iverson noted that what was being discussed this evening
was really related to when someone contacted RTD about a property, not
about our efforts to generate interest.
Committee Chair James asked Bill Sirois if he could discuss their efforts on
putting real property information on RTD’s website. Bill Sirois said that was
something the TOC department has been working to ramp up. Having
defined policies/procedures will really help provide the public with more
information.
Director Francone requested a copy of Resolution 10. Committee Chair
James asked staff to send it to the full Board.
Director Hoy shared that he is a big proponent of sign in the ground and a
list of properties RTD owns that is easy to find. It is hard to get an
unsolicited proposal on a piece of land that no one knows RTD owns. He
recognized that while it was definitely time for an update of Resolution 10,
he would like the process to be one where the Board gets to review the
proposed resolution much in advance of when they will be asked to approve
it. Bill Sirois stated that was staff’s plan.
Director Hoy expressed his surprise at how many acres of the Ft. Lupton
property were under contract. He wondered if there was a closing date.
Susan Altes explained that there was a due diligence period of 180 days.
She said that the property went under contract April 8th. Due to the length
of time of the due diligence period Susan Altes did negotiate several triggers
that would increase the purchase price of the property, such as the buyer
not exercising the right to close in 120 days.
Director Walker shared that the number one, perhaps only, complaint he
hears from developers is that they do not understand our real estate
process. He believes understanding the why and how will really help them a
lot. He said he could see a scenario where an adjoining property owner
might be able to develop a small property in conjunction with the property
that they own that would not be developable to us. He likes the direction
staff is moving.

property owner has the decision in if they wish to keep the leftover portion
of their property or have RTD purchase the entire parcel.

• 16th Street Mall

Rick Clarke stated that we received one bid that was 57% above our
engineer’s estimate. He explained that instead of bringing the Board an
action to approve, staff is going to step back and do some reassessment.
They will be meeting with the contractor next week to try to understand the
costs as some do not make sense to staff. He said that staff hopes we can
work with the contractor to lower the bid even though they recognize this is
a big ASK.
Rick Clarke noted there are several other options. RTD could take the
money designated for reconstruction of the transitway and use it to cover
this overrun; however, staff does not think this is in the best interest of
RTD. He said that RTD can and will ask the stakeholders for additional
funding. The last option is to put everything on hold while we continue to
work with the FTA.
Stan Szabelak, Engineering Project Manager, reminded the Board that part of
the bid included intersection work for the City and County of Denver (City).
The City’s work was 21% over the engineer’s estimate while RTD’s was
50% over. There were line items that came in 40x more than our engineer’s
estimate. He said that often estimates are within a couple percentage
points, not times factors. He thinks that perhaps the contractor does not
understand some elements of the project.
Committee Chair James wondered if there was any potential for reaching
out to other contractors to cultivate interest in the project. He asked if the
low interest was due to there being so much construction occurring in the
Denver metro area. Rick Clarke stated that was correct. Construction
companies in the Denver area are extremely busy right now. He said if we
put the project out to bid again staff plans to beat the bushes to generate a
more competitive bidding environment but that might not help.
Committee Chair James inquired about the ramifications of putting the
project on hold, which RTD is doing right now at least for a short period of
time. Rick Clarke explained that there are challenges with putting the
Packet Pg. 24

Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, said that staff
wanted to give another update on the 16th Street Mall reconstruction
because at the last update staff indicated that this month they would be
coming back to the committee with a request to move forward with a
contractor. He reminded the Board that the project was broken up into two
phases. One phase was for reconstruction of everything except the transit
way. Simultaneously, staff was working with the FTA to look at the impact
of going forward with a different surface for the transit way, which is a
process than can take 8-12 months.

6.C

Director Lasater asked for clarification that the bid received was just for
things like sidewalks and not the transitway. Rick Clarke stated that was
correct. Director Lasater shared that several years ago when the Parker City
Council was trying to do some roadway work the bids came in exceptionally
high and they opted not to move forward. He wondered if this was an
option for RTD as well. Rick Clarke noted that in some ways we are doing
just that; however, the transitway cannot be put on hold forever. Director
Lasater asked if there was any further dialog on using a different material for
the transitway. Rick Clarke stated that is the process that staff is working
thought with the FTA right now. He reiterated that the process is a long
process that includes public involvement.
Committee Chair James thanked staff for the update.

them. The FTA likes to see RTD draw down on the funds we have been
awarded. Staff will need to speak with the FTA and ask for their patience
as we work through the challenges.

C. Updates

• Civil Rights Committee Update
Zamy Silva, Senior Manager for Civil Rights, reviewed the Civil Rights
Update presentation included in the Civil Rights Committee agenda packet
for June 9, 2015. The presentation included percentages achieved on
Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE) and Small Business Enterprises
(SBE) on both base system and FasTracks projects, recent and upcoming
events, an overview of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) program
and the upcoming 25th Anniversary celebration, the Equal Employment
Opportunity (EEO) Office software, and the Workforce Initiative Now (WIN)
Program. She highlighted the Civil Rights and Public Engagement Briefing
for the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) held on June 8, 2015.
Zamy Silva acknowledged the work of Ed Neuberg, Manager for ADA, since
he started with the agency a few months back.
Director Deadwyler wondered about the ADA celebration as she was a
speaker at a similar event held at the Capitol earlier in the year. Ed Neuberg
replied that the official ADA anniversary is July 26th. He noted that it may
have been a celebration noting the significance of the year as ADA embarks
on the 25th anniversary. He added that the upcoming event is a community
event.
Chair Sisk commended the Civil Rights staff on the impressive statistics. He
asked to eventually see statistics on how long WIN participants stay with
employers and how are they utilizing the education and opportunities
received through the WIN program. Zamy Silva replied that her staff has

Director Solano agreed with Chair Sisk. Director Solano noted that as the
focus shifts from construction to operations a lot of the construction
projects will ramp down making it hard to determine what will happen to the
participants. He pointed out that at least the participants are getting trained.
Director Deadwyler shared her conversation with a WIN participant who was
hired full time but keeps getting told he is not needed on certain days or
weeks. She wondered how the agency keeps them working if they are not
working with the contractor. Zamy Silva noted that Martell Dyles, WIN
Program Manager keeps a detailed account of participants. She added that
since the work is project driven at times it is difficult to offer consecutive
work; it all depends on the skills of the individual, the job, the company and
the project. The WIN Program works with contractors to find out about
other opportunities that could benefit the WIN participants.
Committee Chair Walker mentioned that he participated in the briefing for
the Department of Transportation on June 8. He noted that Bryna Helfer,
Office of Public Engagement Deputy Assistant for DOT, Stephanie Gidigbi,
Deputy Director of Public Engagement for DOT, and Kathy Mannes, Director
for the Center for Workforce and Industry Partnerships at the U.S.
Department of labor, showed a lot of enthusiasm over the WIN program. He
thanked Zamy Silva for her work.

those numbers available. She added that the goal of the WIN program is to
find opportunities for individuals to work in the community and to enable
them to continue to grow in their career paths. The growth depends on the
individuals and the projects available. Dave Genova, Interim General
Manager, added that Denver Transit Partners (DTP) intends to use the WIN
program for operations and maintenance positions once the Eagle P3 project
opens, giving the participants a long term program, not just construction
projects. Chair Sisk thanked the Civil Rights staff again for their work and
extended a welcome to Ed Neuberg.

B. Recommended Actions

• Authorization to Enter Into Contract with INIT for Purchase of Day Pass
Printers
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee
to enter into a $2,700,000 sole source contract with INIT Innovations in
Transportation, Inc. (INIT) for purchase, integration and installation of
equipment and software necessary to accommodate the sale of day-pass
fare media under the newly adopted fare structure (Contract Number
15DH072). This contract will include integration with the Computer Aided
Dispatch/ Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) system, interface changes
for the new fare structure, parking pass validation and a 3-year extended
warranty.
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the June 16, 2015 Board
meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer, reminded the Directors
that staff is requesting a sole source contract due to the
specifics of the CAD/AVL system and the specific information
that will need to be printed on the Day Pass. She added that
delaying approval would mean a delay in manufacturing and
installation of the printers.
Director Hoy noted that deploying this project will be pretty
complex. He asked the likelihood of staff meeting the January
1st, 2016 if the Directors approved the contract. Eric

Director Deadwyler expressed her frustration at the
fragmentation of the process. She wondered why the $1.9
million budget transfer request approved recently by the
Directors could not be bundled up with the current request.
Eric Farrington replied that when staff requested the budget
transfer the contracting portion had not been developed.
Heather Copp clarified that the current recommended action is
for a sole source agreement, not for funding. The budget
transfer was requested ahead of time to ensure availability of
funds when negotiating with the vendor. Dave Genova,
Interim General Manager, reiterated that the current
recommended action is for the approval of the contract.
Director Deadwyler said she was afraid of what staff would
request next month regarding this project. She asked staff to
streamline the process and request all the particulars for one
project at the same time.
Director Archuleta asked what the estimated installation time
for each printer would be and if it would affect services. Eric
Farrington replied that the estimated time is four (4) hours. He
added that installation would be done during off peak hours
without disrupting service.
Director Lasater agreed with Director Deadwyler in that the
request seemed confusing. He wondered if the current
request was on top of the $1.9 million budget transfer.
Heather Copp replied that the $2.7 million outlined in the
recommended action is the amount for all the elements of the
project, including $1.9 million for the actual cost of the
printers. Director Lasater noted that it would be helpful to
clearly note that the $1.9 million was embedded in the $2.7
million contract amount as it is difficult to study such large
amounts of information line by line.
Director Solano asked staff to explain the timeframe as it
seemed confusing. Heather Copp replied that the $1.9 million
budget transfer approved in April was to transfer the amount
from the Certificates of Participation (COPs) from the mall
shuttle to the thermal printers. The mall shuttle line item was
chosen since the procurement for the buses was delayed due
to a lack of vendor. The plan is to ask the Board to issue
additional COPs in July, 2015 in order to replenish the amount

Farrington, Information Technology (IT) Program Manager,
replied that he is 85% positive that the deadline will be met.

transferred. Director Solano said he had further questions he
would take offline.

Regarding the completion of the project, Committee Vice Chair
Menten asked what factors contributed to the 15% chance of
not completing the project on time. Eric Farrington replied that
the possible factors are timing of manufacturing, delivery, and
installation. He added that he personally has a higher
percentage for completion but would not like to overpromise.
Committee Vice Chair Menten asked if there was anything in
the contract to ensure delivery of product. Eric Farrington
answered that there are no financial penalties; however, the
contractor is very motivated to do a good job so they continue
to have RTD as a reference.

• Approval of Contract for External Audit Services
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager to execute all
documents necessary to award a contract to RubinBrown, LLP to perform
RTD’s annual external audit services. The contract is awarded for audit
services for calendar years 2015, 2016 and 2017 in the amount of
$333,500. There is an option to extend the contract for two additional one
year periods, at RTD’s discretion, in the amount of $239,500.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the June 16, 2015
Board meeting.
Director Walker seconded the motion.

Packet Pg. 33

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 9, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson asked staff to confirm that the current
recommended action is to issue the contract. The recent
budget transfer was meant to borrow money as the mall
shuttle line item will be refilled when staff comes back to the
Board to issue more COPs. Heather Copp affirmed that was
correct.

6.E

Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer, noted that staff
received five (5) responses from the Request for Proposal
(RFP) process. The evaluation committee recommends
RubinBrown, the current auditors, for calendar years 2015,
2016, and 2017 with the option for an additional two year
extension.
Committee Vice Chair Menten asked staff to elaborate on the
value of auditors having a fresh view versus someone that has
been looking at our system for years. Heather Copp replied
that RubinBrown has a practice of rotating auditors. Staff
feels confident that RubinBrown, as a company, has the
expertise we need to do an objective job.
Committee Vice Chair Menten said she will be voting yes on
the recommended action; however, she emphasized that staff
ask RubinBrown to provide the audit documents electronically
ahead of the presentation in order for the Directors to study
the documents and be prepared for a robust discussion.

• Approval of 2015 Amended Budget
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2015 to amend
and appropriate funds for the proposed 2015 Amended Budget, to increase
the appropriation by $134.670 million to $1,520.186 million as detailed
below in the overview of the 2015 Amended Budget, and to decrease the
appropriation of Capital Carryforward (previously approved capital funds) by
$315.917 million to $987.198 million.
This action item meets policy requirements and the General Manager’s goals
of Fiscal Sustainability/Financial Plan by effecting current budgeting in a
timely manner.
The 2015 Amended Budget appropriation includes the amounts in the
Amended Budget column below (in thousands), which is a summary of
relevant data from Exhibit I.

C. Updates

• 2016-2021 Strategic Budget Plan Update
Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager for Budget and Financial Analysis,
reviewed the 2016-2021 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) presentation included
in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet for June
9, 2015. The presentation included SBP variables, revenue assumptions,
expenditure assumptions, reduced/eliminated/deferred projects, cash flow
summary for Base System Capital and Operations, 2016 sources of funds,
2016 uses of funds, opportunities and challenges, and next steps.
She noted that all projects are measured against RTD’s mission statement in
order to decide which projects will be reduced, eliminated, or deferred.
Using this methodology the gap was reduced from $26 million to $12
million.
Director Lasater asked for clarification on how $14 million was reduced from
the gap. Jannette Scarpino replied that $8.5 million was reduced from
deferred projects, $3.5 million from duplicative projects when compared to
the FasTracks Annual Performance Evaluation, and $2 million in project
reductions.

Committee Vice Chair Menten asked about the mall shuttles as
we currently do not have a provider. Dave Genova, Interim
General Manager, said RTD is actively pursuing a provider.
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations,
added that RTD is evaluating proposals from two vendors.
Staff hopes to come to the Board in August with a
recommendation.

6.E

Director Anderson asked for the Sources of Other Income making up 8.3%
on the 2016 Base Sources of Funds pie chart included in the presentation.
She asked if the source was advertising. Jannette Scarpino replied that
advertising was part of it. Other sources include rentals, joint ventures,
Intergovernmental Agreements, etc. Director Anderson shared that she was
contacted by a constituent who was offended by one of the advertisements.
She noted that in the overall picture advertisement revenue does not seem
to be a great source, but it would be a significant amount if we had to find
more revenue to fill that gap. She appreciated staff’s work on balancing the
budget.
Director Bagley asked regarding the process for the 2015 projects deferred
to 2016 and if any of them have been deferred from 2016 to 2017.
Jannette Scarpino replied that she did not remember of the top of her head.
Director Bagley said that he would get the details of those projects offline.
Committee Vice Chair Menten asked regarding the Passenger Fares
percentage on the 2016 Base Sources of Funds pie chart included in the
presentation. She wondered if the figure, which is represented at 17.5%,
was adjusted since it is usually in the low 20’s. Jannette Scarpino replied
that the low 20’s figure is based on a different calculation which includes
passenger fares, Sales and Use Tax revenue and grant revenue. The pie
chart in the presentation is total sources not limited to operating revenue,
making the fare revenue a bit smaller.

• April 2015 Monthly Financials
Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer, noted that the Monthly Financial
report includes a new column which shows the actual versus budget
numbers both for the month and year to date. She said that feedback on
the new format is welcomed.
Doug MacLeod, Controller, reviewed the April 2015 Monthly Financial
Status as included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
agenda packet for June 9, 2015. He pointed out that all the items showed
an increase except for ridership and fare revenue within the April 2015
actual versus budget and Year-to-Date 2015 actual versus budget.

Chair Sisk thanked Jannette Scarpino for her presentation. He asked when
staff would pull the trigger on the 2016 diesel prices. Dave Genova, Interim
General Manager, replied that there is an ongoing conversation regarding
diesel prices between himself, Procurement, and Finance. He said the team
is advising to wait a little longer to lock the price. Chair Sisk stated that we
currently do not lock regular gas prices. Dave Genova affirmed the
statement saying that the diesel is the main fuel used; regular gas is used on
the RTD vehicle fleet. Chair Sisk asked to see an analysis of regular gas
uses.

6.E

Director Anderson noted that it seems ridership is lower due to lower gas
prices. She observed that this seems to be a trend over the years. Doug
MacLeod noted that year to date ridership is up and the lower than budgeted
ridership for 2015 is not a significant drop, indicating it is hard to tell what
drives ridership.

Director Bagley commended staff on the new methodology of the report as
it gives a simple and comprehensive at-a-glance look at what’s going on.
Committee Vice Chair Menten thanked staff for the new version of the
report. She noted that no information was eliminated and that it sounds like
everyone is happy with the improvements.

• Smart Media Technology (SMT) and Day Pass Printer Status
Kim Heldman, Senior Manager for Information Technology, reviewed the
Smart Media Technology (SMT) and Day Pass Printer Status update as
included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet

order to achieve the following goals:
 Technology changes
 Card distribution and logistics
 Merchant arrangements
 Training
 Marketing campaigns
 Updates to the ticket vending machines and platform validators
 Changes to financial systems to accommodate fare changes

Director Walker pointed out that the report’s new format is very helpful. He
asked staff if it was helpful to them. Doug MacLeod acknowledged that
putting the report together takes a little more work; however, the outcome
of a more user friendly, quick snapshot format is what staff is striving for.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, introduced Kevin
Boland, Director of Operations for Fare Collection USA for Xerox
Transportation Solutions, and Jenn Masak, Denver based Project Manager
for Transportation, Central and Local Government for Xerox Transportation
Solutions.
Bruce Abel addressed the question posed at past meetings of a fallback plan
if Stored Value is not available on January 1st. He stated that part of the
implementation strategy and not so much as fallback is to still have available
the 10 ride ticket books and paper transfers during the soft launch and until
a robust network is in place for customers. He added that the printers are
critical in order to implement the Day Pass.
Director Archuleta asked what the sale price will be for the Stored Value
card. Bruce Abel replied that initially it will be free of charge to help people
shift from paper and cash media. Staff anticipates charging for the card
later as an incentive to reuse and reload the card. Currently there is no
recommendation on how long the free period would last. He added that the

Kim Heldman noted that the total project had a budget of $26,440,705.57
with an actual expenditure of $16,873,867.26, leaving a remaining budget
of $9,556,838.31. She noted that the contract with Xerox is for
$21,889,000.53. The amount paid to Xerox so far is $13,892,213.61 with
a remaining budget of $7,996,786.92. She added that Xerox is paid when
milestones in the project are reached.

Chair Sisk thanked staff for the progress made on the SmartCard project.
He shared how perplexed he is at how long the project has taken since
SmartCards are not a new product on the market. He mentioned that during
his time in London he used the Oyster Travelcard very effectively. He added
that RTD needs to have such technology available soon. Bruce Abel noted
that staff has been very deliberate in rolling out the Stored Value card. He
said that RTD went live with the current operating pass system on January
1, 2013. The system was not prepared to deal with the annual renewals
due to volume and capacity constraints. Staff wanted to address the
capacity issue before moving forward in order to get it right when
interfacing with tens of thousands of customers.
Director Lasater referred to the elements of Stored Value and Stored Value
Internal Portal/Back-Office Enhancements, both with a yellow status, in part
due to potential timing of availability of Xerox personnel. He said that he
found it highly substandard that Xerox personnel would not be available due
to European’s vacation schedules. He finds it atrocious that an organization
the size of Xerox does not build personnel vacations into their programming
schedule. He added that in his personal business he deals internationally
writing technology, and his company is more responsive to customers.
Bruce Abel noted that RTD staff factors personnel availability into the work
as a large amount of personnel is based in France and follows the local
vacation custom. He added that this factor does not have a long term
impact on the project. Director Lasater said that it does have a long term
impact on the project because a majority of the personnel is not available for
a month. Kevin Boland affirmed that the majority of Xerox’s personnel
based in France takes the month of August off. Xerox has been proactive in
moving jobs to other countries in order to account for that. Director Lasater
asked how long Xerox has had this contract. Bruce Abel replied that RTD
has been working with Xerox on this project since mid-2010. Director
Lasater wondered if the project would be closer to completion if the
personnel gap would have been addressed earlier. Bruce Abel answered that
he did not think so due to the capacity constraints encountered. Director
Lasater asked if the capacity constraint was a flaw on Xerox’s part or RTD’s
part. Bruce Abel replied that the relationship with Xerox is a partnership
thus the responsibility is shared. Director Lasater found it hard to believe
Xerox did not anticipate the capacity constraint since they have experience
with Stored Value cards.
Director Hoy encouraged staff to be selective of whom the friends and
family are for the proof of concept operational test. He noted that they
Packet Pg. 43

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 9, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

card itself costs about a dollar to manufacture. Director Archuleta asked if
retailers would receive a percentage of the card sales. Bruce Abel replied
that staff is currently involved in that conversation.

6.E

could serve as ambassadors for the program if they have a positive
experience.

Director Anderson thanked staff for ensuring that every customer that will
interface with the SmartCard will be taken care of by working on the volume
capacity. She asked staff to provide the potential volume projections at a
later date.
Committee Vice Chair Menten noted that merchants, such as King Soopers,
will receive a financial hit on the credit card processing fee for Stored Value
Card transactions. She wondered if processing fees posed a challenge when
working with smaller selling outlets. Kim Heldman replied that staff is in the
process of discussing compensation for absorbing the processing fee costs.
Heather Copp added that King Soopers would not disclose what the
processing fee is. Staff can estimate it to be between 1%-4%.
Committee Vice Chair Menten wondered about Xerox experience with ADA
compliance and how the variations between countries would affect that
process. Bruce Abel replied that Xerox will have to meet RTD’s ADA
standards. Committee Vice Chair Menten wondered how a sight impaired
person would be able to distinguish the SmartCard from other cards. Bruce
Abel said he did not know how they would be able to do so. Committee
Vice Chair Menten thanked staff for meeting with her earlier to answer her
other questions about the SmartCard project.
Director Solano asked what the process would be to recover the value
stored in a lost card. Kim Heldman replied that the fully functional web
portal would allow for customers to register their card in order for cards and
values to be reissued. Director Solano wondered if the process to reissue a
Stored Value card would be similar to reissuing a credit card. Kim Heldman
said that was correct.

D. Other Matters
Committee Vice Chair Menten announced that the General Manager Executive
Search public feedback form is available through the RTD website.

options and suspects that most will gravitate towards the new media. He
added that having both available makes him feel better about the transition.

B. Recommended Actions

• August 2015 Service Changes
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the August 2015 Service Change package as
revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of
approximately $279,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or
his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private
operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
Motion:

Director Lasater made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the June 16, 2015
Board Meeting.
Chair Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
reminded the Board that staff presented their initial set of
recommendations last month prior to taking them out to public
comment. He asked Jessie Carter, Manager of Service
Planning and Scheduling, to review the proposed changes with
the Board which were highlighted in yellow in their packet.
Jessie Carter noted that there were 7 public hearings, but
there was not a large number of attendees. He said this is
largely due to the nature of the proposed service changes as
there were not many that were controversial. He shared that
there were 76 comments through the website, about 40 of
which regarded proposed changes to the 16/16L.

Packet Pg. 47

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 9, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley participated via phone. Director Lasater left early. Director Folska,
Director Francone, Director Lubow, and Director Tobiassen were absent.

Jessie Carter noted that these changes come not only from
public input but continued analysis done by staff. He
reviewed the following changes to the initial recommendation:
 Route 9 – West 10th Avenue: extend selected morning
peak trips to 31st and Brighton to relieve overloads
currently affecting Route 48.
 Route 15 – East Colfax: originally staff was proposing
eliminate the deviation into the Anschutz-Fitzsimons
campus off Colfax, but due to public comment staff is
proposing deviation remain for weekday trips.
 Route 21 – Evans Avenue: staff originally proposed a
reroute onto Jewell Avenue but has since rescinded the
change. When staff went out and physically looked at
the route they realized there was not enough time in
the schedule.
 Route 80 – service change has been rescinded. Staff
needs to evaluate this entire route as ridership is not as
strong as they would like.
 Route 120X – Thornton/Wagon Road Express: add
2:20 p.m. trip due to overloads.
 Route Stampede – CU East Campus: additional midday
trips
 Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride: this proposal slightly
reduces the Call-n-Ride service area
 South Jeffco Call-n-Ride: one Call-n-Ride trip to be
provided in each peak period
Jessie Carter stated that even with changes to the initial
recommendation the cost would remain the same at
approximately $279,000 annually.
Director Deadwyler expressed her appreciation in working with
Anschutz-Fitzsimons on Route 15. She said that even though
there are not a large number of riders, there was a strong
reaction to the change. She thinks once the I-225 Line is
running we might be able to discontinue the deviation at that
time. Jessie Carter believes that is right on-point. Staff had a
great meeting with them, not only about Route 15 but also
about the shuttle they plan to open with the I-225 Line. He
hopes that RTD and Anschutz-Fitzsimons can develop some
synergy between the two.

C. Updates

• US 36 Service Plan
Bruce Abel introduced Nate Diaz, Service Planning and Scheduler on the
North team, who has been heavily involved in the development of the
service plan and outreach process. He said that staff would like to provide a
recap with the process along with feedback staff has received as well as
some of the adjustments made as a result of that feedback. He noted that it
was a slightly different timetable as originally staff wanted to seek Board
approval in June; however, staff wanted the Board to have ample time to
review prior to the request for approval. Since there was not an opportunity
to present the Service Plan at a study session in May staff now plans to
bring the recommendation back to the Board for approval in July. Bruce
Abel reiterated that there had been extensive public outreach throughout the
process.
Nate Diaz reviewed a Power Point Presentation with the Board that is
available in the June 9, 2015 Operations and Customer Service Committee
Agenda Packet. He reminded the Board that the Service Plan Guiding
Principals were:
 Consolidate routes
o Easier for customers to select their bus (less need to consult
timetables)
o Provide regular and spontaneous service frequencies
throughout the day
o More cost-effective service delivery
o Provide frequent, bi-directional service that supports intracorridor travel
 Utilize roadway improvements
o Increase operating speeds

Director Solano asked if staff proposed to extend any routes
to the new St. Anthony’s Hospital. Jessie Carter said not at
this time but it is one staff’s radar. They just recently had a
meeting with Adams County Economic Development as it is
something ACED would like to see as well.

6.F

o

Increase reliability

Nate Diaz pointed out that the current proposal recommends Express
frequency of 10-minitue intervals as opposed to the consultant
recommendation of 15-minute. The current proposal also eliminates the
initial consultant recommendations to reduce local service. He explained
that the service plan represents a 10.5% increase in service hours over
existing service, and, due to taking advantage of roadway improvements,
will actually result in a 16.6% increase in the number of trips. Nate Diaz
also noted that the frequencies proposed meet or exceed those outlined in
the US 36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition memo.
Nate Diaz explained that the staff recommendations exceed the initial
funding identified for the US 36 BRT Corridor but are warranted. Staff
recommends closely monitoring service needs in the corridor as service
begins and making changes as warranted.
Bruce Abel stated that as staff looked at the transportation needs of the
corridor, they have moved forward with developing a recommendation that
exceeds the budget in the early years. He said the next steps are to come
back to the Board at the July 7, 2015 Operations and Customer Service
Committee before asking the Board for final approval at the July 28, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Menten inquired if staff anticipated any more changes before the
service plan was brought back to the Board. Bruce Abel stated that this is
staff’s recommendation as it sits today but they do not anticipate any
additional changes. Staff has addressed the feedback that feels warranted
and responded accordingly.
Director Menten asked if increased speed was simply a guiding principle or if
RTD had actually done anything to make the service run faster. Nate Diaz
explained that the roadway improvement in the corridor would allow for
increased speed and more reliable buses. Bruce Abel noted that when staff
references roadway improvements everyone thinks of the managed lanes;
however, part of the roadway improvements allow for bus-on-shoulder
operation for the all stop buses. This allows the buses to bypass traffic in

Packet Pg. 50

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 9, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Nate Diaz said there were 5 public hearings hosted along the US 36 Corridor
having over 200 attendees. Staff received 77 verbal comments, 189
written/email comments and several petitions. This feedback was
incorporated into the service plan if it made sense but there were some
requests that were either not warranted at this time or staff was unable to
do due to costs.

6.F

Director Menten expressed confusion about Route 209. Originally staff
proposed eliminating the route due to poor ridership of about 5 boardings per
day; however, now staff is recommending the route remains in service.
Nate Diaz said that Boulder objected to the route elimination because it
provides service to a retirement community. Bruce Abel explained that staff
is taking a more systematic approach to Route 209. He stated that on its
own it is not a strong route but perhaps with the increased connectivity
from BRT the service will grow. Staff feels it is a route that needs to be
monitored but it was not the appropriate time to recommend the reduction.
Director Menten expressed that she does not agree. Looking at ridership in
2013 Route 209 had 13.5 boardings per hour and now it is down to 5 per
day. Nate Diaz explained that the 5 boardings per day is simply on the
portion of Route 209 that was proposed to be eliminated, which was south
of Baseline Road. Jessie Carter stated that overall performance for the route
is still at around 13 boardings per day.
Director Deadwyler said this recommendation makes her heart flutter. In her
opinion it is quite a wish list. She knows that those in her District would
sure like additional service as their buses come at a very low frequency.
She asked for a breakdown of how much this exceeds the allocated budget.
Bruce Abel said he would really use the term front loaded. Initially the
budget would grow more slowly in the beginning years with a later growth
spurt. Staff has recommended front loading it $300K in 2017, $120K in
2018 and in 2019 the cost will be back in sync with the established budget.
Director Deadwyler wondered where the increase in funding was coming
from. She understands that the budget comes out of FasTracks but when
staff is talking about increasing service so much she wonders if it must
come out of our operating budget. Bruce Abel stated that FasTracks has
both a capital and operating budget; all funding for US 36 BRT would come
from the FasTracks operating budget. Director Deadwyler said that she is
very concerned about this being over budget. She asked if the rest of the
system would suffer because of this. Bruce Abel stated no. Director
Deadwyler wondered if the budgets were exceeded for any of the other lines
opening in 2016. Bruce Abel explained that the service plans for those lines
had not yet been developed.
Chair Sisk thanked the staff for all their hard work. He really appreciates the
time they have spent on this plan. He reminded the Directors that this is
really the only FasTracks line that serves the Northwest area. He
remembers shortly after the West Line opened when the Board was then
asked to approve over $1 million on service increases. He believes this is a
Packet Pg. 51

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 9, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

highly congested periods when they could not weave in and out of traffic to
the stops and back to the managed lanes.

6.F

Director Hoy commented that this is a dynamic plan that keeps changing
subtly; however we are coming down to the wire and at some point staff
just needs to say this is the plan. He recognized the plan keep Route AB
service for a short period of time. He noted that staff said only 75 people
take that bus but to him that seems like a lot of people. He said that to
those that ride the route it is their universe. He asked staff to keep that in
mind.
Director Hoy expressed his concern over increasing the express buses
because every time a bus leaves from Boulder and blows right through
Westminster people cannot get on or off; however, he recognizes that the
challenge then is really the budget. Director Hoy thinks that staff is
recommending a plan that is really workable. Bruce Abel pointed out that
service planning is not a science but an art. He said Director Hoy really
articulated the balance that staff is trying to achieve. Staff feels very
comfortable with the balance that has been struck.
Committee Chair Anderson thanked staff. She believes they have struck a
fine balance. She recognized that every Director wants more service for
their area; no one would ever say they had too much service. She thinks
staff has done a good job in responding to the concerns for Chair Sisk’s
community.

commitment to the entire District. RTD promised a robust BRT system and
it is critical that we deliver. He said this is not a wish list so much as about
creating a successful BRT for this area and RTD. He noted that not
everyone is getting what they wanted as is evident from the letter the
Directors received from the University of Colorado but the plan as is really
makes good sense. He thanked staff again for the work they had done.

Paula Perdue shared there is an issue that is surfacing that is
more for the GM Executive Search Committee but she wanted
to communicate to the Executive Committee so they can be
clear on the process. The process followed by the GM
Executive Search on inquiries or people wanting to apply is
that all this will be channeled through the Executive Search
Firm who will do the screening, etc. This is to maintain
fairness and equity in treatment across the board and that no
one person is perceived to have an unfair access to Board
members or advantage. All of the input from the listening
sessions, focus groups, CAC meeting, and the input from the
Board will be funneled into a candidate profile that will be used
by the Executive Search firm. Right now she is holding all
inquiries or communications in the Board office until the
Executive Search firm is hired, targeted around July 7th. Board
members should continue to refer interested parties to her
until the Executive Search firm is hired. This process allows
the Board members to have clean hands and ensure everyone
is treated equitably.
Director Hoy commented it is important that we set the
expectations for day pass printers on day 1. Interim General
Manager Genova noted they are having these discussions.
Interim General Manager Genova indicated he will have several
items to share under the General Manager Report. One such
item is the Clinton Global Initiative which Marla Lien, General
Counsel, participated in this week.
Director Walker noted he will be doing an update on the APTA
Board seminar under old business.

incorporate these types of forums with the employees
periodically throughout the year. Chair Sisk commented that a
common theme has been silos and communications. The
employees expressed appreciation for the Board members to
offer these listening opportunities. Interim General Manager
Genova added that he has heard similar messages as well in
the employee strategical survey and that staff is addressing
this issue.

Unanimous Consent

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to enter
into a $2,700,000 sole source contract with INIT Innovations in Transportation,
Inc. (INIT) for purchase, integration and installation of equipment and software
necessary to accommodate the sale of day-pass fare media under the newly
adopted fare structure (Contract Number 15DH072). This contract will include
integration with the Computer Aided Dispatch/ Automatic Vehicle Location
(CAD/AVL) system, interface changes for the new fare structure, parking pass
validation and a 3-year extended warranty.
C.

Approval of Contract for External Audit Services

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager to execute all documents
necessary to award a contract to RubinBrown, LLP to perform RTD’s annual
external audit services. The contract is awarded for audit services for calendar
years 2015, 2016 and 2017 in the amount of $333,500. There is an option to
extend the contract for two additional one year periods, at RTD’s discretion, in the

D.

August 2015 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the August 2015 Service Change package as revised
and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of approximately
$279,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.

Director Walker shared he will be meeting with the Urban Peak organization which
is located in his district to talk about fares. He considers this a listening session.
Interim General Manager Genova shared three things:
o The MAX group will be meeting during the same time as the APTA Board
Seminar. They will be having events including inviting Chair Sisk to do a
welcome on July 20 which is a conflict with the APTA session.

Meeting with Affordable-income taskforce—The staff has met with the
leader for Mile High Connects who appears to have a different perception of
the commitments made by RTD. Staff will continue to work on gaining
clarity and understanding of how we can partner together with this
taskforce. Director Hoy conveyed his position that while RTD is willing to
work with these organizations to provide options for the transit-dependent
poor, RTD does not have a coffer to finance these subsidies. Chair Sisk
added this is a complicated issue and that while our objective is to work
with these organizations, he sees it more as issues affecting how to improve
the distribution channels of our low-income fare program. We need to
separate out the structure issues from this next phase dealing with this.
Director Walker commented his concern is in using percentages as that gap
could widen over time. He referred to the King County model that does not
use percentages.
o Interim General Manager Genova shared that RTD will have lots of visibility
at the APTA Rail Conference. A number of staff members will be presenters
and RTD will receive the APTA Gold Award for safety. The two Board
members in attendance (Anderson and Bagley) will be asked to accept these
awards along with staff on behalf of the agency. He will be there but will
leave early to attend the CDOT event on Monday.
Chair Sisk referenced the CDOT opening and stated that he and Paula have been in
discussion about protocols when an event is in a respective district. In this case,
this is not a RTD hosted event but a CDOT event and he was contacted directly by
CDOT as the Chair of the Board. Nevertheless, we need to be clear on our
protocols for including Board members on events occurring in their respective
districts. This will be most important for the 2016 opening. Paula Perdue added
that while some of the events may not be hosted by RTD, this is an opportunity for
our PI department to help communicate to these other organizations that we do
have protocols and to suggest we should include the Directors representing these
respective districts.
Director Walker shared that former General Manager Washington had invited him to
be a member of the APTA Nominating Committee and he will be attending a
meeting around August 21 or 22.

recognize the following winners:
Bus International Participants
John Johnson (RTD – 12th Place)
Abniger EK Chan (First Transit – 6th Place)

Honorable Mayor Applebaum, City of Boulder and US 36 Mayors and Commissions
Coalition (MCC), shared that initially the MCC had some concerns about the original
fare proposal related to equity between bus and rail; however, the RTD staff took
the MCC’s concerns seriously and addressed them in the revised proposal before

the Board this evening by making bus and rail equitable. The MCC recognizes that
there is still more work to be done for US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) as well as
arterial BRT in the future. Mayor Applebaum also acknowledged the next phase of
the fare study that would look at the pass programs, which will be of high interest
to Boulder. He said on behalf of the City of Boulder and MCC, he thanks RTD and
continues to look forward to working together in the future.
Dianna Janda thanked RTD for the extremely fine bus drivers. She shared that she
often calls in compliments because these drivers care about their fellow man. They
are observant of the people outside their bus and they wait when they see
someone is trying to catch the bus. She stated there has not been any time that a
passenger has had an issue with waiting as everyone has been racing to catch a
bus at least once. However, she also calls to complain about the bad bus drivers
who do not wait or open their doors when someone is right there. The time of the
people that ride RTD buses is worth something too. She stated that drivers do not
have a right to ignore passengers trying to get on the bus. She said that bus stops
should also be realigned so that drivers can see the other buses that are nearby and
know if they might need to wait for transfers from the other buses.
Tom Grushka, Highlands Ranch, stated that he is legally blind and wearing a hat
because he is sensitive to light. He has been dependent on RTD as his means of
transportation for many years. He said that he has been working on a documentary
since 2011 when RTD had a $20 million service cut during the recession but still
made a $17 million loan to the Crawford Hotel and Denver Union Station. Tom
Grushka expressed concern that RTD is using public funds for things other than
transportation. He informed everyone that there are eight seats on the Board up for
election next year. If the Directors are not representing the citizens they need to be
replaced. He said that the fare structure is inequitable and staff has not been
truthful with the Board about the public’s feedback. He wondered if anyone on the
Board had read the full 700 page transcript from the fare study public hearings. He
stated that $2.60 is outrageous and an economic injustice. This will destroy low
income riders and bus service will be cut anyway as RTD will lose ridership.
Mary Grushka, Highlands Ranch, said that she must respectfully disagree with the
Mayor of Boulder. The fares the Board is being asked to approve tonight are not
equitable. She sees that some of the light rail fares are going down or staying the
same while all the bus fares are going up. She stated that the riders that depend
on RTD are the riders that use the buses. She does not see how the Board can
justify these increases. RTD is hitting the ones that require RTD the most.
Linda Meric, National Executive Directors of 9 to 5, stated that 9 to 5 is a national
membership organization of women in low wage jobs working to improve policies
on workplace fairness. She noted that affordable and equitable transportation is a
necessity. Many communities lack access to affordable transportation that
provides access to jobs, schools, childcare, healthcare, etc. and this is particularly



true for low income communities, communities of color and communities with
disabilities. She said that the current RTD fare structure is unaffordable to many in
our community, forcing people to choose between a meal and transportation. The
proposal before the Board this evening takes us in the wrong direction, making
public transportation less affordable and less accessible to those that need it the
most. She urged the Board to vote no and begin immediate conversations on an
affordable, income based fare structure.
Hanni Raley, The Arc of Aurora, is an advocate for the intellectually and
developmentally disabled community. Many of the individuals The Arc of Aurora
serves are completely reliant on government assistance, are low income and
completely reliant on public transportation. They have been reminding the
community that without transportation, a group of individuals that have fought for
decades for community inclusion will essentially be re-institutionalized. She stated
that the community has been asking RTD to not institute a fare increase unless
simultaneously instituting a low income pass and Non-profit Agency Reduced Fare
program overhaul. But, the Board has already heard this. The Board has heard
from the families that will be forced to decide between medical care and food. The
Board has already heard that paratransit riders already cannot afford the fare. The
Board has heard from College and EcoPass riders ready and willing to increase their
fees to balance the increase. She stated that everyone knows there are better
ways to meet common goals and the Board has heard this; however, listening is
not an outcome but the first step to effectively achieving outcomes with real and
meaningful community engagement. Hanni Raley thanked the Directors who are
fighting for their constituents and been active in the fare study process. She hopes
the Board will slow this down so at the end of the process everyone can be proud
of how we treat our neighbor.
Andrea Chriboga-Flor, 9 to 5, is a transit organizer. She is here to share the story
of a 9 to 5 member, Claire, who cannot attend due to the curfew of her homeless
shelter:
Claire was forced to flee her home with her son, leaving all their belongings behind,
due to an abusive boyfriend. Claire said that she stays at the shelter because she
gets bus tickets. If she leaves the shelter then she no longer has access to these
tickets and cannot get to work or get her son to school. She feels bad when she
takes these tickets because it means someone else is not getting them. There are
many people that want to work but they cannot get a pass. Clair said the system
is not working. There has to be a way so people are not always searching for the
tickets. Claire said she is begging the Board to vote no on a fare hike and come up
with a way for her to buy her own tickets. Once she has a stable job she would be
proud to pay full price.
Andrea Chriboga-Flor urged the Board to listen to the stories they are hearing about
what a huge impact a fare increase will have on Denver residents.

Zoë Williams, 9 to 5, is a transit organizer who first stood before the Board on
February 18, 2014, asking RTD to create an affordable fare and pas system. She
said that she did not know that a fare study was being launched but she knew that
people were struggling. The Board has heard testimony that the fare proposal is
unfair, unjust and a significant burden. This dramatic increase in fares comes at a
time when one-quarter of workers in Denver earn less than $12 per hour. She said
there is a rental crisis in which monthly housing costs have increased over 11%.
Zoë Williams stated that without riders RTD is just a fleet of empty buses and
trains. RTD needs the community as much as the community needs RTD and it is
shameful that the Board has forgotten that.
Joe Thomas, Colorado Jobs for Justice, works with the working class people to
help them improve their lives. He wanted to bring the story to the Board from one
of his members who is ill and cannot travel.
His member had an EcoPass once. He was working at a job Downtown and his
company paid for it. He had enough money for food and medicine. The EcoPass
was a small thing but it meant a lot to him. Then he got hurt and could not work
that job any longer. He was faced with the decision to get a job Downtown that
paid less or at the DIA that paid more but he could not afford the fare to get to
DIA.
Joe Thomas stated that there is a better way RTD can operate. He noted that he
has heard these types of stories so many times. He expressed concern that not
many Board members attend the public hearings and staff has not passed on the
overwhelming consensus that the public does not need a fare hike but an income
based fare. He urged the Board to not only vote no on the fare structure because it
is inequitable, but to listen directly to their constituents in the future.
Reverend Anne Dunlap shared that she is a United Church of Christ Minister
working on racial and economic justice in the Denver metro area. She said that not
only would the fare increase be a hardship on her family as they depend on public
transportation but it would be especially difficult for low income people with whom
they do their ministry. She said that as a clergy member she is here this evening to
ask the Board what side they are on. Denver is becoming notorious for being an
unaffordable place for hard working folks. She wonders if the Board will do what is
fair and just for those in the community or if they will make life harder and harsher
for those that work so hard and make so little. She encouraged the Board to vote
against the fare increase.
Richard Pollizi, Littleton, has lived in Colorado for over thirty years after coming
back from a brief move to Chicago. He expressed his disappointment that the law
in Colorado does not prohibit drunks, prostitutes, pimps, etc. from riding public
transportation. He noted that young children ride the light rail and get exposed to
all kinds of trash. He believes that whoever designed the light rail did not have old
people in mind as they have to walk long distances at the stations.

Elizabeth Murphy said she works with Community Enterprise, a non-profit that
works in South Adams County. She recognized that the community is aware of the
potential risks related to development around light rail stations, especially since the
expansion is happening in low income areas; therefore, it is crucial that they are
able to use RTD’s services. RTD fares and passes are already unaffordable. She
stated that equality and affordability cannot be an afterthought. She encouraged
the Board to vote no until a low income pass is incorporated.
Lee Ann Gott, Aurora, came to speak about the effect of the fare increase on
people with mental disorders. Her daughter works for the Mental Health Center of
Denver (Center). She said that when they were discussing the fare increases her
daughter expressed her concern about her clients being able to travel to the Center.
Individuals with severe mental disorders often cannot hold down regular jobs but
their disorders can be controlled with medication and support provided by the
Center. In order to get that support they must travel to the Center and they rely on
public transportation for this. She shared that their bus passes are already a big
chunk of their monthly public assistance; not only will the increase be a hardship
for these clients but may prevent them from going to the Center for their
medication.
Daniela Villareal, Aurora, is a community organizer with Rights for All People. She
is here to speak out not in support of the proposed fare structure. She noted that
she is not a rider of RTD but that does not mean she does not support those who
are RTD dependent. She believes that as elected Board Members they should be
supporting the community’s best interest and increasing the fare is not fair. She
was disgusted to learn that low income riders were being called income challenged.
She urges the Directors to sit down and talk to their constituents that really need
RTD to be affordable and equitable.
Gina McAfee with US 36 Commuting Solutions, an organization of 70 private
sector and 9 public sector members, echoed the comments of Mayor Applebaum.
She said that US 36 Commuting Solutions is very pleased to see how RTD has
responded to the comments they submitted. There was a great deal of concern
about the first proposal having different fares for rail versus bus but the community
is very happy to see that has changed. She thanked the Board for listening to their
comments and making modifications. US 36 Commuting Solutions looks forward
to working with RTD as we move forward with evaluating the Eco and CollegePass
programs as well as the US 36 BRT.
Maggie Gomez, 9 to 5, has been involved with many organizations, many of whom
are here tonight, requesting the Board members represent the needs of the interests
and needs of the community. She pointed out that they have heard that
SmartCards is one way to provide discounts but this is still not equitable.
SmartCards are not easily accessible for many riders but particularly benefit those
with credit cards. She encouraged the Directors to read through the 700 pages of

public comment. She feels that she has tried to contact her Directors but never
hears back. Maggie Gomez stated that equity and affordability cannot be an
afterthought and non-profits cannot be shouldered with the burden of providing
affordability. RTD oversees a budget of over $500 million; if affordability and
equity were a priority RTD could find the funding.
Gretchen Armijo, Community Health Planner with the City of Denver, urged the
Board to add an income based discounted fare similar to RTD’s current discount
program for seniors, students, and people with disabilities. She stated that access
to affordable transportation is a critical element to community health. When fares
rise people are forced to make decisions between transportation, health care, food,
etc. She shared that transit riders get more physical activity per day, one of the
most important factors in reducing the risk of disease. This is important because in
the City of Denver residents making $25K or less per year experience higher
instances of chronic disease. Low income residents often live in communities that
lack resources that are critical to their health and public transportation provides
them with a means to access these services. She pointed out that several other
cities have implemented income based fares and she urged RTD to do the same.
Jackie Parkins, Denver, is an organizer with the Fight for $15 campaign. She
works with employees fighting for fair wages at their jobs. She reiterated how
many hours these employees need to work just to be able to afford the average
apartment in Denver. She knows one gentleman who takes the bus to the plasma
center several times a week just to make ends meet. She is here as a member of
the community who is not income challenged but someone that cares about her
neighbors. She wants to see people able to go to work and doctor’s appointments
without having to choose between that and putting food on the table. She believes
that the fare study is fundamentally unjust and wonders why some Board members
ran for their positions if they do not want to serve the public. She said that she is
begging the Board to vote no on the fare increase.
Martin Martinez, Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, shared that he had been
hearing that Medicaid will cover the increased costs of riding RTD for people with
disabilities but he is here to dispute that. He works with the homeless population
and has several clients that cannot use Medicaid benefits for Access-a-Ride. He
recognized the many people telling the Board the fares are unfair and a class issue.
He said they are just asking that the Board listen before they vote.
Kathleen Bracke, Go Boulder Manager, echoed the comments made by Mayor
Applebaum and Gina McAfee. She appreciates the responsiveness and work done
by RTD staff to address the concerns they raised, particularly in addressing equality
concerns between bus and rail fares. She said that her organization looks forward
to continuing to work with RTD in refining the fare structure for the Pass programs.
Robert Chase, Colorado Coalition for Patients and Caregivers, echoed the calls for
an income based fare structure. RTD needs to address fundamental problems with

its mission. Denver has delegated out essential responsibilities to organizations like
RTD. He said that FasTracks has failed in its task as many Libertarian critics
predicted. FasTracks is not a cost effective system that makes transit affordable in
Denver. He stated that RTD is raising the price the most on those least capable
with dealing with the change. He believes that RTD is lying to the public by
claiming that the bus to Boulder is Bus Rapid Transit. He thinks that RTD needs to
rethink its entire mission.
Erin Bennett, Denver, is the State Director for 9 to 5. She wanted to share a story
about one of their members who cannot attend the meeting because she is at one
of her three jobs.
Her member has been able to survive because she rides buses. She works at a fast
food restaurant, coffee shop and baby sits. Sometimes she rides six routes just to
get to all her jobs. Some days she rides her bike so she does not have to pay for
the bus. She said that she and her son barely scrape by because fares are too
expensive. She has called every place she can think of to see if they can help her
with bus fare but none can. She said that in order to pay for her apartment she has
to work three jobs. If the fare is raised she will not be able to afford to get to all
her jobs and will have to move into a shelter. She thinks this plan probably works
for people that have choices and money left over at the end of every day but that is
not her. It hurts that this is how RTD treats the riders that are on the buses every
day.
Ray Lyall stated that he was speaking on behalf of those that are homeless in
Denver, 42% of which are families. It is ridiculous that RTD is going to raise bus
fares. He cannot believe that RTD paid $17 million to the Crawford hotel. He
asked where he could get an application. RTD needs to do something that will
work.
Marcus Hyde, Denver Homeless Out Loud, helps run a Catholic house of hospitality
for homeless in Downtown Denver. He is watching a city that he loves get ruined.
He is watching rents rise at an extremely fast rate. He is watching wages stay
stagnant. He is watching elected officials pretend to listen to their constituents.
Every morning he watches the homeless people he works with get up and stand in
line to see if they have won the lottery for bus tickets. Then, he watches those
that did not win the lottery pan handle to try to ride the bus to human services to
see if they can get tickets. He said that maybe the Directors do not see this and
are insulated from it but he sees this every day. He stated that what he does know
is that if he was making it harder for homeless people to work or move into housing
then someone should fire him. He suggested the Directors think to themselves “am
I making life easier?” If they are going to raise fares then he expects to see them
doing something productive as well like advocating for a raise in minimum wage or
rent control.

Carrie Craig, Denver, is a program coordinator for Colorado Coalition for the
Homeless. Her organization does participate in the non-profit reduced fare program;
however, they spend a significant portion of their grant funding on transportation
costs. This fiscal year they were hit with budget restraints that have caused them
to reduced transportation assistance for their clients. She does not see the current
non-profit reduced fare program as a viable option. For many homeless that are not
fortunate enough to be in a program that provides transportation assistance, they
often have to go to multiple non-profits and jump through numerous hoops before
getting the basic need of transportation met. This can be very traumatizing to their
clients. She recognized that transportation is often key to quality healthcare and
critical for escaping poverty. She urged the Board to vote no. Fares should not be
raised without simultaneously introducing a low income fare pass.
Brittany Bollenbach, Denver, wanted to underscore that the only reason she is
standing in the back snapping and clapping is so she can show her vote of support
for those who are speaking. She wishes the Board would allow for them to do
that. She is a recent transplant to Denver. She shared that previously she served
on the Board for the New York Public Interest Research Group so she understand
how hard it can be to listen to public comments; however, she underscored the
importance of the Directors at least appearing to pay attention. She uses public
transportation every day. After arriving in Denver and navigating her way through
our highly effective bus system she thanks RTD for continuing to support the
system. However, it is imperative that the fares are not increased and that
transfers are not eliminated. She was recently laid off and recognized that it costs
a lot to take buses to interviews.
Jorge Jimenez, Denver, was here this evening to speak about his own personal
experiences. He said that he is fortunate to have a job even if it is low paying
because it pays the rent. He and his wife both have to work full time jobs in order
to support their family. He rides the bus every day for two hours each way. He
stated that this fare increase is going to greatly affect people like him. He already
has to allocate a large portion of his income to a monthly bus pass and will not be
able to afford one if they fares increase. He said that if he cannot afford a bus
pass he will no longer be able to volunteer and support his community. He asked
for the Board’s help by not increasing rates.
Regan Burd, Co-Chair of 9 to 5 Board of Directors, shared that she has been an
RTD rider for over 10 years. She is trying not to sound angry but that is difficult as
so many people are angry that they must come before the Board begging them not
to make this decision. She does not think the Board has done their jobs and really
looked at the proposal and public comments before them. It is as if the Board is
spitting in the communities faces being more concerned about clapping than
affordable fares. She pointed out that this is not the first time the community has
come to the Board with these concerns. It is shocking that RTD wants to pass an

incomplete proposal that does not address the affordable fares that have been
brought over and over to meeting after meeting. She hopes the Directors that are
planning to vote in favor of the fare increase actually listen to the members of the
community before them today. The Directors should vote no and go back to the
drawing Board because they do not have all the information they need.
Haven Rohnert, Denver, has been involved with the Community for years and
recently became a lobbyist for the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition. He shared
that he is a busy person. He went to work, went home, ran errands, came to the
Board meeting and will still have to stop at the store when he leaves. He stated
that the fare increase is unreasonable, but it is more than just about the money.
Three to four years ago he could catch Route 6 every 15 minutes and now it is only
every half an hour. RTD does not seem to recognize that people’s time is important
too. He is just going to buy his kids a car or carpool if this unreasonable proposal
goes through. He said he is very interested to learn more about the upcoming
elections and will not vote for anyone that approves the fare increase. He
respectfully asks the Board to consider the financial realities of people’s lives.
Jenée Elise rides the bus every day. She said that looking at the Board she does
not see them on her route so it leads her to believe that they do not ride the bus.
She thinks the Board members do not see the young kids taking the bus home from
school. Raising the fares of those that are actually riding the bus is delusional. She
believes it is ridiculous that New York has lower fares than Denver. She asked the
Board to think about those they are affecting. It is the ones who barely have
enough change to get home as it is. It is riders like her that are taking the bus, not
the light rail.
Mary Durant, Lakewood, is here as a community member and concerned citizen.
Over the past few years she has accompanied many homeless youth to court for
fare evasion. The court system was not designed to do RTD’s dirty work. She
said that these tickets can place barriers on our most vulnerable populations. She
has watched youth chose to pay RTD’s fare over medication and healthcare. She
would think that as a community supported entity RTD would be open to helping
the people. She feels that the comments that the non-profit organizations in the
community should foot the bill for a low income pass are offensive and
irresponsible. She stated that RTD can either become a part of this community or
brace ourselves for the impact of a relationship deeply torn. The community will
continue to hold RTD and the Board accountable.
Hajar Ibrahim, Denver, recently moved here from New York. She thinks that
Denver needs to realize that if we are going to be a growing city we need to think
like a larger city. She has heard many touching stories this evening. It is
unbelievable the things people are going through just to get around. She believes
that everyone needs to reevaluate what is happening in Denver. She asked the
Board to think about people less fortunate then they are and the hardships they are

going through. She finds it surprising that the Board would consider raising fares
when the buses are not even on schedule.
Kenny Shepard, Denver, shared that he was in Atlanta several years ago and could
travel for $2.25 throughout the bus and rail system. When he was in Dallas it was
$2.50 to ride from the Airport to Downtown. He thinks that the airport fare is too
high. He asked security to go to the Auraria Station because people are not
scanning their passes. He believes this contributes to RTD needing to increase
fares. He wonders why it is taking RTD so long to build FasTracks when in other
cities it only takes a few years.
Jane Smith stated that she had been at the RTD headquarter since three attending
two other meetings. She said that she will try to be sweet rather than caustic but
it will be challenging. She asked for public comment to be opened again before the
Board voted on the Recommended Actions. She noted that she will come back at
the next meeting to finish her comments if she gets cut off. She has always been
taught to bring a solution to a problem and she was here to do just that. She
pointed out that she was wearing a patriotic t-shirts that read “got democracy?”
that was red, white and blue along with patriotic glasses with flashing red lights
and a blue boa. She will be speaking about public process. She believes it is
apparent that the Board and their predecessors do not fully comprehend how, nor
are they willing to put in the effort, to see that public process is implemented
properly. She referenced the comments of former Board Member Jack McCroskey
about his fellow Board Members that “they have never subscribed to the open
government doctrine that sovereign citizens are entitled to look at all the facts, not
just the pretty ones.” Not only was Jack McCroskey censured for using profanity,
he was also censored, which is a violation of the constitution. This lead to a
lawsuit that RTD lost to the tune of $175K. She believes that many of the
Directors are working toward the same goal and they should know who that is
directed towards.
Judy Von Gaia, Denver, finds it very interesting that so many people speaking this
evening are doing so on behalf of those that cannot be in attendance because of
the cost of taking public transportation or needing to be at their jobs. She is a
special education teacher that works with students with learning, cognitive and
physical disabilities. She would teach them how to take the bus to run errands, get
to jobs, etc. Very often these students do not have the money to afford to do
anything other than take the bus. She is concerned about their ability to continue
to take the bus if fares are increased. She has gone without a car on several
occasions and only taken the bus, but she returned to using a car because the
system did not work very well. She challenged the Directors to only take the bus
for a week or a month; while on the bus they can talk to the people that rely on the
bus to learn how this will really impact them. She thinks the Directors will be
humbled to find out what people go through on a daily basis.

Kathryn Fresquez, Earthlink and Bayaud Enterprises, rides transportation every day.
She was homeless for 8 years and struggled to afford to take the bus. Now she is
not homeless but still works with Earthlink, an organization that assists men and
women get out of homelessness. She said that her organization struggles to give
people bus passes. They partner with Bayaud Enterprises which helps, but it is still
not enough. She advised the Board not to raise fares. It is hard for people that are
mentally, physically and financially challenged. She has seen homeless people not
being able to ride the bus and going hungry. She reiterated that the Board should
not increase the fare.
Susan Townsen, Denver, lives in the Westwood neighborhood. Many of her
neighbors do not have a lot of money to afford the bus, but they pay it because
there is no other way for them to get around. She is a widow that has had to
survive on riding the bus because she never learned to drive. She said that she
pays for an EcoPass through her company but they are not sure if they want to
continue offering them next year due to the fare increases. If she cannot get an
EcoPass through work she cannot afford to ride the bus. She stressed that there
are so many people in her community that depend on the bus. She thanked RTD
for bringing back Route 4. It makes it much easier and quicker to get to work.
Jeanette Vizguerra, Aurora, is a mother of three kids. Sometimes she has to take
three buses just to get from her home to her destination. It is imperative that the
Board understand that people cannot afford increased fares and it is essential that
they have these services. She feels it is very difficult to watch the Board sitting
here, proposing a fare increase when RTD needs to focus on improving our
services. She also expressed concern that RTD does not provide change if the
customer does not have the exact fare. She stated that a fare increase does not
help anyone.
Maricruz Herrera, Denver, asked the Board to take into consideration the Hispanic
community. She has really been trying to listen to everything that has been said
but she has had a hard time because it was not a good translation. She believes
that those that need translation should also get additional time to speak.
She is here as a representative of the Westwood Unidos Community. The
community is grateful that RTD returned Route 4. The community felt that RTD
really took the time to listen and work to meet the needs of the community. She
hopes in this situation RTD can do the same and really consider what they are
presenting. If RTD increases the fares it will be too high. She asked the board to
listen to the community again like they did with Route 4.
Dana Nobles lives in transitional housing. She agrees with the previous speaker
that it is not very equitable that people that need translation only get three minutes
to speak as well. She believes the Board should double that time. She reminded
the Board that she has spoken to the before about what transportation means to
her. It is a lifeline to the community and imperative for people to survive. She

describes transportation as a puzzle piece; a person needs all the pieces to fit
together to gain economic security and the pieces do not fit without transportation.
She shared that she was able to buy a car from her mom and the cost of that car is
the same, if not cheaper, than bus fares now. There is a problem with that,
especially when you look at the burden of riding transit. She believes that RTD
views itself as a for profit business but we are not. She is disappointed that the
Directors were not at other meetings as she would have loved to see them there
listening. It is unfortunate that this is the first time the Directors are listening. She
said that the Directors need to listen to what the public is saying or they will vote
them out.
Dawn Howard, Denver, shared that she is in a unique situation because she has a
neurological disability but she does not qualify for a discount pass. Her concern is
for the other people in her life that depend on public transportation. She is a
community organizer for the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition. She stated that
many people with disabilities live in poverty. She asked the Board to think about
what their life would be like if every time they wanted to go somewhere they had
to make the decision between having dinner or driving your car. It is about
someone’s quality of life and being able to get together with friends. She asked the
Directors to think about the percentage of their salary they spend on transportation
and to try to have some compassion. She implored the Directors to think hard
about their decision because people want the ability to have real, robust lives,
friends, dinners out, etc. She encouraged the Directors to vote no.
Cesar Gevert, Arvada, said that like many of the Directors he does not ride RTD.
He takes public transportation in places like London and Paris, but there the fares
are more affordable. He was raised with wealthy parents. He had lived in 13
different countries and speaks 5 different languages; however, he has only found
poverty in the US. That is when he made the decision to begin working with the
poor. He said that often he has to hold back tears because of the difficulty of their
lives. He believes that many of the Directors will vote for the fare increase. He
does not think they will listen to what the public is saying. He stated that each
Director that votes yes will be shameful. The legacy that they leave for their
children will be a legacy of shame.
Julie Bennett said that she is homeless. She stated that the community needs an
income based fare rather than raising it. If RTD wants more ridership we need to
lower prices. She asked every Director to walk up and down the 16th Street Mall
and see the struggle she sees every day. She said there are people walking 20 and
30 miles a day if they are not lucky enough to get bus tickets. She wonders how
they are supposed to get to and from work when they spend so much of their time
trying to get help with their bus fare. People would rather be working, not chasing
down bus fare. She told the Directors to go outside and look at what is going on in
RTD’s neighborhood. If any of the Directors vote yes they should be fired.

Debbie Brady said that she lives on a very limited income. She reminded the
Directors that they are all public officials working for a publicly financed institution.
RTD gets most of its money from the taxpayers. She asked the Board to prove to
her that they were actually paying attention and not just giving lip service to this
public hearing. She reiterated that people will be hurt by this fare increase. She
said she will vote against every member of the Board that votes for the fare
increase.
Mary Anna Thompson, Denver, shared that she came to Denver four years ago as a
nurse. She came to Denver thinking she could experience four seasons and
contribute to her community. She said when she first came her she thought she
was in a third world country. Now she is in transitional housing and uses public
transportation. She stated that there are a lot of people that do not have $2.25 to
ride the bus but they need to get to The Gathering Place because they have not
eaten. She wonders if the fare increase really makes sense. She said that having
to continually ask bus passes is humiliating.
Bob Wilson, Arvada, came to this meeting to hear the stories and know what is
going on. He recognized that the Board has a very difficult issue in front of them.
They have heard the heartfelt need of the community on one hand but on the other
is the big picture of keeping the buses running. The Board has to balance between
these issues. He shared that he was moved by what he heard but RTD does not
help people if RTD cuts service. He encouraged staff to push forward with
SmartCards. He also asked staff to continue working on a subsidized fare
structure, even if it is imperfect. He thanked the Board for listening to everyone.
He knows that they are caring people.

January 2016 Recommended Fare Policy Changes

Directors approves the recommended fare policy changes, as outlined in Attachment A, to
take effect beginning January 1, 2016.
Motion:

Discussion:

Director Lubow made the motion to approve the
January 2016 recommended fare policy changes.
Director Walker seconded the motion.
Following some audience disruption that resulted in
some members of the audience being escorted out, the
following discussion occurred.
Director Francone thanked the public for their
participation. She stated that the Board members had
listened with keen ears to their issues and requested
they would give equal consideration to what the Board
members had to say. She stated there were several
assumptions made by some of the speakers that were
not correct:

Packet Pg. 81

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 26, 2015 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of May 26, 2015)

Motion:

9.A

The non-profit are footing the bill for the low
income pass program
 Directors do not use public transportation
 Directors do not listen and did not attend the fare
study meetings
 The use of the term “income challenged”. She is
sorry that this may have offended some of them but
she noted that several of the speakers referred to
themselves as income challenged. She would love
to know what the proper reference should be.
Nevertheless, there were some valid points made
around some of the issues with service, and the fare
study being incomplete. We are continuing to grapple
with some of these issues. In the next phase, staff will
be addressing some of the issues raised. Right now,
what we need to do is get the infrastructure in place on
which to build. Staff will continue to work with such
groups as Mile-High Connects on affordable fare
structure options.
Director Solano stated he feels the new fare structure
proposal leaves out the disenfranchised and transit
dependent. As a public servant, we need to listen to
the people. His constituents are saying this will hurt
them. He will be voting no.
Director Lubow expressed appreciation to the public
and all of them who provided comments. She feels this
is democracy in action. She will be voting yes tonight.
This does not mean that she not care for all the
heartfelt stories and comments that were made about
the hardship; it is hard to move forward when 50% of
our riders are low income. We need money to leverage.
RTD has tried to address this crisis. The transfers have
been reinstated albeit by the Smart Cards; she has
learned that a person purchasing a single local fare with
a Smart Card is only paying 10 cents more. When you
consider that RTD has deferred fare increases for about
5 years, the bottom line is we have to keep the buses
running. We will continue to listen and work with the
appropriate organization for possible solutions.



Director Lasater stated that when he joined this Board a
few years back he walked into a hornet’s nest of
cutting service. His District was hit hard and received
limited or no service. RTD looks at our service needs
holistically. We have some very old fleet that breaks
down and takes forever for the constituents to get
home. He recently rode an express from Thornton to
Aurora where his wife teaches at one of the most
deprived schools. They created a “books and toys for
boys and girls” because many of these students could
not afford books. Their parents were transit users and
could not afford to get around. He understands
firsthand the impact of this on families and children.
However, we still need to set the foundation first. The
Board will continue to work with staff on this issue.
We need to be as self-sufficient as possible. He has a
blind gentleman in his district who actually lost service.
The proposal we are considering will at least keep
service in place.
Director Walker stated that he grew up riding the bus
system since he was ten and understands the
challenges of being poor. His household consisted of
seven people who had to share, among other things,
sleeping arrangements. RTD has to make some difficult
decisions. We need to choose between raising fares or
cutting service. He would not want to leave anyone
stranded. His vote is a vote to not take away
someone’s ability to get to work.
Director Folska stated that as a visually challenged
person herself, she understands that transportation is
critical to mobility.
Director Bagley reiterated that there are three phases to
this fare issue. The first two are the fare structure and
rates but phase 3 should look at things like the pass
programs (EcoPass, neighborhood and low-income).
This is really an issue of trying to have a balanced
budget. The first projected fare increase was for 2014

but has been deferred until 2016. We have gone about
5 years without an increase. It costs money to operate
a public transit system and there is no such thing as a
free lunch. As compelling as the comments have been
tonight, he thanks Director Lubow for her work with
the Affordable TaskForce and thanks staff who will
continue to work with this group on options.
Director Deadwyler thanked the members of the
audience for their time spent in this meeting tonight.
She has a similar story as many of them shared-a single
mother raising three girls alone. Even now for her in her
District, she cannot use public transit to get home after
7:00 p.m. She cannot walk that last mile so she gets in
her scooter and moves along. It is about making
sacrifices. She understands the issues. She wants to
speak about the Access-a-Ride. We do not have the
software to implement SmartCard on the Access-a-Ride
vehicles. Staff worked hard to come up with a solution
where they are honoring the discount that the Smart
Card provides with the Access-a-Ride costs. As it is,
the Access-a-Ride costs will go down, not up. It
appears that the income-based requests want RTD to
execute but RTD cannot certify. We are working with
the non-profits to see how this can be done. We need
patience to allow the process to work.
Director James stated he has heard some passionate
appeals tonight. He has heard from many in his
district. It is really a fundamental choice-if we do not
have money to run the system, we must cut the
service.
Chair Pro Tem Tobiassen commented this is one of the
hardest decisions he has had to make since being on
the Board. He reflected on a similar discussion in 2011
when the decision was made to cut the service. This is
the first of many steps. RTD staff is working with Mile
High Connects and the Affordable Taskforce-hopefully
we will be able to come up with solutions. We all need
to be part of the solution.

Director Folska thanked Director Walker for his earlier
comments and indicated that she too could share a
story of being a single mom who was visually impaired.
She knows there are a lot of people who are hurting in
Denver. RTD cannot be the solution to all that ails this
city or nation. It will take cooperation between many
entities. RTD will have a part but not all the burden
can rest at RTD’s feet.
Director Solano restated that raising the fare rates will
cause ridership to go down. Lowering the rates will
increase ridership. This is basic economics.
Chair Pro Tem Tobiassen called for the question.

Videotaping RTD Board Meetings Board Report

It is recommended by the Executive Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
Interim General Manager to implement a system to audio and video record all RTD Board
meetings, committee meetings and study sessions, and post the videos to the RTD
website for public viewing. This action also approves the initial upfront costs not to
exceed $25,000 to purchase and install equipment necessary to record the meetings. In
addition, this action approves funding for a contract technician to facilitate the video
recording at each meeting and an offsite contractor to provide closed captioning services.
These services combine for an estimated not-to-exceed amount of $35,000 a year.

Discussion:

Director Bagley stated we are an agency with over a ½
B operational budget. This proposal would be slightly
less than 3K per month. He feels this is critical to
promoting transparency. We need to provide openness
for people who cannot attend including some of the
individuals who were not able to get here tonight. We
also need accountability for the actions of Board
members and video recording would provide that.
Director Menten recognized that there are lots of
elected officials who are activists and believe in
transparency as she is one of them; however, she
cannot support the motion in its current form. She
believes we should consider putting audio on the
internet and we can get this done at little to no cost.
She is willing to fight for audio. Let’s look at having a
stenographer to transcribe minutes and provide the
audio recording on the internet.
Director Francone seconded Director Menten’s
comments and stated that transparency is important.
Director James indicated he does not see a problem
with moving forward. What’s important is we get
started and move toward more transparency.

Director Walker reminded the Board that RTD will be hosting the APTA 2015 Transit Board
Member and Board Support seminar. He shared that at previous conferences there was
quite a show of interest from other Directors that want to see what Denver is doing. He
hopes all the Directors will support the conference because the attendees are coming to
Denver to find out how we did it. He is looking forward to a great seminar.
Director Bagley mentioned that he recently had the honor to accept an award from the
Downtown Denver Partnerships on behalf of RTD as one of the four members of the
Denver Union Station Project Authority. He said it was his honor to accept this award but
it is really staff’s award for their outstanding work on Denver Union Station.
Director James shared that he had the privilege of accepting an award at the same event
for the Free Metro Ride. He said this service will be a necessity when our new lines open

feel is a good way to respond. We need to have more
conversation around this issue. He is not sure which
way he will vote.

Director Folska noted that many other Directors were in attendance for the event as well.
She thought Director Bagley and James did an outstanding job accepting the awards on
RTD’s behalf but she was bothered that no one introduced Director Archuleta when he
was standing on stage as both projects are in his District.

BACKGROUND
The purpose of this memorandum is to request an amendment to the 2015 Adopted Budget. This
amendment will account for capital carryforward adjustments from year-end 2014 to 2015. The
amendment also will detail other adjustments to the capital budget and adjustments to the operating and
administrative budget.

DISCUSSION
Overview of the 2015 Budget Amendment
The total proposed appropriation for the 2015 Amended Budget and the changes from the 2015
Adopted Budget are summarized in the first set of tables above.
2015 Operating Expense Adjustments
The operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment reflects an
increase of $37.0 million from the 2015 Adopted Budget. This increase consists of $4.2 million on the
Base System, $32.1 million in FasTracks Project/Construction, and $0.8 million in FasTracks Operations
(West Line, Denver Union Station, and Free MetroRide). Of the total increase, $13.7 million is attributed
to previously approved transfers primarily for the FasTracks Eagle and I-225 Rail Line projects, and
$17.3 million is attributed to third-party betterments on I-225 and North Metro projects (funded by
capital contributions). On the Base System, the true increase to operating expenses is less than 1% net
of previously approved transfers and one-time expenses.
Shown in detail on the attached Amendment A, major changes are summarized below.
Base System
Bus Operations
 Net increase of $1.0 million for increases in operator overtime, salaried overtime, operator wages,
expanded DRCOG VanPool Program, and the addition of four adjunct equipment supervisors, one
division supervisor, and one rail scheduler/planner.
Private Carrier Operations
 Net increase of $.067 million for expanded DRCOG VanPool Program.
Rail Operations
 Net increase of $1.0 million for increases in operator overtime, salaried overtime, simulator training
software, repair parts, MOW and SCADA materials and supplies, and SCADA hardware (2015 SBP
project).
Planning-Base
 Net increase of $1.5 million from previously-approved transfers, the addition of one Title VI position
and one TOD Analyst position, TOD assessment incorrectly budgeted in Finance and Administration,
RTD parking study, Continuous Improvement project, and grant-funded STAMP projects (offset by
grant funds).
Capital Programs-Base
 Net increase of $0.639 million from previously approved transfers, Jacobs engineering support, and
Stray Current project.
Safety, Security & Facilities-Base
 Net increase of $0.443 million from increased funding for East Metro Controls project, District Shops
HVAC project, District Shops Mezzanine-Asset Management project, environmental clean-up of
Alameda, snow removal, an emergency project for Security Command Center electrical work, offset
by decreased funding for East Metro Supply Air Units project, and previously approved transfers.

General Counsel
 Net increase of $0.045 million for additional funds for legal services for aviation fuel tax matter
offset by previously approved transfers.
Finance and Administration-Base
 Net increase of $1.3 million from increased IT costs due to conversion of 9 temporary IT employees
to full-time, increased funding for various IT projects and the State audit, funding for Smart Media
RPOS modems, various fees, addition of one Senior Budget Analyst and one Senior Finance Analyst,
offset by elimination of two Senior Accountant position, TOD assessment incorrectly budgeted, and
previously approved transfers.
Communications-Base
 Net increase of $0.496 million for increased funds for Fare Study public meetings and public
awareness advertising, service change advertising, system-wide safety campaign, temporary web
developer for real-time information, and previously approved transfers.
Executive Office
 Net increase of $0.135 million for conversion of temporary employee to permanent in Civil Rights,
additional funds for WIN program training, upgrade of compliance software in Civil Rights.
Board Office
 Net increase of $0.390 million for funds needed for GM search and previously approved transfers.
Non-Departmental-Base
 Net decrease of $2.2 million for over-budget of union bonus.
FasTracks Project/Construction
Capital Programs-FasTracks Construction
 Net increase of $31.4 million for previously approved transfers on Eagle and I-225 Rail Line projects,
third-party betterments on I-225 and North Metro, and additional expense funds on Eagle project.
Finance and Administration-FasTracks Construction
 Net increase of $0.027 million for previously approved transfers.
FasTracks Operations
Rail Operations-FasTracks Operations
 Net increase of $0.763 million for two supervisors for I-225 Rail Line, 20 operators for I-225 Rail
Line, two positions for Commuter Rail.
Debt Service
Interest expense is projected to decline $2.1 million on a combined basis from the Adopted Budget due
to unused debt proceeds from previous debt issues available for use in 2015 on the Base system that
will reduce the amount of planned debt issuance and budgeted interest expense. Principal payments on
debt are projected to decrease $3.5 million for the same reason. Interest expense and principal
payments on FasTracks will remain stable. Capitalized interest is expected to show no change.

Packet Pg. 95

12.A

2015 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed amended budget reflects a net increase of $99.4 million over
the 2015 Adopted Budget. These changes result from program changes that have occurred since the
2015 Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
Base System
New capital changes consist of an increase in Base of $12.7 million. Additions to new capital funding
include $3.8 million added for SmartCard stored value card implementation work and $1.9 million added
for thermal printers for buses, and $5.7 million in restoration of funding for the mall shuttles purchase
that was subject of a budget transfer for the SmartCard activity and thermal printers. Other changes
include $1.2 million in Disaster Recovery funds (budget transfer approved by the Board in April 2015).
Please see Attachment B for detail.
FasTracks
New capital changes to FasTracks consist of an increase of $86.8 million. This results from updated
project schedules for the Eagle and I-225 projects that changed the projected expenditures in 2015,
adjustments for grant funding, changes in cost estimates, and corrections to the Adopted Budget.
Additions to new capital funding include $11.9 million for the East Corridor, $6.9 million for the Gold
Line, $63.6 million for the I-225 Rail Line, $3.4 million for Northwest Rail, and $7.0 million for two new
light rail vehicles for I-225. Please see Attachment B for detail and Program Capital attached.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2015 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/14 were used to compute the
estimate of the carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of the adoption of
the annual budget. For the 2015 Amended Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 12/31/14
were used to compute the estimate of the carryforward. This takes into account expenditures that were
made in the last quarter of 2014.
Previously approved capital carryforward is decreased by $315.9 million from the 2015 Adopted Budget
to reflect fourth quarter 2014 actual expenditures, transfers to reclassify certain capital projects as
expense projects, previously approved transfers, completion of projects, and project scope changes.
The Base System portion is a decrease of $67.9 million and the FasTracks decrease is $248.0 million.
Please see Attachment C for detail and Program Capital attached.
Revenue Changes
In the Amended Budget, revenues are projected to increase $16.7 million on a combined basis from the
2015 Adopted Budget.



Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $16.2 million based on the CU-Leeds
School March forecast of 7.1% vs. 5.9% in the Adopted Budget.
Federal grant revenues, including operating grants, capital grants, capital maintenance, FASTER
grants, CMAQ grants, and other grants are projected to remain stable over amounts projected in
the 2015 Adopted Budget. This reflects a decrease of $12.9 million in allocations on the Base
System in capital maintenance, fixed guideway, CMAQ grants, and carryforward grants from the
2015 Adopted Budget, offset by increases in Bus Facilities funding, FTA Ladders of Opportunity
grants, and certain CDOT grants. FasTracks allocated grants are expected to increase $13.4

Packet Pg. 96

12.A




million due to increases in CMAQ grants for the Eagle project, STAMPS grants, and FASTER
grants for the US36 project.
Fare revenue is projected to remain flat in the Amended Budget over the Adopted Budget based
on current year actuals run rate.
Other income is projected to remain stable at $11.0 million.
Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance

The Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to increase $3.3 million from the Adopted Budget
to $16.0 million reflecting amended budget increases offset by increases in revenue.
FasTracks Contingency Reserve
The proposed 2015 Amended Budget reflects continued maintenance of the FasTracks Contingency
Reserve at a balance of $30 million. This reserve is appropriated annually, and is used to fund any
changes in the FasTracks schedule that could not be forecast at the time of adoption of the annual
budget. The purpose of this reserve is to allow the District to accommodate minor changes to the
FasTracks schedule without requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from the FasTracks
Future Construction Reserve. The Reserve has been carried at $30 million since 2010 and remains at
that level in both this Amended Budget and the 2015 Adopted Budget.
The FasTracks Construction Reserve at $100 million is split between the Construction Reserve at $60
million and a Start-up Operations Reserve at $40 million. The Start-up Operations Reserve was
established in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation for the years 2015-2016 in order to meet the
1.2x debt service coverage if needed.
Budget Transfers
The proposed 2015 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and further amended on 1/1/93, 5/15/08 and
4/1/10. The policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000
require prior approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2015 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.
Fund Balance Policy
The proposed 2014 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2015 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and Unrestricted Year-End Fund
balance in the District's working capital. The objective is for the total of these three funds to equal

Packet Pg. 97

12.A

approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for the Base System and two
months of same for FasTracks. The contributions to the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital
Replacement Fund on the Base System will continue at $3.0 million to each fund in 2015.
Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of principal are treated
as expenditures, and (2) depreciation and gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are
excluded.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Amend the 2015 Budget to reflect the capital project changes and the adjustments to the operating
budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2015 Budget and amend the budget with
revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2015 Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2015 Adopted Budget does
not reflect the capital carryforward adjustments, capital budget adjustments, and material changes to
the operating and administrative budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: June 3, 2015

From:

Heather

GM

Date:

June 3, 2015

Subject:

Authorization to Enter Into Contract with INIT
for Purchase of Day Pass Printers

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: June 16, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to enter into a $2,700,000 sole source contract
with INIT Innovations in Transportation, Inc. (INIT) for purchase, integration and installation of equipment
and software necessary to accommodate the sale of day-pass fare media under the newly adopted fare
structure (Contract Number 15DH072). This contract will include integration with the Computer Aided
Dispatch/ Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) system, interface changes for the new fare structure,
parking pass validation and a 3-year extended warranty.
BACKGROUND
RTD recently adopted a modified and simplified fare structure to be enacted in January 2016. Under the
new fare structure, many transfers are eliminated and a day pass will be offered to customers for
purchase on board RTD buses. The day passes are priced at two times the single fare and would allow
a customer to have unlimited rides during a service day, thereby not requiring a rider to purchase a fare
at each transfer. Paper transfers would no longer be needed.
DISCUSSION
In order to make the day pass widely available to RTD’s patrons, the ability to purchase day passes is
needed at the location where a patron accesses RTD’s services either on buses or at rail platforms. RTD
currently has the ability to sell day passes at rail platforms through ticket vending machines (TVMs) and
at sales outlets but currently does not have the ability to offer day passes to patrons who purchase their
first fare upon entering a bus. In order to offer a day pass on buses, a printer would be installed in each
bus whereby a customer would pay for the day pass through the farebox and the operator would
produce a day pass from the onboard printer. The day pass will be printed on watermarked paper and
would clearly indicate the service day for which it is valid.
In addition to the Day Pass Printer and software, the scope of work for this procurement includes having
the Day Pass Printer also function as a Parking Pass Validation printer. The scope of work includes
driver interface changes to activate the printer and Smart Media Technology (SMT) driver interface
changes required for the new fare structure.
INIT is the company providing our CAD/AVL system. They have onboard printer and software that
meets our needs and integrates with the existing system. These printers are in use by Tri-Met in
Portland, OR and RTD staff saw them in use during their visit to Portland. A sole source justification
memo for this procurement has been prepared and approved by Legal Counsel. This procurement meets
the sole source criteria in the RTD "Procurement Standards Manual" revised September 2014.
Soul Source Criteria: Unique Capability

Packet Pg. 124

13.B

With multiple types of Day Passes anticipated and a need for a daily security code printed on each ticket
that is known to all drivers, but not passengers, customized and centralized pass printing software will
be needed for whatever printer is chosen. INIT has already developed printer software that is
programmable through the central system. No other vendor would be able to provide this type of central
system interface and remote reprogramming of the onboard system. Any other vendor would require
that new ticket information be reprogrammed by visiting each of RTD’s 1045 onboard computers with a
new data file. This level of labor effort is substantial and not properly staffed to be available for this
purpose.
Sole Source Criteria: Duplication of Costs
An onboard computer is needed to create and send a file to print. This computer is already available
onboard from the INIT CAD/AVL system. Providing an additional onboard computer would cost over
$2,200,000 to furnish and install an onboard computer, hardened to operate in a transit environment.
Additionally, a different onboard computer would require information that is available in the current INIT
CAD/AVL system. So, a different onboard computer would need to have an interface developed to the
INIT system. This would require customized software and interface development assistance from INIT.
Past experience indicates that onboard interface development is about 3 months of development work,
which is duplication of cost that is not needed with this sole source.
Sole Source Criteria: Prevention of Acceptable Delay
This is one of the most compelling justifications for a sole source for this project. The Board directs
starting the new fare structure on January 1, 2016. This is only seven (7) months after the Board made
its decision on the new fare structure. Going to a competitive procurement will take at least three (3)
months, and likely longer, to select a contractor, negotiate and execute a contract. Manufacturing and
shipping 1043 printers will take over five (5) months. Even with pre-wiring, installation of 1043 printers
will take an additional month. So, with only 7 months to procure and implement this six-month project,
a competitive procurement is not feasible.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of installing thermal printers on each of the 1,043 revenue buses currently in the
RTD fleet is $1,900,000. This cost includes required software and equipment, as well as the
connections and installation necessary to tie the printers into the RTD network and a 3-year extended
warranty. The estimate for Parking Pass Validation is $20,000 and the estimate for the driver interface
changes is $450,000.
Budget Source
Board Funded from Certificate of Participation transfer authorized May 2015
CAD/AVL funds for interface, integration and new fare policy changes
Facility Maintenance funds for Parking validation
Operating Expenses: spare hardware, 3-year extended warranty and software
maintenance

Amount
$1,900,000
$450,000
$20,000
$330,000
$2,700,000

The Board previously authorized the funding necessary for the purchase of the thermal printer units by
transferring a portion of the Certificate of Participation (COP) proceeds issued in 2013 for the

Packet Pg. 125

13.B

replacement of Mall Shuttles – those Mall Shuttle funds will be backfilled with the 2015 COP issuance
expected to occur in August. Funding for parking validation requirements will come from the Facilities
Maintenance budget. Interfaces changes with the CAD/AVL system will be funded with remaining
budget from the Radio and CAD/AVL Replacement Project. Extended warranty funding will come from
2017 through 2019 Operational Budget. Therefore, there is no need to seek additional funding for this
procurement and no budgetary impact other than the transfer of funds from one project to another.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with INIT in order
to purchase and install the equipment necessary to accommodate the sale of day passes
under the proposed 2016 fare structure. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with INIT
to purchase and install the equipment necessary to accommodate the sale of the day pass.
This action would result in RTD’s inability to procure needed day pass printer equipment in
time to provide the ability for patrons to purchase day passes on buses and avoid multiple fare
payments for transfers. This is not the recommended action.

Contract

for

External

Audit

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to RubinBrown,
LLP to perform RTD’s annual external audit services. The contract is awarded for audit services for
calendar years 2015, 2016 and 2017 in the amount of $333,500. There is an option to extend the
contract for two additional one year periods, at RTD’s discretion, in the amount of $239,500.
BACKGROUND
According to Section 12 of Article VII of the RTD Bylaws, “The Board of Directors shall cause an
examination of the District’s financial statements to be made in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards following the end of each fiscal year. One certified copy of said audit shall be filed
with the office of the State Auditor. The audit shall be performed by an independent Certified Public
Accountant retained by the Board of Directors at the sole discretion for this or any other purpose they
deem necessary. The auditor shall provide a signed auditor’s opinion as to the fair presentation of the
financial position of the District, the results of RTD operations and changes in its financial position for
the fiscal year ended. The Board of Directors shall cause such other audits to be made as it deems
necessary, utilizing the Internal Audit staff or independent auditor as it alone shall determine.” In
addition, the District is required by the Single Audit Act of 1984 and certain debt and lease covenants to
have an independent audit of other selected information. Additional external audit services include an
annual review of information provided for the National Transit Database as well as a review of the
General Manager’s contract.
DISCUSSION
The current RTD contract for external audit services expires on June 30, 2015. RubinBrown is the
incumbent firm and has provided external audit services to RTD for the past four years after an
acquisition of the preceding contractor, Bondi and Co. RubinBrown will continue to rotate audit
engagement partners, managers and staff on a periodic basis in keeping with auditing best practices.
RTD issued a best value request for proposals to provide external audit services and received five
proposals from the following firms:
 BKD
 Clifton Larson
 Crowe Horwath
 McGladrey
 RubinBrown

Packet Pg. 127

13.C

The proposals were evaluated with the following criteria:
40% - Qualifications of individuals proposed for key positions and disciplines
30% - Overall experience of the firm
30% - Cost
The proposal evaluation committee determined that RubinBrown had the best overall proposal.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding of $108,000 for the 2015 fiscal year audit will be included in the 2016 Budget. Funding for
external audit services is an annual recurring expenditure that is regularly included in the budget and SBP
process.

ALTERNATIVES
1) Approve the recommendation to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to
award a contract to RubinBrown, LLP to perform RTD’s annual external audit services. This is
the recommended action.
2) Do not approve the recommendation to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to
award a contract to RubinBrown, LLP to perform RTD’s annual external audit services. This is
not the recommended action because it will delay having an external auditor available and
staff has found RubinBrown, LLP to have the best overall proposal.

Subject:

August 2015 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the August 2015 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting
in an annualized cost of approximately $279,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted
by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and several service reductions. Also included in this report
are two proposals implementing service at new facilities slated to be open in time for the August service
change. Boulder Junction at Depot Square (33rd – Pearl Street) is scheduled to be opened with
accompanied changes to existing route services: HX and S and Central Park Station Bus Plaza and parkn-Ride will replace the existing Stapleton park-n-Ride with accompanied changes to existing route
services: 28, 38, 40, 43, 65, 73, 88, 89, 105, AB and AS. We will monitor customer response to the
implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as
appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Seven public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended between May 27th
and June 3rd. Public meetings were held in Aurora, Denver, Boulder, Lakewood and Highlands Ranch.
Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment B of this
report.

CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the

(Route 43 school tripper service replaced by increased frequency on the Route 43)
Routes BOUND, DASH, JUMP, SKIP and STAMPEDE: Change to fall/winter schedules.
Route N – Nederland/Boulder: reinstate routing to Eldora Ski Resort.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The base system financial impact contained in this proposal is estimated to be $279,000 annualized.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed August 2015 service changes does
not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.
LOOK AHEAD – January 17, 2016
The following items are service concepts currently under consideration or are planned events that impact
operations in the next service change period:
 US36 BRT Service Plan restructures the majority of Regional Service aligned along US 36
into the Flatiron Flyer Bus Rapid Transit service.




Route 79L/83L rescheduling and rebranding to simplify customer information in the
Speer/Leetsdale corridor.
Route 6 restructure creating a distinct east-west service (Route 6) and a north-south
service to be named the Route 19 – North Pecos.
Grant funded peak period service increase on the Free MetroRide

Route 1 – West 1st Avenue
An all-day vehicle is proposed to be added to Route 1, due to the proposal on the Route
26, which results in a break of the interline between Route 1 and 26. Anticipated cost
impacts are estimated to be $165,300 annualized.
Route 1W – West 1st Avenue
In conjunction with the discontinuance of the Route 9 school tripper, it is proposed to
reroute Route 1W to operate on Knox Ct between 6th Ave and 10th Ave, 10th Ave between
Knox Ct and Decatur St, and Decatur St between 8th Ave and 10th Ave. The remaining
route will be unchanged. Route 1W will be scheduled to arrive at West High School at
7:20am and depart at 3:40pm. Anticipated cost estimated to be $2,600 annualized.
Route 3L – East Alameda Limited
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance. No cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 6 – East 6th Avenue/ North Pecos
It is proposed to realign Route 6 to stay on Navajo St between 32nd Ave and 34th Ave.
Drainage has been improved in this area and the street is no longer a hazard in freezing
temperatures. No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 8 – North Broadway / Huron
It is proposed to return the southbound terminal of Route 8 to 13th/Welton during weekday
evenings and on weekends. It is also proposed to discontinue Route 8 service to Denver
Water, with all trips terminating at 13th/Welton. Service to Denver Water is proposed to be
provided by an improved Route 34 (proposed Route 33). Anticipated cost savings are
estimated to be $31,000 annualized.
Route 9 – West 10th Avenue
Due to low ridership, it is proposed to discontinue the Route 9 school tripper starting at
Lakewood-Wadsworth Station at 6:22am. The Route 9 will also be extended from Larimer20th Street to 31st –Brighton Boulevard to address overloads currently being experienced
on the Route 48 – East 48th Ave/Commerce City.
Cost savings are estimated to be
$13,000 annualized.

This proposal recombines Routes 26 and 28 at Wadsworth Boulevard. A new routing to
turnaround the Route 9 is proposed using 14th Avenue to Pierce Street to 10th Avenue.
Additional Sunday service is proposed to be added to Route 76 to maintain an appropriate
service frequency along Wadsworth Boulevard in Lakewood.
Anticipated net cost savings is estimated to be $195,000 annualized
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance. No cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 12 – Downing/North Washington
Discontinue 6:07pm southbound trip from Corona/Colfax to Englewood Station. Trip
averages between 8-14 boardings per hour. This proposal reduces frequency south of
Colfax from every 15 to every 30 minutes between 6:00pm and 6:30pm. A reroute
northbound buses to remain on Downing Street at the 30th & Downing LRT Station is also
proposed. The northbound stop at 29th Avenue is very convenient to the station platform.
This proposal reduces travel time by approximately 3 minutes and eliminates a very
difficult left turn from California Street onto Downing. Anticipated cost savings are
estimated to be $8,200 annualized.
Route 15 – East Colfax
Route 15L – East Colfax Limited
Route 20 – 20th Avenue
Discontinue Route 15 deviation into the Anschutz Medical Campus on Saturday and
Sunday. Route averages only one boarding or alighting for every 3 bus trips on weekends.
Route 20 will continue to provide direct campus service.
Discontinue Route 15 deviation south of Colfax via Sable, 13th Avenue, and
Chambers Road. Area is well served by Route 15L on Sable and Route 153 on Chambers
Road. Also discontinue loop via Chambers, 17th Avenue, and Jasper Street.
Extend Route 15 directly east on Colfax Avenue, continuing east to Himalaya
Street, replacing Route 15L Tower Road branch. Route 15 service to Tower Road will
include Saturday/Sunday/holidays, as elimination of deviations should allow this extension
at no additional operating cost. (Note: Saturday service will be every 15 minutes as far
east as Billings Street, then every 30 minutes to Tower Road. Sunday/holiday service will
be every 30 minutes).
Route 15L Tower Road branch trips will be cut back to terminate/originate at
Colfax/Billings (East Metro Garage). Service east of Sable Blvd. is replaced by extended
Route 15. Current Route 15L service to Centrepoint & Sable will remain unchanged.

Reroute eastbound Route 20 trips coming from Lakewood to use Market Street
instead of Wazee Street, between Auraria Parkway and 17th Street. Provides faster
travel time for most riders while still providing good access to Lower Downtown.

Overall project cost is estimated to be $105,180 annualized.
Route 21 – Evans Avenue
Route 21 would be rerouted to use Monroe Street (3 blocks west of Colorado Blvd.)
instead of Colorado Boulevard, between Evans Avenue and Buchtel Drive. No cost impacts
are anticipated.
Route 27 – Yale Avenue
It is proposed to reroute Route 27 in Englewood to serve The Foundry development north
of Dartmouth Ave and west of Elati St. Regular service will be discontinued on Broadway
between Yale Ave and Englewood Pkwy and between Broadway and Inca St. Selected
trips from Porter and Craig hospitals will remain on Englewood Pkwy. Service from Yale
Ave & Broadway will then operate on Yale Ave, Elati St, Bates Ave, Galapago St,
Dartmouth Ave, and Inca St. Service to Englewood Station will be maintained.
No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 30 – South Federal
It is proposed to move the Route 30 school trippers operating between Sheridan Blvd and
Wadsworth & Hampden Park-n-Ride to become part of Route 51. These trips will now
start and end at Dartmouth/Lamar. The afternoon school tripper is proposed to end at
Alameda. The morning school tripper is proposed to start at Alameda. Cost impacts
anticipated to be an estimated $2,580 annualized.
Route 30L – Federal Boulevard Limited
This proposal re-aligns the service in the downtown area to be routed along Stout Street in
the place of Welton Street, but utilizes the same terminal at 22nd Champa. This new
alignment should provide more consistent operation of this service, thereby improving ontime performance. No cost impact anticipated.
Route 31 – Federal Boulevard
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed during the early morning and late night periods
to better coordinate connections with Route 16. It is proposed to move the afternoon
northbound school tripper to start at Federal/Evans at 3:21pm from 3:17pm.
It is proposed to shift the times of the afternoon southbound school trippers to leave
Federal/32nd at 2:55pm and 4:05pm in order to better match school dismissals. No
anticipated cost impacts.

Ellsworth Ave, and Cherokee St. Counter-clockwise would operate on the same streets in
reverse order, except for using Howard Pl between Federal Blvd and Decatur St. Service is
proposed every 45 minutes, peak hours only. Anticipated cost impacts are estimated
$84,200 annualized.
Route 36Ltd – Fort Logan: Minor schedule adjustments
Route 36L – Fort Logan Limited
This proposal re-aligns the service in the downtown area to be routed along Stout Street in
the place of Welton Street, but utilizes the same terminal at 22nd Champa. This new
alignment should provide more consistent operation of this service, thereby improving ontime performance. No cost anticipated.
Route 43 – Martin Luther King Blvd./Gateway
Improve weekday peak period frequency east of Montbello Park-n-Ride to Airport & 40th
Park-n-Ride from every 30 to every 15 minutes, 6:00-8:30am and 3:00-6:00pm. Results
in better load distribution, allows elimination of Route 43/65 school trippers east of
Stapleton Park-n-Ride (at substantial savings).
Cost anticipated to be an estimated $31,000 annualized.
Route 50 – Lakes Crosstown
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance. No cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 51 – Sheridan Boulevard

at 6:07am under this proposal. Anticipated cost is estimated to be $7,250 annualized.
Route 72/72W – 72nd Avenue Crosstown
It is proposed to operate the 2nd to last trip in-service north-bound, instead of deadheading
it back to the garage and to terminate it at US 85 & 72nd Avenue. Anticipated cost is
estimated to be $10,300 annualized.
Route 77 – Ken Caryl Avenue
In conjunction with changes proposed to the South Jeffco Call-n-Ride, it is proposed to
provide Route 77 service during the weekday midday period with 60 minute frequency.

Anticipated cost impacts are estimated to be $8,300 annualized.
Route 225/225D/225E – Boulder/Broomfield via Baseline & US 287
It is proposed to add one west-bound short-turn trip, in the AM peak at about 8:30am in
order to alleviate the overloads and pass-ups caused due to ridership from the homeless
shelter in addition to CU ridership. Trip would start at Baseline Road/Manhattan Road.
Anticipated cost impact is estimated to be $5,200 annualized.
Route 401 – Highlands Ranch/Mineral
Due to few through riders, it is proposed to split Route 401 at Mineral Station. The
western portion will become Route 85 and the eastern portion will remain Route 401.
Span of service, frequency, and trips will remain unchanged. This will provide clarity to
where buses are traveling and allow better monitoring of the route. Minor schedule
adjustments are proposed. No anticipated cost impacts.
Route AA – Wagon Road/DIA
This proposal matches weekend trip times to weekday trip times to allow for schedule
consistency for customers. No anticipated cost impacts.

Route S – Denver/East Boulder
With the opening of Boulder Junction at Depot Square Transit Center, it is proposed to
extend route HX into the new facility, from its current terminal at Pearl Parkway/ 49th
Street. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route Stampede – CU East Campus:
This proposal adds 3 westbound trips at 9:05am, 10:38am and 12:18am, between East
Campus/Discovery Drive and Euclid/18th, as warranted due to passenger overloads at
these times. The service would be supported by a Transit Improvement Plan grant funding
extension (2012-2018) through DRCOG. No cost impact anticipated.
Central Park Station
The new Central Park Station replaces the temporary Stapleton Park-n-Ride. Routes
affected included the 28, 38, 40, 43, 65, 73, 88, 89, 105, AB, and AS. No anticipated
cost impacts.
Belmar Call-n-Ride
The Belmar Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line.
The Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 8:00pm. The Call-n-Ride has not met
the RTD Service Standard of three boarding per hour. The Call-n-Ride currently has one all
day bus, 5:30am – 7:00pm and one peak bus, 6:00am-9:00am and 3:00pm – 6:00pm. It
is recommended to discontinue the peak bus. Anticipated savings are estimated to be
$82,038 in annual costs, which include fuel.
Golden Call-n-Ride
The Golden Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line
under a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Improvement Grant (CMAQ) sponsored by the
City of Golden, the Colorado School of Mines and the RTD. The Call-n-Ride operates one
vehicle as a Flex Route and two vehicles as a non-flex route Call-n-Ride on weekdays. The
Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 8:00pm and Saturdays 8:00am – 11:00pm.
On Saturday, the Call-n-Ride operates one vehicle as a Call-n-Ride. The Saturday Call-nRide has not met the RTD Service Standard of three boarding per hour. The hours
between 7:00pm and 11:00pm carry less than one customer per hour. This
recommendation is to end the service day at 7:00pm. Anticipated savings are estimated to
be $11,152 in annual costs, which include fuel.

Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride
The Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006. The Call-n-Ride has
had difficulty in meeting the RTD standard of 3 boardings per hour. Douglas County, the
Highlands Ranch Metro District and the RTD agreed upon a cost share agreement for 2015
to keep the service. Additionally, a Transportation Advisory Committee was formed to
look at ideas to make the Call-n-Ride more productive. The Committee came up with
numerous ideas that will be implemented over the next few months. This recommendation
identifies the reduction of area served by the Call-n-Ride. The recommended area for
discontinuance is south of C-470, north of University and east of Colorado Blvd. The
current riders will be grandfathered into the service. No new riders will be accepted.
No cost impacts are anticipated with this proposal.
South Jeffco Call-n-Ride
The South Jeffco Call-n-Ride began operating in January 2012. The Call-n-Ride was
funded under a Job Access Reverse Commute grant. The Call-n-Ride operates MondayFriday 5:30am – 10:00pm and Saturdays 8:00am – 10:00pm. The weekday Call-n-Ride
operates with four peak vehicles. One vehicle operates a flex route to Lockheed Martin
operating two trips in the am and two in the pm. This flex route has not met the RTD
Service Standard of three boardings per hour. This recommendation is to discontinue the
Lockheed Martin Flex route and move the resources to the weekday Call-n-Ride service. In
turn, the Call-n-Ride will be allowed to serve Lockheed Martin by a Call-n-Ride trip that is
scheduled by the Lockheed Martin employees as a group. The South Jeffco Call-n-Ride
will have some modifications with schedule times at the station in order to make the Calln-Ride more reliable. With these additional resources, changes will be made to the
weekday service delivery model in order to make the weekday Call-n-Ride a more reliable
service to the customer. The Way To Go program will look at providing a vanpool as an
alternative for the Lockheed Martin customers. No anticipated cost impact.
Light Rail: E Line – Lincoln/Union Station
It is proposed to add one train in each direction in the AM and PM peak periods (7:24 AM
northbound from Lincoln Station, 7:14 AM southbound from Union Station, 5:09 PM northbound
from Lincoln Station, and 4:28 PM southbound from Union Station). This continues to assist
with increasing ridership demand to/from Union Station and W Line transfers as well as increased
school ridership in the fall. This proposal also advances the eventual goal of 15-minute E Line
frequencies in the entire AM and PM peak periods. Anticipated cost impacts are estimated to be
$189,000 annualized.
Light Rail: E Line and F Line
It is proposed to adjust late morning pull-ins and early afternoon pullouts to provide more efficient
service between Lincoln Station and downtown. This proposal has marginal impacts to
passengers; service levels would remain the same. Anticipated savings are estimated to be
$70,800 annualized.

Light Rail: H Line – Nine Mile/Downtown
It is proposed to discontinue the 2:18 AM southbound trip from downtown on late Friday and
Saturday nights. This trip was added in August 2014 as a “clean up” trip through downtown
after the other late night trains, but has resulted in comparatively lower ridership than its D Line
and E Line counterpart trips. Approximately 34 boardings would be affected that would need to
take a train approximately 10 minutes earlier. The northbound trip from 1:36 AM between Nine
Mile and I-25 & Broadway Station would be retained. Anticipated savings are estimated to be
$30,500 annualized.
School Service
Implement seasonal school service on the following routes:
Routes 1, 9, 11, 24, 30, 30Ltd, 31, 51, 52, 65, 73, 100, 206/206F and 208/208F.

Brian Matthews and Doug Monroe were in attendance. One person showed up. Alice is a member of
the HR Transportation Advisory Committee and wanted to show up for the support of changes. We
waited until 6:15pm and closed down the meeting.
It should be noted that this meeting was added to the proposed meetings after the brochure was
printed to discuss proposed boundary changes to the Call-n-Ride. A flyer was handed out on the Call-nRide and every customer that attended the previous Call-n-Ride public meeting and provided contact
information was notified via phone or e-mail about the proposed changes.

The purpose and format for the meeting was explained. Given the small audience, it was
determined to proceed directly to public testimony.
Regarding proposed service changes for August 2015:
 Commenter representing Lockheed Martin employees requested that the RTD
reconsider the cancellation of Southwest Jeffco Call-n-Ride service to the Lockheed
site. She stated that 300 more employees have been added to the location and that
additional marketing could be done to attract more riders. She was joined by two
others who participated in the meeting who also shared that an internship program
was starting near term, with students who would be dependent on the Call-n-Ride
service to the Lockheed site.
 Commenter representing employees of Denver Water expressed concern over the
proposed changes to Routes 8 and 33/34. She wanted to know how the schedules
would be coordinated with other bus services and light rail.
Without further comments, the meeting was concluded at 6:25pm.

the public signed the attendance sheet. The meeting was called to order at 6:01 P.M.
Mr. Monroe thanked the attendee for her attendance. He introduced himself, staff
members, and Director Walker. Given the small audience, it was determined to proceed
directly to public testimony.
Regarding proposed service changes for August 2015:
 Commenter is a long-time transit rider and expressed dissatisfaction with the
discontinuance of Route 8 service to Denver Water during peak hours. Replacement
service for the route, Route 33, will not connect with her origination route
downtown (Route 10), requiring the use of a third route to connect. She
recommended Route 8 continue to serve Denver Water, perhaps with reduced

frequency. The commenter believed the proposed removal of parking at the Denver
Water campus would increase ridership on the route. (Staff shared the challenges
surrounding the Platte Valley industrial area, including Denver Water’s planned
removal of the Route 8 turnaround/layover location due to the imminent
reconstruction of its campus. Staff also explained it had met with Denver Water
representatives multiple times to discuss the proposed service adjustments –
including the same day as this meeting – and received support from the agency
regarding the proposal.)
Seeing no further comments, Mr. Monroe thanked the attendee for her time and invited
her to contact RTD if she had any further questions. Adjournment occurred at 6:11 P.M.,
with staff remaining until 6:25 P.M. to serve potential late-arriving commenters.

Doug Monroe conducted the meeting. Additional staff in attendance included Steve
Hopkins and Diane Marquiss. Director Menten was also in attendance. Four (4) members
of the public signed the attendance sheet. The meeting was called to order at 6:02 P.M.
The format of the meeting was conversational in nature. Mr. Monroe thanked the audience
for its attendance and described the purpose of the evening’s meeting. He introduced
himself, staff members, and Director Menten.
Mr. Monroe asked if any attendees had any questions prior to providing public testimony.
One attendee questioned the rationale for the proposed changes to Routes 26 and 28.
Staff explained that the loss of a layover location on Wadsworth Boulevard and low
ridership on the Wadsworth segment of the routes led to the proposal. It was also
explained that daily service to Applewood would be maintained by Route 28 at similar
times to Route 26.
Seeing no further questions, the following public testimony was received:
Regarding proposed service changes for August 2015:


Commenter uses Route 26 to connect between 27th/Youngfield and
Lakewood/Wadsworth Station. She is “fed up” with RTD, stating that taxpayers are
not receiving the benefits from the taxes collected. The elimination of Route 100
service on Sundays adds to the challenge of using the bus in that area. She stated

Attachment: Attach B Public Meeting Notes August 2015 Service Changes (2389 : Board Report August 2015 Service Changes)

13.D.b

Packet Pg. 145

that the waste in the RTD administration could be put to better use on the street.
She believes that the proposal would result in significant walking distance
increases, making the bus an unviable option.
(Staff interjected to ensure the commenter’s comprehension of the proposal. It was
identified that she was of the belief that all service along 26th and 27th Avenues
would be discontinued. Staff assured her that this was not part of the proposed
service changes.)
Commenter continued that she was more understanding of the changes thanks to
the clarification provided by staff. She added that the connection times between
Routes 28 and Routes 76 and 100 needed to be better coordinated and that light
rail connection times were not necessary to consider. She likes the way Route 26
currently runs, allowing her to travel to and make connections at Lakewood
Commons/Belmar. There is too much redundant service to downtown Denver and
not enough service to other destinations.
(Director Menten interjected to confirm that Route 76 service along Wadsworth
would be maintained, and Mr. Monroe added that Sunday frequency would be
increased to every 30 minutes.)


Commenter has been a transit rider since the 1960s and just learned of the
proposed service changes to Route 26. He believes that the W-Line is working and
provides a good connection to downtown Denver and Golden. Route 26 is
innovative and should be kept. He described discontinued Route 125, which
previously provided service between Youngfield and the Federal Center via Colorado
Mills. He also described the convenience Route 17 used to provide. The lack of
connections between 38th/Youngfield and West Colfax Avenue is hard to
understand. He believes Route 26 is fabulous and is upset that RTD is going to
cancel it regardless of public comment. He stated that Routes 32, 38, and 44 all
travel between Youngfield and downtown Denver and questioned why a fourth
route would need to traverse the same route. He encouraged other riders to submit
their comments to RTD in email form or to attend public hearings. He also
suggested that Route 26 could layover on the southbound sidewalk on Wadsworth
Boulevard underneath the light rail station. He encouraged RTD to better publicize
the route and ask light rail customers which bus route they might use to reach the
station if their personal vehicle became unavailable.



Commenter believes that RTD should be more aggressive in acquiring increased
funding for its services. She occasionally rides Route 26 and notes that the bus
does not have many riders. Her primary concern is for increased service on Route
76 to help minimize transfer times and reduce overcrowding. She believes that the
segments of Routes 76 and 100 between Colfax and Interstate 70 are in need of
increased service, perhaps through the reduction of service on the northern and
southern segments of these routes. She feels that by averaging ridership figures for
the entire route, RTD does not see the actual picture of what ridership looks like
along the route. It was added that coordinating meet times at light rail stations is
unnecessary, but that coordinating transfer times between buses which run less
frequently is much more important. She added that the current timing of Routes 26

Attachment: Attach B Public Meeting Notes August 2015 Service Changes (2389 : Board Report August 2015 Service Changes)

13.D.b

Packet Pg. 146

and 28 mean that customers can’t transfer from one route to the other because
they run simultaneously. She mentioned that RTD has a tendency to overweigh the
authority of self-appointed neighborhood representatives who might not actually
represent the opinions of those in the neighborhood. She concluded her comments
reiterating her desire for increased service along Wadsworth on Sunday.
A general conversation followed regarding the costs of providing parking lots around the
district. Those in attendance who commented all deemed the cost to RTD as excessive
and that RTD should charge people who use these facilities. The location of certain parking
facilities was discussed, including that some neighborhoods who had spoken against
parking lots have received them anyway.
Seeing no further comments, Mr. Monroe thanked the attendees for their time and advised
them of the Board of Directors meeting on June 16, 2015. Adjournment occurred at 7:01
P.M., with staff remaining to answer further questions from the public.

Proposed August Service Changes - Route 120

Hello RTD staff,
I am writing on behalf of the City and County of Broomfield to support the proposed increase in service for the Route
120. The corridor between the Wagon Road Park n Ride and the Broomfield BRT Station has continued to develop and
serve additional riders. The 120th Avenue corridor also emerged from the North Area Mobility Study as a location that
has potential for arterial Bus Rapid Transit and we look forward to exploring that possibility with you some time in the
future.
We very much appreciate this service enhancement and will be happy work with RTD to promote it when it is
implemented.

Dear Mr. Monroe,
You ask "Is there a particular building or complex at Evans/Depew in which elderly or disable passengers live? Or is it
just that general area? That information will certainly help us in making a decision."
It is the general area. For example, in my building the manager, Ray McKeachie, is a wheel chair bound Vet. Further
south is Nellie Pipzr at 2155 S. Depew. For Nellie to board the bus, the driver must lower the shoulder to assist
her. When I told Nellie Sunday morning as we were waiting for the 7:23am 21 East about the purposed changes, she
lamented "I'm so tired already when I come home, I don't want to walk another block to get home."
Neither she or the other gentleman waiting for the 21 had heard of the purposed changes, nor did either of them use
the internet. (I knew only because of an email.)
You also said "Route 21 currently averages about 2 passenger boardings per trip between Sheridan and Federal. We
expect that the bus running on Jewell will attract more riders and also improve service for passengers riding through
that section."
I would argue that while you may be attracting more riders from North of Jewell, but you will be doing a disservice to
the riders along Evans between Sheridan & Federal. I would also say that from my riding the 21 both east & west 5‐7
days a week, I see 4 or more riders picked up along Evans EVERY day of the week, depending on the time of day. If data
collecting by the drivers is practiced as often as the drivers on the 21 route announce connections, your rider data is
under reported 50% OF THE TIME.

I ask you please DO NOT GO FORWARD with this change to the 21 route. As this change will degrade
service for as many if not more riders then will be gained from the change.

15/15L Suggestions

I have noted that you plan to change the route 15/15L bus route to exclude the Anschutz Medical Campus, and I
am protesting this modification.
The UCDenver Anschutz Medical Campus hosts some of the most cutting-edge medical research in the world
and is rapidly growing. Many employees and students rely on public transportation to access the campus. Thus,
removing the campus from the route would create an unnecessary burden on individuals wishing to come to the
Anschutz Medical Campus, and would likely result in decreased use of the bus route altogether.
Furthermore, it would require employees and students to walk further from a stop to reach the campus in a
neighborhood that is not altogether safe for walking extended distances, especially when employees and
students are walking by themselves. This is an issue of usage as well as safety. Please maintain the Anschutz
Medical Campus as part of the current route.

Proposed Service Change to Route 15

Regarding RTD's proposed service change to "discontinue the route 15 deviation via Aurora Court into the Anschutz
Medical Campus," I highly discourage such a decision. I have been a long‐time (well over 10 years) rider on Route
15/15L because I work at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Every trip, I see seniors and families ride
the 15 bus who get off at one of the stops along Aurora Court in order to keep their medical appointments at University
Hospital and clinics or Children's Hospital. Eliminating the Route 15 stops along Aurora Court makes a much longer walk
for seniors/families to see their doctors. When an individual doesn't feel well or has a mobility limitation, the extra walk
from East Colfax onto the Anschutz Medical Campus can be grueling and even dangerous to their health and safety,
particularly in inclement weather.
University of Colorado students and employees also ride the 15 bus and then walk to and from their respective buildings
on campus. Eliminating the Route 15 stops along Aurora Court means adding 10‐15 minutes walk time for students and
employees, often making it even more difficult to arrive at class or work on time or to catch connecting buses and light
rail at the end of the day.
While the 20 bus also stops along Aurora Court, it does not connect with West Colfax buses along the remainder of its
route and the 20 bus does not run as often as the 15 bus. One of the perks of the 15 bus over the 15L is that the 15 runs
often and stops every 2‐3 blocks, while the 15L runs just as often and makes far fewer stops. Both 15 and 15L are
crowded. My experience has been that real travel time on the 15 and 15L are very close to being the same, so why
eliminate the convenience of Route 15 bus stops along Aurora Court? Please reconsider the service change to Route 15
to keep the bus running along Aurora Court.
