## IV. Retiree Awards

Mike Gil, Deputy AGM, introduced Richard Baker, Bus Operator of almost 22 years.  He noted that this was actually Richard’s second career.  Richard followed his dad into law enforcement for 28 years before coming to RTD.  He was a Sheriff in Nebraska on an Indian Reservation, Police Chief in Erie, Police Chief in Dacono and Police Chief in Hanah, WY.  Mike Gil said that Richard drove in the Boulder division for 20 of his 20+ years.  Richard is 77 years of age and is going to continue working with RTD as a part-time undercover ride monitor.  Mike Gil said that Boulder would miss him as a full-time driver but we will welcome him as a ride monitor.

Richard thanked the Board for the award.  He said this was the first award he had received.  He appreciates the many people he has worked with at RTD; they are the backbone of this company.  He recognized that there are good people throughout the company, especially the managers.

## V. Public Participation

Bob Wilson, Arvada, shared that he recently heard several radio reports that he thought might be beneficial for the Board to hear.  One was an interview with the new Director of CDOT.  Bob Wilson noted that he did not mention transit specifically, which was a missed opportunity, but it was very good from a board policy perspective.  The other program was an interview with a local reporter discussing the first train coming into Denver International Airport.

Questions from Board members:

- Director Menten noted that last year the Board was asked to approve a Band-Aid for the Health and Welfare Trust for the Union.  It was her understanding the Band-Aid would last through the end of this year.  She thinks that it is getting close to when a discussion needs to happen about what to do next.  IGM Genova shared that he was just recently briefed by the three salaried employees that serve as Trustees.  It is his understanding that the Trust is bringing in a consultant to look at the health plans to recommend plan changes that could result in a savings.  The trust will be meeting again next month so hopefully IGM Genova will have more information at that time about the options to keep the Trust healthy.

Director Menten asked if the Board would need to approve any extension of the Band-Aid or additional funding that might be required.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, reminded the Board that last summer there was a significant increase in the ATU’s plan cost.  The RTD/ATU collective bargaining agreement (CBA) defines a fixed contribution to the Health and Welfare plan and says that the parties will share any increase in premiums.  She explained that this is a self-funded plan so there is not an outside, objective bill that says the premium is going up by a set dollar amount.  She said the dispute between RTD and ATU was related to how they had chosen to fund their plan and what they were charging RTD as premiums.  Marla Lien stated that this was resolved by RTD and ATU agreeing as a definition of what could be included in the premium; however, under the CBA the Board has already agreed to pay half of the premium so there will be no need for further Board approval.

Director Menten asked who she should contact for any follow-up questions.  IGM Genova said he would be the primary contact.  Director Menten commented that while it did not seem like a lot when looked at as a monthly amount, when looking at the big picture it was a significant increase in the overall budget.  Marla Lien reiterated that this was the reason for defining what would be considered a premium.  IGM Genova noted that there was also a significant increase in the employees’ contribution.

- Director Folska noted that, as mentioned in Chair Sisk’s report, four Directors attended Accelerate Colorado in Washington, D.C. last week with a Delegation from Colorado.  She shared that one of the things that Congressman Polis was good to remind the Directors about what that they do not have their train.  She said that she appreciates the reminder but it makes her concerned about the message that RTD is promoting.  She shared that she is excited about the five new lines we will be opening next year but we do not want anyone to get the impression that RTD will just transition to operations and leave the Northwest Rail in the dust.

## XII. Public Hearing for 2015 Amended Budget

Chair Sisk read the script for the public hearing into record, a copy of which can be found in the Board office.  He asked if there was anyone that would like to speak about the 2015 Amended Budget.  Hearing no comments, he closed public comment.
