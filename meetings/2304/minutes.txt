Retiree Awards
Mike Gil, Deputy AGM, introduced Richard Baker, Bus Operator of almost 22 years. He
noted that this was actually Richard’s second career. Richard followed his dad into law
enforcement for 28 years before coming to RTD. He was a Sheriff in Nebraska on an
Indian Reservation, Police Chief in Erie, Police Chief in Dacono and Police Chief in Hanah,
WY. Mike Gil said that Richard drove in the Boulder division for 20 of his 20+ years.
Richard is 77 years of age and is going to continue working with RTD as a part-time
undercover ride monitor. Mike Gil said that Boulder would miss him as a full-time driver
but we will welcome him as a ride monitor.
Richard thanked the Board for the award. He said this was the first award he had
received. He appreciates the many people he has worked with at RTD; they are the
backbone of this company. He recognized that there are good people throughout the
company, especially the managers.

V.

Public Participation
Bob Wilson, Arvada, shared that he recently heard several radio reports that he thought
might be beneficial for the Board to hear. One was an interview with the new Director of
CDOT. Bob Wilson noted that he did not mention transit specifically, which was a missed
opportunity, but it was very good from a board policy perspective. The other program
was an interview with a local reporter discussing the first train coming into Denver
International Airport.

GM Executive Search Committee Update
Chair Sisk reported that the Committee is making great progress. The Employee Listening
Sessions are continuing throughout this week. Chair Sisk and Director Tobiassen will be
meeting with the Union representatives as well. He commended all the Directors, and
most importantly the employees, for taking their time to participate in this important
activity. Chair Sisk shared that some of the feedback Directors have been hearing is that
the employees would like the opportunity to meet with them once a year. He said that is
something the Directors would like to see happen.
Chair Sisk reminded the Board that there is an Executive Focus group on June 17th. There
will also be another community forum on June 24th. He said that additionally, the Citizens
Advisory Committee will be asked for their input on the General Manager Executive Search
at their meeting on June 17th. Finally, he reminded everyone that there is an online public
questionnaire available. He shared that as of 10:22 a.m. there had already been 365
responses.
Chair Sisk noted that at today’s meeting the Committee reviewed the proposals from
several executive search firms during an executive session. He said that he was pleased
to announce that after the Committee adjourned from executive session they made the
unanimous decision to offer the contract to Krauthamer & Associates.

VIII.

General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Update
Committee Chair Bagley explained that the Committee consisted of six members: Directors
Anderson, Francone, Hoy, Menten, Walker and himself. He said they met this afternoon
to review the 2016 task goals with Interim General Manager Genova. He reminded
everyone that the task goals are determined at a retreat held in March with the Board and
Senior Leadership Team. He stated that the Committee worked with IGM Genova to
ensure the task goals were SMART (specific, measureable, attainable, realistic and timebased). He noted that there would be some minor tweaking between now and the next
Committee meeting on July 7th, at which time the goals will be finalized and sent to the
Board for approval at the July Board Meeting so that they can be incorporated into the
2016 Budget.

Questions from Board members:
 Director Menten noted that last year the Board was asked to approve a Band-Aid
for the Health and Welfare Trust for the Union. It was her understanding the BandAid would last through the end of this year. She thinks that it is getting close to
when a discussion needs to happen about what to do next. IGM Genova shared
that he was just recently briefed by the three salaried employees that serve as
Trustees. It is his understanding that the Trust is bringing in a consultant to look at
the health plans to recommend plan changes that could result in a savings. The
trust will be meeting again next month so hopefully IGM Genova will have more
information at that time about the options to keep the Trust healthy.
Director Menten asked if the Board would need to approve any extension of the
Band-Aid or additional funding that might be required. Marla Lien, General Counsel,
reminded the Board that last summer there was a significant increase in the ATU’s
plan cost. The RTD/ATU collective bargaining agreement (CBA) defines a fixed
contribution to the Health and Welfare plan and says that the parties will share any
increase in premiums. She explained that this is a self-funded plan so there is not
an outside, objective bill that says the premium is going up by a set dollar amount.
She said the dispute between RTD and ATU was related to how they had chosen to
fund their plan and what they were charging RTD as premiums. Marla Lien stated
that this was resolved by RTD and ATU agreeing as a definition of what could be
included in the premium; however, under the CBA the Board has already agreed to
pay half of the premium so there will be no need for further Board approval.
Director Menten asked who she should contact for any follow-up questions. IGM
Genova said he would be the primary contact. Director Menten commented that
while it did not seem like a lot when looked at as a monthly amount, when looking
at the big picture it was a significant increase in the overall budget. Marla Lien
reiterated that this was the reason for defining what would be considered a
premium. IGM Genova noted that there was also a significant increase in the
employees’ contribution.



XII.

Director Folska noted that, as mentioned in Chair Sisk’s report, four Directors
attended Accelerate Colorado in Washington, D.C. last week with a Delegation
from Colorado. She shared that one of the things that Congressman Polis was
good to remind the Directors about what that they do not have their train. She said
that she appreciates the reminder but it makes her concerned about the message
that RTD is promoting. She shared that she is excited about the five new lines we
will be opening next year but we do not want anyone to get the impression that
RTD will just transition to operations and leave the Northwest Rail in the dust.

Public Hearing for 2015 Amended Budget
Chair Sisk read the script for the public hearing into record, a copy of which can be found
in the Board office. He asked if there was anyone that would like to speak about the
2015 Amended Budget. Hearing no comments, he closed public comment.

Approval of 2015 Amended Budget

XVI. Old Business
Director Walker reminded everyone that the APTA Transit Board Member and Board
Support Seminar would be in Denver next month, as Chair Sisk mentioned. He thinks that
all Board members with the exception of two or three have signed up. He hopes everyone
will be in attendance. As of today there are 111 registrants, which is almost as many as
attended last year. He has been told that most registrants sign up in the last month so the
numbers look very good. He shared that we are still looking for more sponsors to really
add the “razzle dazzle” to the event.
Director Hoy reminded everyone about the event Trans Forum event taking place next
Thursday that he emailed the Directors about. He said that this is the 3rd year and it really
promises to be a good event. He hopes the Directors will attend it their schedule allows.

XVII. New Business
Director Lasater thanked IGM Genova and staff for their help pulling of a last minute
request to have a Call-n-Ride bus at the Parker Days CarFest. He said it was very well
received and hopefully brought some awareness to those Parker residents that still do not
know about the Call-n-Ride. He thanked the City of Parker, Douglas County and RTD for
working together to get more notoriety for the service.
Director Anderson wanted to share what a pleasant experience it was meeting with the
employees during the GM Executive Search listening session. She is looking forward to
reading the comments from the other sessions. She thought it was very interesting that
that there were some really thoughtful employees.
Director Francone thanked Pauletta Tonilas, Senior Manager of Public Relations and Public
Information, and Brian Matthews, Manager of Special Services, for their help with her
Town Hall meeting in Evergreen about the Call-n-Ride. She said the community was very
excited about the service and she thinks we will see ridership increase soon.
