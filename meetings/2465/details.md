Special Recognition – TSA Gold Standard Award 2015

General Manager Genova explained that the TSA Gold Standard Award is given to organizations demonstrating the highest standard of excellence in security.  He pointed out this is the second consecutive award that RTD has received, which is a great statement for the efforts of the team lead by Chief Tarbert.

General manager Genova pointed out that the team has been doing a great deal of preparation for the University of Colorado A-Line Opening.  The team put together an extensive manual that has been circulated throughout our various law enforcement partners.  He looks forward to seeing them in action on Friday and Saturday.

## V. Public Participation

Chair Pro Tem Hoy stated public participation is open to anyone that wants to address the Board.  He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.

- Doug Gragg, Denver, congratulated everyone on the upcoming University of Colorado A-Line opening.  He has been looking forward to this line for years and will have a wonderful time riding up and down the system.  He shared that last week he observed the Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting at which the CU Leeds School of Business (Leeds) gave an economics presentation.  He expressed concern that Leeds kept saying there was low inflation.  He stated RTD cannot have Leeds come before this agency and say that inflation is low when RTD raised fares at the first of the year.  If inflation is low then RTD needs to lower prices, not raise them.

Director Menten asked for further information on the 16th Street Mall Partners as this seems like a new organization.  She wondered who made up this partnership and if there had been any changes since the Board voted to remove the Mall Shuttle for the Meet in the Street Events.  General Manager Genova explained it was just the name the City and County Denver (Denver) is using to describe the working group for the Meet in the Street Events.  It is comprised of RTD, the Downtown Denver Partnership and Denver.  He stated there have been no changes to the plan that was previously approved.  The working group meets to discuss logistics, objectives, tools to gather data, etc.

##### b. 2016 Tifia Loan Signature Page

### D. Adoption of 2017 Performance Measures

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors adopts the attached 2017 Performance Measures for mission statement goals 1-7.  There are 23 specific performance measures in total, and it is proposed that an additional goal be added (goal 3.2) for a total of 24.

Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to approve the 2017 Performance Measures.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Anderson stated she would be voting no for the simple reason that she does not know where the additional $2 million needed to meet the on-time performance goal will come from.  RTD has a finite amount of financial resources and she cannot vote yes until she knows how staff will balance the budget.

Director Menten pointed out that based on the discussion during the Financial Administration and Audit Committee there is nothing requiring an additional $2 million be spent.  She does not want to lower RTD’s standards, especially when the Board just approved spending $26 million on the Civic Center renovations.  She wants to see on-time performance be a priority but that does not mean the Board has approved spending an additional $2 million.

Vote on the

Motion:              The motion passed with 9 in favor (Bagley, Folska, Francone, Hoy, James, Lubow, Menten, Sisk, Walker) and 3 opposed (Anderson, Archuleta, Lasater).  Chair Tobiassen and Directors Deadwyler and Solano were absent.

Chair Pro Tem Hoy declared the motion PASSED.

There was no old business.

## XV. New Business

Director Bagley complimented Nate Currey, Senior Manager of Public Relations and Public Information, Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, and the many other staff members involved for all their efforts during the telephone town halls that Directors just finished.  He thought staff did a fantastic job.

Director Sisk echoed the comments of Director Bagley.  He wanted to recognize Nate Currey and Karen Benker, Citizens for Finishing FasTracks, who were on Colorado Public Radio last week to discuss FasTracks.  He thought it was a very enlightened discussion that was handled well by all parties.  He said Colorado Public Radio did a really good job gathering background information.

Director Sisk shared that he recently had the honor of traveling to Washington, D.C. with the US 36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition (MCC).  He stated it was a great trip and people in D.C. are very excited about the University of Colorado A-Line.  He thanked Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, for attending with him and doing the heavy lifting.  He also thanked Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, for providing background information so RTD was speaking together with the MCC.  He thinks it assists RTD immeasurably when we can present a united front to the outside with our community partners.
