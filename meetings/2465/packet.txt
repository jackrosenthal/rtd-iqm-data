C. Updates

• Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Planning Efforts Status
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager, stated over the last several years
there have been a few activities that led staff in the direction of considering
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). These included the Northeast Area Transit Study II
(NATE) that provided a potential BRT corridor between Brighton and Denver,
the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) that provided a potential
framework for arterial BRT, other entities’ efforts creating additional BRT
opportunities, the successful opening of the Flatiron Flyer and the state
legislation permitting bus-on-shoulder operations. He reviewed the Power
Point presentation that was included in the April 5, 2016 Planning and
Development Committee Agenda Packet.
Chris Quinn shared that the Northeast Area Transit Study II (NATE II)
purpose included the analysis of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) alternatives
between Denver/Brighton corridors. The final report recommends further
consideration of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) on the State Highway 2 (SH 2)
corridor. The line would terminate along the University of Colorado A Line
at:
 Colorado Blvd. Station or
 Central Park Station
He noted other activities being addressed are looking at the possibility of
transitioning from Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) to rail on this route in the future.
Staff is still working towards completing a final report to present to the
Board. Chris Quinn stated that the SH119 was the stakeholders’

Packet Pg. 4

Directors Anderson and Hoy were absent. Directors Deadwyler, Folska and Menten
participated by phone.

6.A

Other feasibility analysis studies being reviewed are:
 SH 7 Corridor – Coalition led by Boulder County for corridor from
Boulder to Brighton.
 US 287 – Interest from coalition of Northwest-area stakeholders in
advancing this corridor forward from Longmont to US 36.
 East Colfax – Denver/Aurora pursuing bus enhancements from
downtown to I-225.
 Speer/Leetsdale Corridor – Denver beginning bus enhancement
study/environmental review for corridor.
 I-25 North – Colorado Department of Transport CDOT to begin buson-shoulder study to address “reverse commute” on Downtown
Express managed lanes.
 US 36 to 120th Ave. – Colorado Department of Transport CDOT to
open managed lanes extension. Next phase will extend from 120th
to C-470.
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) awarded RTD $1 million
in transit improvement program (TIP) grant funding for a region-wide BRT
study. This study will provide high-level analysis of potential corridors which
could benefit from BRT – type capital investments. Chris Quinn stated that
this study will also provide a prioritized list of candidate corridors for future
RTD investments. The high level analysis study is due to commence mid2017.
Director Bagley wondered if further study and the TIP grant would look at
providing BRT throughout entire metro area of Denver such as Wadsworth,
Colorado Boulevard, Arapahoe Road, etc. Chris Quinn replied that staff
would like to look at all principle corridors in the region to determine what
routes could benefit most from small capital improvement for travel time and
ridership.
Director Lubow shared that she was very excited about the sound of this
information, especially since the Flatiron Flyer is doing so well. She added
that she believes BRT has potential to be really positive in District I;
however, she has to raise the concern from the north that even though BRT
is a good idea they still do not have a rail option. She noted Chris Quinn
talked about studying how convertible BRT is to rail. She wonders if BRT
along SH 119 could be converted in the future. Chris Quinn replied that one

Packet Pg. 5

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 5, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

recommendation as the highest priority after the Northwest Area Mobility
Study (NAMS). He said staff is developing the scope of work for
environmental clearance and preliminary engineering. He anticipates
releasing a request for proposal (RFP) in late spring. Chris Quinn expects
this study process to take approximately 2 to 2 ½ years.

6.A

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, answered that this
topic can be criteria his department will address as part of their evaluation.
He explained that dedicated corridors for BRT would lend themselves more
easily to conversion. Director Lubow requested that the conversion analysis
specifically include the Northwest areas.
General Manager Genova explained that the conversion issues are really
about Right-of-Way (ROW). He referenced to the example addressed by
Chris Quinn previously in Canada that the BRT was operating in its own
designated ROW. He stated that the conversion issue is fairly straight
forward to assess in any corridor where RTD would consider BRT.
Director Sisk asked if his memory was correct that RTD paid $2.2 million for
NAMS. He wondered if RTD had completely scrapped the plan or if it was
still viable. Bill Van Meter replied that as was previously referenced to by
Chris Quinn, the top priority determined from NAMS was completion of
Northwest rail. That remains a priority and has not changed for the agency.
The top BRT corridor was SH119. Staff is proceeding forward with support
from Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) funds, as well as
RTD funds, to do a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis and
preliminary engineering. He noted in the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) the
Board adopted last year there was $15 million allocated as a first increment
toward actual capital construction in last year of the SBP. This is a real
commitment made by the Board toward that top BRT priority. Bill Van Meter
pointed out another key recommendation was to address the reverse
commute on North I-25 and bus on shoulder opportunities. He is pleased
and excited about Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) awarding
themselves a grant to move forward on a study. RTD will be assisting with
local match for a study on reverse bus-on-shoulder operations for I-25 North.
Director Sisk noted that having been part of Northwest Area Mobility Study
and having worked on a fairly integral basis, he believes it is important to
keep NAMS moving forward. The consensus was not exclusive to just the
Northwest Rail but just a prong of what was agreed upon by stakeholders.
Director Sisk addressed that Bill Van Meter and Chris Quinn had answered
the question in the way he had remembered so he was happy.
Packet Pg. 6

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 5, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

of the things his department found during the Northeast Area Transit Study
II (NATE II) is they often heard people saying that an option is to start with
BRT and then convert it to rail. In that corridor staff found a lot of feasibility
challenges. Chris Quinn believes it has been done in Ottawa Canada;
however, given the corridors that RTD is looking at such as SH 119 there
are many associated challenges with this conversion option. Director Lubow
further inquired if they would be addressing which corridors would be easily
convertible to rail.

6.A

Director Francone expressed that she would like to further add to Director
Bagley’s comments. Director Francone would like staff to consider things
like the Jefferson County Parkway project, which is currently at ground level
right now so she believes there is an opportunity to evaluate BRT. Bill Van
meter responded that there are a number of candidate corridors throughout
the District that staff intend to look at and plan to involve stakeholders and
DRCOG to help identify all the opportunities.
Director Solano stated that it was his understanding that SH 2 did not have
shoulder width for BRT consideration. He wondered if that was true. Chris
Quinn responded that there is some reconstruction happening on the SH 2.
He said even though RTD is probably not getting exclusive lanes
constructed, there is still opportunity for bus-on-shoulder, que jumps, etc.
Director Solano asked what timeframe RTD was looking at for
implementation of NATE II. Chris Quinn responded that a high level
conceptual study was done. RTD would need to do a NEPA, similar to what
we are doing on SH 119. That would be the next step to get closer to
implementation.
Director Anderson believes the Board members would benefit from being
open minded in regard to various transit issues and recognizing that most of
them would not be resolved in any of their terms of office. RTD is taking
adequate first steps in beginning to look at these issues. She noted RTD
started major investment studies 25 years before even beginning FasTracks.
The transit solution may not look like how the Board sees it today. Director
Anderson would like to see all the communities working together utilizing
the many technology and engineering advances that are developing.
Director Folska wondered if CDOT required any kind of legislative authority
to provide public transit within the RTD district. Bill Van Meter replied that
he was not sure about the legal restrictions or opportunities but as they are
operating Bustang today he believes they are allowed to operate
transportation.
Director Folska believes CDOT is really trying to connect communities
outside the District into RTD. She asked Bill Van Meter to find out about
Packet Pg. 7

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 5, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Sisk inquired if the Planning Department was working on any
Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grants in
connection with bus-on-shoulder on North I-25. Bill Van Meter responded
that they were not for this year; however, staff would possibly look into it in
2017. CDOT is not comfortable supporting it at this time. CDOT wants a
completed study so they have a better understanding of scope, cost and
challenges for the N I-25 bus-on-shoulder.

6.A

Director Folska stated that there is currently a lot of studies going on, many
of which seem to be overlapping with the NAMS that cost RTD $2.2 million.
She questioned if staff found redundancy in all of these different studies.
Director Folska proposed that they instead incorporate the finding of NAMS
and pull all the monies together to do one study. Bill Van Meter replied that
was exactly what staff has been thinking about. Staff plans to take what
was done in NAMS and apply it to the rest of the region to allow for a more
efficient study.
Committee Chair James commented that he would like the Planning
Department to think outside the box and that he has concerns that today’s
solutions are sometimes the mode du jour. He would like them to recall that
many years ago in one of the first studies on Colfax was the street car study
which has led RTD to the direction it is now. He wonders to what degree
staff is considering those kinds of alternatives in present studies. Bill Van
Meter stated that the developments in on demand transit have been part of
a national discussion. His department is internally looking at how RTD best
maximizes RTD’s relationship with those providers. He anticipates his
department will look at corridors for BRT with highest ridership potential;
however, what staff learns in terms of the impact of on demand transit and
how it impacts our services is hard to understand right now.
General Manager Genova added that staff is having ongoing conversations
about on demand transit. Staff is currently working with Denver Metro
Chamber, CDOT, and DRCOG on a project called mobility blue print to look
beyond the normal kinds of options that we do today. This group is in the
process of putting together a Request for Information (RFI) to look to
industry to see how we might be able to scope an effort around that. He
indicated staff is engaged in these kinds of planning efforts with other major
stakeholders in the region.
Committee Chair James responded that this process will serve as context for
BRT study.

CDOT’s authority to operate within the District. Director Folska asked what
RTD’s commitment to the study on reverse I-25 commute. She also
wondered the total cost of the study. Bill Van Meter stated that he would
need to confirm the exact number but believes it is approximately $17,000 $20,000, less than half of the local match. The total cost is in the $300350 hundred thousand range.

6.A

Lacy Bell, Planning Project Manager, stated that last year she was not
working on the East Colfax Transit improvements but was instead involved
in the fare study. Since she was newish to the project she wanted to get
some background information on route 15 and 15L. She was aware that
this service has our highest ridership but was surprised to learn that it is
higher than the W-Line as well as the Flatiron Flyer with an average of 22K
per weekday. She explained that there are two related projects occurring,
the Colfax Corridor Connections led by the City and County of Denver, and
the 15L Route Improvements led by RTD. She reviewed a Power Point
presentation that is available in the April 5, 2016 Planning and Development
Committee Agenda Packet.
The activities that have occurred as part of the Colfax Corridor Connections
Project are:
 In 2010 Denver completed the Colfax Streetcar Feasibility Study
(CSFS).

In 2011 Denver initiated a $3 million Alternatives Analysis
(AA)/environmental documentation study:
o $2 million of funding from Federal Transit Administration FTA
o $1 million of funding provided by Denver
 In 2015 the Alternatives Analysis/environmental documentation study
was completed with the preferred alternative selective being with Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT)
 Anticipated completion of environmental documentation is in spring
2016.
 Next steps are to identify funding for implementation of engineering
design and construction.
Lacy Bell noted that as a result of the Colfax Corridor Connections, BRT is
being considered as a viable alternative. The BRT would include:
 5 minute peak period service and enhanced stops from Auraria to
Anschutz
 Providing a peak period bus only lane from Broadway to Syracuse
Street
She shared that the 15L Route Improvements Project goal is to implement
improvements that will work for day and support future BRT enhancements.
The hope is to look at short-term opportunities to improve transit on East
Colfax while working with the city toward the long-term goal of BRT. The
project limits are 25 stops between Broadway and I-25. The total project
budget is approximately $11 million with RTD contributing the local match
for all grants at approximately $2 million total. Lacy Bell explained that 15L

Packet Pg. 9

• East Colfax Transit Improvements

6.A

She stated 15L operational improvements include bus bulbs/curb extensions
(sidewalk extended to edge of the parking lane so the bus stops in the travel
lane), queue bypass lanes and transit signal priority (TSP). The next current
action items include environmental clearance and engineering design. The
next step is to develop the construction/implementation schedule based on
design reviews.
Chair Tobiassen thanked Lacey Bell for the great presentation. He is excited
to see the upcoming improvements to Colfax. Director Tobiassen asked if
the security cameras that are being installed would have real time video
recording capacity. Lacy Bell replied that these security cameras would be
like RTD’s other security cameras already installed. She said this depends
on if we can connect to fiber and if there are places we can mount. Chair
Tobiassen stated there is always a chance that other grants might be
available for security improvements.
Chair Tobiassen further added that one of the problems the 15L has today is
if one bus runs late, all the other buses do not pass and stay in sequence.
He wonders how staff envisions handling that kind of issue. Lacy Bell
replied that this kind of problem is difficult because it is such a popular
route. She explained that one of the reasons the buses cannot pass is there
are passengers getting off at almost every stop. She is hopeful these
improvements, as well as a dedicated lane in the future, will improve
operations.
Director Lubow stated how glad she is that people are working on the
crowding issue on the 15 and 15L routes. Regarding 15L project budget
Director Lubow asked Lacy Bell to confirm that RTD investment amount
would be $2 million in total. Lucy Bell replied that the 15L Project Budget
total was $11 million and the RTD’s contribution would be $2 million.
Director Lubow asked if there would be greater operational cost or less
associated with these improvements. Lacy Bell indicated that due to this
line being so popular the cost will more than likely remain the same;

Packet Pg. 10

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 5, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Bus Stop Enhancement suggestions have included extensive public
feedback. The enhancements now include:
 Security cameras
 Improved lighting
 Enhanced shelters with better visibility
o Include trash cans and benches
o Modular with the ability to expand at high ridership stops
o Enhancements will be incorporated into Bus Rapid Transport
BRT stops

6.A

Director Walker stated that he was familiar with a lot of the 15L problems
being raised in tonight’s meeting. He shared on Broadway the bulb outs
were constructed and it makes for such a nice environment and a more
pleasant, walkable area. He believes there are a lot of benefits for the
community when all parties work together. Director Walker asked if the
security camera would be placed on RTDs shelters or elsewhere. Lacy Bell
explained that RTD security prefers that the cameras be placed elsewhere
due to the bus shelters not allowing the cameras a wide enough view. She
stated that her department will work on this issue through the design
process.
Director Walker wondered who would be responsible for maintenance at the
stops. Lacy Bell stated that maintenance details still needed to be worked
out. She hopes to have a good, collaborative discussion with the City of
Denver because these changes will benefit all parties. Director Walker noted
that the Business Improvement District on Broadway takes care of some of
the stops. He thinks this looks great and is looking forward to it
progressing.
Director Francone stated that, on behalf of her nieces and nephews that ride
the 15L every day, she would like to thank staff for these upcoming
operational improvements and bus stop enhancements. Director Francone
inquired if there is an anticipated completion date. Lacy Bell explained that
the grant funds are programmed for 2016-2019. She said it depends on
how quickly we can get through the design review as to when RTD will start
and end construction.
Director Deadwyler thanked Lacy Bell for such a beautiful report. She
wondered if there would be a dedicated lane for BRT and buses, and if so,
would Colfax be widened. Lacy Bell answered that for 15L improvements
the plan is to work with what is there. For the City’s project they have been
very adamant that they are not in favor of solving congestion by widening
streets. Director Deadwyler asked if that meant Colfax would just be one
lane for cars. She expressed concern this would only create more
congestion. Lacy Bell replied that during peak period just one lane would be
used for cars. She explained that the City has gone out and done traffic
analysis and gone out to communities. The City has determined traffic
impacts are not significant enough to be a concern.
Committee Chair James said it was interesting to see what is going on along
Colfax and thanked Lacy Bell for the update.

Packet Pg. 11

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 5, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

however, staff is hoping with improved operations and reliability of the 15L
there might be a reduction in operation costs.

6.A

D. Other Matters

Director Walker advised that last night he attended the Denver City Council meeting
voting to approve the I-25 station area master plan. He said the number one
concern brought up at that meeting, and throughout study process, was parking. If
there is a development proposal for property RTD owns, parking is something that
we will have to be very mindful of. Citizens have a big concern that the overflow
parking will result in an increase of people parking in neighborhood streets.
Director James asked for an update about the parking analysis that is underway.
General Manager Genova reminded the Board that last month Bill Sirois, Senior
Manager of Transit Oriented Development and Planning Coordination, did briefing
on that project. Denver is very aware of RTD’s concerns about parking. RTD and
Denver are working together to resolve any concerns. Bill Van Meter stated that
staff plans to report back to board at the next committee meeting on the progress
of the parking technical assessment to-date.

B. Recommended Actions

• Longmont Free Fare Buy Up
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
RTD approve a new contract with Boulder County to allow the County to
continue to buy up fares on all four of the Longmont local fixed route
services, herein referenced as “the 300 series.” Specifically the 300 series
are routes 323, 324, 326 and 327 and complementary Access-a-Ride
services for a period of an additional 18 months.
Motion:

Director Lubow made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the April 19, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Brian Matthews, Manager of Special Service, explained that
Boulder County would like to continue to “buy up” all fares on
the 300 series routes in Longmont for an additional 18
months. Boulder County feels this program will continue to
serve their low income population. As with the program
before there is no cost to RTD. Director Bagley noted that
boardings have effectively doubled since this program was
initiated. He expressed his concern about the precedent this
“buy up” is setting in the City of Longmont. He wants to
make sure there were no promises made that this would
continue if Boulder County decided not to “buy up” the fares.
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,

• University of Colorado A Line (no back-up)
Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager of Capital Program,
shared that staff wanted to review the process for the opening next week.
He said we are on schedule to open on April 22. Though there have been
challenges staff is overcoming these obstacles.
Adrian Mabry, Manager of Projects and Contracts, reviewed the following
events
 Thursday, April 21, 2016 – 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm – VIP Reception –
Westin DIA – Transportation will be provided via the University of
Colorado A-Line at Union Station or 40th and Airport beginning at
4:30 p.m. There is a video presentation at 7:00 p.m. and the last
train will leave the airport at 9:00 p.m.
 Friday, April 22, 2016 – 7:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. – University of
Colorado A Line Grand Opening Day Ribbon Cutting Events – There
are a series of ribbon cutting events with the first starting at 7:30
a.m. There is also a ribbon cutting at 40th and Airport and the Grand
Opening Ceremony at the DIA Plaza. This will be from 10:00 a.m. to
12:00 p.m. After the last ribbon cutting the University of Colorado
A-Line will be open until 9:00 p.m.
 Saturday, April 23, 2016 – 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. – University of

There will be free rides on all lines from 5:00 am until end-of-service
for that day. The University of Colorado A-Line will operate until
10:00 p.m. and then begin revenue service on Sunday
Director Folska asked how many invitations had been sent out for the VIP
event. Adrian Mabry responded that well over 1000 invites had been sent
out and each invitee could bring a guest. The VIP RSVP list currently stands
at 1040. Committee Chair Anderson stated that this opening was going to

be an exciting week that everyone was looking forward to. She thanked the
staff.

Nataly Erving, Senior Service Planner/Scheduler, reviewed a PowerPoint
presentation that was included in the April 12, 2016 Operations and
Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet. It outlined a comparison of
US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Flatiron Flyer ridership performance of the
US36 Corridor from January 2012 (Before the US36 Construction) to
August 2015 (Completion of US36 Construction Phase I) and January 2016
(Start of US36 BRT Flatiron Flyer Service).In 2012 there were 12 patterns
along this US36 corridor and it made it confusing for the passengers. This
has been consolidated to 6 patterns in this corridor, making it easier and less
confusing.
Nataly Erving shared that the ridership increase from January 2012 to
January 2016 was 66.8%. She said the ridership pattern breakdown has
shown that the FF1 carries the majority of the corridor ship with an increase
from 4,000 average weekday ridership in 2012 to 6,000 average weekday
ridership in 2016, followed by FF2 and FF4 performing strongly in this
corridor. She stated demand is still very similar but overall ridership numbers
are up; specifically, ridership has increased throughout the entire day, not
just peak periods. This shows that the 15 minute all-day bidirectional
service plan is working. There is a lot more activity within the corridor, not
just Boulder/Denver centric as it was before. She pointed out the intent of
the plan was to do just that so staff is pleased with the results so far.
Director Folska asked if staff could find out what the population density
increase has been for this corridor from 2012 to 2016. Nataly Erving stated
that she would look into that for Director Folska.
Director Sisk stated that he felt it was great to see this flourishing. He
inquired about how staff monitors growth in the community and how to
know when additional service is needed.
Nataly Erving answered that by using daily monitoring from ride check data,
fare box revenue, etc., it allows staff to recognize where the demand is
coming from. She said as RTD’s service standards warrant, staff will make
adjustments as best they can.
Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, stated that
customers in this corridor are not shy in contacting the RTD in order to
express their needs and any problems or shortfalls they are experiencing
using the RTD services.

Director Sisk pointed out that there are beautiful stations that are still under
construction, mainly the McCaslin Station. He said he is concerned about
public safety in these areas especially at night when visibility is not as good.
He stated it is not mission accomplished yet and wondered when this might
be finished. Nataly Erving said that she speaks with the project coordinators
at least once a week. She shared they are going through their punch list
and initially thought they would be finished in the middle of April; however,
there have been weather conditions that delayed the timelines. She indicated
the team is being diligent that all their items on their punch list are
completed.
Director Hoy shared that he and Nataly have become a good team and work
together to respond to customer issues. He said he was happy that the
constituents were becoming more messengers of information rather than
complainers. He asked Nataly Erving not to abandon him next week with all
the upcoming runboard changes as he does have a little bit of angst. Nataly
Erving stated staff would be watching very closely at the Sheridan station to
address any issues quickly.
Director Folska asked if staff could specifically articulate the criteria or
factors that indicate a need to increase service. Nataly Erving answered that
she works within the service standards that are given to her by the Board. If
there is a fully seated load and the trip before and the trip after are also fully
seated then that indicates we are at capacity and additional service might be
warranted. She noted if there is a fully seated load but the trip before and
after have capacity then staff will look to make minor trip adjustments to try
and balance the loads. She stated it is a very fine tuned tweaking process.
Director Folska stated the Super Bowl Parade situation as an example of
high capacity demand but a one off situation that staff probably would not
use in evaluating capacity. She wondered if there is a timeframe around
evaluating capacity before determining that it has been met Director Folska
requested that this information be sent to her in an e-mail format. Jessie

Bruce Abel stated that he is aware that we have two styles of monitoring
happening for the US36 Corridor today. He said what Nataly Erving outlined
is at the micro level. He explained on the macro level staff monitors the
build out of various communities and work with stakeholders to monitor
what is coming down the pipe. Bruce Abel gave an example of Google
moving into Boulder. He shared when the service plan was first
implemented the community said we needed to increase service to Boulder
Junction because Google is building there; however, while staff agrees that
more service will be needed in the future, Google is not there today. This is
an example of needing to work with the community and Google to
understand the timeline for when the demand might occur.

6.B

Committee Chair Anderson asked if the opening of the Eagle project would
affect any of the routes from Boulder, specifically the routes between
Boulder and Anschutz. She has had constituents asking her this question.
Nataly Erving answered there would be some impacts. The AB will be
rerouted along the Northwest Parkway because the demand at the
Broomfield and Westminster Park-n-Rides do not warrant direct service to
DIA. Passengers who want to get to the airport from those stations will still
have multiple options available. Nataly Erving said that as it relates to
Anschutz, she anticipates some shifting with the opening of the R-Line
which is why staff will closely monitor what happens on the FF5. At this
time she does not know what changes, if any, might be proposed.

• Proposed August 2016 Service Change
Bruce Abel reminded the Board that the process is to present draft
recommendations to the Board, solicit public comment, and then come back
to the Board with final recommendations for approval. Jessie Carter
characterized the August service changes as typical; however, there are two
notable changes. The first is the new Route 62 which will provide service
from Central Park Boulevard Station to Commerce City. This route is grant
funded so it is at no cost to RTD. Staff hopes to see strong ridership. The
second item is an increase on the service on the Free Metro Ride from a 6
minute headway down to a 4 ½ minute frequency. Staff believes this will
be needed with the opening of the University of Colorado A-Line line in April.
Director Francone asked if Jessie Carter could explain to her about the
CV/CS/CX conversion of a trip. Jessie Carter explained that one CV trip
leaving Civic Center Station would be converted to a Route CS trip so it
would now serve Federal Center Station as well.
Director Francone recognized the performance of the Lockheed Martin Call-nRide had been iffy. She asked if there were any new ridership numbers.
Brian Matthews, Manager of Special Services, stated at last count it was
doing okay with 4 to 5 passengers per trip.
Director Lubow asked about the BOLT service change that would convert 4
morning trips and 3 evening trips to express routes. Nataly Erving explained
that staff was working with the City of Longmont regarding this. There was
a request for such a service. This addresses the request for a faster trip and
for a connection to Boulder Junction from Longmont. She stated if
successful, there will be further conversations about how to move forward.

Packet Pg. 18

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 12, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Carter answered that his department would forward this information to
Director Folska.

Director Lubow asked for more information about the
consolidation/elimination of exception stops for Routes BOLT, J and L within
Longmont. Nataly Erving that the currently the exception stops are very
confusing as they are different for each route. Staff and the City of
Longmont met to review the entire list of stops to consolidate the exception
stops along all three routes to make it easier for commuters. Director
Lubow thanked staff as she agreed the old schedule was very confusing.
Director Menten noted with the proposed change of the 5:07 p.m. Route CV
staff was also proposing trip adjustments for the westbound trips of up to
10 minutes. She wondered how many trips that affected. Jessie Carter
stated at this point of time he could not say as the final schedule has not yet
been written. He committed to come back to Director Menten when he was
able to provide the actual schedule.
Director Menten inquired if any progress had been made with regards to
getting the TSA employees to the airport. Jessie Carter stated that route AT
changes in the service plan for April will get people to the airport by 3:15
a.m. which satisfies the 3:30 a.m. request; however, nothing has been set
for Stapleton or Central Park Boulevard Station as of now.
Director Menten noted that service change hearings were scheduled in
Longmont, Denver and Commerce City. She wondered if there was any
reason one might be needed on the West side considering the changes for
Routes 1, 3, 11, 16, 28, 7 and the 6. Jessie Carter answered that these are
all primarily related to our standard school adjustments so he did not see a
reason to have one on the West side; however, the meetings in Commerce
City and Longmont are because of the new services and the very confusing
stop consolidation that Nataly Erving just explained.

• Lost Service Hours Update
Bruce Abel stated that a report on lost service hours was included in the
April 12, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet,
which he is calling the tale of two cities. On the negative side there was an
overall increase in the number of lost service hours; however, if we factor
out the two snow days on March 23 & March 24 where our 4” to 6”
forecast turned into a 16” to 18”, March has a marked improvement.
He believes that although we have not yet turned the corner, April to-date is
looking very positive in terms of our performance as we continue to reduce
our lost hours of service.

• Hiring Update

Director Archuleta asked how many drivers we were short. Bruce Abel
stated that we are under 100 short, which is the lowest number we have
had in many years. He said when he looked on Monday the number was 83,
so he is happy to see improvements in that arena and he is hoping it
continues to manifest in even lower lost service hours going forward.

D. Other Matters
Committee Chair Anderson shared that she recently attended a transportation
meeting in Adams County. During the meeting, Excel Energy made a presentation
about locating a substation in Thornton. There are currently three places in
Thornton that Excel would like to locate a substation as Thornton is running out of
reliable power in the area. Committee Chair Anderson said she brought up the
subject of transportation and how power can impact the on-time operations for our
buses, for example if traffic signals are not working and cause a traffic jam. She
was asked to address the Thornton City Council, which she declined but wonders if
the Board should express to the Thornton City Council how important reliable
electric power is to on-time performance of buses and the future operations of the
Northwest Rail via a letter from Chair Tobiassen.
Director Hoy commented that the substation issue has been going on for a long
time and he feels it really should be resolved; however, he did not connect it with
traffic signals not working He believes the trains have their own power brought in
to ensure they run.
Director Sisk commented that we need to tread carefully in the way we approach
our communications with city councils as he is not sure a letter from the RTD Board
on this topic would be well received. He would have qualms sending any letter that
can be viewed as invasive of what is really their decision.
Director Walker does not think it is beyond the bounds of appropriate for RTD to
express concerns to city councils, city managers, etc. about issues that could
affect agency operations because it is all connected. He thinks RTD needs to be
considered as part of the City as what we do effects the operations, functionality

Bruce Abel stated included in the April 12, 2016 Operations and Customer
Service Committee Agenda Packet is a report tracking operator hiring and
training. Staff’s objective is to have at least 20 participants attending
classes every other week. During April staff was successful in maintaining
class numbers in the high teens. He indicated his team would continue to
work with HR to address our staffing challenges. He pointed out that as
hiring and training improve we can see it has a direct result on our lost
service hours going down. He stated mandated overtime is still part of the
equation but beginning to go down as well.

6.B

and economics of our cities. He would be in support of sending some type of
letter.
Director Anderson said that in listening to Director Sisk and to take it out of the
realm of politics, it may be better to have communication be from staff. Director
Hoy stated that he agreed communication from staff to staff made sense.
General Manager Genova indicated staff would follow-up with the City.

• Adoption of 2017 Performance Measures
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
that the Board of Directors adopts the attached 2017 Performance
Measures for mission statement goals 1-7.
There are 23 specific
performance measures in total, and it is proposed that an additional goal
be added (goal 3.2) for a total of 24.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the April 19, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial
Analysis, reminded the Board that staff brings this to them
now because the performance measures are used in
development of the Strategic Budget Plan and 2017
Recommended Budget. She outlined the changes as follows:
 Performance Measure 3.1 – Local On-Time Bus Service be
reduced to 86% from 88% and Reginal On-Time Service to
92% from 94% as a results of more accurate data
collection and a peer review analysis
 Performance Measure 3.2 – Add system-wide service
availability measure for Bus at 97%, which is considered a
realistic measure as availability was 98% in 2013, 97% in
2014, and 96% in 2015

Discussion:

6.C



Performance Measure 3.3 – Increase Mileage between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls from 28K to 30K miles as
a result of having newer buses in the fleet

Director Francone commented that in addition to decreasing
the on-time performance percentage for measure 3.1, there
was also mention of adding an additional $2 million in
resources to reach that goal. She asked staff for further
information. Heather Copp explained that staff cannot meet
the 2016 goal of 86%/94% on-time performance with current
resources. She stated if the Board wanted to keep the goals
where they are today, staff has determined it would require an
additional $2 million to attain the goals.
Director Francone wondered what the $2 million would
address. Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus
Operations, said he was going to get into Transit Scheduling
101. He explained that schedules are driven by how long it
takes a bus to make a cycle. If a bus makes one cycle in an
hour, RTD can maintain 60 minute frequency with one bus;
however, as traffic and congestion increase, if the bus now
takes 65 minutes to complete a cycle, a bus must be added to
maintain the frequencies. If a bus is not added and the
schedule not changed, the bus will not be on-time. He stated
the additional funding would be to add buses to routes as
needed to improve on-time performance.
Director Folska wondered what impacts staff foresaw with all
the changes going on this year. She feels this action is
premature as we still have four rail openings this year. Bruce
Abel stated he would not characterize this as premature but
long overdue. He shared that prior to 2011, service monitors
would stand at a corner and observe the buses that went by.
As a result of this methodology there were approximately 240
single-point observations per day. In 2011 the methodology
was changed to a GPS based system. The number of
observations increased to over 18K per day, scattered
throughout the District. He said with nothing changing but the
methodology, on-time performance went from 88-90% to
83%.
Packet Pg. 25

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 12, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

She pointed out that performance measures 6.2 and 6.3
would be established though the 2017 Annual Budget process.
She noted that 2016 performance measures may be adjusted
before staff brings the 2016 Amended Budget to the Board for
approval.

6.C

Director Walker shared that he has been riding the Route 0 for
10-12 years and he thinks it is pretty bold to only drop the ontime performance to 86%. He commented that what was
once a reliable 35 minute bus ride now stretches out to 45
minutes or more. He thinks it is irrelevant that all the lines are
opening as not everyone will take the train. He is in support
of changing the on-time performance measures as if goals are
not attainable they are useless. He hopes the Board will make
the performance measures meaningful.
Director Deadwyler asked how we inform people if buses are
going to be late due to increased travel time. Bruce Abel
indicated these were addressed as part of the routine service
change process that happens three times a year. If a bus can
be added within our financial constraints a bus is added; if not
then the schedule is adjusted.
Director Lubow expressed concern hearing that Director
Walker’s trip now takes 10 minutes longer. She wonders if
that could have been addressed by adding another bus. Bruce
Abel explained that the trip length is not affected by adding
another bus. That would be due to increased traffic, changing
light cycles, etc. He said adding another bus would allow us
to maintain service frequencies as total trip times increase.
Director Lubow worries there is some creeping trouble that is
below the radar.
Director Lubow shared that she is also concerned about
lowering a standard. She believes the deeper question is if it
is important to spend $2 million to get better service;
however, she thinks that if we are not hearing from irate
customers perhaps the additional funding is not really needed.
Bruce Abel shared that from a reliability standpoint, a bus not
Packet Pg. 26

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 12, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska said she wonders what happened to the
customer satisfaction survey that RTD paid $1.4 million to a
company in Kansas City to perform. Bruce Abel stated that
customer satisfaction survey results are included as part of the
quarterly reports given at the Operations and Customer
Service Committee Meetings. Director Folska stated for $1.4
million she would have expected a formal report, not just
information that seems like it would come from our Customer
Care Division. She said it would make her feel better to see
something formal about the survey.

6.C

Bruce Abel stated that staff is just trying to acknowledge the
reality of the situation. He shared an example of the on-time
performance goal for Utah at 95%. He said the way they
meet this goal is to schedule buses to operate so slowly that
customers call to complain because the operator is sitting on
the side of the road to not be ahead of schedule. He pointed
out there are many ways to achieve on-time performance but
RTD staff balances the goals with the needs of the riders
instead.
Director Anderson believes the Board needs to look at the
numbers. She said she is not willing to spend $2 million for an
increase of just 2% when there are other places the $2 million
can be spent.
Director Francone said she respectfully disagrees with Director
Anderson. She thinks the $2 million is worth it, especially
since we just increased fares. She stated that reliability for
our customers really encourages ridership and keeps it strong.
She does not support lowering the performance measure.
Director Francone asked for an explanation of the 24th
performance measured that Jannette Scarpino referenced as
being added. Jannette Scarpino said that was the addition of
the measurement for system wide service availability for bus.
Director Bagley thinks with all the changes that are happening
this year, now is not the time to throw more service at on-time
performance. He believes the recommendation to look more
realistically at the measurement would be better at this time
and is consistent with staff’s recommendation.
Director Walker acknowledged that he sees more traffic during
his commute now than several years ago. He said the length
of the trip does not affect his satisfaction as he knows it is out
of the drivers control; however, if he is waiting on the corner
expecting a bus at 7:16 and it is not there until 7:26 that is
when he has a problem. He wonders if this will not be quite
as important with the new transit app. He believes keeping
the standards at an unattainable level make the drivers’ jobs
more difficult trying to meet schedules they cannot meet. He
thinks the Board needs to give everyone in this agency a break
and give them a goal they can actually meet.

showing up is far more important than a bus that is five
minutes late.

Chair Tobiassen shared that the reality for him is that he is not
getting complaints from constituents who are unhappy with
on-time performance. If he does hear from a constituent it is
because a particular bus is continually late. He said he if
finding that more and more riders are using the app and not
even using our schedules. He does not think changing the ontime performance number will significantly improve any
perception of on-time performance. Additionally, he noted
that spreading $2 million over the entire system would not be
appreciated by anyone in particular. He stated using real
numbers based on real data makes sense to him.
Director Folska feels that after everything RTD went through
last year with the fare study, the public will see this as RTD
raising fares and then reducing our performance standards.
She asked what will keep staff from coming year after year
and continuing to lower the standard. She stated she cannot
support lowering on-time performance as the rational does not
make sense to her.
Director Deadwyler said her District must be different than
others because she constantly receives complaints that the
buses are not on-time. She is concerned that RTD will
continue to lower goals every year when something is not
working. If we need to add more service to improve on-time
performance then that is what we need to do. She said
people need to make sure they can get from point A to point B
when they think they will get there. Director Deadwyler thinks
that longer travel times are not just from traffic, but also
because there are more riders so it takes longer for them to
board. She shared she hears about drivers who are under
such pressure to meet their goals that they may be short with
customers when they are trying to board. She stated she
cannot support lowering the on-time performance at this time.
Motion to
Amend:

Chair Tobiassen made the motion to amend goal
3.1 to keep the performance measure at 88%
for Local On-Time Bus Service and at 94% for
Regional On-Time Bus Service.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Anderson expressed that it seemed one of the goals
was arbitrarily changed by the Board last year as well. She

Director Anderson asked if anything was really achieved by
leaving the measures the same. She stated the Board can play
with these numbers but it does not make any difference other
than RTD throwing more money at it. Heather Copp reiterated
that staff is just trying to illustrate that if the Board does not
change the on-time performance staff will not make the goal
without additional funding. She said if the Board truly wants
to reach the 88%/94%, the Board will have to fund it. If it is
just symbolic than the Board does not need to do anything;
however, she would think the Board would want to achieve
the goals. Director Anderson asked where the additional $2
million might come from with sales and use tax revenues
going down. Heather Copp stated it would be part of the
2017 budget discussion.
Director Bagley asked if Chair Tobiassen’s motion included
spending an extra $2 million. Chair Tobiassen stated it does
not. It is simply to keep the performance measures as they
are today.
Director Folska noted this was the second quarter of 2016.
She wondered if staff had locked in the diesel fuel prices yet
for 2017. Heather Copp said that conversation would happen
as staff moved through the Strategic Budget Plan and 2017
Recommended Budget. Director Folska stated that might have
resulted in $10 million that RTD could have saved this year, of
which $2 million could have been allocated. Heather Copp
explained that staff did lock in for 2016 in 2015, which was a
savings of around $7.5 million. She shared that staff had not
done the analysis to determine if it made sense to lock in for
2017 yet. It is very premature at this time.
Director Folska inquired if RTD had a vendor for a fuel lock in
2017. General Manager Genova explained that right now RTD
is in the final year of a multi-year contract. A new contract
will need to be executed for 2017 and beyond. He said
requests for proposals are due back May 5 so he anticipates
having a contact shortly.
Director Folska thought it would have been traditional for us to
lock in fuel prices for 2017 in December of last year. She
Packet Pg. 29

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 12, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

believes the Board has all the information before them that this
measure needs to be lowered. Bruce Abel stated last year
staff made the same recommendation for 2016 but ultimately
it was approved at 88%/94% then as well.

remembers having that discussion recently. Heather Copp
stated during the last Board Budget Workshop they discussed
that staff would typically lock in fuel prices in the fall; so for
2017 staff would typically lock in during fall of 2016.
Director Folska stated she distinctly recalled having a
conversation about locking in fuel prices in the fall of 2015 for
2016, but our contract did not get renewed with our provider.
Heather Copp thinks there was some confusion as typically for
2016 we would lock in late in 2015; however, last year staff
decided to lock in the summer timeframe around June/July
rather than in the fall. She explained that this year staff was
still determining if it made sense to lock. Director Folska is
very clear that there were different details and requested the
notes from that meeting.
Committee Chair Menten indicated she would be supporting
the amendment. She pointed out that nothing states
achieving the goal requires RTD to spend $2 million, but it is
important to her that the customers have reliability. She
believes that people that do not have a phone need to have
peace of mind as well.
Director Anderson asked for it to be clear that spending an
additional $2 million is not part of the amendment. Chair
Tobiassen stated that was correct. Any additional funding
would be part of the budget conversation at a later date.

C. Updates

• Sales and Use Tax Forecast Update
Doug MacLeod, Controller, reminded the Board that RTD receives forecasts
from CU Leeds School of Business twice per year in March and September.
He said the March forecast is used during the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
and Amended Budget. The September forecast is used for the next year’s
budget. He introduced Robert McNown and Brian Lewandowski from the
CU Leeds School of Business (Leeds). Robert McNown reviewed a Power
Point presentation that is available in the April 12, 2016 Financial
Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.
Robert McNown stressed that there is a lot of uncertainty involved in
forecasting. He shared that the short-term and medium-term forecasts are
affected by employment, real gross domestic product, personal income, and
retail sales and taxable sales; the long-term forecasts focus on changes in
population and age distribution which affect savings, labor supply,
productivity, output, and household expenditures.
Robert McNown noted that the rate of job growth and personal income
increase in Colorado has outpaced the National average; however,
employment growth has peaked and is starting to trend down to a slightly
lower rate. He pointed out that Colorado’s housing market is strong, but
that also means consumers might have less disposable income if they need
to spend more on housing as there have been dramatic increases in price.
Robert McNown reiterated that there is always forecast uncertainty, which
requires CU Leeds to make frequent revisions as new information becomes
available. He pointed to a graph of Moody’s Gross Domestic Product
Expectations from March of 2014 through September of 2016 to illustrate
how much just one component of their forecasts could change in a relatively
short period of time. He explained that the main factors that would impact
the 2016-2017 revenues would be:
 Growing, but slowing, Colorado employment, sales, and personal
income expectations
Packet Pg. 31

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED as amended.

6.C

Exports
Decreasing oil prices
Sales tax remittances from Amazon

Robert McNown stated that the short-term forecasts were strong for 2016
and 2017 but were lower than their September forecasts. Total sales and
use tax increases are projected at 6.38% and 5.64% respectively. He said
that Sales and Use Tax will continue to increase over the long-term but the
rate of increase will begin to slow. This is a reflection of slower growth in
general economic conditions for the nation and state. He shared that in
conducting a comparison with the Colorado Legislative Council and the
Office of State Planning and Budgeting the Leeds forecasts are in line with
these agencies.
Robert McNown reiterated that the integrity of the forecasts is very
important to CU Leeds. This is insured through:
 Forecasts being updated semi-annually to reflect the most current
economic situation
 Forecasts being too high or too low, reflecting uncertainty in the
economy
 Forecasts that are generated from theoretically sound economic
relations, modeled with state-of-the-art methods of modern
econometric time series analyses
 Forecasts do not incorporate “add factors” or other subjective
adjustments of model forecasts
 Leeds being independent from RTD with no political or financial stake
in the forecast numbers
Director Anderson expressed her concerns around online shopping and
Colorado’s inability to find a way to capture sales tax on online purchases.
She noted that Colorado is now getting tax from Amazon but that is only at
the state level. Heather Copp explained that currently Amazon has
volunteered to charge state income tax for online sales. She said the only
way RTD would have the ability to collect tax would be if Amazon open a
distribution center or store within the District. Director Anderson stated she
believes there will be more and more online sales that will lead to RTD’s
revenues decreasing.
Director Anderson shared that since she has been on the Board she has been
disturbed that RTD has been overly optimistic with regards to projections
and budgets. She said her preference would be for staff to not use anything
but the low forecast provided by Leeds because it is more conservative.
She would rather have money left over than have to scramble to make up
for it. Robert McNown shared those were conversations his team was

Packet Pg. 32



having with staff. Heather Copp pointed out that today our sales and use
tax would fall somewhere between the low and mid forecast.

Director Bagley reminded the Board in 2011 RTD started the Fiscal
Sustainability Task Force and hired Leeds as a result. He thinks that was a
fantastic move on the part of RTD. He said in looking at the slide that
graphs the forecast uncertainty, it appears to him the first quarter of every
year is low. He asked if it was correct to assume this is probably due to
higher consumer spending during the holiday season. Robert McNown
stated that was exactly what was going on. He shared you would see the
same pattern going back much further than 2014.
Director Lubow believes an analysis of income inequality would be useful for
Leeds to include because it answers some of those troubling problems seen
when the economy is robust but there are still many social ills. She thinks it
is risky not to address as if there is more inequality there is less stability in
the economy. Robert McNown said that was something they could
consider. He commented getting income distributions at the state level is
difficult but perhaps there are other indicators that might be useful.

• Smart Media Technology (SMT) Status Update
Heather Copp indicated the report was included in the April 12, 2016
Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet. She shared
the good news is that participants have increased from last month up to
1,240. She stated none of the statuses have changed on the program
components. She shared that staff has opened the lines of communication
with King Soopers so they are hopeful the pilot program can be up and
running rather swiftly.
There were no questions from Directors.

• Review of 2017-2022 SBP Development Process and 2017 Budget
Assumptions
Committee Chair Menten indicated that due to the late hour, this discussion
would be deferred to the Study Session on April 26, 2016 along with the
tactical plans at the request of staff. Heather Copp asked if Directors had

Packet Pg. 33

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 12, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska echoed Director Anderson’s concern. She believes erring on
the side of conservativism is good. She said she is always confused about
the unemployment numbers. It is interesting to her that we have such low
unemployment but homelessness seems to be going up. Robert McNown
explained that one source of disconnect between robust employment growth
and the evidence of homelessness is the very slow wage growth. He said
this goes hand in hand with increased inequality. The mean wages will be
biased upward by extremely high incomes in the top percentiles.

6.C

any feedback between now and the Study Session staff would love to
receive it.
Director Bagley asked when the next Board Budget workshop was
scheduled. Heather Copp stated it would be in the afternoon before the
Study Session.

Doug MacLeod indicated the report was included in the April 12, 2016
Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet. He pointed
out that sales and use tax, ridership, and fare revenue are all under budget
year-to-date. He stated that for fare revenue we are $2.4 million under
budget and sales and use tax is $2.6 million, which equals a $5 million
shortfall. He said if staff was to annualize those numbers they think we
might end up from $23 to $34 million short on revenues. He explained that
staff would be taking this into consideration as we begin the amended
budget process.
Director Bagley stated this was all the more reason not to add $2 million to
the budget for meeting the on-time performance measure.

D. Other Matters
Director Francone advised the Board that there would be a General Manager
Oversight and Performance Management Committee Meeting on April 19 at 3:30
p.m. She said the Committee should expect to hit the ground running. Director
Bagley asked what topics would be discussed. He specifically wondered if there
would be a discussion of the task goals. Director Francone shared that the
committee would review the process and draft timeline for when tasks needed to
be completed, as well as a few housekeeping items. She said the task goals may
be discussed in broad terms but she was not anticipating a thorough discussion.

April Board Meeting Agenda Review
1st Vice Chair Hoy provided the initial review of the agenda and indicated it would be a
quick meeting as we only have a few items for review.
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to approve
moving the April 19th Board agenda to the full Board.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

1st Vice Chair Hoy noted there were no retirees to be
recognized at the Board meeting and he believe this is the first
time this has happened since he has been on the Board. 2nd

1st Vice Chair Hoy walked through the agenda bullet point
mentioning that we would be having a General Manager
Oversight and Performance Management committee meeting
prior to the Board meeting on the 19th. He continued to walk
through the agenda citing the approval of Board meeting and
Committee meeting minutes.
GM Genova asked if the Chair’s script and the Chair’s report
were prepared by staff or by the Chair. Acting Executive
Director McManus indicated they were prepared by staff and
after having a discussion with Chair Tobiassen going forward
both documents would be incorporated into one for efficiency.
1st Vice Chair Hoy said he liked the approach of simplicity and
moved onto the review of the 3 items on the unanimous
consent agenda. 2nd Vice Chair Deadwyler reminded 1st Vice
Chair Hoy of the language he would need to present allowing
the Directors to sever any of these 3 actions and move them
to recommended action to be voted on independently.
1st Vice Chair Hoy asked for some clarification on the
Longmont service and ridership increases and the increased
dollar amount. GM Genova said the program was supported
by Boulder County and the City of Longmont and he went on
to explain that this model works for Longmont because it is a
contained area and why this same model would not work in
other areas. He also indicated that if service needed to
increase we would not be able to accommodate the impact
but for RTD this is found revenue. 2nd Vice Chair Deadwyler
asked in the scenario of increased ridership what would the
recourse be? GM Genova said the City of Longmont and
Boulder County would have to pick up the cost. 1st Vice Chair
Hoy stated they are seeing increased trips but not necessarily

Vice Chair Deadwyler indicated we would be doing a special
recognition for the RTD Security team who has received the
Gold Standard Award from the TSA. GM Genova said this
was the third time we have received the award and the TSA
does a full assessment every few years of the security plans
and the award addresses the merits of the overall plan.

increased ridership. Director Walker said this was much like
the Art service in Englewood which also is a good program.

1st Vice Chair Hoy moved onto the single recommended
action, the performance measures. He said as he remembered
the action was placed back to the past performance
percentages. GM Genova said he was correct the numbers
were moved back to what they have always been in the past.
1st Vice Chair Hoy asked if the changes had been made in the
Board Report moving forward to the board meeting. Acting
Executive Director McManus indicated all the corrections had
been made by Finance and the document moving forward is in
the Executive Committee packet.

Retiree Awards
Chair Tobiassen noted there were six retirees this month with four in attendance.
Interim General Manager Genova recognized Marla Lien, General Counsel with 25 years of
service. He acknowledged that she has played a major role in every RTD deal during that
time from FasTracks railroad negotiations, to our public-private partnerships, to Denver
Union Station. She has been one of the most dedicated, hardworking and committed
people that Interim General Manager Genova has known. He noted that Marla is nationally
known in the industry and her contributions to the District have been numerous. He
shared that he has been teasing her because she is going to work part-time, four days a
week. He pointed out that Marla had many things to be proud of outside her work
accolades. Her son, Adam, is in his fourth year of medical school, which brings her a
great deal of joy. Her also recognized her husband Rick who was in attendance. Interim
General Manager Genova wished her all the best as she transitioned to a new adventure.
He thanked her for all she has done for RTD and the transit industry.
Marla Lien thanked RTD for all they have done for her. She said it has been a privilege and
a chance to be involved and contribute to the region. She stated everyone over the past
25 years has helped make this organization and region great. Her job gave her a chance to
be part of that and work with such talented and dedicated individuals. She noted that this
Board and the other Boards collectively over the years charged staff to get the work done.
She commented that she is leaving at a time when she has done her part but now the
Agency will get to stand and see the fruits of all RTD has accomplished over the last 20
years. She was very proud to be part of it.
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, and Steve Gieske, General
Superintendent of Maintenance, introduced George Gill, Technical Training Instructor with
21 years of service. Bruce Abel shared that George started off as a mechanic, became a

supervisor, and is now a Technical Training Instructor. He said George plans to camp, fish
and gold in his retirement. He recognized his wife Arlene and son Ryan who were in
attendance.
Steve Gieske recognized George for his contributions. He indicated that George has been
the key instructor in the mechanic helper program to help grow our mechanics from our
internal employees. He stated this has been an outstanding and very successful program.
In fact, one of the program participants will be taking George’s position to head up the
helper program. He said he hopes staff can continue to live up to George’s standards for
the program.
George Gill thanked RTD for allowing him to work here for 21 years. He said it has been
the best job he has ever had.
Bruce Abel and Gina Callahan, Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager of Bus
Operations, introduced Magic Miljenko, a bus operator with 15 years of service. He said in
his retirement Magic plans to ski, travel and spend time with his family. Bruce Abel
thanked him for his contributions over the years.
Gina Callahan noted that she and Magic go a long way back as they drove on the Mall
together. She is excited for his opportunities in retirement.
Magic Miljenko thanked RTD for the opportunity to be on the front line for our passengers.
He said what makes this organization great is the opportunities that are given to everyone.
He thought it was a very memorable and educational experience. He learned more at RTD
than in all of his previous careers.
Bruce Abel said he would also like to recognize Robert Austin for his 45 years of service
as a bus operator. He noted that Robert has a number of hobbies, including photography,
woodworking, metal machining, meteorology and many others. He pointed out those
were just Robert’s hobbies so his retirement plans are to get busy. He pointed out that
Robert is number one on the seniority list. He thanked Robert for his years of service.
Robert Austin said he had to keep it short because he had to go home and finish some
weather reports for the news stations as that is one of his hobbies, among many others.
He shared that he was one of the first of three operators after the buyout of Denver
Tramway. He drove mostly city routes during his early years and for the last 19 years he
drove the AA. He enjoyed his time at RTD but he has a lot to do at home. His philosophy
is to do things for other people as it makes you more appreciative when you do things for
yourself.
Chair Tobiassen recognized Gary Nelson, senior accounting technician with 24 years of
service, and Royola Willrich, light rail train operator with 28 years of service, who were
unable to be in attendance. He congratulated all our retirees for their commitment to the
region.

Public Participation
Chair Tobiassen stated public participation was open to anyone that wanted to address the
Board. He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.
 Michelle Medal, Boulder, was here, with several of her fellow riders who commute
from Boulder each day, to talk about changes to the Flatiron Flyer 2, specifically the
elimination of the Dartmouth and Broadway bus stop. She shared when she first
began working in Denver she was very excited to be able to commute via bus. The
Dartmouth and Broadway stop is a very easy place to park and get on the bus. She
understands the current plan is to eliminate this stop. With the elimination of this
stop there is nowhere for her to get on the bus between her house and the Table
Mesa Park-n-Ride as the ones being kept do not have parking. She stated it would
be a very large burden for her, and others, to get to the Table Mesa Park-n-Ride,
drive around in circles to find parking, climb 4 flights of stairs, and then cross a
bridge to get to the bus. She urged RTD to consider keeping the stop at Dartmouth
and Broadway.
 David Kreutzer, Boulder, thanked Director Sisk for his communication with him and
fellow riders related to the Dartmouth and Broadway bus stop. He said he was
going to address the first and last mile issue. He believes the old system of having
the BX stop at every other stop along Broadway really solved the first-last mile
issue by making it easy for people to walk to their homes. By eliminating so many
stops, especially at Dartmouth, he thinks RTD is taking a step backward in
addressing the first-last mile problem. He explained that the total amount of time it
now takes people to get to their final destination is increased even if eliminating
some stops has decreased the travel time of the bus through that one segment.
RTD needs to focus on the total travel time of the passenger, not just the bus. He
hopes there will be further public input regarding the stops along Broadway.
 Dietrich Hoffner, Boulder, also wanted to address the stop at Broadway and
Dartmouth. He echoed everything that had already been said about the importance
of this stop. He said through conversations with RTD staff, who have been very
helpful, it seems RTD’s preferred solution is that riders take a local bus to the Table
Mesa Park-n-Ride. He indicated this would add 10-15 minutes, which is a lot of
time in both directions. He noted the Dartmouth Park-n-Ride is also used as
overflow for the Table Mesa Park-n-Ride. He thinks it would be a shame to see this
stop closed in favor of stops that do not have similar parking options.
 Doug Gragg, Denver, commended RTD for the diversity that can now be seen at
Denver Union Station. He said previously there was a lack of diversity but during
his recent trip it was evident.
 Janet Streater, Boulder, commented that three months ago RTD closed a number of
stops in South Boulder. She noted the only remaining Park-n-Rides are the very
first and very last stop as RTD closed the remaining ones. She purchased her home
because of its location to the Dartmouth and Broadway park-n-Ride. It is a very

Discussion:

Director Anderson indicated she would be voting no.
She pointed out that an article was in the Denver Post
about RTD being transparent, so in the name of
transparency she would be voting against an executive
session.
Director Hoy asked for confirmation that not having an
executive session would not prohibit the Board from
making a motion to approve the General Manager’s
contract. Rolf Asphaug, Acting General Counsel,
reminded the Board that if there was an executive
session it would be to determine if any further
negotiations need to be done or to clarify how the
proposed contract was negotiated. He said the
approval of the General Manager Contract can still
occur without an executive session.
Director Hoy wondered if he was correct that if a
Director was satisfied with the contract it may be
appropriate for that Director to vote against an
executive session. Rolf Asphaug stated if a Director
did not feel an executive session was necessary they
should vote no.
Director Folska inquired if Directors that voted against
an executive session would then be excused if the
majority chose to have an executive session. Rolf
Asphaug stated that regardless of how a Director voted
they would still have the right to be in an executive
session.
Director Folska asked if minutes from executive
sessions were eventually made public. Rolf Asphaug
stated they were not. He said they are recorded but
the recording would only be used if someone filed a
court action challenging the legality of the executive
session.

Rolf Asphaug explained that this was a debatable
motion and would require a simple majority of 8 votes
to pass.
Director Anderson pointed out that the process of hiring
a new General Manager had been going on for a solid
year. She thinks it is time for the Board to move on.
The Board agreed 13 to 0 to enter into contract
negotiations with Interim General Manager Genova.
She believes this is a good contract. She commented
that the Board has had the opportunity to look at the
contract and decide if they support it. Directors Bagley
and Francone and Interim General Manager Genova all
negotiated this contract in good faith. She stated it is
time to vote yes or no and move on.
Director Deadwyler indicated the Board received a copy
of the contract at last Tuesday’s meeting. She noted
the full Board was not there during negotiations but
believes Directors Bagley and Francone did a very good
job; however, Director Deadwyler stated there was new
information that was not shared with them during
negotiations that she felt they should have known
about. She explained that was why she wanted to
have an executive session.
Director Menten recognized that the search for the
General Manager had been a long process; however,
seeing what is in the contract is new information.
Director Menten believes the public has a right to see
the contract and have time to digest the information.
She thinks if the Board wants to be proud of the search
process allowing the public time to review the contract
is really the icing on the cake. She does not think it
hurts RTD in any way and really benefits the Board.
She acknowledged the hours put into the process by
the GM Executive Search Committee but pointed out
that she also has to look out for the taxpayers. She
asked for time for the contract to be put out in the
open and have this vote postponed for a month.

that each Director was elected by the people to
represent those people accordingly. She said if a
Director like the contract they should vote for it and if
they do not like it they should not vote for it. She
stated that holding up the process is not fair to the
Agency, the negotiating team, or Interim General
Manager Genova.
Director Lubow expressed concern about Director
Deadwyler’s statement that there is additional
information the Board should understand.
Director Solano believes it is in the best interest of the
Agency to allow the constituents’ time to react as the
Board works for them. He does not think the
constituents have had the chance, in good faith, to
come forward with their comments. He thinks there
have been problems with previous General Managers so
it is important to make sure that whoever the Board is
choosing is also the choice of the people.
Director Deadwyler stated she disagrees with some of
the statements she has heard this evening. She feels
that while the Board does represent the constituents
they do not have the final say in how a Director votes.
She noted that Interim General Manager Genova was
the choice of the public as was expressed to the Board
through the public forum. She does not like that the
contract was put out in the open. She thought there

Motion to
Call the Question:

8.A

Director James stated that whatever Director
Deadwyler was referencing was not big enough to
impact her decision to vote on the contract this
evening. He felt he had enough information to vote to
approve the contract. He said he would be voting yes.
Director Hoy said he agreed with Director Deadwyler
that the candidate had been chosen by community
groups, the constituents and community leaders, as
well as by the Board. He stated the candidates were
very well vetted. Director Hoy shared that as he reads
the contract, he thinks it is very good and fits within
the parameters that Director Bagley and Francone were
given by the General Manager Executive Search
Committee and what was made publicly available to
every stakeholder and constituent.
Director Francone stated that she supports open
government and believes the Agency does a good job
with regards to transparency. She said what confuses
her is the reason for the motion to postpone this item.
She asked if Director Menten feels there has not been
enough opportunity for public comment. She noted
there were 37 public meetings held throughout the
process that were open to everyone. She wonders
how Director Menten feels this process could have
been more open.
Director Walker agreed that the process has been
extremely open. He thinks the public has entrusted the
Board to negotiate the contract. He said there needs to
be some level of trust that the Board will do a good job
so someone is not put in a position of negotiating in
public. He stated he is happy with the terms and will
be voting to approve the contract if it is voted on this
evening.

Packet Pg. 58

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 29, 2016 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of March 29, 2016)

would be an opportunity to discuss the contract during
an executive session. There is information that she
does not think the negotiators had but she does not
want to discuss it publicly.

Director Bagley reminded the Board that a term sheet
and contract negotiating parameters were given to the
Board in December, 2015. At the direction of the
former Chair of the Board, Chuck Sisk, he and Director
Francone were charged with negotiating the contract.
It has taken four months to get to this point. He
pointed out that a General Manager Oversight and
Performance Management Committee Meeting was held
on March 8 and all Board members were invited to
attend; however, not all Board members attended. He
stated that the contract was within the term sheet and
contract negotiating parameters. He thinks it is time to
move forward and approve the contract. He believes
postponing approval of the contract would be an
egregious error on the part of this Board.
Director Lubow indicated she wanted to say something
that is really going out on a limb for her. She does not
think anyone is contesting the person who was
selected. She thinks the issue has to do with salary.
She wishes this discussion was initiated when the
salary range discussion first began; however, it did not
happen that way, which is unfortunate. She believes a
discussion about all RTD employee salaries needs to be
started. She stated that income inequality is a huge
problem in our country. Director Lubow said it had
been a pleasure working with Interim General Manager
Genova but there is too much of a disparity between
management salaries and that of ordinary employees.
Vote on Motion
to Postpone to
a Time Certain:

The motion failed with 6 in favor (Deadwyler, Francone,
Lasater, Lubow, Menten, Solano) and 9 opposed
(Anderson, Archuleta, Bagley, Folska, Hoy, James,
Sisk, Tobiassen, Walker).

Discussion:

Director Folska agreed that salaries can be shocking
when they get to $250K or more; however, the Board
office, in conjunction with the Board of Directors, spent
an enormous amount of time research this to determine
the industry standard. She said that perhaps not all
Directors attended those meetings but it was
discussed. She stated that there were vigorous
conversations about salary range, benefits, etc.
Director Folska indicated she has no problem with
anything in the contract. She applauded Directors
Bagley and Francone for their hard work. She thanked
Interim General Manager Genova for rising to the
occasion and keeping the agency on track.
Director James encouraged the Board, especially those
interested in postponement, to respect the process. He
said the salary range has been exposed to the public
and is very competitive. He stated that RTD must pay
enough to get the job done well. Director James
indicated he would vote to approve the contract.
Director Deadwyler congratulated Directors Bagley and
Francone for negotiating this contract. She thought
they did a wonderful job. She was on the GMESC
team so she knows how much time was invested in
this difficult process. She shared that her reasons for
wanting to postpone the vote are different than those
of Director Menten; however, she wants to make sure
the salary matches the job description and she does not
think they match.
Director Menten thanked Director Lubow for her
comments as she thinks Director Lubow spoke to a

Packet Pg. 60

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 29, 2016 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of March 29, 2016)

8.A

point that has gotten lost. She does not think the
Board had a vote on the salary range for the General
Manager’s Contract. She noted the GMESC may have
voted but the full Board did not. Director Menten
stated she was very clear when the Board voted to
enter into contract negotiations with Interim General
Manager Genova that she was accepting him as the
final candidate, not his salary range. Director Menten
pointed out that minutes of the GMESC were not
available on the internet, which is unacceptable. She
said she also had an issue with the fact that someone
would have to search out the salary range on the RTD
website. She stated she would be voting no as she
thinks the public deserves more time.
Director Lubow indicated she would be voting yes
because it is important to support Dave Genova;
however, she thinks a discussion around salaries needs
to happen.
Director Bagley pointed out that the GMESC meetings
were open to every member of the Board. The
committee discussed the compensation philosophy for
RTD significantly and reviewed the job description,
making slight amendments. He noted that during the
salary range discussions it was determined the range
should be from $260K to $350K. He explained that he
and Director Francone did an evaluation of other
salaries throughout the country and found the average
to be around $300K. Director Bagley stated the article
in the paper was totally inaccurate as the original salary
paid to former General Manager Washington in 2009
was $275K. He explained that in reviewing the
compensation philosophy it was determined that the
GMESC wanted the salary to be in the top 25%. He
indicated that this salary is the same as it was six years
ago. There is the opportunity for the salary to rise but
even at the end of the 5th year it will only be at $315K.
Director Bagley stated that having a conversation about
salaries was never brought up until this evening. He

Packet Pg. 61

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 29, 2016 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of March 29, 2016)

8.A

also thinks the discussion about transparently has
gotten way out of line. The contract provided to the
Board specifically said that it was confidential. He
pointed out that every Director signed a confidentiality
agreement as part of the process. He expected much
better from a member of the Board and is appalled that
the contract was released.
Director Solano said he does not question Dave
Genova’s ability but he does question the salary. He
thinks that it is too high but for the good of the Agency
he will vote yes this evening.
Director Deadwyler thanked Director Bagley for his
comments. She said he was correct that the GMESC
did sit down and come up with a salary range. She
indicated she has no issue with the salary. She stated
she is also appalled that the contract was leaked. She
feels this took away the opportunity for other Board
members to discuss the contract as there was not even
an executive session. She thinks when one Director
makes a unilateral decision it places the entire Board in
a bad light. She indicated she would be voting yes as
the issue she had is now mute.
Director Lasater shared when he was on the Parker
Town Council they could not take any action that
would encumber future councils. He wonders if that is
the same for the RTD Board as he feels there are parts
of the contract that encumber future Boards. He has
an issue with the automatic $10K salary increase per
year. He stated he has an issue with anything that is
automatic as it should be in the Board’s prevue in the
future to decide if the General Manager deserves a
raise. Rolf Asphaug explained he had not read the
contract to avoid a conflict of interest or the
appearance of impropriety; however, he noted there is
the Collective Bargaining Agreement that spans multiple
years. He said from his understanding he does not see
an issue with the automatic raise.

Director Menten thinks the Board is having a very
healthy conversation with the public being able to hear
the discussion. She thanked Director Anderson for the
idea of keeping the discussion out of executive session.
She stated there are rulings on what can be done to tie
the hands of elected officials. She referenced a case in
Greenwood Village where it was determined that gag
orders are a violation of the constitutional rights of
dissenting Board members.
Chair Tobiassen agreed there had been robust and
forthright conversation.

Subject:

Longmont Free Fare Buy Up

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that RTD approve a new contract
with Boulder County to allow the County to continue to buy up fares on all four of the Longmont local
fixed route services, herein referenced as “the 300 series.” Specifically the 300 series are routes 323,
324, 326 and 327 and complementary Access-a-Ride services for a period of an additional 18 months.
BACKGROUND
Boulder County entered into an agreement with the RTD in 2014 to “buy up” all fares on the 300 series
routes in Longmont. The current contract was for a period of two years from July 1, 2014 – June 30,
2016. The County would like to continue the program.
DISCUSSION
Boulder County and the City of Longmont feel that one of the major reasons that ridership has declined in
Longmont over the years is due to high fares. The objective of this action is to continue to build ridership
and increase mobility options for low income riders.
Under this program all passengers will continue to be allowed unlimited boardings on all 300 series
routes, in both directions, throughout the day. All RTD rules, regulations, and codes of conduct will be
the same as if passengers were paying fares. Transit operators, other RTD staff and members of law
enforcement will continue to have the discretion to refuse boarding to any passenger they deem will
compromise the safety of others. Transfers will be issued to any passengers requesting a transfer. This
program will not include the Call-n-Ride or Regional routes operating within Longmont. The purpose of the
program is to focus on fixed route local ridership. The County has also agreed that RTD will not be
responsible for any additional operational costs required to stay within their thresholds; any new cost will
be borne by Boulder County. The local agencies, specifically Boulder County and City of Longmont, have
performed the majority of the marketing and publicity for this program with the approval of RTD
Marketing. RTD will continue to promote this program. Boulder County, City of Longmont and RTD will
hold meetings to discuss any issues that need to be addressed with the Buy Up program.
During this 18 month period, Boulder County has agreed to reimburse the RTD $391,806 for fares on the
300 series routes and approximately $21,150 for Access-a-Ride trips that fall within the ADA service
area boundaries of the 300 series routes (the Access-a-Ride dollars are approximate and the County will
reimburse based on actual usage). Calculations for this reimbursement are based on the original dollar
amount established in the 2014 contract which was based on the 300 series fare revenue from 2012.
This new dollar amount reflects the new fare structure and an additional 8% to reflect the new riders.
There will be an escape clause in the contract that will allow either the County or RTD to discontinue the
program with 60 days’ notice.
Overall the program has been doing very well in terms of increased boardings. RTD survey results
reflected that approximately 8% of the increased boardings were “new” riders. 2013 boardings for the

Packet Pg. 65

11.A

Longmont local routes were 156,863 boardings (weekday and Saturdays). In 2015 boardings increased
to 313,692.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no financial impact to the RTD.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) Borrower
Authorized Representative Certificate (the “Certificate”).
BACKGROUND:
RTD executed a TIFIA loan with the US Department of Transportation on December 1, 2011 to partially
fund the Eagle P3 project. The loan requires RTD to appoint authorized representatives to act as
representatives for matters relating to the loan. In order to reflect changes in District personnel, the
Certificate is updated periodically as required.
DISCUSSION:
The attached recommended Certificate has been modified from the previously approved Certificate only
to reflect RTD personnel changes. The changes include replacing Philip A. Washington with David A.
Genova, Terry L. Howerter with Heather Copp and Teresa Sedmak with Brenden R. Morgan.
ALTERNATIVES:
1.
Adopt the attached Agreement. This is the recommended action.
2.
Modify the attached Agreement.
3.
Do not adopt the attached Agreement. This is not the recommended action.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
This recommended Board action poses no financial impact to the District.

Board Meeting Date: April 19, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopts the attached 2017 Performance Measures for mission statement goals 1-7. There are 23
specific performance measures in total, and it is proposed that an additional goal be added (goal 3.2)
for a total of 24.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These performance measures provide a framework in which RTD can
determine how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within the
context of its mission statement, and integrate with the Board’s 2017 priorities of Fiscal
Sustainability, Workforce/Human Capital and State of Good Repair. A report detailing year-to-date
performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of Directors following the end of
each quarter. The proposed performance measures for 2017 are brought to the Board of Directors for
approval at this time because the measures are used in development of the 2017-2022 Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) and 2017 Budget.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the adopted goals from 2016 to 2017 are listed below:


Goal 3.2 Maintain system-wide service availability
o While service availability is currently measured for Light Rail, an additional goal is
proposed for service availability for Bus as well beginning in 2017. The measure is
calculated as total operating hours less service delay hours, divided by total scheduled
hours. In other words, it is the percentage of scheduled service that is available as
operating service. The goal has been 99.0% for Light Rail and will be 97.0% for Bus.
The latter is considered a realistic measure considering lost service experienced in recent
months from lack of operator availability. This measure also includes time lost as a
result of accidents, vehicle breakdowns, etc. Bus system-wide availability was 98% for
2013, 97% for 2014, and 96% for 2015.



Goal 3.4 Improve mileage between road calls
o The goal for Mileage between Lost Service Maintenance Road Calls is increased from
28,000 to 30,000 miles. The improvement is expected due to the new bus vehicles
that dominate the bus fleet and require fewer maintenance road calls. A lost service
maintenance road call is a maintenance-related problem that results in a revenue vehicle
being traded, towed, or repaired on the street causing a service delay of 1 minute or

Packet Pg. 81

12.D

more. Mileage between lost service road calls is calculated by dividing actual miles
operated by the number of lost service maintenance road calls.


Goal 6.2 Increase ridership
o Overall ridership increase will be established by the financial plans inherent in the
adoption of the 2017 Annual Budget in November 2016 and in the Board-approved
Ridership Goal model, and it is carried as a placeholder at this time.



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total operating revenue
o These measures will be established by the financial plans inherent in the adoption of the
2017 Annual Budget in November 2016 and are carried as placeholders at this time.

It is noted that we are developing a performance protocol for commuter rail linked to the
concessionaire agreement with Denver Transit Partners and such measurement report will be brought
to the Board for review at a later date. While we have numerous contractual reporting requirements
at various intervals, DTP’s operational reporting system is a work in progress and we plan to create a
baseline report in 2016 to incorporate relevant criteria. Major categories around which measurement
criteria will be developed include rolling stock availability, station availability, asset service availability,
and incident detail, among other criteria.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2017 Performance Measures will be utilized in the development of the final 2017 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2017 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures included
in the 2017 Performance Report.
2. Modify the recommended 2017 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance
measures to be included in the 2017 Performance Report and make required adjustments, if
necessary, to the 2017 Requested Budget.
3. Do not adopt the 2017 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures
included in the 2017 Performance Report.
