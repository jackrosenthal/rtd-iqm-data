BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
January 2023 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

Committee Meeting Date:
October 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
October 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for January 2023 service
changes to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 as well as to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community Value.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Interim Director, Civil Rights
Jessie Carter II, Senior Manager, Service Planning and Scheduling
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 26 service changes proposed for January 2023 provides opportunities for bus and rail operators to
vote new work assignments and for the Service Development Division to adjust the overall operations
plan for the transit network. Additionally, with the Board-adopted Reimagine RTD System Optimization
Plan (SOP), several of the service change proposals reflect the first phases of SOP implementation to
provide the best possible customer value.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard
to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Service Equity Analysis Requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The January 2023 service
change proposal includes four major service changes out of 26 total changes. Thus, an analysis is
required to be brought before the Board for approval. The complete Title VI Service Equity Analysis
report is included in Attachment A.

1.D.1

Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major
service changes will be subject to an equity analysis.
Title VI Policies:
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
DISCUSSION
Staff proposes changes to 18 bus routes and eight rail lines in the forthcoming January 2023 runboard.
Of these 26 changes, four services have proposed additions or reductions to service 25% greater than
that of baseline service and thus meet established thresholds for a major service change. Those routes
are shown in bold in the following table.

Modified Services (23 services)
(Additional trips, expanded service spans)

11, 12, 15, 15L, 21, 24, 30, 42, 44, 76, 83D/83L,
88, 93L, 130, AT, 228, BOLT
D Line, E Line, H Line, L Line, R Line, W Line

Reduced Services (one service)

120L

Discontinued Services (two services)

C Line, F Line

Methodology
Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line level, route/line
block group and network level to identify any potential disparities in service changes based on
race/ethnicity or income.
Summary of Findings
• Of the over 63,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes
(both bus and rail), minority and low-income populations represented a higher share of population
than district averages. Of this cumulative figure, 33,000 would receive service improvements for
equity populations

Packet Pg. 4

1.D.1

•

The one bus route with major service changes serves above-average minority or low-income
populations

•

For major service changes to rail service, minority populations are not disproportionately impacted
by the elimination of service to the C and F lines; however, the burden on low-income populations
relative to higher income populations slightly exceeds the threshold

•

Although staff is proposing that the C and F lines be permanently discontinued, all stations
currently served by the C and F lines will continue to be served by rail service at 15-minute peak
headways. More specifically:

•

o

The stations served prior to the discontinuation of the C Line will continue to be served by
the D Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the W or E line required to
continue to Denver Union Station

o

The stations served prior to the discontinuation of the F Line will continue to be served by
the E Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the D or H Line required to
continue to 18th•Stout Station

o

These service changes signify the agency’s commitment to ensure an equitable distribution
of service improvements and to minimize impacts with the permanent discontinuance of
these light rail lines

When considering the demographics within the service areas of lines/routes with major service
changes and as a proportion to the District overall, both minority and low-income equity
populations received a greater increase in service (i.e., were more positively impacted) compared
to non-equity populations; minority areas had a +1.84% benefit above non-minority areas, and
low-income areas received a +1.67% compared to higher income areas

Conclusions
Although two of the major service changes resulted in a disproportionate burden at the line level, Title VI
concerns are minimal at the network level when comparing the service changes between the August
2022 and January 2023 runboards. In aggregate, a review of all routes/lines found no adverse impacts
between equity and non-equity routes/lines. Overall, the system-wide service increases have positively
impacted equity populations slightly more compared to non-equity populations. Therefore, no systemlevel disparate impact or disproportionate burden is found related to the proposed major service changes
in the January 2023 service change proposal.
In adopting this report, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community
Value while maintaining compliance with Title VI federal regulations. RTD will continue to assess the
equity implications for all subsequent service change proposals and will propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Service Equity Analysis: January 2023
Executive Summary
This document summarizes the analysis of the service changes between the August 2022 and January 2023
runboards to ensure changes have not inequitably impacted minority and low-income populations.

Methodology
RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts, and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group levels to identify
any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes
RTD proposes changes to 18 bus route/patterns and eight rail lines of RTD’s forthcoming January 2023 runboard.
Of these 26 changes, three services meet established thresholds for a major service change. The routes/lines
listed below have proposed adjustments to service that were greater than 25% of baseline service or services
being eliminated.

Service Adjustments (one service)

Service Eliminations (two services)

Route 30 – South Federal: extend span of service weekdays
and Sundays in bi-directional pattern
C Line: regular service on the C Line is discontinued
F Line: regular service on the F Line is discontinued

Findings

Alterations to the initial proposed January 2023 service changes include adding improvements to Route 30,
which serves high concentrations of equity populations. Further, though staff is proposing that the C and F Lines
be permanently discontinued, all stations currently served by the C and F Lines will continue to be served by rail
service at 15-minute peak headways. The stations served prior to the discontinuation of the C Line will continue
to be served by the D Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the W or E Line required to continue
to Denver Union Station. Moreover, the stations served prior to the discontinuation of the F Line will continue to
be served by the E Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the D or H Line required to continue
to 18th•Stout Station. These service changes signify the agency’s commitment to ensure an equitable distribution
of service improvements and to minimize impacts with the permanent discontinuance of these rail lines.
When considering the demographics within the service areas of routes/lines with major service changes and as
a proportion to the District overall, both minority and low-income equity populations received a greater increase
in service (i.e., were more positively impacted) compared to non-equity populations. Minority areas had a
+1.84% benefit above non-minority areas, and low-income areas received a +1.67% compared to higher income
areas. For major service changes to rail service, minority populations are not disproportionately impacted by the
elimination of service to the C and F Lines; however, the burden on low-income populations relative to higher
income populations slightly exceeds the threshold.
Finally, though there were no cumulative adverse impacts at the network level, potential disparate impacts and
disproportionate burdens were identified at the individual route-level: of the three routes/lines that had major
service changes, two lines had a disproportionate burden finding.

1.D.1.a

Service Equity Analysis: January 2023
Introduction
Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver region.
An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit service without
regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact
on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that are proposed to occur between the
August 2022 and January 2023 runboards. Routes with major service changes include one major increase and
two major service decreases (eliminations) of formerly suspended routes. These changes and all others have
been reviewed individually at the route/line level and in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential
impacts to the communities RTD serves.

Service Change Philosophy
An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD. These
changes include the addition of new routes/lines, the elimination of existing routes/lines and changes to the
alignment and trip frequency within existing routes/lines. RTD has established principles to identify the service
changes needed to meet the diverse travel needs of those within the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system.

Service performance evaluation based on service standards
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to

Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without

populations
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes depending on service type, route alignment and frequency.
Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all routes within each class.
RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in ridership and operational
performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify services that are
underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. In keeping
with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish performance metrics used to
identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses these metrics to identify a series
of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of the proposed major service changes on minority
populations and low-income households at or below 150 percent of the Department of Health and Human
Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact
Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating service change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25%addition or reduction in the service
hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service changes will be
subject
to
an
equity
analysis
that
includes
an
analysis
of
adverse
effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes,
but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects
and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.

2. Disparate Impact Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10 percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than higher income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150%
of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and
RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources and Methodology
Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5Year Estimates for years 2014 to 2018 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level. Other data
related to the analysis includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into
a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with changes in service at a
geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts to district equity communities.
The equity analysis for the January 2023 runboard looked at whether an individual route’s major service changes
impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the proportional difference in changes
made to equity populations within a route’s/line’s quarter-mile service area. These proportional differences were
compared against district population proportions of equity populations and route/line proportions of equity
populations.
Low-income status for population within the District is derived from the Census Bureau and is based on 150%
of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services guidelines), based on local
context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of three. Minority status was based on the non-white
and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area was based on the collection of block groups
within district boundaries.
Route/line service area population was determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area was then used to calculate the percentage overlap of census blockbased population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contained 100% of the underlying block group,
100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block group
was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
RTD calculated the net change in service hours for each route/line modification to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change at or above 25% from baseline was flagged as a major service change
for further review.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden
Analysis
Proposed service changes for the January 2023 runboard that resulted in a 25% or greater change in service
were categorized by equity population (minority or non-minority, low-income or higher income) for comparison.
Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their identification within the prior network
using 2018 ACS five-year demographic data.
A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to review the routes/lines individually. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the District. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of Disparate Impact (for minority populations) or Disproportionate Burden (for low-income populations) and was
flagged for a finding of potential impact.

Changes by Transit Mode
As RTD continues to adapt to changes affected by the pandemic, nearly 19 bus routes will undergo service
changes. Of these, five routes will see an increase of bus service by 56 daily revenue service hours (56
weekday, 28 Saturday, 37 Sunday). One of the routes, Route 30, exceeded the major service change
threshold and account for 16 of the additional daily revenue service hours. The suspended C and F Lines will be
permanently removed from service.

Major Service Change Review

A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups, and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions or Eliminations (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases/Restructuring (service increases of 25% or more related to new or
restructured service)

Major Service Change Reductions/Eliminations

Two rail lines were previously suspended during the COVID-19 service reductions. The Board of Directors
approved these suspensions during the April 2021 monthly meeting. The January 2023 service proposal includes
the permanent discontinuance or elimination of these lines.

Major Service Change Increases
One bus route had major service changes, which includes service increases of 25% or greater. This includes one
modification to span of service (Route 30).

Route- and Line-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route/line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (DI) and/or
Disproportionate Burdens (DB). Both service reductions and service increases are analyzed. For service
increases, the analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority
and low-income populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse
effects of the reductions are disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.

Service Equity Analysis: January 2023
Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the District’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were reviewed
for potential DI or DB findings. In summary, the review of these adverse impacts determined the following:
•

Two lines met the threshold for a potential Disproportionate Burden

A complete listing of all potential DI and DB findings can be found in Appendix B.

Network Analysis

In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program update, a network analysis is required in addition to route- and
line-level analysis. A network level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for Title
VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring
further review. Once average district thresholds for low-income and minority populations were established,
subsequent equity analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service
changes of 25% or greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major
service changes experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes
with major service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group
levels (block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•
•

Systemwide, bus service was increased by over 56 daily revenue hours
Of the over 63,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes (both bus
and rail), minority and low-income populations represented a higher share of population than district
averages. Of this cumulative figure, 33,000 would receive service improvements for equity populations.
At the route level, equity routes and non-equity routes1 were compared only for those with major service
changes. The one bus route with major service changes serves above-average minority or low-income
populations

In review of Route 30, there are no adverse impacts. In review of all rail Lines (C Line and F Line),
there were no adverse impacts for minority populations at the network level. However, there is a
potential disproportionate burden for low-income populations when aggregating the proposed
changes to all rail lines.

Service Equity Analysis: January 2023
the August 2022 to January 2023 service change. Block groups with low-income and minority populations at or
above the district average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas higher income and
non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (16.8%) and
minority population (35.4%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in annual trips for
equity versus non-equity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for
potential adverse impacts.

There are 1,916 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District2. Using the 2018 5Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the total
minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the District-wide lowincome and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average.
While the percent minority figure of 35.4% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.019
million) the low-income population percentage of 16.8% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure. This
is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine3. The thresholds
summarized in Error! Reference source not found.4 yielded 751 (39% of all) block groups above the district
average for low-income population, and 715 (37%) block groups above the district average for minority
population.

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate to determine overall impacts to underlying
population. Table 4 summarizes the change in service for block group population within one quarter mile of bus
or rail stops with proposed major service changes proportionally compared to population in the District. This
comparison reviews the equity composition of those who may be impacted by proposed service changes
compared to the overall equity composition of the District overall. Table 5 summarizes the change in rail service
using the same methodology.

2

Some block groups are not completely contained within district boundaries due to differences in boundaries between the
District and Census-defined geographies.
3
The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total population and
results in a different base population used to determine low-income percent of population.

For bus service, equity populations stand to benefit more than non-equity populations, with minority
populations benefitting 1.84% more than non-minority population and low-income populations benefitting
1.67% more than higher-income populations. For major service changes to rail service, minority populations are
not disproportionately impacted by the elimination of service to the C and F Lines; however, the burden on lowincome populations relative to higher income populations slightly exceeds the threshold.

Summary of Findings
The network changes that are proposed between August 2022 and January 2023 include modifications to service
that include additional trips and longer spans of service. The major service change increases were entirely
invested in bus services. Major service change decreases resulted in the discontinuation of the C and F Lines.
The C Line has been suspended since January 2021, and the F Line has been suspended since September 2020.

Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether there is an alternative
that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or disproportionate burden on
low-income customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals.
Alterations to the initial proposed January 2023 service changes4 include adding improvements to Route 30,
which serves high concentrations of equity populations. Although the C and F Lines are proposed to be
permanently discontinued, stations currently served by the C and F Lines will continue to be served by rail service
at 15-minute peak headways. The stations served prior to the discontinuation of the C Line will continue to be
served by the D Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the W or E Line required to continue to
Denver Union Station. The stations served prior to the discontinuation of the F Line will continue to be served
by the E Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the D or H Line required to continue to 18th•Stout
Station. These service changes signify the agency’s commitment to ensure an equitable distribution of service
improvements and to minimize impacts with the permanent discontinuance of these rail lines.
In addition to the systemwide-level findings below, RTD’s on-going pandemic response, the substantial ridership
decline, personnel impacts, resource allocation (human and capital) and recovery uncertainty serves as
justification for maintaining the January 2023 service changes proposal.

Service Equity Analysis: January 2023
•

Of the more than 36,000 people with access to bus stops within the service area of the bus route with
a major service improvement, minority and low-income groups represented a higher share of the
population than district averages, indicating targeted services to equity populations

•

When considering the demographics within the service areas of the bus route with a major service
change and as a proportion to the District overall, both minority and low-income populations
received a greater increase in service (were positively impacted more) compared to nonequity populations. Minority areas had +1.84% benefit above non-minority areas and low-income
areas received +1.67% compared to higher-income areas

•

Of the over 27,000 people with access to rail stations with major service decreases, low-income
populations were impacted at a lower rate than the higher-income district average, whereas minority
populations represented a higher share of the population than non-minority populations.

Split Route 12 into the former Routes 7 (see page 14) and 12, with the
northern portion operating as Route 7 between 38th/Blake Station and
Northglenn at 112th Station, and the southern portion continuing operating
between Englewood Station and 38th/Blake Station as the Route 12. This
proposal is aimed at improving on-time performance, by creating two
shorter route alignments with separate operating schedules and greater
opportunities for schedule recovery.
Schedule adjustments resulting from running time analysis, aimed at
improving on-time performance are proposed.

extends service to cover from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. both directions. Sunday, add
southbound service over the alignment. Due to a previous configuration that
is no longer in use, route 30 only runs northbound on Sundays from 8 a.m.
to 5 p.m.

improving on-time performance are proposed.
Reroute route 76 in the area between I-70 and Olde Town Arvada Station to
enhance operational safety. New northbound routing will be R – 52nd Ave, L
– Vance St, C – 53rd Ave, to regular routing. New southbound routing will
be C – Vance St, R – 52nd Ave, L – Wadsworth Blvd, to regular routing. This
will add service to stops #21428 and 22763, without losing service to any
current stops.
Schedule adjustments resulting from running time analysis, aimed at
improving on-time performance are proposed.
Adjust the meet times at Colorado at 72nd Ave Station with the N Line for
better connections, weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays.
Adjust the meet times at Colorado at 72nd Ave Station with the N Line for

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager of Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
As is customary with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargain
Agreement shared between RTD and ATU 1001, the January 2023 Service Change Proposal facilitates
both an opportunity for RTD bus and rail operators to vote new work assignments and the opportunity
for Service Development staff to make adjustments to the operations plan for RTD’s transit network.
With the Board’s adoption of the Reimagine RTD System Optimization Plan (SOP) in July 2022, several
of the proposals herein initiate the first phases of implementation of the SOP. The January 2023
proposals related to the SOP were selected, modified and based on RTD’s current capacity to provide
service. Workforce availability challenges persist, tying the sequencing of SOP-related route proposals
more directly to specific operating division’s capacity for additional work assignments. It should be noted
that efforts to increase operator availability through intensified recruitment and increased employee
outreach continue.
DISCUSSION
Following the guidelines contained in the Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Community Value and
Customer Excellence and recognizing the RTD’s workforce challenges, the proposals herein are directed
at improving on-time performance, maintaining Collective Bargaining Agreement compliance and
implementing the first phase of the SOP.
The Board adopted guidance for proposed service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders;

Attachment A
January 2023 Service Change Proposal

Routes 7 – North Washington
12 – Downing/North Washington
Current on-time performance 26.8% late, 71.5% on-time
As outlined in the RTD Board-approved System Optimization Plan, it is proposed to split
Route 12 into the former Routes 7 and 12, with the northern portion operating as Route 7
between 38th/Blake Station and Northglenn at 112th Station, and the southern portion
continuing operating between Englewood Station and 38th/Blake Station as the Route 12.
This proposal is aimed at improving the on-time performance, by creating two shorter
route alignments with separate operating schedules and greater opportunities for schedule
recovery. This proposal is the first phase of implementing the Route 12 as described in the
Reimagine RTD System Optimization Plan (SOP) and does not contain the separate
branches and increased headway frequency. Further changes are necessary to realize the
full SOP proposal and will be proposed as resources become available. Anticipated cost
impact 16 hours 1 vehicle and 1.5 FTE.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue proposal withdrawn for further adjustments relating to CBA
compliance and service suitability.
Responding to frequent customer requests, this proposal expands service east, to Aurora
Plaza (Del Mar Circle) at 60-minute frequencies as outlined in the RTD Board-approved
System Optimization Plan. This proposal is the first phase of implementing the Route 10
as described in the Reimagine RTD SOP and does not contain the increased headway
frequency. Further changes are necessary to realize the full SOP proposal and will be
proposed as resources become available. Anticipated cost impacts are estimated to be 40
hours, 3 vehicles, 5 FTE
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue
Current on-time performance 25.3% late, 70.6% on-time
It is proposed to perform a running time analysis to improve on-time performance of the
route. Anticipated cost estimated to be one all-day vehicle and 1.5 FTE.
Route 15 – East Colfax Avenue
Current on-time performance 28.1% late, 67.9% on-time
Schedule adjustments resulting from running time analysis, aimed at improving on-time
performance are proposed. Anticipated cost impacts are estimated to be 12 hours ,one
vehicle and 1.5 FTE for all service days.
Route 15L – East Colfax Avenue Limited
Current on-time performance 13.2% late, 81.8% on-time
Schedule adjustments are proposed to coordinate the anticipated changes to the Route 15
operating schedule. No cost impacts anticipated.

currently operates from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. northbound, and 10:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
southbound. It is proposed to extend service to cover from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. both
directions. Sunday it is proposed to add southbound service over the alignment. Due to a
previous configuration that is no longer in use, route 30 only runs northbound on Sundays
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. As proposed in the SOP, it is necessary to give the area bidirectional service. This proposal is the first phase of implementing the Route 30 as
described in the SOP and does not contain the reassignment of branches and increased
