WIN Program Update
This update was provided by Kenn Hardin and Carla Perez. A copy of the presentation is
available with the DBE committee minutes in the Board office.
Kenn Hardin shared the Regional Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) program is a collaborative

partnership that leverages resources to prepare people to enter the transportation industry.
WIN is addressing some of the issues for our local skilled workforce in trying to support
livable, sustainable communities through the following goals:
 Workers—developing transferable skills and providing jobs, career development and
work experience through local partnerships
 Businesses-supporting opportunities to create and grow businesses and to provide a
process to customize training needs for employers
 Communities-increasing access to resources that support the community and
strengthening existing community organizations through collaborative networks and
approaches.
Unlike other programs, WIN is not training people who have to then wait for jobs. Rather, we
are getting jobs so that as workers are trained, at the end of the training there is a job waiting
for them.
Director Cohen inquired on the process for assessment. Kenn Hardin explained that RTD has
partnered with CCD who is performing the assessment and career planning.
Kenn Hardin emphasized that the WIN program has a national impact and hopefully will serve
as a national model for the new federal program authorization as well as potential Federal
workforce development funding.
The targeted launch date for this program is April, 2011. RTD will be collaborating with the
Denver Transit partners (DTP) for an anticipated 60+ positions in a number of areas:
CAD/AVL, Document control, general construction labor, surveying. business services, etc.
Kenn Hardin introduced Selena Benevez of Selena Inc, a DBE/SBE firm who will be working on
the Smart Card System. Selena explained they will be running a call center which will also
include the EcoPass program. She plans to hire 14 employees. They are also partnering and
serving as part of the employee community group to bring in Denver native educational
center, The idea is to help keep jobs locally and to create opportunities for people living in the
community.
Director Brohl provided some background of this program as introduced in Washington DC at
the Legislative Conference in 2010. This program was touted to do two primary things:
 Transform this region
 Building jobs which helps to positively impact on regional poverty and provide work
opportunities.
Around May, the FT administrator introduced this program on a regional basis as a great
model for other cities. In July a Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) was signed between
CCD, DTP and RTD. This program will have a fundamental change in how we do things; we
are working with FTA and FHA and other agencies and this will have monumental impact.
Director Malpiede also applauded the program and the efforts of this program. She asked if
representatives from CCD could come back and talk about the training program and where
they are at in the process. She also suggested that Landri Taylor with the Urban League
could share some perspective. She wanted to know how many people are we anticipated in
the pilot stage. Kenn Hardin responded about 60 people over the 2011 timeframe. Director
Malpiede inquired if he could provide a timeline that she could share with her constituents.
Director Cohen stated this was an exciting program and acknowledged the great effort. He
inquired where does Emily Griffith fit in with CCD. Kenn Hardin explained they were one of
the resource networks we will be leveraging to provide training and basic life skills.
Director McMullen stated Kenn is doing a wonderful job with this program but asked about
the presence of labor. Kenn Hardin responded they have had several conversations with
various labor groups such as Denver joint electrical, IBEW, engineering and working with at
least 5 different labor pools-they are all part of the network. Kenn Hardin will provide a list of

the labor groups.
Director Deadwyler inquired how are people selected to participate and what if they need a
GED? Kenn Hardin responded they can still participate in the program alongside working to
complete the GED.
General Manager Washington re-emphasized the national impact of this program. As the
government look for a new reauthorization program, we hope this program will be included
and will end up in the reauthorization bill. He has been invited by Peter Rogoff to the
Transportation Research Board meeting the end of the month and will continue to tout this
program.
