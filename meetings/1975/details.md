#### 1. Citizens Advisory Committee

#### 1. Approval of Eleventh Year (2015) Contract Amendment to Jacobs Engineering for FasTracks Program Support Consulting Services

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the eleventh year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in the amount of $17,861,430 for Program Support Services Consulting for FasTracks for the year 2015.  Funds for the award are contained in the 2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.

Motion:                 Director Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, reminded the Board that all four (4) Recommended Actions come to the Board annually as contract negotiations for scope and cost are finalized.

Pranaya Shrestha, Senior Manager for Program Management, added that Jacobs Engineering provides specialized services that RTD does not have in house.  He said that Jacobs has come under budget all eleven (11) years that they have been contracted by RTD.  For 2014, Jacobs is estimated to be $1.5 million under budget.  Pranaya Shrestha noted that Jacobs Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) percentage is 19.5%, above the contractual 7%.

Rick Clarke added that Brian Middleton, Executive Project Manager for Jacobs Engineering, could not attend the meeting due to illness.

Committee Vice Chair Lasater declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

#### 2. Approval of Eleventh Year (2015) Contract Amendment to Delcan for FasTracks Quality Management Consultant Services

Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Kevin Diviness, Director of Quality Assurance, told the Directors that the Delcan contract runs parallel to the Jacobs Engineering contract.  Delcan has exceeded the DBE contractual goal of 5%, averaging 8.3%.  He said that Delcan has committed to a 12.3% DBE goal for 2015.  He recognized Tim Stokes, Senior Project Manager at Delcan, among those in attendance.

Director Bagley expressed his excitement over approving contracts for Jacob Engineering, Delcan, and Kumar and Associates, Inc.  He said RTD has great review of records and account monitoring under these companies.  He is convinced that the auditing is done appropriately.  He thanked all three companies.

Director Menten asked if Delcan’s quality control oversight included the oversight of the Jersey bridge.  Kevin Diviness explained that the quality control lies on the contractors as they are responsible for checking their own work.  Delcan and other firms give RTD the tools for review and oversight.  Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, added that staff will give an Eagle P3 project update to the Board in December.  This update will include the Jersey bridge.

Committee Vice Chair Lasater declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

Motion:                 Director Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

The scope of work is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment is for an amount not to exceed $686,009.60 for the year 2015. Funds for the award are contained in the 2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.

Motion:                 Director Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Discussion:               Pauletta Tonilas, Sr. Manager for Public Relations and Public Information, explained that the Virtegic Group Incorporated (Virtegic) contract was set up as a one (1) year contract with four (4) one (1) year option.  This would be the third year.  She explained that the staff of four (4) full time and three (3) part time employees is designed to work seamlessly with RTD.  She introduced the team composed of Sherman Hamilton, Joni Goheen, Michelle Brier, Marta Sipeki, Z. J. Czupor, and Dale Honor.  Dave Mitchell was unable to attend.  Pauletta Tonilas said that the contract includes an option for extra support in 2016 if RTD staff determines it will be needed during the scheduled openings and special event planning.  Virtegic is a Small Business Enterprise (SBE).

Director Tobiassen said that I-225 is his highest priority as it is in the peak of construction.  He works very closely with the Virtegic team.  He was surprised to find out some of the contractors were not RTD employees.  He said the Virtegic are great folks working on a great, incredibly complex project.

Director Deadwyler said that her experience with Virtegic is different from that of Director Tobiassen.  She mentioned that Virtegic has limited access to people.  She noted that she is not happy with some of the decisions or the mistakes that have been made.  She added that she could not vote to award another $500,000 plus to this organization.

Director Solano said that his experience with Virtegic has always been positive.  They have always been available to explain the projects.  He noted they are always present at meetings.  He said that he would vote yes.

Chair Sisk noted that he read through the contract and is very satisfied.  He considers the Virtegic working seamlessly with the RTD staff a great strategy.  He said his questions have been addressed.

Committee Vice Chair Lasater declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. Aurora Line / I-225 Rail Construction Update

Chris Hinton, I-225 Deputy Project Manager for Construction, reviewed the presentation included in the FasTracks Monitoring Committee meeting packet for November 11, 2014.  The presentation included pictorial construction updates as well as a safety video.  The video was produced in conjunction with the City of Aurora and shown on Channel 8.

Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, mentioned that FasTracks has a tremendous safety record exceeding the industry averages by a wide margin.  FasTracks insurance has issued rebates due to the safety record.  He also pointed out that Chris Hinton is an example of opportunities given to people on FasTracks.  Rick Clarke said that Chris Hinton started as a T-REX Construction Engineer, worked on the West Corridor, was an Eagle Project Quality Manager, and now is the I-225 Deputy Project Manager for Construction.

Rick Clarke made reference to Director Tobiassen’s previous comments on the complexity of the I-225 project.  He said that there have been many challenges, both contractual and those that come with building infrastructure in urban areas.  He noted that Aurora Water is planning on betterments to their system while construction is ongoing.  This, Rick Clarke said, is good for the community though it does present complications to RTD’s project.  Staff still predicts opening the I-225 Rail line in the second half of 2016.

Director Deadwyler thanked staff for the safety video.  She said that she appreciates the construction crew’s work under inclement weather.  She encourages her constituents to honk and say hi to the construction workers thanking them for their work.

Director Deadwyler told staff about the difficulty she experienced due to the closings at E. Exposition Ave. and S. Sable Blvd.  She said that the signage and the detours were not clearly marked when she was trying to access the Kaiser Permanente facility.  She noted that signage was better last week.  However, she found it frustrating because she could not find any alerts regarding the closings.  She asked staff to give better communications about closings in the future, especially when it involves high traffic areas such as a medical facility.  Rick Clarke replied that he would look into the released communication pertaining to that closing.

Director Tobiassen commended the RTD staff and Kiewit for their work on such a complex project.  He also commended the City of Aurora and their staff for their partnership with RTD.  He stated that the City of Aurora does not have additional staff or resources yet they are doing a lot to connect with RTD work.  He specifically thanked Aurora Public Works, Aurora Parks and Open Spaces, Aurora Water, Channel 8, and the residents and HOAs.  He also thanked RTD and City of Aurora staff for reaching out and communicating with local business.  Rick Clarke confirmed staff communicates with the City of Aurora and/or the heads of the different public entities on a daily basis.
