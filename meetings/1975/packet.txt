Approval of Eleventh Year (2015) Contract
Amendment to Jacobs Engineering for
FasTracks
Program
Support
Consulting
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the eleventh year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in the
amount of $17,861,430 for Program Support Services Consulting for FasTracks for the year 2015.
Funds for the award are contained in the 2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital
program in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the 2015 goal of advancing and completing the FasTracks program.
On May 24, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to CarterBurgess (later purchased by Jacobs Engineering) for Program Support Consulting Services at an
initial 2005 Contract amount of $2,360,000, and a Notice to Proceed of July 5, 2005. The RTD
Board has approved subsequent contract amendments that have brought the current Contract Not to-Exceed price up to $150,982,726. The Contract Not-to-Exceed price through the end of 2015
with this contract amendment would be $168,844,156.
The PSC team provides program management support and specialized technical staff support to
augment RTD FasTracks Team staff. Key PSC staff members are co-located with RTD Staff at the
RTD FasTracks offices. The PSC functions as an extension of RTD staff. This approach adds value,
cost-effectively, by allowing RTD to tap the PSC’s specialized resources in planning, environmental,
design, engineering, construction management support, program control, and related disciplines on
an as-needed, often part-time, basis.
Further, as the focus of the FasTracks program has shifted from planning and design to construction,
the staff resources required for support of the program shift similarly. The PSC role has changed,
and will continue to change, to meet the evolving needs of the FasTracks program. This flexibility
allows RTD to retain the core staff required for implementation of the FasTracks program, without
having to continually (and inefficiently) staff up and then staff down in the planning, design, and
construction management disciplines.
Some of the key deliverables and assistance, in process or received, from the Jacobs/PSC team in
2014 included:



Participation in the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) that resulted in the revised financial plan
that was adopted by the Board in May 2014.
Provided key construction management support for the DUS and Eagle Projects.

Provided design and construction management support of I-225 LRT Project.
Provided ongoing support in Planning, Engineering, Project Controls and DBE/SBE/WIN support.

application for the Central Corridor Extension.
Maintained the programwide project controls functions including cost, schedule, estimating,
change management, and document control.
Supported ROW design, survey, and acquisition of all projects.
Provided contract closeout support for the West Rail Line.

DISCUSSION
The Program Support Services Contract was specified for a term of six years with a six-year option,
to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work tasks. The six year option was approved by
the RTD Board in November 2010.The purpose of the annual re-negotiation of the contract is to
ensure that specific tasks and deliverables respond to the evolving needs of the FasTracks Program.
The PSC serves as an extension of RTD staff. RTD staff provides overall management and control of
the FasTracks program and administration of this contract. The PSC provides key personnel to a
number of tasks. These assignments are based on focusing the PSC effort to:





Areas of specialized expertise or experience.
Part-time assignments.
Shorter duration efforts.
Positions that are difficult for RTD to fill.

Each position in the FasTracks organization is evaluated individually to determine whether that
position falls within the above criteria for using a consultant. In addition, before a consultant is
actually brought into the FasTracks program, an assessment is made as to whether the position is
still needed, and an interview is conducted with the appropriate RTD manager(s).
The major program activities in 2015 include the following:





Construction and start of testing of the Eagle P3 project.
Construction of I-225 Project.
Final design and construction of the North Metro Line.
Prepare RFP documents and application for a Full Funding Grant Agreement for the Southeast Rail
Extension.

During 2015, the PSC contract identifies the following specific tasks in support of FasTracks:
Program Management
 Provide the full-time support of a Project Controls Manager for the FasTracks Senior management
Team.
 Provide the support of specific project controls positions in schedule, cost control, and document
control. Provide tracking and monthly schedule and cost updates to each project manager.

RTD has established a 7% DBE goal for this Contract. The latest DBE report indicates that the PSC’s
actual cumulative DBE percentage has been 19.46%. For 2015, the PSC has committed to 27.1% DBE
participation, well in excess of the 7% goal. Additionally, while not in their contract, the PSC has
committed to continuing their participation in the WIN program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the PSC contract from 2005 through 2015 would be
$168,844,156 with this amendment. Funds for the 2015 contract award in the amount of
$17,861,430 are included in the 2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in
the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the eighth year
contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in the amount of $17,861,430 for Program Support
Services Consulting for FasTracks for the year 2015. Funds for the award are contained in the
2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where PSC
support would be utilized.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
eighth year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering. Rather, perform all the work in -house
with RTD staff. This is not recommended as RTD does not have the staff to provide a sufficient
level of expertise in a cost-effective approach to manage the FasTracks Program (As described in
the Background section, the PSC team can provide the technical specialties on an as needed
basis).
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Re-solicit this work to another consulting team. This is
not recommended as the PSC is satisfactorily performing its work assignments and providing
valuable technical and project management assistance to the RTD team.
Selection of alternatives two or three would delay the implementation of the FasTracks Program as
there would be a major loss of continuity on the program.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the Eleventh year Contract Amendment for Delcan in the amount of
$1,700,000 for Quality Management Consulting Services for FasTracks for the year 2015. Funds for

BACKGROUND
This action supports the General Manager’s first task goal for 2015 – Advancing/Completing FasTracks.
On June 28, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to Delcan for
Quality Management Consulting Services at an initial 2005 contract price of $418,539, and a Notice to
Proceed of August 1, 2005. This contract was set up to run for an initial six-year term, re-negotiated
and amended annually, based on the needs of the program. The contract also included provisions for a

actual cost proposal for the 2010 workscope was $1,400,000; but because of cumulative budget
underruns from previous years, the total Contract Not-to-Exceed price only needed to be increased by
$600,000 in order to deliver the 2010 work.
On November 23, 2010, the Board approved a seventh year contract amendment for 2011 in the
amount of $1,550,000, and authorized the six-year option included in the original contract.

with RTD’s project contractors, in an effort to avoid conflicts of interest.

2015 FasTracks Public Information Consultant
Contract Award

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the third one-year option to the Virtegic Group Incorporated as the
FasTracks Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period
of performance through 2015. The scope of work is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic
Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This
contract amendment is for an amount not to exceed $686,009.60 for the year 2015. Funds for the
award are contained in the 2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
BACKGROUND
Utilizing a Public Information Consultant team to extend the staffin g needs of the FasTracks Public
Information Program contributes to the agency’s 2015 goal to Advance/Complete FasTracks.
In October 2011, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for a Public Information, Communications and
Public Outreach Consultant to serve as an extension of staff in the implementation of the FasTracks
Public Information Program. Following a comprehensive evaluation process, Virtegic Group
Incorporated, a certified SBE firm, was selected for this contract award.
The procurement was set up as a one-year contract award with four one-year options, negotiated
annually by RTD and Consultant Staff and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors. This gives
RTD the opportunity to assess and address the public information and outreach needs of the
FasTracks program on an annual basis as the program evolves. The services needed through this
contract may be reduced or embellished from year to year depending on the future financial situation
and changing needs of the FasTracks program.
Virtegic began its work effort in January 2012 and the RTD Board approved the first of four oneyear options for 2013 and the second one-year option for 2014. In the three years of working as the
FasTracks public information consultant so far, the Virtegic team members have satisfactorily
performed their work assignments and have remained flexible in meeting the needs of the public
information program during staff transitions.
DISCUSSION
The initial contract to Virtegic for 2012 was in the amount of $451,459.20. The first one-year
option for 2013 was $485,167.20. The second one-year option for 2014 was $487,308.80. The
third one-year option for 2015 is not to exceed $686,009.60 bringing the total on this contract to
$2,109,944.80. The 2015 contract amendment includes a base contract amount of $518,009.60 as
well as funds in the amount of $168,000 for an option to provide staffing to assist with special
events planning and preparation for the FasTracks project openings in 2016. This is an option to be
exercised on an as-needed basis only if RTD staff determines extra staff is needed to assist with
preparation for the five project openings in 2016.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for this third one-year option are included in the 2015 Recommended Budget for the
FasTracks program.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the third one-year
option to the Virtegic Group Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information, Communications
and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period of performance through 2015 . The scope of
work is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually
by the RTD Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment is for an amount
not to exceed $686,009.60 for the year 2015. Funds for the award are contained in the 2015
Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the Public Information Consultant approach.
This is not recommended as RTD doesn’t currently have the staff to provide a sufficient level of
resources to meet the public information, communications and public outreach needs of the
FasTracks program. This alternative would delay and negatively impact the effective
implementation of the FasTracks Public Information Program.

3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
third one-year option to Virtegic Group. Issue another Request for Proposals for professional
services for Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach for the FasTracks Program
and award a contract to another consulting team. This is not recommended as the Virtegic team
is satisfactorily performing its work and has been flexible in meeting the changing communication
needs of the FasTracks program. Also, this alternative will delay and negatively impact the
successful implementation of the various strategies and activities associated with a
comprehensive and multi-layered communications effort.
