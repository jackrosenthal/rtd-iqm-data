it's your turn to speak.
If you're dialed in, press star 6 to toggle your mute settings. Please bear in mind that by participating in
this process, you are being recorded. If you do not wish to be recorded, then your comments will have to

Office at rtd.boardoffice@rtd-denver.com.
During this time, the Board will not offer comments or responses. Directors or staff may contact speakers
following their comments if they raise matters that lend themselves to follow up. Speakers should begin
their remarks by stating their names and they will have up to 3 minutes to provide their comments. And
has anyone raised their hand to have any speakers in the queue?
JILLIAN KNAPP-RHODES: We do not have any speakers in the queue at this time.
VINCE BUZEK: OK. Has anybody submitted email comments ahead of the meeting?
JILLIAN KNAPP-RHODES: And no email comments.
VINCE BUZEK: Great. With no participants in the queue and no email comments, we'll close the public
participation period at this time. We're going to then talk about our Executive session. We're going to-- I'm
going to need a motion to move into Executive session pursuant to 24-6-4024A, Colorado revised
statutes.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA MALPIEDE: Hold on. So moved.
KATE WILLIAMS: Second.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks. Let me finish reading the motion that you guys just moved and seconded. But I
got you. On the purchase acquisition, lease, transfer or sale of real personal or other property interest,

section 24-6-4024BCRS to receive legal advice and 24-6-4024ECRS for determining positions relative to
matters that may be subject to negotiations. Director Rivera-Malpiede, are you the movant on that?
ANGIE RIVERA MALPIEDE: I was.
VINCE BUZEK: And Director Williams, will you second that?
KATE WILLIAMS: I was.
VINCE BUZEK: OK. Are there any-- do we have any discussion?
MELANIE SNYDER: Mr. Chair, if I may. This is General Counsel Snyder. I just want to note for the record
that in addition to the statutory basis that you just cited, the purpose of the Executive session is to discuss
the battery electric bus project and the new flyer contract.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks very much for that. Yes, correct. And receive legal advice on the same. So any
further discussion on this? Are there any no votes to moving into Executive session? Seeing none. That
motion passes 14 to 0. Everybody that's entitled to participate in the Executive session, please move to
the other meeting at this time.
You should have gotten another Zoom link for the Executive session. Once this meeting is adjourned, we
will come once-- we'll go into Executive session. When we're done there, we'll come back to this one to
finish things out. So everybody, we'll see you in the Executive session.
