Zero Emission Policy

The Regional Transportation District (RTD), under the General Manager and CEO’s
leadership, shall achieve net zero emissions by 2050 as measured by Scope 1 and Scope 2
emissions as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. RTD's Board shall reevaluate this
policy after receiving an asset transition plan (or similarly named plan which details RTD’s
plans to transition to a zero emission fleet) (“Transition Plan”) and no less than annually to
measure progress towards this policy.
Beginning with the November 2023 Operations and Safety Committee meeting, staff shall
present monthly updates to the Board of Directors until such time as the Transition Plan
can be completed.
In the event including Scope 2 emissions will delay the completion of the Transition Plan,
staff shall apprise the Board of Directors of the same and the Board of Directors may elect
to remove the Scope 2 emissions portion of the Transition Plan.
In the event working towards this policy is in conflict with RTD’s ability to deliver service,
staff shall bring a recommended action to the Board to weigh the options against this
policy and to determine whether adjustment is necessary.
