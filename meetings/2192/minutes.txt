II.

Board Legislative Retreat Update
Chair Kemp shared that due to a number of factors, a decision has
been made to postpone the Board Legislative retreat.
Cal Marsella shared that he is working on talking points for the
Directors that will provide a consistent message and will work
across the board including “elevator talks” with elected officials
during the DNC.

III.

Other Matters
Chair Kemp introduced the proposed Low income EcoPass Pilot
Program white paper which is a collaborative effort between him and
Director Tayer to begin addressing the perceived lack of equity
between cash customers and subscribers to RTD discount programs.
At first glance Board members and Cal Marsella thought the program
has potential but will need time to flush it out.
Director Tayer shared the goal is to include this as part of the
comprehensive 2009 financial plan discussion with hopes to
implement a pilot along with the proposed fare increase in January.
Chair Kemp directed that the Board office would make available a
copy of this proposal to the full Board for their comments. He also
requested Cal to have staff perform a review with plans to
implement the pilot program in January.

IV.

Adjournment
The meeting adjourned at 12:50 p.m.
