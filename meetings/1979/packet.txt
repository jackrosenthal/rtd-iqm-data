BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: November 12, 2014

From:

Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: November 25, 2014

Subject:

Purchase twelve (12) Light Rail Vehicles

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a negotiations with Siemens to purchase
twelve (12) Light Rail Vehicles at a total price not to exceed $48 million, and to enter into the resulting
contract with Siemens.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Rail Operations needs to purchase twelve (12)
expansion Light Rail Vehicles in order to continue to provide the proper level of service. In addition,
adding these cars will provide a conservative number of spare cars needed to provide maintenance on
the existing fleet as it ages.
DISCUSSION
We need to begin negotiations with Siemens. It generally takes two (2) years from the time a notice to
proceed is issued before we see the first light rail car delivered. In addition, Siemens has historically
required thirty percent (30%) payment when the notice to proceed is issued, and an additional thirty
percent (30%) within the next ninety (90) days. Rail Operations staff has recently been in contact with
Siemens, and they have verbally agreed to delay the second thirty percent (30%) payment until 2016.
This will be a sole-source contract, and fits within RTD’s capital budget plan.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This acquisition is part of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) that was recently approved by RTD Board of
Directors. Funds are included in the 2015, 2016 and 2017 Strategic Budget Plan and the requested
2015 RTD Budget. In recent correspondence with Siemens, RTD has obtained a $3.9 million price for
each vehicle; RTD will also need to assure that purchase-related expenses, including a “Buy-America”
audit and on-site factory inspection during the car construction are funded.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Siemens has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its
DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to begin negotiations with Siemens, and if these
negotiations are successful, authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute a
contract to purchase twelve (12) Light Rail vehicles in an amount not to exceed amount
programmed in the SBP. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not allow us to begin negotiations with Siemens for the purchase of twelve (12) Light Rail
vehicles. This will delay the procurement process and is not in the best interest of RTD.

Board Meeting Date: November 25, 2014

Subject:

Budget Transfer for Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service and fuel line items of the
“Group 20” budget to the service line item of the “Group 23” budget to cover the variation in costs
incurred as a result of adjustments to service levels associated with runboard service changes in
2014. The total dollar amount of the budget transfer is $760,000.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with two (2) different service providers, First Transit and Transdev Services
(formerly known as Veolia Transportation), to provide fixed-route transit services under four (4)
service contracts. The fixed-route services are packaged in “groups” that include a variety of bus
routes. The fixed-route services currently operated by private contractors are as follows: Group 21
(Transdev), Group 22 (First Transit Longmont), Group 23 (First Transit Denver), and Group 24 (First
Transit Commerce City). First Transit Commerce City was providing service under the Group 20
contract through August of this year. That service was re-bid in 2014 and was subsequently
awarded again to First Transit as the Group 24 service package.
DISCUSSION:
Effective with each of the runboard service changes in 2014, RTD Service Planning & Scheduling
made adjustments in the number of service hours in all of the private contract fixed-route service
contracts to best distribute the available resources. The adjustments that were made to the Group
20 and Group 23 contracts resulted in an unanticipated increase in service hours in the Group 23
contract and a reduction in the service hours in the Group 20 contract. At the present time, the
Group 23 service hours have been increased to a level higher than the hours used to estimate costs
for the 2014 budget and the contract will run short of budget funding by the end of the year.
Conversely, the Group 20 service hours have been reduced below the level used to estimate costs
for the 2014 budget. Therefore, it is recommended that the excess budget dollars in Group 20 be
transferred to Group 23 to provide the additional budget funding needed for this service contract for
2014.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no financial impact. The Group 20 service contract currently has budgeted dollars available
to be transferred into the Group 23 service contract.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Approve the recommended action item so that funds will be available to pay invoices for Group
23 service through the end of 2014.
2)
Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will require
staff to locate additional sources for budget funding to pay invoices for Group 23 service.

Subject:

Budget Transfer for Contracted Access-a-Ride
Service

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service and fuel line items of the
Global Transportation and MV Transportation budgets to the service and fuel line items of the
Horizon Coach Lines budget to cover the variation in costs incurred as a result of the award of the
new Access-a-Ride service contract in 2014. The total dollar amount of the budget transfer is
$1,398,000.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with four (4) different service providers, Horizon Coach Lines, MV
Transportation, Via Mobility Services, and Transdev Services (formerly Veolia Transportation On
Demand), to provide Access-a-Ride paratransit services under four (4) service contracts. Three of
the service providers (Horizon, MV, and Via) use RTD-owned vehicles to provide “dedicated” service,
while the fourth provider (Transdev) uses Transdev-owned vehicles (taxi cabs) to provide “nondedicated” service. The current Access-a-Ride contracts were implemented in April of 2014
following the re-bid of the service in 2013. The current Access-a-Ride service model is a change
from the previous service model. Previously, the service had been provided by four (4) providers all
using RTD-provided vehicles and distributed as follows: MV Transportation—50% of revenue hours,
Global Transportation—16.6% of revenue hours, Horizon Coach Lines—16.6% of revenue hours and
Via Mobility Services—16.6% of revenue hours.
DISCUSSION:
At the time the 2014 budget was being prepared, the re-bid of the Access-a-Ride service was still in
the procurement process and no determination had been made on the service model or distribution of
service hours between providers. Consequently, the 2014 budgets were based on the existing 2013
service model as described above. The award/implementation of the new Access-a-Ride service
contracts in 2014 resulted in the following distribution of service: MV Transportation—50% of all
dedicated vehicle service hours, Horizon Coach Lines—25% of all dedicated vehicle service hours,
Via Mobility Services—25% of all dedicated vehicle service hours, and Transdev—100% of all nondedicated vehicle service (approximately 7% of the total Access-a-Ride service). The new Access-aRide service model resulted in an increase in revenue service hours for the Horizon and Via contracts
and a slight decrease in the service hours in the MV contract (over what had been used for budget
preparation). Global Transportation was not selected to continue providing service under the new
Access-a-Ride service model and contract. Therefore, the unused budgeted funds allocated to Global
in the 2014 budget were reallocated to the other providers.
Unfortunately, due to a
miscommunication, budget funding for Horizon was incorrectly allocated to MV. Therefore, those
funds now need to be transferred from MV to Horizon to cover the increased budget needs for
Horizon.
At the close of the Global Access-a-Ride contract, additional budget funds were released, which can

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.3

also be used to cover the budget funding shortfall for Horizon. Therefore, It is recommended that the
excess budget dollars from the Global budget and available budget dollars in the MV budget be
transferred to the Horizon budget to provide the additional budget funding needed for the increased
level service in the contract for 2014.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no financial impact. There are currently budgeted dollars available in the Global and MV
budgets to be transferred into the Horizon service contract.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Approve the recommended action item so that funds will be available to pay invoices for Horizon
service and fuel through the end of 2014.
2)
Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will require
staff to locate additional sources for budget funding to pay invoices for Horizon service and fuel.

Board Meeting Date: November 25, 2014

Subject:

Boulder Transit Village – Contract Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to amend contract 10FH032 with Adolfson and Peterson for an additional
$1,450,900, increasing the new not-to-exceed contract amount to $9,389,905.
BACKGROUND
In September 2010, RTD released an RFP for design-build teams to build a bus transfer facility on RTD owned land near 30th and Pearl Streets in Boulder, with the option of incorporating joint development in
support of the City of Boulder’s plan for the area.
In September 2011, the RTD Board of Directors awarded the development of the Boulder Junction TOD
project to the team of Adolfson and Peterson for a mixed-use development that included:







6 bay, below grade bus transfer facility similar to Market Street Station;
New access road, Junction Place, that connects the RTD transit facility to Pearl Parkway;
5 story, 390 space parking garage with 90 RTD parking spaces;
Public plaza connecting the Project elements to each other and the surrounding community;
5 story, 140 room hotel with associated retail;
71 units of affordable rental housing.

DISCUSSION
Currently the project is 90% complete. There have been three amendments to date that have added the
following:




Enclosure of the patron waiting area
Requirement of an escrow agreement to back up letter of credit
Floor vapor barrier

The work remaining that requires a contract amendment includes:









A permanent ground water filtration system
Emergency generator
Removal of unforeseen railroad ties
Upgrades to interior finishes
Security system
Building automation system
Data lines
Automatic elevator recall feature

DBE PARTICIPATION

Packet Pg. 9

1.B.4

The RFP called for a DBE requirement of 16% of the construction contract. Adolfson and Peterson is
exceeding the DBE goals for the Project and is providing for 24.9% DBE participation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The current contact value through amendment 3 is $7,938,905. The contract amendment will raise the
not-to-exceed contract amount to $9,389,905. The project funding is available from a remaining CMAQ
grant amount of approximately $1,200,000 and local match that is within the project budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to amend contract
10FH032 with Adolfson and Peterson for an additional $1,450,900, increasing the new not-toexceed contract amount to $9,389,905.
2. Do not accept the recommended action. This is not recommended as RTD would lose
approximately $1,200,000 of remaining CMAQ grant funding that is available for the project; and
important elements of the project would not be built.

Access-a-Ride/Cab 3rd Quarter Update

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership increased by 2% through the 3rd quarter of 2014 compared to the same period
of 2013. Productivity remained constant at 1.24 passengers per hour. During the same period, Accessa-Cab ridership increased by 9%. The increased use of Access-a-Cab by Access-a-Ride passengers
allows RTD to accommodate increased total program ridership while limiting the need to increase
resources devoted to Access-a-Ride. Combined Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab ridership increased by
4% compared to 2013.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride increased by 2% during the 3rd quarter of 2014
compared to the same period of 2013. Access-a-Ride is approximately 3% under budgeted revenue
hours through the third quarter of 2014.
On-Time Performance
Carrier on time performance through the 3rd quarter of 2014 was 95.1% and decreased slightly as
compared to the same period in 2013. Our private contractors continue to address on time performance
challenges. Several of the carriers continue to run radio advertisements as a means of attracting
potential operators.
Passenger on time performance through the 3rd quarter of 2014 was 82.45% and decreased slightly as
compared to the same period in 2013; however we are continuing to show an improvement over the 1st
quarter of 2014.
Customer Complaints
Complaints per passenger increased slightly through the 3rd quarter of 2014 as compared to the same
period in 2013 as complaints increased from 9 complaints per 10,000 passenger boardings (.0009) to
10 complaints per 10,000 passenger boardings (.0010). Staff continues to work with our carriers and
passengers to improve overall customer satisfaction.

Call-n-Ride Comments:
Belmar CnR - Call-n-Ride ridership had not met minimum expectation of 3 boardings per hour since
opening in April 2013. The January 2015 service changes will have the Call-n-Ride boundary changing
and the flex route discontinued.
Dry Creek CnR – The Dry Creek Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006 with the opening of the
Southeast Light Rail. The Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 7:00pm. The Call-n-Ride
currently serves the Dry Creek Station. The boundaries can best be described as Arapahoe Road on the
north, I-25 on the east, County Line Road to the south and Holly on the west. During off peak hours the
Call-n-Ride serves the entire area. During peak hours the Call-n-Ride serves only to Quebec. The
January 2015 recommended service changes calls for changing the boundaries by not serving west of
Quebec and north of Dry Creek. This area has been very unproductive and by removing this section may
allow better productivity in the remaining area.
Evergreen CnR – This Call-n-Ride began in March 2002 and ridership has always been above the
minimum boardings per hour until 2013. In 2013 the ridership began to drop off. This was due to
numerous reasons: Many of our older regular customers passed away, a school that routinely used the
service closed down and an organization that works with the disabled that used our bus for over 10
years decided to purchase their own bus. Last May we started a concentrated effort to market to the
children for use over the summer and for the new school year. The RTD Marketing group is currently

Packet Pg. 33

1.C.4

working on a marketing plan for this Call-n-Ride. In January, RTD will be forming a Transportation
Advisory Committee to evaluate the service and look at possible changes to increase ridership.
South Jeffco – Ridership is above the minimum 3 boardings per hour, and we would like to see this rise
to 4 boardings per hour. The trips to Lockheed Martin have had low ridership. The RTD Marketing
group is currently working on a marketing plan for this Call-n-Ride.
Thornton – Ridership is above the minimum 3 boardings per hour, and we would like to see this rise to 4
boardings per hour. The RTD Marketing group is currently working on a marketing plan for this Call-nRide.
Federal Heights – Call-n-Ride ridership has not met minimum expectation of 3 boardings per hour. This
Call-n-Ride was recommended for discontinuance in January 2015. This Call-n-Ride was grant funded
by 4 municipalities. It should be noted that for the past two months, the Call-n-Ride has been averaging
4 boardings per hour. An advocate in the area has been assertively teaching seniors to utilize the
service. The RTD and the funding partners will enter into a cost share agreement to fund the Call-n-Ride
for 2015. In January 2015, RTD and Adams County will be forming a Transportation Advisory
Committee to evaluate the Call-n-Rides and look at possible changes to increase ridership.
Highlands Ranch - Call-n-Ride ridership has not met the minimum expectation of 3 boardings per hour.
This Call-n-Ride was recommended for discontinuance in January 2015. RTD and the funding partners
will enter into a cost share agreement to fund the Call-n-Ride for 2015. In November 2015, RTD,
Douglas County and the Highlands Ranch Metro District will be forming a Transportation Advisory
Committee to evaluate the Call-n-Ride and look at possible changes to increase ridership.
Parker – Call-n-Ride ridership has not met the minimum expectation of 3 boardings per hour. This Call-nRide was recommended for discontinuance in January 2015. RTD and the funding partners will enter
into a cost share agreement to fund the Call-n-Ride for 2015. In November 2015, RTD, Douglas County
and the Town of Parker will be forming a Transportation Advisory Committee to evaluate the Call-n-Ride
and look at possible changes to increase ridership

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 3rd
Quarter 2014

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the third quarter of 2014 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 3rd quarter. First Transit and Transdev (formerly known as
Veolia Transportation) continue to utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident
investigations for retraining of operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all
employees at monthly safety meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at
their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per
100,000 miles in the 3rd quarter. All of the six passenger accidents that occurred in the 3rd
quarter were classified as non-preventable. First Transit and Transdev continue to conduct
proactive retraining to increase operator awareness of passenger mobility issues to reduce the
number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 3rd quarter. The contractor organizations place a high
emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local
operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.

Packet Pg. 38

1.C.5



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
The contractors as a group did not meet the target of 88% Local On-Time Service in the 3rd
quarter. Only Transdev met this goal with 88.6% Local On-Time Service. RTD and the private
contractors are currently campaigning routes and operators with low on time performance with a
renewed focus on first time point departures. On a monthly basis contractors review the OTP
report and meet with operators of low performing routes to discuss factors that are impacting
their ability to reach 88% on time performance.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 26,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 3rd quarter. The contractors continue to improve in this
area by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely
manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
The contractors as a group met the target of .0004 Complaints per Boarding in the 3rd quarter.
Individually, First Transit Commerce City and First Transit Longmont met the goal with .0004 and
.0003 complaints per boarding in the 3rd quarter. First Transit Denver and Transdev continue to
investigate and address customer complaints with operators. The contractors utilize onboard
video surveillance to retrain operators on the importance of good customer service and automatic
vehicle location software to improve on time performance. The contractors also continue to
address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.

3rd Quarter Customer Complaint Analysis

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 3rd Quarter of 2014. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2013.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding. The goal for 2014 was again adjusted to account for the static higher level of complaints due
to the securement area/priority seating issues, the fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability,
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line service. The goal for 2014 is .0004 complaints per
passenger boarding.
For the 3rd Quarter of 2014, RTD, First Transit Commerce City, and First Transit Longmont met the goal
of .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. First Transit Denver and Veolia had .0005 complaints per
passenger boarding. The combined performance for all of the private contractors was .0004 complaints
per passenger boarding. The combined performance for RTD and the private contractors was .0004
complaints per passenger boarding.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per playback
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the complaint
RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.

Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices and produce a quarterly newsletter which is
shared with operations personnel.
RTD is conducting refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis,
DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for
disabled passengers.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.

Historically, and in 2014, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – For 3rd Quarter 2014, the complaints in this category decreased 30.2% compared
to the same period in 2013. In many cases, CAD/AVL “flashbacks” confirm that buses are on route, but
running late. However, from the passenger’s perspective, the bus did not show. The YTD average in
this category for 2014 is 4.8 complaints per day. This reflects an improvement from 6.9 complaints per
day in 2013.
Bus Early – For 3rd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category decreased 24.9% compared to the same
period in 2013. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The

Packet Pg. 42

1.C.6

YTD average in this category for 2014 is 5.2 complaints per day. This is an improvement from 6.9
complaints per day in 2013.
Bus Late – For 3rd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 3.1% compared to the same
period in 2013. Improving on-time performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons
including construction, traffic and heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same
number of passengers on fewer trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address runningtime issues. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 12.4 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2013 was 12.0 complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – For 3rd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 16.1%
compared to the same period in 2013. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and
undercover ride checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate
manner. In addition, the private contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive
Cam, Smart Drive) installed on the buses and RTD is in the process of installing a similar system on its
buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to be counseled and
retrained as needed to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety campaigns are conducted to
reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category is 4.7 complaints per day. The
comparable number for 2013 was 4.1 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – For 3rd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 0.7% compared to
the same period in 2013. In the majority of cases, video evidence usually confirms that the operator
followed proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 11.2 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2013 was 11.1 complaints per day.
Discrimination – This category was created in 2009 to track complaints related to Title VI issues. For
3rd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category decreased 23.7% compared to the same period in 2013.
Investigation into discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at fault. The YTD
average in this category for 2014 is 0.3 complaints per day. This reflects an improvement from 0.4
complaints per day in 2013.
Fare Dispute – For 3rd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category decreased 17.3% compared to the
same period in 2013. It appears passengers have come to accept the fact that operators are expecting
fares to be paid upon boarding. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that
passengers presented an improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of
the fare policies. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 1.2 complaints per day. This reflects an
improvement from 1.4 complaints per day in 2013.
Improper Procedure/Operator – For 3rd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 11.7%
compared to the same period in 2013. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the recently completed ADA refresher training provided information to remind operators of the
procedures to follow to ensure passengers in mobility devices are able to board the bus. In cases where
video evidence shows operators are not following proper procedures, appropriate action is taken. The

Packet Pg. 43

1.C.6

YTD average in this category for 2014 is 8.3 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013
was 7.4 complaints per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator –For 3rd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category decreased 2.3% compared to
the same period in 2013. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, the
Bus Operator Training Newsletter Team, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers are providing operators with
up-to-date information to answer customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average
in the category for 2014 is 0.5 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was also 0.5
complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – For 3rd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 8.2%
compared to the same period in 2013. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop
as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be
waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (128 of the total 2,963 = 4%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources
will allow. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 10.9 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2013 was 10.0 complaints per day.

Customer Satisfaction Survey
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops

DISCUSSION:
Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons contacted during the
quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area and conduct an onboard enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables summarize information for the months of July, August, and September. These
tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the estimated fare evasion
rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests made by police officers.
Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion.
This is an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have

the authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This quarter the

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Security Officer Use of Force Incidents
Use of Force is defined as any hands on touching of a suspect by a security officer to detain a suspect
or make a citizen’s arrest. The majority of these issues are minor in nature. No injuries to any suspect
or officer occurred in this reporting quarter. The following table summarizes the use of force incidents
per month.
