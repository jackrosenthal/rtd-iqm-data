#### 1. Purchase twelve (12) Light Rail Vehicles

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a negotiations with Siemens to purchase twelve (12) Light Rail Vehicles at a total price not to exceed $48 million, and to enter into the resulting contract with Siemens.

Motion:               Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager for Rail Operations, explained that these new vehicles will supplement the existing fleet with the I-225 and Southeast extension corridors openings.  He noted that Light Rail service is popular, thus needing more vehicles on the streets.

Director Bagley said that he had chatted with Austin Jenkins during the LEED® Green Building Certification Award Ceremony at Denver Union Station (DUS).  He noted that he had a couple of questions that he wanted to have on the record.

Director Bagley asked about the external appearance of the 12 new vehicles.  Austin Jenkins said that the new vehicles are an upgraded version of the same series as the existing fleet.  He noted that the new vehicles feature advances in design, structure, and technology.

Director Bagley asked Austin Jenkins regarding bicycle accommodations in the new vehicles.   Austin Jenkins replied that accommodating bicycles is a challenge.  He noted that the cars are the same size as the current cars.  In order to accommodate bicycles, seats would have to be given up.  The feedback from riders is to not give up seats.  Austin Jenkins noted that most morning trains from the Southeast lines are maxed out at four cars and standing room.  Austin Jenkins added that seating will be knee to back on the new fleet.

Director Tobiassen said that his first question was regarding seating and that it had been answered.  He wondered if the new fleet would have a ripple effect on RTD’s ability to store vehicles.  Austin Jenkins stated that the Board action earlier in the year to store vehicles along the I-225 corridor will pay dividends; there will be no problem storing the cars.

Director Daly said his question was also regarding seating and that it had been addressed.

Director Lubow pointed out that bikes are important.  She asked staff to further discuss room for bicycles on Light Rail vehicles.  Austin Jenkins informed the Directors that he wrote a paper on this subject and led the conversion of the fleet while he worked in San Jose, CA.  He reiterated that in order to gain something, in this case bicycle space, something must be given up, seats.  He noted that the current fleet allows for four (4) bikes on each train car except behind the operator.  On a full four (4) car train this amounts to fourteen (14) bikes.  RTD cars do not have the space in the middle section to put hangers in place like other agencies with longer cars have done.  Director Lubow said that fourteen (14) bikes is not bad.

Director Deadwyler wondered why RTD has not considered switching to longer buses or trains like other agencies, for example, Indianapolis.  Austin Jenkins replied that a uniform fleet through the same manufacturer saves the agency a lot of money.  He said that RTD’s current vehicle is a good vehicle.  He added that the current scenario is the best situation for what the agency has.

Director Solano wondered if ridership was growing since purchasing twelve (12) vehicles would allow for room to grow.  Austin Jenkins said that ridership has increased since the opening of the W Rail Line.  He also noted the increase ridership during Bronco game days.

Committee Chair Lubow declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

Austin Jenkins expressed his thanks to the Board for working together through the past years.  He was not sure if and when he would address the Board again before his transition from RTD.

#### 2. Budget Transfer for Contracted Fixed-Route Services

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service and fuel line items of the “Group 20” budget to the service line item of the “Group 23” budget to cover the variation in costs incurred as a result of adjustments to service levels associated with runboard service changes in 2014.  The total dollar amount of the budget transfer is $760,000.

Motion:               Director Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, noted that this recommended action is a housekeeping adjustment as contracts are finalized.

Director Folska corrected the budget transfer amount read out loud to match the one on the Board Report as $760,000.

Committee Chair Lubow declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

#### 3. Budget Transfer for Contracted Access-a-Ride Service

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service and fuel line items of the Global Transportation and MV Transportation budgets to the service and fuel line items of the Horizon Coach Lines budget to cover the variation in costs incurred as a result of the award of the new Access-a-Ride service contract in 2014.  The total dollar amount of the budget transfer is $1,398,000.

Motion:               Director Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, noted that this recommended action is a housekeeping adjustment to fund the current contracts for the three (3) contracted providers.  When the budget was prepared there were four (4) contracted providers.

Committee Chair Lubow declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

Bruce Abel said that Austin Jenkins, Assistant Manager for Rail Operations, apologized for leaving early as he had an engagement at the Denver International Airport.

#### 4. Boulder Transit Village  – Contract Amendment

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to amend contract 10FH032 with Adolfson and Peterson for an additional $1,450,900, increasing the new not-to-exceed contract amount to $9,389,905.

Motion:               Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Richard Rost, Manager for Facilities Engineering, explained to the Directors that the project is 90% complete.  The remaining work requiring the amendment includes:

- A permanent ground water filtration system

- Emergency generator

- Removal of unforeseen railroad ties

- Upgrades to interior finishes

- Security system

- Building automation system

- Data lines

- Automatic elevator recall feature

Richard Rost also noted that the project funding is available from a remaining CMAQ grant amount of approximately $1,200,000 and local match that is within the project budget.  He said that the team is aiming at an August, 2015 move in date.

Director Bagley asked why the items listed were not originally considered.  He also noted that this project has been going on for four (4) to five (5) years.  Richard Rost answered that the project has been going on for longer than that.  He said that the original scope was a Park-n-Ride surface lot.  He added that the listed items are necessary as the project moves towards a Transit Oriented Development (TOD) with a parking structure.  Director Bagley expressed his satisfaction with Richard Rost’s answer.

Director Solano asked regarding the removal of unforeseen railroad ties.  He said that this makes him imagine there is some sort of excavation projected for the project.  Richard Rost answered in the affirmative.  He said that this would account for any unforeseen work in that area.

Director Menten asked for clarification on the completion of the project.  Richard Rost said that the project is 90% complete.

Director Menten said that when the project originally was approved, the figure was $7.145 million.  She pointed out that the $1.4 million requested adds considerably to the total amount of the project.  She asked if this was the final number or if the Board should expect another increase.  Richard Rost replied that the project is so close to the end that staff does not anticipate any further increases.  He noted that there is a contingency built within the $1.4 million requested.  Phil Washington, General Manager, said that the project could potentially come under the $1.4 million.  Dave Genova, Assistant General Manager for Safety, Security, and Facilities, added that funding is available through a CMAQ grant of $1.2 million dollars.  In order to secure the funding, the agency needs to move ahead with the project.

Director Hoy said that the discussion may have answered his question.  He wondered where the remaining funding will come from.  He said that it sounded like the remaining $1.2 million is covered under the CMAQ grant.  Richard Rost replied that the amounts are in the existing budget and that this is under the General Manager’s authority increase.  Dave Genova clarified that the request is a contract amendment, not asking for extra money.  Director Hoy wanted to clarify that he heard Phil Washington and Dave Genova say that RTD may not need to use the requested amount.  Dave Genova told Director Hoy that he was correct.

Director Folska mentioned that she hopes the accessibility issues that surfaced at Denver Union Station do not happen at this station.

Director Menten asked for clarification on the permanent ground water filtration.  Richard Rost said the property is at a high water table.  Since the bus station is below the water line, water would need to be pumped at all times.

Committee Chair Lubow declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. Updated RTD System Map/Line Colors and Letters

Scott Reed, Assistant Manager for Communications, introduce Pauletta Tonilas, Senior Manager for Public Relations and Public Information, and Kate Wilson, Marketing Account Executive.

Kate Wilson distributed the revised FasTracks Line Map to the Directors.  Scott Reed said the map includes the letter and color designation for the lines.  He reminded the Directors that the extension process started in 2000.  Letters were used as identifiers as this was consistent with the Regional bus system.  He said that the colors are for map purposes only.

Kate Wilson told the Directors that the current project started this past summer.  Staff looked at project and system planning and followed any precedents set.  The new lines are designated as below:

- A – Airport/East line.  This letter has been historically reserved for this line.

- B – Northwest line/Boulder.  This letter has been historically reserved for this line.

- G – Gold line

- L – Central rail extension as it will loop through Downtown Denver

- N – North metro line

- R – I-225.  This letters alliterates with Aurora.

Kate Wilson reiterated that the colors are for map purposes only and not for line identification.  She said that staff took careful considerations when choosing colors as to ease confusion at intersections.

Director Lasater mentioned that for the past year and a half he had been told that the eventual Ridge Gate/I-225 line was called the “Z” line.  He wondered where the “R” came from.  Kate Wilson said that for planning and internal document purposes the line was referred as “Z” line.  Scott Reed added that the “R” was for the alliteration with Aurora as the “A” line had been historically reserved for the airport line.  Director Lasater pointed out that half the line is not in Aurora.  Scott Reed said that the City of Aurora is doing marketing to rebrand around the rail line.

Director Tobiassen said that he supports naming the I-225 line as the “R” line.

#### 2. Fare Study Task Force Update

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, explained that the update discusses alternatives identified, initial screenings, and the alternatives that have passed for further evaluation.  Staff is not making any recommendations at this time.

Lacy Bell, Planning Project Manager, reviewed the presentation as included in the Operations and Customer Service Committee meeting packet for November 18, 2014.  Bruce Abel added that the first phase of the study looked at the structure.  The analysis is related to price.  Staff and CH2M HILL, the consultants, are looking at alternative structures to achieve revenue neutrality.  He said that the next stage is pricing alternatives as it relates to sustainability; third stage as it relates to programs.  He said that staff’s timeline is to make a recommendation by January, 2015, go to public meetings, finalize fare level and pricing by May or June, 2015, and wrap up the process by September, 2015 in order to implement by January 2016.

Director Tobiassen noted that the presentation did not reference the benefit of free parking at light rail stations.  Bruce Abel said that parking is a specific item CH2M HILL will address during the process.

Director Tobiassen asked if the study addressed discount passes, such as Senior discount and students.  Bruce Abel said that staff has taken discount passes into consideration during the process.

Director Bagley noted that the Littleton public meeting is scheduled for December 11, the same date as the Board dinner and the Highlands Ranch Transportation Advisory Task Force meeting.  He asked staff to consider finding another time so he and other Directors could attend.  Bruce Abel said that he would ask the outreach team and see what could be done.

Director Walker asked if customers would pay extra for different types of services, i.e. bus and rail.  He mentioned that he may have missed this during the presentation.  Lacy Bell answered that that is one of the pieces being looked at and no decision has been made.

Director James asked regarding the plans for EcoPass and other similar products.  Bruce Abel replied that these will part of the third phase as these products are impacted by pricing and structure.

Director Deadwyler mentioned that she was disheartened because some of the Directors and constituents have asked to participate in the Fare Task Force and have not been included.  She said the presentation seemed to be more of the same in terms of fare.  She noted that fares need to be accessible for those that are less fortunate as they are the ones who utilize and need public transportation the most.  Director Deadwyler pointed out that since public meetings are not well attended, the feedback gathered is not a fair assessment of what is going on in the market place.  She encouraged staff to reconsider adding a couple of board members and constituents that use services daily to make sure all the bases are covered.  Bruce Abel replied that staff has incorporated all feedback received and will continue to do that.

Director Solano noted that there are no public meetings in Commerce City, one of the locations with many low income people who utilize the services the most.  He wondered why there would be a meeting in Littleton but not in Commerce City.

Director Hoy told staff he appreciated the update.  He said that he finds the present composition of the Fare Study Task Force appropriate.

Director Hoy addressed the concept of “fair fare”.  He said that it is fairness that everybody pays for the service they receive: type of bus, length of trip, etc.  Bruce Abel said that staff will continue to review this for RTD.  He noted that other smaller agencies have gone to flat fare.

Chair Sisk said that RTD needs to expand its footprint in reaching people.  He noted that public meetings are poorly attended.  He wondered if maybe inviting the Citizens Advisory Committee would be helpful in gathering feedback.  He said he would like to see the agency utilizing local TV channels as a way to communicate with the constituents.  Bruce Abel replied that staff has used customer panels in the early stages and anticipates to use them as the process unfolds.  Lacy Bell noted that there will be a web presence to gather feedback.  She said she would look into local channel opportunities.

Director Menten remembers that the past discounted passes were only valid during off peak hours, but that Director Daly shared it made things very difficult for the drivers.  She wonders when the program changed.  Bruce Able said that the original thinking was that the passes would help shift some of the travel demand away from peak hours; however, it was determined that there was no impact and caused a great deal of confusion and many confrontations.  He stated that the Board approved the discounted passes being valid at all times in 2002.

Director Anderson said that she seconded Chair Sisk’s proposal of utilizing local TV channels.  She said that the audience could have an interactive participation by calling in or going to the website for comments.

Director Folska asked if the Fare Task Force included members from the Finance department.  Bruce Abel said that Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, and Doug MacLeod, Manager for Financial Reporting, are part of the Fare Task Force.

Director Folska said that it is important to understand the actual cost of operating each line.  She asked staff for the operational cost allocation for each line.  Bruce Abel said that staff does have that information but he did not have it available with him at the meeting.

Director Folska added to the communication piece that Chair Sisk and Director Anderson mentioned.  She said that she would love to see a communication campaign with the constituents.  She encouraged staff to use the hold message on the phone line as a tool to encourage people to have their voices heard.  She suggested driving people to the website and other different venues.

Director Folska agreed with Director Tobiassen on his parking thoughts.  She added that it is important to help people that struggle to pay for transportation.

Director Solano said that as a government agency, RTD should run efficiently.  He said this is more important than revenue neutrality.

Director Lubow thanked staff for their work on this complex matter.  She said that she has talked to some constituents about how the fare study will simplify the structure.  She said that she was deflated to find out that one of the options is to remain the same.  Lacy Bell said that the current structure is included as a baseline.  Neither one of the options presented is a recommendation to the Board.  Director Lubow mentioned that she thought the options presented were the two best options.  Bruce Abel replied that the benefits of no change could be perceived as another option.  Director Lubow said that some people may be disappointed if there is no change.

Director Lubow mentioned that one of the feedbacks from the public meetings was accessibility to discounted fares.  Bruce Abel said that this will be part of the third phase.  Lacy Bell added that CH2M HILL will have some preliminary findings soon.

Director Lubow asked if there will be email outreach in order to gain feedback since people do not attend the public meetings as much.  Lacy Bell answered that those that replied to the first email outreach will be included in the next phase.  She said her team would ask marketing about using other list serves.

Bruce Abel noted that the next four items on the agenda would also be covered during the updates of the Financial Administration & Audit Committee meeting.  He told the Directors that if they had any questions at the moment staff could address them.  He invited the Directors to wait until the Financial Administration & Audit Committee meeting updates as that discussion may answer some of questions.

#### 7. 3rd Quarter 2014 Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary

John Tarbert, Transit Police Chief, referred the Directors to the report included in the Operations and Customers Service Committee meeting packet for November 18, 2014.

Director Menten noted that a few months back there was a news clip from the Lakewood Police Department regarding a notice that the city of Lakewood had received a grant to be used towards supplying the officers with additional Tasers.  This made it sound like there is a crime problem.  She has not heard of this from her constituents using the W line.  She asked Chief Tarbert if there had been a spurt in crime in Lakewood. She said that she had reached out to the City of Lakewood but has not heard back.  She asked Chief Tarbert for assistance in following up with the City of Lakewood.  Chief Tarbert replied that he would call the City of Lakewood in the morning.

Director Tobiassen noted that the report from the City of Aurora is that they really appreciate all the work from RTD and contracted security officers.

Director Tobiassen mentioned that the City of Lakewood has adopted a no smoking ordinance.  He asked if RTD had contracted Lakewood police on duty as they do in Denver.  Chief Tarbert replied that yes, there are Lakewood police officers that are contracted by RTD in their off hours.  RTD security has to follow State law.  In Lakewood, they could enforce the city ordinance if they wanted, but that is not an RTD policy.

Chair Sisk noted the increase in patrons checked during the third quarter.  Chief Tarbert replied that the increase had to do with the Broncos ridership during games.

Director Hoy noted the number of fare evasions on buses.  He wondered how this happened since the bus operator should collect fares.  Chief Tarbert said that plain clothes police officers watch interactions between patrons and customer.  If nothing happens, then they make contact for fare evasion.  Chief Tarbert added that the high number of arrests are because initial contact is made for fare evasion but the patron ends up having an arrest warrant.

Director Folska asked for clarification on where the highest fare evasion happened: bus or rail.  She also inquired about the percentage of fare evasion.  Chief Tarbert said that most fare evasion happens on rail.  The percentage for July was 3.4%.  The percentages for August and September were 4.3%.  Director Folska mentioned that the feedback she gets from her constituents makes it seem that we have an out of control fare evasion problem.  They get very upset when someone does not pay.  She wondered how to correct that public perception.

### D. Other Matters

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, updated the Directors on the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition (CCDC) agreement.  Under the agreement, RTD retained an ADA expert to ensure that the agency complies and enforces the policy issues agreed upon: mainly access to the securement area.  The initial report has been submitted. The primary issue raised was that the agreement did not include a transition period, which RTD incorporated.  The ADA expert found that the agreement did imply a transition plan. The report does not identify deficiencies; therefore RTD will not complete a remediation plan.  Staff will provide the Board with a copy of the report once finalized.

Director Solano said that he received calls from constituents saying that riders were being evicted from Denver Union Station (DUS) when the temperatures dropped below freezing in the past week.  Chief Tarbert said that this was the first time he had heard of this and that he would look into it.  Director Solano hoped that these events had not happened as tax payers paid in part for DUS.

Director Deadwyler said that she had heard that DUS staff was asking the homeless to leave during the drop in temperature as well.  She said that an article on the Denver Post quoted an RTD representative as saying, “we are not responsible for hosting these people – they are loitering.”  Director Deadwyler wondered if RTD had a policy for extreme weather.  She said that if there was not one in place it should be created.  She noted that if one was in place maybe it needed to be changed.  Director Deadwyler added that the libraries were open offering a warm place.  In her opinion DUS should be open as well as it is considered the living room of the community.  Scott Reed, Assistant Manager for Communications, said that the quote was attributed to him.  He was asked by the reporter if RTD had facilities to house the homeless.  The flipped reference was published.  He said that he did point out that RTD facilities are transit oriented.  If people are in an RTD property and not using transit it could be considered loitering.  Director Deadwyler expressed her disappointment on the flipped reference.  She pointed out that the article included a picture of a security officer escorting people out.  She added that when the temperature drops below zero we should leave the homeless alone.  Phil Washington, General Manager, mentioned that this was the first time he had heard about it and that staff will look into it.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Lubow adjourned to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee at 6:57 p.m.
