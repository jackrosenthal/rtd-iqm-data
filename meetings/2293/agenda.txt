Call to Order

Action Item: Video Recording for Board Chamber
It is recommended by the Executive Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager to implement a system to audio and video
record all RTD Board meetings, committee meetings and study sessions, and post
the videos to the RTD website for public viewing. This action also approves the
initial upfront costs not to exceed $25,000 to purchase and install equipment
necessary to record the meetings. In addition, this action approves funding for a
contract technician to facilitate the video recording at each meeting and an offsite
contractor to provide closed captioning services. These services combine for an
estimated not-to-exceed amount of $35,000 a year.
