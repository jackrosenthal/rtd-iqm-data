US 36 Bus Rapid Transit – Use of Contingency
Funds from Phase I and II Commitments

Board Meeting Date: April 2, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors modify the
formal actions taken on August 23, 2011 and July 24, 2012 concerning RTD funding provided to the
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the Colorado High Performance Toll Enterprise
(HPTE) for Phase I and Phase II of the US 36 Managed Lanes Project. Specifically, it is recommended
that the RTD Board of Directors allow the following actions:



Any RTD funding left over after completion of Phase I may be used for the Phase II project; and
Any RTD funding left over after the completion of both Phase I and Phase II will be used for
acquisition of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) vehicles for the corridor.

BACKGROUND
On August 23, 2011 the RTD Board of Directors authorized funding in the amount of $120 million for
Phase I of CDOT’s Managed Lanes project, which extends from the current High Occupancy Vehicle
lanes ending at approximately US 36 and Pecos to approximately US 36 and Broomfield between
Flatirons and 88th Street in Louisville. On July 24, 2012, the RTD Board of Directors authorized an
additional $15 million for CDOT’s Phase II project, which will extend from 88th Street to Table Mesa.
The Board Report for Phase II funding included the following language, “Should less than $15 million be
required by HPTE to complete the second phase of the project, RTD staff has requested and remains
firm in the conviction that HPTE should reduce RTD’s commitment – prior to that of any of the other
funding partners. In this case, RTD would reprogram any remaining funds into additional BRT
improvements in the corridor.”
DISCUSSION
HPTE and CDOT have advised RTD that the completion of Phase II will require the use of contingency
funds remaining from Phase I, and CDOT and HPTE have requested that RTD authorize the use of
remaining Phase I funds for Phase II. In light of that request and assuming it is authorized by the RTD
Board of Directors, CDOT, RTD and HPTE have developed a proposed framework to allocate any funds
remaining after Phase II is complete. CDOT will use its funds for the I-25 and US 36 Managed Lanes,
which includes capital rehabilitation of I-25 High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes structures on the segment
between US 36 and Denver Union Station on which the majority of US 36 BRT services will operate.
The rehabilitation of these structures will be included in the total cost of the US 36 Managed Lanes
Project. The three entities propose that any funds remaining after cost of construction of the entire
Project (Phase I, Phase II, and I-25 HOT lanes structure rehabilitation) will be spent by all parties, for
additional elements to enhance/build out the I-25 and US 36 Managed Lanes and BRT.
CDOT would not use any of its remaining Project funds (other than Bridge Enterprise Funds that are
statutorily restricted) except on projects selected, with RTD concurrence, within the US 36 and I-25
corridors. RTD would use its share of remaining funds solely on BRT vehicle acquisition. DRCOG will be

Packet Pg. 4

1.C.1

asked to commit that any remaining grant funds it has provided to the project remain in the corridor and
be allocated to RTD for BRT vehicle acquisition. HPTE will use all funds (not including shared toll
revenues which may be received by HPTE in the future and which are in any event subject to
expenditure approval by RTD) in the corridor for maintenance and capital reserve or any remaining capital
infrastructure needed for BRT that can be implemented under CDOT/HPTE’s authority.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact resulting from the recommended action, because RTD has already authorized
the full $135 million to CDOT/HPTE for Phase I and Phase II of the US 36 Managed Lanes project.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors modify the formal actions taken on August 23, 2011 and July 24, 2012
concerning RTD funding provided to the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the
Colorado High Performance Toll Enterprise (HPTE) for Phase I and Phase II of the US 36 Managed Lanes
Project. Specifically, it is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors allow the following actions:



Any RTD funding left over after completion of Phase I may be used for the Phase II project; and
Any RTD funding left over after the completion of both Phase I and Phase II will be used for
acquisition of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) vehicles for the corridor.

2. Do not approve the modifications to how RTD funding may be applied to the US 36 Managed Lanes
Project. This action is not recommended. The requested use of Phase I remaining funds to complete
Phase II of the US 36 Managed Lanes project, when combined with available grant funds and funds from
other parties, will allow the completion of the managed lanes to Table Mesa, thereby completing the
primary capital improvements required to achieve BRT in the US 36 Corridor.
