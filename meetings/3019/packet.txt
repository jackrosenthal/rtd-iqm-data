involving many people operating at different
levels of their respective companies.”

Safety Moment

RTD R Line
Derailment

• The R Line train derailed at the intersection of South Sable Boulevard and East
Exposition Avenue on Jan. 28.

Attachment: RTD Board Packet RTD SMS 072820 (4277 : Safety Management System -

2.1.a

• The derailment occurred as the train was going too fast around a 90-degree curve.
• One passenger was thrown from the train and others were injured in a
derailment Monday morning in Aurora
• “Light rail operators are trained to slow their trains when approaching sharp
turns,”

Consider how the factors of the Reason Model might apply to this event:
• Organizational processes
• Latent conditions
• Workplace conditions

• Defenses
• Active failure

• Safety is not the absence of
accidents
• Safety is the presence of
defenses (mitigations)
• So, our role is to …
… Keep failure from being successful!

Packet Pg. 45

Attachment: RTD Board Packet RTD SMS 072820 (4277 : Safety Management System -

2.1.a

Risk Acceptance
The key for RTD is understanding exactly what is meant by
acceptable or tolerable risk.
The expression “acceptable risk” usually, but not always, refers to the level at which
further risk reduction measures or additional expenditure of resources will not result in
significant reduction of risk” – ANSI B1.0 - 2010
Risk acceptance is a policy decision that must be owned & embraced by RTD, as an
agency, not individuals within RTD

KEY
POINT

Risk acceptance is defined at RTD within the Safety Risk Management Process
“Accepting” a risk does not mean the risk is eliminated
 “Residual risk” still remains
 Remaining risk is sufficiently low to be outweighed by the benefits of the
existing operation
Packet Pg. 46

Attachment: RTD Board Packet RTD SMS 072820 (4277 : Safety Management System -

Thought Exercise: Risk Acceptance:
Consider Covid-19: How do
people differ in the precautions
they take?

Examples: Totally segregated,
Hang out socially distanced, no
precautions

Consider risk tolerance within

Example: Different hiring criteria,
accident tolerance or intolerance,

- Lack of attention or funding for safety

BUDGET
REDUCTION
PRINCIPLES.

Service reductions should not be our primary response. We’ll be
creative: We will take a balanced approach to budget reductions
and do so in such a way as to align with our mission. Accordingly,
service reductions should be minimized so as to minimize the
impact to our customers. We will strive for a well-rounded
approach by incorporating reductions in overhead, breaking down
silos and engaging partners, and seeking creative approaches to
service delivery.

#3
We’ll prioritize mobility for people who most depend on transit
during the pandemic: We will strive to maximize mobility during the
pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services
to access essential jobs and other necessities, while also keeping
our communities and activity centers appropriately connected.
