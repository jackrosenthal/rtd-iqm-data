STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Erin Vallejos, Senior Manager Contracted Services, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to § 32-9-119.5(2)(a), C.R.S., RTD operates a system under which up to 58% of the agency’s
vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses, nonprofit organizations, or local
governments pursuant to competitively negotiated contracts. The agency currently contracts
approximately 45% of fixed-route service, 100% of complementary paratransit service (Access-a-Ride),
and 100% of FlexRide service, for a total amount of contracted transit service of approximately 56%.
The first contract for the provision of contracted fixed-route services was referred to as the “Group 1”
contract, and each subsequent contract was given a higher number. The service contract referred to as
“Group 32” replaces the Group 28 service contract, which will expire on August 24, 2024. The Group
32 service package consists of 116 buses operating 20 routes that provide service to the cities of
Arvada, Aurora, Brighton, Commerce City, Englewood, Glendale, Lakewood, Littleton, Thornton,
Westminster, and Wheat Ridge, the City and County of Broomfield, and the City and County of Denver,
providing approximately 236,786 revenue hours per year.
DISCUSSION
On July 12, 2023, RTD issued a solicitation for the provision of fixed-route service referred to herein as
Group 32 service. The solicitation was made available on the RTD website and was advertised via transit
industry-related publications. Proposals were due September 21, 2023. During the two-month
solicitation period, two proposals were received. A panel of staff subject matter experts assessed the

Packet Pg. 3

1.E.1

proposals using pre-determined objective evaluative criteria. Based on the overall evaluations of the
proposals, the panel recommends awarding the contract to Transdev Services, Inc.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding is included in the 2024 Budget for the provision of Group 32 services effective August 25,
2024. Funding for future contract years is contemplated in the agency’s financial forecast and will be
presented for the Board’s consideration annually, as identified within each year’s respective budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Drug and Alcohol Policy Amendments

January 17, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
January 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the amendments to the RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy (Policy)
mandated by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) of the United States Department of Transportation
(DOT).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Charlene Polege, Chief People Officer
Edin Memic, Manager, HR DOT Compliance
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
The FTA requires that recipients of Section 5307, 5309, 5311, or 5339 funds that have safety-sensitive
employees have an FTA-compliant drug and alcohol testing program in place for such employees and a
supporting drug and alcohol policy adopted by the appropriate governing body or other “final authority”
entity. Further, the drug and alcohol policy must also comply with DOT regulations. The RTD Board of
Directors last approved the Policy on March 4, 2013. Except for minor corrections and updates, the
Board is responsible for approving all substantive amendments to the Policy.
In accordance with the Colorado Labor Peace Act, RTD is required to negotiate directly with the
Amalgamated Transit Union 1001 (ATU 1001) any terms of employment that impact working conditions
(e.g., wages, hours, scheduling, work rules, work assignments and job protection provisions, and
grievance and arbitration procedures).
DISCUSSION
The most recent amendments to the drug and alcohol policy represent regulatory amendments to include
but not limited to updates to positions that are deemed “safety-sensitive” under FTA regulations, the
inclusion of unambiguous language that conforms with the Drug Free Workplace Act (DFWA) of 1988,
synchronized “removal from service language” aligned to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
Policy, and simplification and updates to DOT testing procedures.
Additionally, the Parties (RTD and ATU 1001) negotiated amendments impacting the working conditions
of represented staff to include, but not limited to implementing progressive discipline for not reporting
medication use when required by law, inclusion of “instant testing” to testing procedures, and
enhancement of employee accommodation language concerning “end of shift testing.”

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no negative fiscal impact associated with this action. However, the implementation of instant
testing is projected to save $70K annually. Further, as recipients of Section 5307, 5309, 5311, or 5339
funds, non-compliance with the DOT and FTA regulations may impact RTD’s ability to receive federal
funds.

1.0 General Policy Statement
The Regional Transportation District is dedicated to providing safe, dependable, and
economical transportation services to the public, and to providing a healthy, safe and
satisfying work environment for our employees. RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union,
Local 1001, agree that employees of the system must be able to work in a drug and
alcohol-free work environment. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect
the rights and respect the privacy of all employees. The employer has the right and duty
to protect its employees, passengers and the public from the adverse effects of drug and
alcohol abuse. It is not the intent of the employer to restrict the employees' off-the-job
conduct.
A successful drug and alcohol program must address the safety implications of drug and
alcohol abuse and must also institute proper procedures and controls guaranteeing accurate
alcohol and drug testing results, while preserving confidentiality and focusing on
rehabilitation through an effective Employee Assistance Program (EAP).
Even though some substances for which RTD tests are legal, their use may have
significant safety impacts. Therefore, it is the responsibility of all employees to report to
work free of alcohol and controlled substances. At the same time, every effort must be
made to protect and respect employees' rights and privacy.
To meet these goals and comply with legal requirements, RTD has implemented this policy
to (1) detect drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through testing; (2) encourage
employees to obtain treatment and rehabilitation for drug and alcohol problems; (3)
deter drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through education, training, and
discipline; and (4) enforce RTD's goal of a drug and alcohol-free work environment through
appropriate discipline.
Drug and alcohol abuse can have profound effects on the health, work, and personal life
not only of the abuser but also the abuser's family, friends, and the public at large.
Employees should be aware of the signs and symptoms of drug or alcohol problems, and
of available methods of intervening when a substance abuse problem is suspected.
Appendix A to this policy contains additional discussion of these matters.
This policy was originally adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on October 18, 1994, and
subsequent major modifications were adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on September
1998, July 2000, May 2003, July 2011, and March 2013. Many elements of this policy are
FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA policy that govern
those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such cases, the FRA policy shall control.

required by federal regulations covering persons in safety-sensitive job classifications. Other
elements of this policy are not required by federal regulations but are official RTD policy.
Appendix B to this policy explains which elements of this policy are not federally required.
Employees wishing to review federal regulations on drug and alcohol use may contact RTD's
Drug and Alcohol Program Manager (DAPM).
This policy supersedes all other RTD drug, alcohol, or substance abuse policies. To the
extent that any elements of this policy may conflict with federal or state regulations as
they may be amended or revised in the future, the regulations shall control. Employees
are expected to review, be familiar with, and obey this policy and all laws concerning drug
and alcohol use and testing. All existing and new RTD employees must receive at least 60
minutes of training on the effects and consequences of prohibited drug use on personal
health, safety, the work environment, and the signs and symptoms which may indicate
prohibited drug use.
Compliance with this policy, including participation in RTD's drug and alcohol testing
program, is a required condition of employment.

2.0 Applicability
2. 1 Categories of Employees
This policy applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive RTD employees,
volunteers, and contractors. For ease of reference, all of the above persons are
referred to in this policy as "employees" unless otherwise noted. This policy applies
to all employees while on the property of RTD to perform RTD duty or while
performing any RTD-related business. Visitors and vendors are expected to adhere
to this policy while on RTD property. Non-compliance with this policy may result in
immediate and permanent removal from RTD premises.
In addition to being subject to all other elements of this policy, employees who
perform "safety- sensitive functions" for RTD, as that term is defined in federal
regulations 49 CFR Parts 40 as amended and Part 655, are subject to random drug
and alcohol testing and other special requirements set forth in this policy. Generally,
a safety-sensitive function occurs when an employee is performing, ready to perform
or immediately available to perform any duty related to the safe operation of public
transportation.
FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA policy that govern
those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such cases, the FRA policy shall control.

The following are safety-sensitive functions:
1.

Operation of a revenue service vehicle, whether or not such vehicle
is in revenue service.

2.

Controlling dispatch or movement of a revenue service vehicle.

3.

Maintaining revenue service vehicles or equipment used in revenue service.

4.

Operating a non-revenue service vehicle when required to be
operated by a holder of a CDL.

5.

Carrying a firearm for security purposes.

6.

Supervising, where the supervisor actually performs any function
listed in items 1-5 above.

RTD reviews the actual duties performed by employees in all job classifications to
determine which employees perform safety-sensitive functions, and determines
which job functions may require the performance of safety-sensitive duties. An
analysis will be performed if any new job classifications are developed, or current job
description changes, to determine if the job should be considered safety-sensitive
by querying the policy.
During that process, Manager, Total Rewards engages with the DAPM to determine
if the positions will fall in one of the safety-sensitive categories, and quarterly audit
of new and changed positions will be conducted to confirm safety-sensitive category
assignments.

FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA policy that govern
those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such cases, the FRA policy shall control.

2.2 Categories of Prohibited Substances
This policy applies to controlled substances (see section 2.2.1
of this policy); legal drugs or medications which may impair
mental functioning, motor skills or judgment (section 2.2.2);
and alcohol (section 2.2.4). For ease of reference, these
substances are collectively referred to in this policy as
"prohibited substances" unless otherwise noted.
2.2.1 Controlled Substances
Controlled substances are any drug or other substance
identified in Schedules I through V of the federal Controlled
Substance Act (21 USC section 801 et seq.), federal
regulations at 21 CFR sections 1300.11 through 1300.15, and
the Colorado Controlled Substance Act (CRS section 12-22301), all as amended. Controlled substances include, but are
not necessarily limited to: marijuana, cocaine, opioids,
amphetamines, and PCP (phencyclidine).
2.2.2 Legal Drugs or Medications
The appropriate use of legally prescribed drugs or over-thecounter medications are not prohibited. However, the use of
any legally prescribed drug or medication which carries a
warning label that indicates that mental functions, motor skills,
or judgment may be adversely affected must be discussed by
employees with their appropriate health care professional
before performing work-related duties. Employees are urged
to seek and obtain medical confirmation prior to using
prescription or over the counter drugs to assure that such
consumption will not adversely affect their ability to safely
perform essential job functions. Appendix C contains
guidelines for use of prescribed drugs and over-the-counter
medications and a partial list of some over-the-counter
medications that may affect your ability to drive.
FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA
policy that govern those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such

1.E.2.a

A legally prescribed drug is one for which the employee has a
prescription or other written authorization from a licensed
health care provider permitted by law to prescribe or dispense
drugs or medications. The authorization must include the
employee's name, the name of the substance, the amount to
be taken, and the period of authorization. Not reporting
medications use to the medical provider when required by the
law may lead to discipline.
2.2.3 Medical and Recreational Marijuana
Colorado law on the use of medical and recreational marijuana
does not amend, exempt, or supersede RTD's Drug and
Alcohol Policy. The Department of Transportation's Drug and
Alcohol Testing Regulation 49CFR Part 40, section 40.151
(e) does not authorize verification of a test based on
information that a physician recommended that the employee
use a drug listed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances
Act (e.g., under a state law that purports to authorize such
recommendations, such as the medical marijuana" laws that
some states have adopted). The MRO will not verify a drug
test as negative based upon learning that the employee used
"medical or recreational marijuana" when states have passed
"medical or recreational marijuana" initiatives.
2.2.4 Alcohol
Alcohol is a colorless, volatile liquid that is the intoxicating agent in
fermented and distilled beverages. It also includes ethyl-alcohol or
other low molecular weight alcohols including methyl or isopropyl
alcohol. Alcohol can be found in certain medications, candy, energy
drinks, as well as in alcoholic beverages.
2.3 Hours of Compliance
Testing is conducted on all days and hours throughout the year.
Employees are subject to this policy while on RTD duty, while on the
property of RTD to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD vehicles, and
FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA
policy that govern those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such

when the break ends. Employees are subject to this policy on regularly
scheduled days, and when volunteering for or assigned to extra work on
days off, holidays, etc. Safety-sensitive employees are also subject to this
policy at additional times set forth in section 3.4 of this policy.
3.0

Prohibited Conduct; Discipline

Discipline under this policy is independent of discipline for violation of any
other performance code or work rules. For example, an employee who
causes an accident and tests positive for alcohol use may receive
separate, consecutive penalties for both the accident and the positive
test.
In addition to any disciplinary action taken under this policy, law
enforcement authorities may be notified where criminal activity is
suspected in connection with any of the following prohibited conduct.
3.1

Possession/Use of Prohibited Substances at RTD

Any employee found to manufacture, distribute, dispense, sell, possess,
or use prohibited substances while on RTD duty, while on the property of
RTD to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD vehicles, and on lunch or
other breaks if the employee is scheduled to return to work when the
break ends, may be subject to discipline up to and including termination
of employment. All employees are required to notify RTD of any criminal
drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace within
five days after such conviction.
3.2

Intoxication/Under Influence

Any employee reasonably suspected of being intoxicated by, impaired by,
or under the influence of a prohibited substance, or of being not fit for
duty due to use of a prohibited substance, while on RTD duty, while on
the property of RTD to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD vehicles,
and on lunch or other breaks if the employee is scheduled to return to
work when the break ends, may be immediately suspended from job
duties pending an investigation and verification of their condition. Any
employee found to be intoxicated by, impaired by, or under the influence
of a prohibited substance, or not fit for duty due to use of a prohibited

Positive Drug, or Alcohol Tests at 0.04 or above

Positive drug or alcohol tests may be subject to discipline up to and
including termination of employment as set forth in this policy. In
addition, sections 5.3 and 5.4 of this policy specify an employment
assessment and return-to-duty requirements following a verified positive
test (i.e., a positive confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol
concentration of 0.04 or greater).
Any time that an employee loses while removed from service pending
report of a confirmatory test (or for safety-sensitive employees, while
removed from service under section 5.1 of this policy) will be counted
towards disciplinary suspension time.
3.3.1 Alcohol Test of 0.02 but Less than 0.04
Federal law requires RTD to remove a safety-sensitive employee
from service as provided in section 5.1 of this policy if a
confirmatory breath alcohol test indicates an alcohol concentration
of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04. To deter such conduct, a
safety-sensitive employee with a confirmatory breath alcohol test
of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 may receive the following
discipline:
1.

First violation: Removal from service for no less than
eight hours; warning letter; and recommendation that
the employee seek assistance from the Employee
Assistance Program ("EAP").
For a first violation when the employee has already
been subject to the return-to-duty requirements of

Any employee with a "verified positive" drug or alcohol test, as that
term is defined in section 3.3 of this policy (i.e., a positive
confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or
greater), may receive the following discipline:
1.

First violation: 20-working-day unpaid suspension to
termination, depending on circumstances. If discipline
is other than termination of employment, the employee
must also undergo an employment assessment and

3.5 Noncompliance with Testing Requirements
Any employee who refuses to comply with an RTD request for drug or
alcohol testing, provides false information in connection with a drug or
alcohol test, or attempts to falsify drug or alcohol test results through
tampering, contamination, adulteration, or substitution of a test sample,
may be treated as if the employee had received a "verified positive" drug
test result (i.e., a positive confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol
concentration of 0.04 or greater), will be removed from service
immediately, and may be subject to discipline up to and including
termination of employment. In addition, noncompliance with testing
requirements may constitute a refusal to test for purposes of section
5.1 of this policy (removal of safety-sensitive employees from service).
"Refusal to comply" includes:
• Failure to appear for any test (except pre-employment test)
within a reasonable time as determined by RTD
• Failure to remain at the testing site until the testing process
is completed, except a pre-employment test
• Failure to attempt to provide a sufficient amount of urine,
breath or saliva specimen as required by FTA or DOT
regulations
• In the case of a directly observed or monitored collection in
a drug test, failure to permit the observation or monitoring
of your provision of a specimen
• Failure to provide a sufficient amount of urine or breath when
directed, and it has been determined, through a required
medical evaluation, that there was no adequate medical
explanation for the failure
• Failure or decline to take an additional drug test RTD or the
collector has directed you to take
•

Failure to undergo a medical evaluation, as directed by the
MRO as part of the verification process, or as directed by the
Designated Employer Representative (DER)

Failure to cooperate with any part of the testing process
For an observed collection, fail to follow the observer's
instructions to raise your clothing above the waist, lower
clothing and underpants, and turn around to permit the
observer to determine if you have any type of prosthetic or
other device that could be used to interfere with the
collection process

• Possess or wear a prosthetic or other device that could be
used to interfere with the collection process
• Providing a specimen that is verified as adulterated or substituted
• Admit to the collector or MRO that you adulterated or
substituted the specimen
For pre-employment only, failure to appear, aborting the collection before
the test commences, or failure to remain at the site prior to
commencement of test is NOT a test refusal.
A refusal to test constitutes violation of this policy and will be treated the
same as a positive test result. Refusal to test under RTD authority will
not be considered as a refusal to take a DOT-required test, however it
may carry similar consequences.
3.6

Criminal Convictions

Any employee who is convicted of a felony involving off-site purchase,
sale or distribution of a controlled substance, or who fails to immediately
notify their supervisor of any such conviction, may be subject to discipline
up to and including termination of employment.
3. 7 Noncompliance with Treatment Requirements
Under certain circumstances, federal law requires RTD to impose and
monitor treatment of RTD employees for substance abuse, and to set
aftercare and return-to- duty requirements (see sections 5.3 and 5.4 of
this policy). RTD may require employees to submit to a treatment as a
condition of employment when there is an actual knowledge or admission
of drug use or alcohol misuse. Any employee who refuses or fails to

Drug and Alcohol Testing
Test Procedures

Employees may be required to submit to urine drug testing and/or breath
alcohol testing under circumstances set forth in this policy. Testing shall
be conducted in a manner to protect the rights of the employee, assure
the integrity of the drug and alcohol testing process, safeguard the
validity of the test results, and ensure that test results are attributed to
the correct employee. For split specimen collections, Collectors will use
techniques and equipment consistent with federal regulations and RTD
will contract laboratory facilities that have been approved by the federal
government. All federally mandated testing will be conducted consistent
with federal requirements of 49 CFR Parts 40, as amended, and Part 655.
The Union and RTD will cooperate to allow the Union reasonable
opportunity to review the Drug and Alcohol program subject to limits of
confidentiality. Such review may include, but is not limited to, credentials
of the MRO, Substance Abuse Professionals, Breath Alcohol Technicians,
Urine/Saliva Collectors, and testing laboratories.
FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA

The Union shall receive, when reasonably requested and subject to
confidentiality, information including, but not limited to, drug test
results, chain of custody forms, the random selection process, and
collection site procedures. RTD and the Union may jointly review literature
and research on alcohol and drug testing technology and procedures,
suggested changes and improvements to the program, and employee
education and training programs.
RTD will strictly adhere to all standards of confidentiality. Testing records
and results will be released only to those authorized by federal
regulations to receive such information. RTD will strive to protect
employees' rights to dignity, privacy, and confidentiality throughout the
testing process.
4.1.1

Drug Testing Procedures

RTD will designate a MRO to receive drug test results and
determine whether there is a legitimate medical explanation for
confirmed positive, adulterated, substituted, and invalid drug tests
results from the laboratory, or by an employee's medical condition.
The MRO will then report all test results to the RTD via electronic
file. The MRO shall be a licensed physician (Doctor of Medicine or
osteopathy) with knowledge of drug abuse disorders. In carrying
out their responsibilities, the MRO shall examine alternate medical
explanations for any positive test result. This action may include
conducting a medical interview and review of the individual's
medical history, or review of any other relevant biomedical factors.
The MRO shall review all medical records made available by the
tested individual when a confirmed positive test could have
resulted from legally prescribed medication. The MRO shall not,
however, consider the results of federally mandated urine samples
that are not obtained or processed in accordance with 49 CFR Part
40, as amended.
Pursuant to federal regulations, drugs to be tested for are
marijuana, cocaine, opioids, amphetamines, and phencyclidine
(PCP). (RTD reserves the right, not based on federal regulations,
to test for additional drugs including barbiturates, benzodiazepines

Quaalude), and nonamphetamine stimulants, by separate urine
specimen if there is reasonable suspicion of such drug use (see
section 4.2.2 of this policy).
An initial drug screen will be conducted on each urine specimen at
a laboratory certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (DHHS). For specimens that are not negative (at or above
initial cutoff concentration, as established by 49CFR Part 40, as
amended), a second, confirmatory, test will be performed using
currently approved method by Department of Health and Human
Services and consistent with Part 40. The second test will be
considered a "verified positive" test under this policy if the amounts
present in the confirming test are at or above the minimum
thresholds established by federal regulations 49 CFR Part 40, as
amended, and the MRO determines that the positive result was
caused by the unauthorized use of controlled substances.
Before verifying that an employee has a positive test result, the
MRO is responsible for contacting any such employee, on a direct
and confidential basis, to determine whether the employee wishes
to discuss the test or present a legitimate explanation for the
positive result. MRO staff may make the initial contact for the MRO
in order to schedule a discussion between the MRO and the
employee, as well as, explain the consequences if an employee
declines to speak with the MRO. If, after reasonable efforts, the
MRO is unable to reach the employee directly, the MRO may
contact RTD's Designated Employer Representative (DER) for
assistance in contacting the employee. RTD's DER will take
maximum precautions to preserve the confidentiality of the MRO
contact.
If, after making all diligent and reasonable efforts, neither the MRO
nor RTD's DER are able to contact the employee within ten (10)
days of the date the MRO received the confirmed positive test result
from the laboratory, the MRO may verify the test result as positive.

within time limits set forth in Part 40 if the employee presents
documentation of serious injury or illness or other circumstances
that unavoidably prevented the employee from being contacted
within the designated time period, and if the employee then
presents a legitimate (in the MRO's opinion) explanation for the
positive test, the MRO shall declare the test to be negative.
The MRO shall notify each employee who has a confirmed positive
test that the employee has 72 hours in which to request a test of a
split specimen provided at the same time as the original sample. If
the employee requests an analysis of the split specimen within 72
hours of having been informed of a verified positive test, the MRO

to another DHHS-certified testing laboratory for analysis. All costs
for such testing shall be paid by the employee (by payroll
deduction if necessary) unless the additional test invalidates the

Alcohol Testing Procedures

Alcohol testing will be performed by a qualified Breath Alcohol
Technician (BAT) or Screening Test Technician (STT).
The BAT or STT must receive qualification training meeting the
requirements in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. If the initial test
indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a second,
confirmatory, test will be performed. If the confirmatory test
indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater, the

Categories of Tests
4.2.1

Pre-Employment Drug Testing

All applicants for employment will be tested for drug use prior to
employment in any position at RTD, and prior to transfer from a
non-safety-sensitive position into a safety-sensitive position.
Receipt by RTD of a verified negative drug result is required prior
to employment or transfer. A verified positive test (i.e., a positive
confirmatory test for drug use) will disqualify an applicant from
again applying for employment or transfer for 24 months from date
of collection; in addition, the applicant will receive a Substance
Abuse Professional (SAP) referral letter and must provide evidence
from the SAP as proof of having successfully completed a referral,
evaluation, and treatment plan prior to further consideration of any

Safety-sensitive employees who have been off duty for 90 days or
more for any reason, and have been out of the random pool, must
successfully pass a pre-employment drug test prior to the
performance of a safety-sensitive function.
4.2.2

Reasonable Suspicion Testing

An employee will be tested where there is reasonable
suspicion that the employee has engaged in drug or alcohol
use. Reasonable suspicion alcohol testing for safety-sensitive
employees shall be performed just before, during and just
following the performance of a safety-sensitive function. To
come under reasonable suspicion, the employee must be
observed by a supervisor trained in the detection of drug or
alcohol misuse. Supervisors who make reasonable suspicion
determinations of drug use shall receive at least 60 minutes
of training on the physical, behavioral, and performance
indicators of probable drug use. Supervisors designated to
determine whether reasonable suspicion exists for alcohol
testing shall receive at least 60 minutes of training on the
physical, behavioral, speech and performance indicators of
probable alcohol misuse.
Reasonable suspicion testing under Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) authority is required when one trained
supervisor can articulate and substantiate physical,
behavioral and performance indicators of probable drug use
or alcohol misuse by observing the appearance, behavior,
speech, or body odors of the employee, or physical signs and
symptoms consistent with use of prohibited substances.
Otherwise, examples of conditions which may result in
reasonable- suspicion evaluation or immediate testing under
RTD authority include, but are not limited to, the following:

Post-Accident Testing

In case of an accident involving any RTD vehicle (regardless of
whether or not the vehicle is in revenue service) that results in a
death, tests will be conducted on all employees on duty in the RTD
vehicle and on any other employee whose performance could have
contributed to the accident.
In case of a non-fatal accident in which an individual sustains
injuries requiring immediate treatment at a medical treatment
facility, the RTD vehicle is a bus, van or automobile and one or
more vehicles incur disabling damage that requires towing from
the site, or the RTD vehicle is a vehicle operating on rails and is
removed from revenue service, tests will be conducted on all
employees on duty in the RTD vehicle (unless the employee's
behavior can be completely discounted as a contributing factor
to the accident) and on any other employee whose performance
could have contributed to the accident.

The above post-accident testing procedures are separate from
reasonable- suspicion testing conducted under section 4.2.2 of
this policy.
Post-accident testing will be done as soon as possible, and no later
than eight hours after the accident for alcohol testing and 32 hours
after the accident for drug testing. An employee involved in an
accident must not use alcohol until after the employee undergoes
alcohol testing or eight hours have elapsed, whichever comes first.
Every effort will be made to conduct alcohol testing within two
hours after the accident. In the event the alcohol test is delayed
beyond two hours, RTD will prepare and maintain a record stating
the reason(s) for the delay. If an alcohol test is not administered
within eight hours following the accident, all attempts to administer
the test must cease and RTD must update the record.
Nothing in this policy shall be construed to require the delay of
necessary medical attention for the injured following an accident
or to prohibit an employee from leaving the scene of an accident
for the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the
accident or to obtain necessary emergency medical care.
However, any employee who under the above circumstances
fails to remain readily available for drug and alcohol testing
(including notifying RTD of their location), or who otherwise leaves
the scene of an accident without appropriate authorization prior to
submission to drug and alcohol testing, will be considered to have
refused the test. Under section 3.5 of this policy, leaving the
scene of an accident without valid reason is a serious violation
subject to discipline up to and including termination of
employment.
4.2.4

Return-to-Duty Testing

As part of the employment assessment and return-to-duty
requirements set forth in sections 5.3 and 5.4 of this policy, any
employee with a verified positive drug or alcohol test (i.e., a
positive confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol concentration of
0.04 or greater) must test negative for drugs and/or alcohol before
FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA

and alcohol testing after returning to work.
4.2.5

Random Testing

Employees in safety-sensitive positions will be subjected to
unannounced random drug and alcohol testing in accordance
with FTA regulation 655.45. Random selections shall be a
sufficient number of covered employees for testing during each
calendar year to equal an annual rate not less than the
minimum annual percentage rate of 10% of the safety-sensitive
workforce for alcohol and 50% for drugs or at the rates set forth
by the FTA in Part 655, as amended. This rate is subject to
annual review, as provided in 49CFR Part 655.45(b). Each such
employee shall be in a pool from which random selection is made.
Each such employee shall have an equal chance at selection and
shall remain in the pool even after being tested. The basis for
random selection shall be by a scientifically valid random
number generation method initiated by computer. To ensure
that employees have a reasonable expectation that they might
be called for a test on any day they are at work, the dates for
random testing shall be spread reasonably throughout the
calendar year. Random tests are unannounced and immediate.
Employees are required to proceed to the test site immediately
upon notification. Random testing may also be conducted
pursuant to other sections of this policy. A safety-sensitive
employee shall only be randomly tested for alcohol misuse just
before, during and just following the performance of a safetysensitive function. In addition, RTD Executive Leadership will be
expected to participate in random testing (testing of nonsafety-sensitive Executive Leadership is based on RTD's
independent authority and not federal regulations).
If an employee has a verifiable obligation for childcare, elder care,
or similar reasons, that will prevent them from remaining on-site
for an extended period of time at the end of their shift, written
request to the manager needs to be submitted in advance. The
FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA
policy that govern those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such
cases, the FRA policy shall control.

manager will forward such requests to the HR DOT Compliance
Unit who will ensure that drug testing commences at least three
hours prior to the end of the shift to accommodate the employee’s
obligations. Any such request will need to be re-evaluated at least
annually.
4.3

Employee Status Pending Test Results
Employees who are tested for reasonable suspicion or postaccident testing will be immediately removed from service and will
not be allowed to return to work until test results are reported.
If a negative test result is reported, the employee will be notified
immediately, returned to work, and compensated for the period of
absence from work.
As a general rule, when an employee is sent for any other type of
test, the employee will not be removed from service pending
receipt of test results.

Consequences of Positive Tests
5.1

Special Consequences for Safety-Sensitive Employees

A safety-sensitive employee with a confirmatory alcohol test result of
0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04, shall be immediately removed from
service for a minimum of eight hours following the confirmatory test. A
safety- sensitive employee with a verified positive test (i.e., a positive
confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or
greater) shall be immediately removed from service until after an
employment assessment and release to return to duty by a Substance
Abuse Professional ("SAP") under section 5.3 of this policy.

Discipline

Discipline for a positive drug or alcohol test is set forth in paragraph 3.3

Employment Assessment

5.3

Any employee with a verified positive test (i.e., a positive confirmatory
test for drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater) will be
immediately removed from duty and must be promptly assessed by a
Substance Abuse Professional (SAP). An SAP is either (1) a licensed
physician, or a licensed or certified psychologist, social worker, or
employee assistance professional with knowledge of and clinical
experience in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-and drug-related
disorders; or (2) an addiction counselor certified by the National
Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors Certification
Commission. The SAP will evaluate each employee to determine what
assistance the employee needs in resolving problems associated with
prohibited substance abuse or misuse.
Assessment by an SAP does not exempt an employee from discipline
and does not guarantee continued employment or reinstatement. The
cost of any treatment or rehabilitation services will be paid by the
employee or the employee's own insurance provider.
After the SAP determines that the employee has successfully complied
with prescribed education and/or treatment, the employee must
promptly follow the rehabilitation program prescribed by the SAP,
must pass a directly observed return- to-duty drug and/or alcohol test
(non-observed return-to-duty for positive/refusal results that were
collected under RTD authority), and must fulfill the return-to-duty
requirements of section 5.4 of this policy.
Return to Duty Requirements

5.4

Employees who re-enter the workforce following (1) completion of a
disciplinary suspension for a DOT verified positive drug or alcohol test
at or above 0.04 level, (2) a favorable employment assessment which
includes a medical exam for safety-sensitive employees, and (3)
successful return-to-duty testing, shall be subject to the following
requirements:
•

Unannounced observed follow-up drug and alcohol testing for one
to five years (1-5) depending on the circumstances of the case

must pass a minimum of six (6) follow-up tests within the first
twelve (12) months back in safety-sensitive duties.
•

An agreement to follow specified after-care requirements
recommended by the SAP, with the cost of such requirements
to be borne by the employee or the employee's own insurance
provider.

•

Compliance with all recommendations of the SAP, and release to
RTD from each treatment provider of records of attendance,
recommendations, and compliance.

An employee's violation of the above requirements may be grounds for
termination of employment under section 3. 7 of this policy.
Non-DOT violations if not resulting in termination of employment, will
have a similar return-to-work process as described in sections 5.4 and
6.0. All testing will be done under RTD authority.

Employees Who Seek Assistance Prior to Violations
Employees are strongly encouraged to seek assistance to overcome
alcohol or drug dependency problems before accidents or violations of
this policy occur. RTD is strongly committed to working in a positive
manner with such employees.
Employees who seek assistance with alcohol or drug dependency prior
to violation of this policy will be referred to the substance abuse
counselor who has the qualifications of a Substance Abuse Professional
(SAP) for appropriate treatment and/or rehabilitation program.
Employees will not be subject to discipline for their participation in such
programs. Employees participating in or completing a treatment or
rehabilitation program will continue to be required to comply with RTD
performance standards, policies, and rules and regulations, including but
not limited to this policy, and may be subject to discipline if these are
violated.
If determined necessary by RTD-approved medical professionals, medical
leaves of absence may be arranged to allow for proper treatment of
employees who seek assistance with alcohol or drug dependency, and

Regional Transportation District
Drug and Alcohol Policy

Materials on Drug and Alcohol Abuse
The attached materials contain discussion of the effects of drug and alcohol
abuse on the health, work, and personal life not only of the abuser but also
the abuser's family, friends, and the public at large. The materials also
discuss the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol problems, and possible
methods of intervening.
NOTE: RTD provides its employees a confidential Employee Assistance
Program (EAP) which provides employees and their immediate families a
broad range of confidential counseling and referral services for personal
and job-related problems, including drug or alcohol abuse. The program
is available t w e n t y - f o u r ( 2 4 ) hours a day, seven (7) days a week.
The EAP provides up to eight (8) sessions of counseling for a problem
and, if warranted, refers the employee or family member to another
agency or helping facility. The employee is responsible for charges after
a referral is made; however, the EAP can often find an agency whose
services are free or covered by insurance. Sick leave may be used to visit
EAP counselors during regular business hours.

Drugs and Alcohol: Effects, Signs, and Solutions
One of every ten U.S. workers abuses alcohol or drugs. In fact, some
studies conclude that up to 20-25 percent of the nation's workforce may
be abusing alcohol or drugs. Experts estimate that there are 10 million
alcoholics in this country, 6 million current cocaine abusers, 16 to 20
million people who frequently use marijuana, and several million persons
who abuse prescription drugs.
Drugs and alcohol affect their users' judgment, performance, and safetyawareness, which in turn directly affects the safety and well-being of the
users' families, all other employees, and the public at large.
Effects of Drug and Alcohol Abuse
Drug and alcohol abuse affect a person physically and mentally. These effects
occur not only during actual intoxication (which can last from almost
immediately in the case of alcohol, to one to twenty-four (1-24) hours after
intake for other drugs), but also during residual hangovers, fatigue rebounds,
and longer periods of mental impairment. Physical and mental effects may
include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Slow reactions
Poor coordination
Fatigue
Delayed decision-making
Poor or erratic judgment
Confusion
Learning difficulties
Poor memory
Loss of concentration
Depression or anxiety
Difficulty in sorting out priority tasks
Neurotic or psychotic behavior
Refusal to accept authority

Drugs and alcohol can also lead to many serious physical problems. For
example, cocaine use - even in small amounts, or by first-time users -- has
been linked with heart attacks.
Amphetamine abuse can lead to strokes. Alcoholism can cause fatal
cirrhosis of the liver. Use of heroin and other intravenously injected drugs
expose the user to transmission of infectious diseases.
Some persons wrongly believe that marijuana is relatively "safe." However,
in addition to marijuana's links to many of the above physical and mental
disturbances, research indicates that marijuana is a "gateway" drug
leading to further drug use. Almost s i x t y ( 60) percent of marijuana
users will go on to use other drugs.
RTD's mission to provide safe and efficient public transportation is directly
threatened by employees' drug and alcohol abuse. For example, each year
approximately two million motor vehicle collisions occur that involve
drinking and driving, injuring 700,000 persons and killing 25,000 persons.
One of every two Americans will be involved in an alcohol- related traffic
accident in their lifetime.
Signs of Drug and Alcohol Abuse
The first signs of drug or alcohol abuse may be hard to distinguish from
signs of other problems such as job stress, overwork, fatigue, or emotional
problems. To make recognition even more difficult, drug- and alcoholabusing employees often develop survival skills to avoid detection.
Supervisors and co-workers need to be aware of the following general
signs of drug and alcohol abuse:
•

Absenteeism or tardiness: Employees with substance abuse
problems may be absent an average of two to three times more than
the normal employee. They may exhibit a pattern of absences on
certain days, such as Mondays and Fridays.

•

Staff turnover: Chemically dependent people have disorganized
lives. Many quit rather than face detection; others transfer or are
fired for poor or unsafe performance.

FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA
policy that govern those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such

•

Equipment breakdown: Substance-abusing employees often
lose interest in maintenance of equipment and may use broken
equipment to avoid work.

•

Erratic performance; poor work quality: Mental and physical
agility and concentration deteriorate with substance abuse. The
abuser may miss deadlines, have poor concentration, work in bursts
of energy, and overlook important details. The person becomes
unreliable.

•

Poor morale: Substance abuse creates wide mood swings, anxiety
depression, and anger. Co-workers often see substance abusers as
poor "team workers" and safety hazards. Abusers often blame work
problems on someone or something else.

•

Increased accidents and "near-misses": Impaired employees are
3.6 times more likely to cause an accident. Even small quantities of
drugs or alcohol in the system can cause deterioration of alertness,
clear-mindedness, and reaction speed. For example, studies show
that a person's driving ability substantially decreases at a blood
alcohol content level of .04%. This is the equivalent of
approximately two (2) beers or one (1) martini consumed in one (1)
hour.

•

Theft: Drugs are expensive, and drug users need money to support
their habits. As substance abusers' value systems and judgment are
affected by drugs, their loyalty and dedication to their co-workers and
employers is weakened.

The following signs may also indicate involvement of drugs or alcohol in a
person's problems:
• Sudden changes, usually for the worse, in attitude, work performance, or
behavior
• A lackadaisical, "I don't care" attitude
• Deteriorating or erratic performance
• Hangover symptoms
• Drug-culture jargon
• Secretive behavior

• Impulsive and temperamental behavior
• Changes in personal appearance or hygiene
• Jitters, hand tremors, hyperexcitability
• Carelessness
• Sleeping on the job
• Sudden weight loss
• Chronic cough or runny nose
• Sores around the nose, or marks on the arms

Note that each symptom, by itself, may point to problems other than
drug or alcohol abuse. However, when a pattern begins to develop, a
supervisor, manager, co-worker or family member needs to be alert and act
quickly. Fueled by drug or alcohol abuse, these behaviors can quickly lead
to accidents, productivity problems, higher operating costs, greater
absenteeism, and worsened service to the public.
Solutions for Drug and Alcohol Abuse
One of the biggest obstacles to overcome in trying to help or reach the drug
or alcohol abuser is denial. To overcome a drug or alcohol dependency, a
person must first and foremost be able and willing to recognize the problem.
However, some abusers, especially cocaine users, erroneously believe that
the drug improves their performance. Others insist that they can "control"
their addictions on their own. Denial must be confronted and overcome
before the abuser can begin to recover.
Supervisors and co-workers endanger the lives and safety of the abuser, and
their family, co-workers and the public, if they try to "cover up" for the
abusing employee or do the employee's work.
Co-workers and supervisors should not allow a suspected substance abuser
to continue working at a lower level and should not let friendship with the
employee or fear of exposing an "embarrassing" problem lead them into
concealing the problem. They should
not share in the abuser's denial by encouraging the abuser to believe that
they do not have a problem.
FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA
policy that govern those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such
cases, the FRA policy shall control.

Co-workers and supervisors should pay attention to the warning signs of
drug and alcohol abuse, talk to the abuser about concerns you have for the
abuser's health or job, and refuse to cover up for or take excuses from the
abuser.
Supervisors should also know how to administer and apply RTD's Drug and
Alcohol Policy and other performance rules and policies.
Successful intervention in the workplace often starts with a frank, firm, but
sensitive discussion with the person, a n d b y focusing on problems with the
person's performance or safety. To deal with the person's likely denials,
problems should be clearly documented so that the person can be shown
clear-cut evidence of what is wrong.
Co-workers and supervisors should encourage a suspected abuser of drugs
or alcohol to seek assistance from RTD's Employee Assistance Program
(EAP). The abuser should be reminded that any help offered through the
EAP program is strictly confidential. Such EAP programs have 70-80 percent
success rates for substance abuse recovery. This is higher than rates for
other programs, because with EAP programs the employee has the
commitment of the company behind them.
A person dependent on drugs or alcohol can also be referred to their
personal health care provider or clergy member, to private alcohol or drug
treatment clinics, or to self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous or
Narcotics Anonymous.
Additional information on drug and alcohol use and abuse can be obtained
from the EAP or RTD's Human Resources Department.

FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA
policy that govern those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such

APPENDIX B
Regional Transportation District
Drug and Alcohol Policy

Non-Federally Required Elements of Policy
Many elements of RTD's Drug and Alcohol Policy are required by federal
regulations covering transit employees in safety-sensitive positions. Other
elements of RTD's policy are not required by federal regulations but are
official RTD policy. Federal regulations require RTD to identify which
provisions of its policy are mandated by the regulations and which are not.
The parts of the Regional Transportation District Drug and Alcohol Policy not
mandated by federal regulations are as follows:
1.

RTD's Policy applies to more than safety-sensitive employees
covered by federal regulations. It applies to all safety-sensitive and
non-safety-sensitive RTD employees, volunteers, and contractors.
Intent of the policy is to apply all provisions equally to all
employees, only changing the applicable authority when
appropriate. Visitors and vendors are also expected to adhere to
the Policy while on RTD property. (See Policy section 2.1.)

2.

RTD's Policy contains hours of compliance beyond those required
by federal regulations. Specifically, employees are subject to the
Policy while on RTD duty, while on the property of RTD to perform
RTD duty, while driving RTD vehicles, on lunch or other breaks if
the employee is scheduled to return to work when the break ends,
on regularly scheduled days, and when volunteering for or
assigned to extra work on days off, holidays, etc. (See Policy
section 2.3.)

3.

Discipline is not addressed in the federal regulations. (See Policy
sections 3.0 and 6.0.)

FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA
policy that govern those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such
cases, the FRA policy shall control.

4.

Possession/use of prohibited substances, criminal convictions,
noncompliance with treatment requirements, improper use of
policy, monetary reimbursement, and prohibited substances on
RTD property are not addressed in the federal regulations. (See
Policy sections 3.1, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 4.1.1, 4.2.2, 5.4, and
6.0)

5.

The RTD-Union agreements for Union review of the Drug and
Alcohol Program, and for joint review, are not addressed in the
federal regulations. (See Policy section 4.1)

6.

RTD has reserved the right, not based on federal regulations, to
conduct reasonable-suspicion testing by separate urine specimen
for additional drugs including barbiturates, benzodiazepines (e.g.,
Valium, Librium, Xanax), nonbarbiturate sedatives (e.g.,
Quaalude,), and nonamphetamine stimulants. (See Policy section
4.1.1).

7.

The following tests for non-safety-sensitive positions are not
addressed in the federal regulations: Pre-employment,
Reasonable Suspicion, Post- Accident, Return-to-Duty, Follow-up
and Executive Leadership Random testing. (See Policy section
4.2.5)

8.

Provisions to encourage employees to voluntarily seek assistance
with alcohol or drug dependency by participating in appropriate
treatment and/or rehabilitation programs are not addressed in the
federal regulations. (See Policy section 6.0)

FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA
policy that govern those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such

APPENDIX C
PRESCRIPTIONS AND OVER THE COUNTER
MEDICATIONS
•

Be Cautious. All medications, prescription (Rx) and over-the-counter
(OTC) medications have the potential to be dangerous. Use medications
cautiously and always in accordance with physician's directions. Do not
perform any safety-sensitive function while impaired by any medication;
however, this caution should not be construed to require any FTA covered
employee to delay or deny any necessary medical treatment.

•

Inform prescribing physician, dentist or other medical professional.
Before accepting any prescriptions, employees should inform their
physicians of their safety-sensitive position and explain their job duties. Do
not assume physicians will remember explanations from one visit to the
next. Employees are encouraged to:
o Remind their physician of any other medications they are taking
including those medications prescribed by other physicians
o Make sure their physician has their complete medical history
o Remember to ask their physician if they will be able to perform their
duties safely while taking prescribed medications
o Seek alternatives should recommended medications be deemed
unsafe

•

Solicit information from you pharmacist. Employees are encouraged to ask
their pharmacist for additional information about an Rx or OTC. A pharmacist
will be very knowledgeable about the medication ingredients, side- effects,
precautions, drug interactions, and effects when combined with other
drugs. Even if after receiving physician advice, employees are encouraged
to obtain more information. Pharmacists may be more knowledgeable and
able to provide additional information and insight. Read warning labels and
side-effects provided on information summaries provided with Rx and
OTC's.

FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA policy
that govern those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such cases, the
FRA policy shall control.

1.E.2.a

•

Do not over-medicate. Always follow the prescription directly as
written. Never increase the dosage or frequency of use without explicit
directions from your doctor. Not only is this practice medically risky, but
increased dose of a medication may cause impairment when the same
medication used as recommended may not.

•

Check the strength of the prescription. Sometimes medicines are
prescribed in different strengths (i.e., 500 vs. 250 MG). Do not take a
pill without first checking the dosage and comparing it to the prescription,
even if the medication has been taken before or this is a refill.

•

Never take someone else's medication. This is illegal, dangerous,
and it may cause impairment.

•

Always monitor your reaction. After taking any medication (Rx or
OTC) watch for any side-effects including drowsiness, dizziness,
confusion, etc. Try to get accustomed to the medication first before
reporting for work. The same applies even if you have taken this
medication in the past with no previous side-effects. An individual's
reactions to a medication may vary with each treatment, the nature of
the illness and other medications taken.

•

Avoid Rx/OTCs that have been problems in the past. If you have
taken medications in the past that have caused negative side-effects,
make a note of the active ingredients and avoid these in the future.
Inform your prescribing physician of your problem with the previous
medications and ask for alternative medications that do not have this
ingredient. For OTCs read the ingredient portion of the label and ask
the pharmacist for assistance.

•

Ask for alternative treatments or dosage schedule. If you notice
side-effects that could pose a safety risk, consult your prescribing
physician (or pharmacist in the case of an OTC) about alternative
treatments, medications, dosages, or schedule of use. You may be able
to avoid the negative side-effects by simply shifting the dosage
schedule to take your medications following your shift rather than
before.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 Operations and Safety Committee Work Plan

January 17, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operating Officer
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
At the Study Session on October 18, 2023, the Board of Directors discussed the idea of annual
committee work plans.
Annual committee work plans are a useful tool for ensuring the Board and staff collaborate effectively to
accomplish the necessary work of the agency and Board, while providing dedicated space for the Board
to pursue governance/policy objectives and gain further insights into matters of interest to Directors.
Work plans elevate and respect the role of the committees of the Board as some of the most effective
forums for completing the work of the Board.
Per the Board’s Bylaws (Article VI, Section 1, e.), the Operations and Safety Committee is “responsible
for all operational matters, including all contracted and non-contracted bus, rail, paratransit, and
microtransit services, as well as safety and security matters.”
DISCUSSION
The Committee is asked to review the attached draft work plan and gain an understanding of the
committee’s workflow based on the items currently listed. Additionally, the Directors should provide
input on items they would like to see included in the work plan that are not already included in the draft
document.
Following the discussion, senior staff will work with the Chair and Vice Chair of the committee to further
refine the work plan. The Committee will then review the work plan for approval at the February 14,
2024 meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the Operations and Safety Committee’s ability to effectively

Packet Pg. 58

1.F.1

govern directly impacts the overall performance of the agency. A solid committee work plan will ensure
RTD’s resources are used efficiently, and that the Board’s policy and governance objectives are more
focused, collaborative, and obtainable.
