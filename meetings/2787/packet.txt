Re:

Oct. 30, 2018 Board Study Session Item: Mobility Choice Blueprint

Over the past few months, RTD has been actively engaged in the multi-agency/private sector
effort entitled Mobility Choice Blueprint (MCB). As a refresher, here are the vision and mission
statements for MCB:
Blueprint Vision: Our metropolitan region employs a full array of flexible technology and
services to maximize access to mobility choices connecting people of all ages, incomes and
abilities to jobs, recreation, healthcare, amenities and other daily activities, enhancing and
protecting our quality of life now and in the future.
Blueprint Mission: The metropolitan agencies will collaborate, in partnership with
community, nonprofit, and private sector leaders, to carefully consider a range of effective
and efficient solutions to the challenges and opportunities presented by emerging mobility
technologies. We will provide recommendations to encourage the most effective technologies
and approaches, maximizing mobility to meet our long-term goals of enhanced quality of life
and increased economic vitality across the metropolitan region.
We have provided MCB updates to the Board at regular intervals, and are now in the final
two-plus months of the project. The diagram below provides a visual summary of the MCB
process. We are currently at the stage labeled "Preliminary & Final Recommendations."

3.1.a

One key component of the overall effort is attached for Board consideration at this Study
Session: the MCB tactical actions. These actions accompany this memo in the form of a multipage document. The proposed actions are the product of consultant research, travel demand
modeling, internal and external thought leader review and comment, extensive community
outreach and engagement, discussion and refinement by the public agency management team
(RTD, CDOT, and DRCOG), and input from the Mobility Choice Board of Directors at their
October 16, 2018 Workshop.
Each tactical action is labeled with either an “F” (for Forward) or “B” (for Bold). The Forward
actions, which would be in contrast to a status quo (i.e. a future with little or no
implementation of these actions) are described as follows: “Moving forward with innovative
program development, interagency coordination, and pilot testing and implementation, the
Denver region adapts to emerging mobility technologies, maintaining community visions and
improving mobility for all.” Bold actions are described as follows: “By taking a chance on bold
programs that work to break down traditional silos, build new partnerships, and prioritize
impactful and innovative applications of emerging technologies, the Denver region begins to
reshape its mobility systems.” In general, the bold actions would be a “heavier lift” and require
more investment compared to the forward actions. Both sets of actions have a common 2030
time horizon.

3.1.a

In addition to a description, each action includes a tactic initiator, additional participants, and
priority tactics (by agency). RTD has identified a number of actions where we could be the
neither of these designations commits RTD to initiating or participating, but rather is a
proposal for Board consideration.
One of the key areas for Board discussion is governance. Tactic F1, Establish a Mobility
Technology Advisory Committee (MTAC), articulates the need for an entity to collaborate with
the private sector to match regional needs with new technology-enabled mobility solutions.
In fact, there are numerous other tactics that could be addressed by this entity, including F5,
F26, B1, B7, B9, and B16. The primary purpose of the entity would be to provide a metro
area point of contact for innovative mobility, address region-level outcomes, leverage publicprivate knowledge, develop open data for mobility, initiate pilot projects, and fill any
institutional gaps. We look forward to Board dialogue on this topic, since the successful
implementation of MCB will depend to a large extent on collaborative CDOT, DRCOG, and RTD
policy decisions.
We have also highlighted a number of other tactical actions for Board discussion. These are
denoted by red text in the title, and include both tactics where RTD is a possible initiator and
tactics that could be an RTD priority. What stand out are a number of tactical actions that
align very well with the General Manager 2019 Tactical Plan, as follows:
Strategic Priority: Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods
Alternative Service Delivery Approaches (Non-Traditional Fixed Route Public Transit)


F10, Partner with private sector to provide mobility options in areas that do not meet
fixed route bus service standards



F9, Pilot driverless microtransit to increase public exposure to AV technology

Establish a Regional Mobility Data Platform that:
* Consolidates multiagency and private provider archived and real time data into a single data
repository with joint access
* Establishes policy standards for data sharing between regional stakeholders for
interoperability and security
* Develops open, machine-readable data publication from instrumented infrastructure
* Creates a policy that will ensure the interoperability of infrastructure and software
* Promotes the development of open, well-documented APIs

* Establish standards for public and private mobility data sharing to ensure interoperability
among regional stakeholders
* Coordinate Pilot Projects conducted throughout the region to avoid duplication of efforts and
share findings
* Provide guidance on best uses of available funding across the agencies for technology Pilot
Projects
* Coordinate agency staff resource sharing for technology related projects
* Create a process to prioritize corridors for technology projects
* Develop partnerships with private sector providers to incentivize private ridesharing
* Identify costs and potential funding associated with retrofitting infrastructure to support and
maintain emerging technologies such as Connected Vehicles, Autonomous Vehicles, and
Sensor Data Collection

TBD

2. Shared Mobility

Establish common regional standards for micromobility services: Establish a working
group to identify common standards and guidelines for Micromobility (bicycle sharing, scooter
sharing, etc.) to address mobility hubs, shared mobility lanes, data sharing, and other issues.

DRCOG

3. Traveler
Information and
Payment

Develop a universal mobility app for trip planning and payment: Implement an accountbased, multipurpose user-friendly mobility app. Combine trip planning, real-time, fare payment
and vehicle arrival times across all mobility options--walking, transit, scooter, parking, etc. to
include all public, quasi-public, and private service transportation operators. Procure a vendor
partner to integrate and market the branded regional app.

Coordinate Transportation System Management and Operations (Traffic Management
Centers) * Provide TMC connectivity from all traffic signals, ITS equipment, cameras, or other
digital infrastructure assets within the Denver Region * Require that future infrastructure
projects include fiber communications connectivity to TMCs * Integrate management,
operations, and communications of TMCs * Implement a region-wide traffic
management/operations system

CDOT

1. Transportation
Systems
Optimization

Pilot integrated corridor management (ICM) on 10 arterial corridors: Fund and implement
an Integrated Corridor Management (ICM) Pilot Project in a key metro corridor including Next
Generation Traffic Signal/Adaptive Control. ICM combines two fundamental concepts: active
management and integration. Active management involves monitoring and assessing the
performance of the system and dynamically implementing actions in response to fluctuations in
demand. Integration requires actively managing assets in a unified way so that actions can be
taken to benefit the corridor as a whole, not just a particular piece of it. Integration occurs
along three dimensions: Institutional, Operational, and Technical.
