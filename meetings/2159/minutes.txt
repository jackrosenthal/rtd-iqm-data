

Assumptions for FasTracks 2012 Annual Program Evaluation
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the scope of the 2012 Annual Program
Evaluation (APE) to include the following assumptions:
Sales and Use Tax
 Successful 0.4% sales and use tax election in November,
2012, with new revenues effective January 1, 2013
 The new sales and use tax will fully sunset
 Debt proceeds secured by the new sales and use tax will be
used ONLY for the remaining, partially-funded projects (as
identified below in Table 1)
 Revenues from the new sales and use tax will be available to
pay for O&M for the remaining, partially-funded projects
 Existing 0.4% sales and use tax would not be able to fund
O&M on the new corridors until after 2035. Absent this
flexibility, this could result in a scenario where there is not
enough funding to operate and maintain the corridors once
they are built
 RTD needs to maintain the ability to manage O&M as a
system, not on a corridor-by-corridor basis
 Revenues from the new sales and use tax will be combined for
debt service coverage purposes
 If revenues cannot be blended for debt service coverage
purposes, RTD cannot issue new bonds in time to complete
the program by 2020 at a 2.00x Additional Bonds Test (ABT)
 Issuing debt at less than 2.00x ABT could result in:
1. Lower credit rating
2. Higher interest rates
3. Reduced pool of potential investors

Summary of the Executive Committee Meeting held on November 17, 2011,
at 12:00 p.m.
Page 7 of 9
4. More risk for completing the program if revenues do not
meet expectations
Scope
 Construction and operation of all of the FasTracks corridors
and projects, including:
Denver Union Station, West Corridor, Central Corridor
Extension, Eagle Project, I225 Corridor, Light Rail Maintenance Facilities, North Metro,
Northwest Rail,
Southeast Corridor Extension, Southwest Corridor Extension
and RTD’s remaining
proportionate share of US 36
 Scope of these corridors and projects consistent with the final
environmental
clearance documents, currently approved designs, signed
contract documents and any minor modifications resulting from
future value engineering efforts
 Current design assumptions will be used to update capital cost
estimates for the remaining corridors
 Establishment of a program-wide contingency is being
considered to ensure funding is available to complete the FasTracks
system on time
 If there is contingency left over after all the corridors are
complete, RTD staff and the RTD Board of Directors will work
with stakeholders to develop a recommendation concerning
the use of any remaining contingency. Options could include:
1. Fulfilling outstanding commitments allowed by the
original FasTracks plan
2. Paying down the existing bonds so that they sales and
use tax can sunset earlier than targeted
Schedule
 Corridor construction phasing consistent with the current
Board adopted 2011 APE,
as approved in the most recent (2010) Annual Report to
DRCOG on FasTracks (See Attachment 1)
 Note: specific completion dates may shift to match updated
cash flow assumptions

Board of Directors to place a sales and use tax increase on the ballot, but it
preserves the RTD Board of Directors’ ability to continue consideration of all
potential scenarios for completion of the FasTracks program.
