BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Subject:

Budget Transfer for I-25 North Express Lanes
Extension and Express Bus Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the transfer of $375,000 from the Drivers Kiosk Replacement Project to fund the 2014 payment for the
IGA for the I-25 North Express Lanes Extension and Express Bus Project. Funding for the 2015 payment
will be provided in the 2015 Recommended Budget.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the 2014 goal of innovative and fiscally sustainable service delivery and the 2015
goal of improving service delivery.
In March 2012, the Board of Directors approved a commitment of $750,000 toward the local match for
CDOT’s I-25 North Express Lanes Extension Project. At the time, CDOT was in the process of
submitting a TIGER IV grant submission to fund this project, and requested that RTD contribute a portion
of the local match if CDOT were to receive the grant. RTD agreed to contribute $750,000 toward the
local match based on future operating cost savings on the bus routes currently operating on I-25
between US 36 and 120th Avenue, which would save travel time by using the express lanes. CDOT
received the TIGER grant in 2012, and the IGA obligating RTD for its contribution to the project is
effective November 22, 2014.
DISCUSSION
The I-25 North Express Lanes Extension Project will make efficient use of the existing highway
pavement by adding one additional express lane in each direction on I-25 between 120th Avenue on the
north to U.S. 36 on the south and would then connect to the existing managed lanes at U.S. 36 going
south into Denver. No additional right-of-way will be needed to implement this project. This project
represents a collaborative effort among CDOT, RTD, the Denver Regional Council of Governments,
several local jurisdictions and associated agencies in developing a cost-effective, near-term solution to
address the congestion on I-25.
The IGA is between RTD and the Colorado High Performance Transportation Enterprise (HPTE), a division
of CDOT. Like the previously signed US 36 IGA, the North I-25 IGA guarantees RTD travel times on the
managed lanes and commits that tolls during the peak hours will not be lower than corresponding RTD
fares.
CDOT started work on this project in October 2013, and expects the project to be completed in October
2015. Once this work is completed, several existing routes along the north I-25 corridor will benefit
from travel time savings by using the new express lanes. These routes include the 40X, 120X and
122X express routes, and the LNX and LSX branches of the regional route L.

Packet Pg. 4

2.B.1

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the 2014 payment would be provided through this budget transfer. Funding for the 2015
payment will be provided in the 2015 Recommended Budget. Once the project is open, RTD would
expect to see operating and maintenance cost savings of between $64,000 and $282,000 per year
depending on the revised schedules and resulting run cutting process.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $375,000 from the Drivers Kiosk Replacement
Project to fund the 2014 payment for the IGA for the I-25 North Express Lanes Extension and
Express Bus Project. Funding for the 2015 payment will be provided in the 2015 Recommended
Budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the transfer of funds. This is not
recommended because the IGA was executed per Board action. RTD would be in default to CDOT if
the transfer were not approved because RTD would not be able to pay the invoice due in 2014.

Board Meeting Date: November 25, 2014

Subject:

Local Government Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Local Government Liaison services with
CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) to exercise the third option year (January 1, 2015 through December 31,
2015) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a cost of $96,000. Funding for this contract is included in
the annual FasTracks budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Local Government Liaison services was issued on October 20, 2011.
Eight responsive proposals were received for evaluation. Three of the teams were interviewed by a
procurement panel, and a recommendation was subsequently referred to the Executive Committee on
December 15, 2011. The Executive Committee unanimously approved the recommendation that CRL
Associates, Inc. be offered a contract which provided for a one-year base price with four (4) one-year
option periods. The referenced extension covers the third option period from January 1, 2015, to
December 31, 2015. CRL will continue to provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the elected officials and
staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and
economic development organizations. This team has a broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns,
as well as an extensive network of relationships with local governments, elected officials, and
stakeholders along the Front Range.
As part of the Local Government Liaison services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and the
Chairman of the Board to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and
county levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular
outreach to the business community and economic development organizations in the Metro area to
develop partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues of concern.
CRL will represent RTD at meetings at the local level of government and provide professional advice,
counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local government activities as they relate to RTD. CRL will also
provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the third option year ($96,000/year) are included in the annual budget for the FasTracks
program.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to exercise the third option year

Packet Pg. 24

3.B.1

(January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a cost of
$96,000.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to enter into
an agreement to exercise the third option year on the contract for the Local Government
Liaison services. A new Request for Proposals could be sent to interested parties, and a new
Local Government Liaison firm could be retained. This action is not recommended because
CRL Associates, Inc. has been very effective in assisting RTD with local government matters
in the past, and this group is very familiar with RTD’s issues and policies.

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

Board Meeting Date: November 25, 2014

Subject:

Federal Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to enter into a new agreement for Federal Liaison Services with
Squire Patton Boggs LLP for a 23-month contract at a cost of $494,500 ($21,500 per month—the same
rate as currently being paid) with three one-year options (option year one at $264,000; option year two
at $270,000; option year three at $276,000). The total amount of $1,304,500 was below staff’s
internal cost estimate, and funding for this contract is included in the annual budgets.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Federal Liaison Services was issued on August 12, 2014. This
solicitation was a Best Value Procurement where technical factors and cost were all considered. Ten
responsive proposals were received, and they were evaluated by a five-member evaluation committee
that recommended Squire Patton Boggs LLP. The recommendation of the evaluation committee was
subsequently referred to the Government Relations Committee on November 11, 2014. The
Government Relations Committee recommended that Squire Patton Boggs LLP be offered a new
contract for a five-year period. Squire Patton Boggs has been RTD’s federal lobbyist since 2000 and
has assisted in RTD’s receiving over $2.5 billion in federal grants and loans. In addition to constant
monitoring of Congressional and Government Relations Branch activities, status reports are issued
and special reports are prepared when required by the Board of Directors or the General Manager.
DISCUSSION
Constant monitoring of federal legislative activities that relate to RTD is required, and RTD’s interests
must be conveyed to appropriate members of Congress, including the Colorado delegation and other
key Congressional committee members. The Squire Patton Boggs team has excellent rapport and
respect from the Colorado delegation and serves as a resource for the delegation staff. When RTD
has a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) in place as it now does (Eagle P3 Project), the annual
appropriations process requires intense attention to committee hearings and to the status of the
Congressional budget process. In addition, RTD is seeking a Full Funding Grant Agreement for the
Southeast Rail Extension, which also entails extensive contacts with the Colorado Congressional
delegation. Significant lobbying efforts will be required to follow the steps to ensure being awarded
the annual appropriations in the current FFGA, as well as procuring the future FFGA.
The MAP-21 Continuing Resolution expires on May 31, 2015, so the federal lobbyists will play a key
role in representing RTD’s needs in the next reauthorization bill. With the build out of FasTracks, the
lobbyists will need to be especially attentive to the federal financing needs for the new corridors, and
they will monitor discussions and advocate for RTD’s best interests regarding new reauthorization
language. When the bill is enacted, Squire Patton Boggs will play a key role in advising RTD as to
the contents of the bill and monitoring the rule-making process.
In addition to helping with Congressional activities, assistance is also necessary with the Executive
Branch of the federal government, including the Department of Transportation (the Federal Transit

Packet Pg. 26

3.B.2

Administration and the Federal Railroad Administration). Squire Patton Boggs will provide guidance
and assistance in applying for and receiving federal funds from the Department of Transportation.
The Denver office of Squire Patton Boggs serves as important advisory role in RTD’s connection to
relevant national personnel and issues. In addition, annually, or as required, meetings with the Board
of Directors are also held.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Government Relations Committee’s Recommended Action to exercise a 23-month
contract at a cost of $494,500 ($21,500 per month—the same rate as currently being paid)
with three one-year options (option year one at $264,000; option year two at $270,000;
option year three at $276,000). The total amount of $1,304,500 was below staff’s internal
cost estimate, and funding for this contract is included in the annual budgets.
2. Continue the contract on a month-to-month basis, if amenable to the current Contractor
(Squire Patton Boggs LLP). This option is not recommended because continuity and stability
in liaison services is an important consideration.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and issue a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for
Federal Liaison Services. This option is not recommended because RTD’s RFP process was
properly utilized for this procurement, and all the proposals have been reviewed and subjected
to the evaluation criteria, resulting in a recommendation from the evaluation committee—
pursuant to RTD’s long-standing procurement procedures.

Approval of Eleventh Year (2015) Contract
Amendment to Jacobs Engineering for
FasTracks
Program
Support
Consulting
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the eleventh year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in the
amount of $17,861,430 for Program Support Services Consulting for FasTracks for the year 2015.
Funds for the award are contained in the 2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital
program in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the 2015 goal of advancing and completing the FasTracks program.
On May 24, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to CarterBurgess (later purchased by Jacobs Engineering) for Program Support Consulting Services at an
initial 2005 Contract amount of $2,360,000, and a Notice to Proceed of July 5, 2005. The RTD
Board has approved subsequent contract amendments that have brought the current Contract Not to-Exceed price up to $150,982,726. The Contract Not-to-Exceed price through the end of 2015
with this contract amendment would be $168,844,156.
The PSC team provides program management support and specialized technical staff support to
augment RTD FasTracks Team staff. Key PSC staff members are co-located with RTD Staff at the
RTD FasTracks offices. The PSC functions as an extension of RTD staff. This approach adds value,
cost-effectively, by allowing RTD to tap the PSC’s specialized resources in planning, environmental,
design, engineering, construction management support, program control, and related disciplines on
an as-needed, often part-time, basis.
Further, as the focus of the FasTracks program has shifted from planning and design to construction,
the staff resources required for support of the program shift similarly. The PSC role has changed,
and will continue to change, to meet the evolving needs of the FasTracks program. This flexibility
allows RTD to retain the core staff required for implementation of the FasTracks program, without
having to continually (and inefficiently) staff up and then staff down in the planning, design, and
construction management disciplines.
Some of the key deliverables and assistance, in process or received, from the Jacobs/PSC team in
2014 included:



Participation in the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) that resulted in the revised financial plan
that was adopted by the Board in May 2014.
Provided key construction management support for the DUS and Eagle Projects.

Supported the design review and coordination with stakeholders for the North Metro Project.
Provided design and construction management support of I-225 LRT Project.
Provided ongoing support in Planning, Engineering, Project Controls and DBE/SBE/WIN support.
Supported the Environmental Assessment, New Starts submittal, and Entry into Engineering
Grant Application for the Southeast Rail Extension.
Supported the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Grant
application for the Central Corridor Extension.
Maintained the programwide project controls functions including cost, schedule, estimating,
change management, and document control.
Supported ROW design, survey, and acquisition of all projects.
Provided contract closeout support for the West Rail Line.

DISCUSSION
The Program Support Services Contract was specified for a term of six years with a six-year option,
to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work tasks. The six year option was approved by
the RTD Board in November 2010.The purpose of the annual re-negotiation of the contract is to
ensure that specific tasks and deliverables respond to the evolving needs of the FasTracks Program.
The PSC serves as an extension of RTD staff. RTD staff provides overall management and control of
the FasTracks program and administration of this contract. The PSC provides key personnel to a
number of tasks. These assignments are based on focusing the PSC effort to:





Areas of specialized expertise or experience.
Part-time assignments.
Shorter duration efforts.
Positions that are difficult for RTD to fill.

Each position in the FasTracks organization is evaluated individually to determine whether that
position falls within the above criteria for using a consultant. In addition, before a consultant is
actually brought into the FasTracks program, an assessment is made as to whether the position is
still needed, and an interview is conducted with the appropriate RTD manager(s).
The major program activities in 2015 include the following:





RTD has established a 7% DBE goal for this Contract. The latest DBE report indicates that the PSC’s
actual cumulative DBE percentage has been 19.46%. For 2015, the PSC has committed to 27.1% DBE
participation, well in excess of the 7% goal. Additionally, while not in their contract, the PSC has
committed to continuing their participation in the WIN program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the PSC contract from 2005 through 2015 would be
$168,844,156 with this amendment. Funds for the 2015 contract award in the amount of
$17,861,430 are included in the 2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in
the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the eighth year
contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in the amount of $17,861,430 for Program Support
Services Consulting for FasTracks for the year 2015. Funds for the award are contained in the
2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where PSC
support would be utilized.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
eighth year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering. Rather, perform all the work in -house
with RTD staff. This is not recommended as RTD does not have the staff to provide a sufficient
level of expertise in a cost-effective approach to manage the FasTracks Program (As described in
the Background section, the PSC team can provide the technical specialties on an as needed
basis).
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Re-solicit this work to another consulting team. This is
not recommended as the PSC is satisfactorily performing its work assignments and providing
valuable technical and project management assistance to the RTD team.
Selection of alternatives two or three would delay the implementation of the FasTracks Program as
there would be a major loss of continuity on the program.

Approval of Eleventh Year (2015) Contract
Amendment to Delcan for FasTracks Quality
Management Consultant Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the Eleventh year Contract Amendment for Delcan in the amount of
$1,700,000 for Quality Management Consulting Services for FasTracks for the year 2015. Funds for
the amendment are contained in the 2015 RTD FasTracks Budget.
BACKGROUND
This action supports the General Manager’s first task goal for 2015 – Advancing/Completing FasTracks.
On June 28, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to Delcan for
Quality Management Consulting Services at an initial 2005 contract price of $418,539, and a Notice to
Proceed of August 1, 2005. This contract was set up to run for an initial six-year term, re-negotiated
and amended annually, based on the needs of the program. The contract also included provisions for a
six-year option.
On December 13, 2005, the RTD Board approved a second year contract amendment for 2006 in the

On November 18, 2008, the RTD Board approved a fifth year contract amendment for 2009 in the
amount of $1,340,000.
On November 17, 2009, the RTD Board approved a sixth year contract amendment for 2010. The
actual cost proposal for the 2010 workscope was $1,400,000; but because of cumulative budget
underruns from previous years, the total Contract Not-to-Exceed price only needed to be increased by
$600,000 in order to deliver the 2010 work.
On November 23, 2010, the Board approved a seventh year contract amendment for 2011 in the
amount of $1,550,000, and authorized the six-year option included in the original contract.
On November 22, 2011, the Board approved an eighth year contract amendment for 2012 in the
amount of $1,645,422.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for this contract amendment are included in the 2015 RTD FasTracks budget.

staff. This is not recommended, as RTD doesn’t have certain skills required to fully develop the
Quality Management program.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
eleventh year contract amendment to Delcan. Rather, re-solicit and award this work to another
consulting team. This is not recommended, as Delcan is satisfactorily performing its work
assignments and providing valuable quality management assistance to the RTD team.
4. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to award the
eleventh year contract to Delcan. Rather, transfer this work scope to the Program Support
Consultant. This is not recommended, as the Quality Management Consultant was originally
established separately from the Program Support Consultant to provide a level of independence.

2015 FasTracks Public Information Consultant
Contract Award

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the third one-year option to the Virtegic Group Incorporated as the
FasTracks Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period
of performance through 2015. The scope of work is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic
Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This
contract amendment is for an amount not to exceed $686,009.60 for the year 2015. Funds for the
award are contained in the 2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
BACKGROUND
Utilizing a Public Information Consultant team to extend the staffin g needs of the FasTracks Public
Information Program contributes to the agency’s 2015 goal to Advance/Complete FasTracks.
In October 2011, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for a Public Information, Communications and
Public Outreach Consultant to serve as an extension of staff in the implementation of the FasTracks
Public Information Program. Following a comprehensive evaluation process, Virtegic Group
Incorporated, a certified SBE firm, was selected for this contract award.
The procurement was set up as a one-year contract award with four one-year options, negotiated
annually by RTD and Consultant Staff and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors. This gives
RTD the opportunity to assess and address the public information and outreach needs of the
FasTracks program on an annual basis as the program evolves. The services needed through this
contract may be reduced or embellished from year to year depending on the future financial situation
and changing needs of the FasTracks program.
Virtegic began its work effort in January 2012 and the RTD Board approved the first of four oneyear options for 2013 and the second one-year option for 2014. In the three years of working as the
FasTracks public information consultant so far, the Virtegic team members have satisfactorily
performed their work assignments and have remained flexible in meeting the needs of the public
information program during staff transitions.
DISCUSSION
The initial contract to Virtegic for 2012 was in the amount of $451,459.20. The first one-year
option for 2013 was $485,167.20. The second one-year option for 2014 was $487,308.80. The
third one-year option for 2015 is not to exceed $686,009.60 bringing the total on this contract to
$2,109,944.80. The 2015 contract amendment includes a base contract amount of $518,009.60 as
well as funds in the amount of $168,000 for an option to provide staffing to assist with special
events planning and preparation for the FasTracks project openings in 2016. This is an option to be
exercised on an as-needed basis only if RTD staff determines extra staff is needed to assist with
preparation for the five project openings in 2016.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for this third one-year option are included in the 2015 Recommended Budget for the
FasTracks program.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the third one-year
option to the Virtegic Group Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information, Communications
and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period of performance through 2015 . The scope of
work is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually

not to exceed $686,009.60 for the year 2015. Funds for the award are contained in the 2015
Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the Public Information Consultant approach.
This is not recommended as RTD doesn’t currently have the staff to provide a sufficient level of
resources to meet the public information, communications and public outreach needs of the
FasTracks program. This alternative would delay and negatively impact the effective
implementation of the FasTracks Public Information Program.

3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
third one-year option to Virtegic Group. Issue another Request for Proposals for professional
services for Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach for the FasTracks Program
and award a contract to another consulting team. This is not recommended as the Virtegic team
is satisfactorily performing its work and has been flexible in meeting the changing communication
needs of the FasTracks program. Also, this alternative will delay and negatively impact the
successful implementation of the various strategies and activities associated with a
comprehensive and multi-layered communications effort.
