Chair Tobiassen moved on to the Unanimous Consent agenda for review and asked if there were any questions on any of the items being presented.  Director Deadwyler asked about the appointment of the Salaried Employee Trustee Replacement as she needed clarification on the structure.  Chair Tobiassen explained the structure change and how it was determined to address both of the salaried plans were and that they were equally represented by an appropriate mix of staff from each specific plan.  He went further to say 2 board members represent as well and Heather Copp, CFO, was a standing member of the committee.  Chair Tobiassen said he is impressed with how the fund is managed and the entire committee is engaged in the process.  Chair Tobiassen outlined how the appointments of the board representation would be completed once he and Director Lubow rolled off the committee in December.  GM Genova said the vacancy for the new member would be advertised in the Monday Morning Q and applications would be reviewed for the perspective candidates.

Chair Tobiassen asked to move onto the recommended action agenda and outlined the items being considered.  There was no discussion on the State Liaison Services.  Director Hoy asked about the Item I and wanted to confirm that the corridors listed SE Corridor and Eagle P3 were the specific corridors listed in the resolution.  Currently the GM Genova said that was true the bonds would be utilized for the stated corridors.  The Central corridor and the SW corridor are not funded at this time.

Director Francone requested a short discussion regarding the ideology of funding the buses at this time outlined in Resolution J as opposed to waiting to make the purchase and how the funding would be paid back.  GM Genova discussed the challenges of getting on the schedule of having the buses built and moving forward would insure the delivery of the vehicles needed when they are needed.  Director Francone asked if staff was comfortable that the bus vendor would be around for a period of time.  GM Genova said he feels the providers we are using now would be around for a while.

Chair Tobiassen moved on to the last recommended action the August 2016 Service Changes.  Director Deadwyler voiced some concern about how the bus constituents have been lost with all the energy going to the train right now.  She has said there are bus scheduling concerns that need to addressed from April before we move on to additional changes.  GM Genova said he would have Jessie Carter look at some of the adjustments that need to be made.  Director Hoy mentioned that on the BRT routes needed changes in January after the opening and the service planning group were very proactive in making adjustments.  Director Deadwyler said she would follow up on the problem routes particularly northern Aurora and service to the Anschutz Campus.  Director Francone said she met with Jessie Carter in the afternoon to clarify the needs of her constituents are being met.  Director Menten and Director Hoy mentioned adjustments were made to the bus schedules were made after the opening of the West Line and for the most part the needs were met.
