Executive Committee
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. We have Director Cook on the phone. She's on her way
in. I'm going to call the meeting to order. This is the Executive Committee on January 23, 2:00
PM.
If we could go around the room and just say who's here. I'm Angie Rivera-Malpiede. I'm chair of
the RTD Board. Pauletta?
PAULETTA TONILAS: Pauletta Tonilas, Assistant General Manager of Communications.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Barbara McManus, Executive Manager, Board of Directors.
VINCE BUZEK: Vince Buzek, Board Secretary.
PEGGY CATLIN: Peggy Catlin, First Vice Chair.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Lynn Guissinger, Treasurer.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And then Shelley?
SHELLEY COOK: Still here.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Can you introduce yourself for the record?
SHELLEY COOK: Ah, thank you. Shelley Cook, Second Vice Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. And?
NATHANIEL MINOR: Nathaniel Minor, Colorado Public Radio.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So I wanted to start off this meeting with our Assistant General
Manager, Pauletta Tonilas, to just talk with us about communication and really kind of the
messaging that we should be looking at this point.
PAULETTA TONILAS: Yeah. So I sent the Board an email earlier just about a general statement
that we had put together. Because we're starting to get questions about the legislation about RTD.
And so we did craft a very general statement in the spirit of, you know, we're working with our
legislative partners on components that will be positive enhancements of how we can serve our
customers, in the spirit or something like that.
But part of what I feel is really important right now is for us to just really be strategic and
coordinated. And without question, the media, constituents will come to Board members and ask

you questions. And whatever we can do to help provide you with some information to answer
questions is what we're here for.
But it also really helps us to know when you've been contacted by the media and what you've
shared with them. Because then they'll call us, and they'll oftentimes tell us that, oh, well, your
Board member told us this or that, and we've talked to five Board members. And without question,
we're not trying to control what the Board members say, but there is some general statements
people oftentimes find helpful to be at least conversation starters and to give just perspective, and
then just looping back and letting us know when you've gotten these inquiries.
Because again, it's in the spirit of us having our act together, to put it bluntly, and for us to be
sharing accurate information and be thoughtful about what we're sharing, with obviously the color
commentary every Board member has an opportunity to share is fine. But it just really helps us to
be all on the same page.
And because right now it's literally every given day people are watching everything we do. We are
under the microscope right now. And I just feel like as much as we can be coordinated and
consistent in messaging and process moving forward, whether it be how we're approaching the
legislation that will be introduced or whether it's about the interim CEO process, is us being
proactive.
I mean, we really are trying to be as proactive as we can be to get out ahead of things instead of
chasing our tail and being reactionary. And I just came from a meeting-- in fact, my folks are still
in there right now-- talking about strategy moving forward, as it relates to even image of the agency
and some things that we can start doing in the short term and more of the long term. Some of these
things I'll be able to share with you in the Communications and Government Relations Committee
meeting that we'll be doing on February 4th, so that you guys kind of have an idea of where we're
headed.
But again, we all have an opportunity to be in it together. In the spirit of openness and transparency,
we're not trying to coin anything a certain way or trying to be PR central. Look over here at all this
great stuff. It's openness. It's transparency. But we can also do that in a coordinated way and
making sure that we're all using each other as tools more than anything else.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Does anybody have any questions?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes. So how can we-- I mean, you have the Executive Committee here. How
can we help communicate that to our fellow Board members?
PAULETTA TONILAS: Well, I was talking with the Chair just about maybe there's an opportunity
to share some things amongst Board members about, at least let us know when you've been
contacted by the press, here's what we're saying. Or even letting us know if there's ideas of, you
know what, here's a message I've been saying and it's really been resonating. And we can be like,
sure, and put together message sheets for you guys, message points, get those out to you.

So that's a big help is how you can-- which you already have been doing, I think, relaying messages
amongst each other, as Board members. As we move forward with this legislation that's been
drafted, I think we've all been engaged in elements of it that are problematic that can be
opportunities for us to work with our legislative partners. I think in the spirit of showing how we're
working with our partners, and we're very open to not only working with them on changes that
people might think need to be made but what we already do.
Because some of, I think, what's going on in people's minds is they maybe just don't know and
they're not educated enough about the things that we already do. For instance, that we work among
the best with transit agencies in the country with the ADA community. We have some of the
strongest programs for ADA in the whole country.
And so it's, how can we leverage these kinds of messages in the spirit of working with our partners
and yet educating and making it productive for the RTD, not an impediment for the RTD.
PEGGY CATLIN: And not come across as being-PAULETTA TONILAS: Defensive, exactly.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And I think the other thing to say is not, you know, not every
Board member has seen the proposed bill. And so if they get a call from someone from the media,
they're not going to be able to respond. And that's one of the things is making sure that we have
our finger on the pulse and letting each other know, hey, this is coming down the pike and if you
get a call, is only fair to everybody. Because you don't like getting those calls and not knowing
what it is that's happening. So thank you.
I think that if you could get us a sheet of talking points that we can share with the Board.
PAULETTA TONILAS: Absolutely. Yes, we're working on it.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think that that would be great. And then we can help call the
Board members, let them know, hey, we're sending you this, we want you to have it at your desk.
And if you have any questions, let us know. But we want to just give you a heads up that you might
be getting some phone calls.
PAULETTA TONILAS: The other thing, if I can real quickly, just update you guys on as it relates
to us notifying the Board when things happen, either things as they're emerging, incidents,
accidents, I try to give you guys a media roundup when things are happening in the press. And
we've had a discussion amongst senior leadership team about, let's get a process together so that
it's maybe always the same person. Because sometimes you get things from Dave Genova,
sometimes Mike Meader, sometimes from me.
So I am now going to be the person that notifies you guys when things happen, or my designee,
one of my staff. Because we always have somebody who's on call for media relations and what
have you, and we get the notices. So as best we can, we're going to get you guys information as

soon as we can about accidents, situations happening in the agency, media heads up, so you know
before you see it on the nightly news or what have you.
So we are shoring up that process, too. And we do have a lot of really great media things coming
up that I'll be sending to you guys. I think there's some fantastic opportunity stories coming that I
think start to add some perspective from a national perspective. I talk about being the trailblazer
all the time. But in the spirit of that, where we have a lot of our transit partners who are in the same
boat as us and who are coming to us being like, hey, what are you guys doing about this? So I
think this will be encouraging.
PEGGY CATLIN: I don't know if it was earned media or planted, but the piece about the G line
operator could not have been sweeter.
PAULETTA TONILAS: Oh, yeah. Yeah, that was a great story. Absolutely.
PEGGY CATLIN: That was awesome.
PAULETTA TONILAS: Yeah. And we're looking at social media, too, and how we can not use it
just clinically, in terms of system information and what have you. But we're changing our social
media strategy a bit to, I don't want to say be a little more edgy, but be a little more in the spirit of
what social media is intended to be. And so that's some of the discussion we've been having here
of late.
So anyway, that's just some things that I wanted to share with you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No. Thank you. And I think it'd be kind of cool for the Board to
identify one really fun story that we want highlighted in each district. I know in one district there
was a proposal on a train. I know in another district there was a four year old's birthday party on a
train.
PAULETTA TONILAS: Oh, gosh, it was-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And you know, I think the District is filled with that kind of stuff.
But nobody's focused on happy things anymore. And maybe we need to do some of that. Yeah.
PAULETTA TONILAS: Yeah. So anyway, any questions for me before I go?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No, if you could get us those talking points, I think that would be
great.
PAULETTA TONILAS: Absolutely. We're working on them.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And then we can disseminate them to the other Board. Thank you
so much.
PAULETTA TONILAS: You bet. Absolutely. Yeah. And we'll see you at 3:30.

LYNN GUISSINGER: Or as soon as I get done here, too.
PAULETTA TONILAS: Or whenever you're done. Yeah, whenever you're done.
LYNN GUISSINGER: [INAUDIBLE] then.
PAULETTA TONILAS: OK, guys. Thank you so much.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you so much.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Thanks, Pauletta.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Our next agenda item is-LYNN GUISSINGER: Do you have an agenda? Is there a printed one?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. Do you mind-LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes, thank you.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So in three minutes, Susan Spero will be dialing in. But in the
meantime, I guess I can go forward. These are copies of the two Board reports and the one
resolution that will be in the packet that we're sending out today regarding the appointment of the
Interim General Manager and the budget transfer for the RFPs that will be going out.
So they're for your review.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, hello, sir.
WILLIAM GROSS: Hello. You don't have to call me names, you know.
JOHN MCKAY: There's some seats-- I can have you follow me back in the back.
WILLIAM GROSS: OK, sure.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And then when Susan gets on the line.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So when would we be putting this out?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Under Other Matters, we will discuss it for adoption for the-LYNN GUISSINGER: We're not naming someone Tuesday, are we?
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, yes.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We hope to. I mean, we're hoping to conclude this.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So we don't talk him little bit first? No?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, it's not my decision. But that's what I thought was happening. We
would review everything over the weekend, all of the comments.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I agree with naming someone. But making it public at that point, it seems
like we would go back to that person real quick, or-SUSAN SPERO: Susan Spero's on the call.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Hi, Susan.
SUSAN SPERO: Hi there.
MICHAEL EBER: Michael Eber on the call.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Who? Who? I'm sorry.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Michael Eber.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
All right. All right, you're on, Susan and Michael.
SUSAN SPERO: Thank you.
MICHAEL EBER: Let me thank the Chair.
SUSAN SPERO: So our mission, should we choose to accept, in this call is to hopefully get you
to sign off on the objectives and the agenda for February 1, which I believe you've received, and
hopefully you've had a chance to look over. And do you want us to stay on the call for the rest-- is
this the rest of your agenda or is there a point, after we discuss the agenda, you want us to get off
the call?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes, just after the agenda, we're going to move to other things.
SUSAN SPERO: OK. All right. Because Michael's got a hard stop at 3:45 and I have a hard stop
at 4:00. But I'm hopeful we're done before then.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Oh, yeah, we'll be done way before that.
SUSAN SPERO: OK.

MICHAEL EBER: Real quickly, before this, since we're calling in, do you mind just doing a quick
shout out, Chair, along with yourself and I think I heard Barbara's voices, of who else is with us?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. So Angie, Chair of the Board.
PEGGY CATLIN: Peggy Catlin, First Vice Chair.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Lynn Guissinger, Treasurer.
VINCE BUZEK: Vince Buzek, Secretary.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Barbara McManus, Executive Manager.
SHELLEY COOK: Shelley Cook. Second Vice Chair.
SUSAN SPERO: I missed the name between-MICHAEL EBER: Sorry, Lynn and-SUSAN SPERO: Lynn and then what?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Vince.
VINCE BUZEK: Vince Buzek.
SUSAN SPERO: OK. All right.
SHELLEY COOK: Now I'm on the phone, Shelley Cook.
SUSAN SPERO: OK. Thank you.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And we had two guests.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We have Nate Minor.
NATHANIEL MINOR: Nathaniel Minor, Colorado Public Radio.
MICHAEL EBER: Very good. Nice to hear your voice. Thank you.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Would you introduce yourself, Dr. Gross?
WILLIAM GROSS: William Gross. Nobody in particular, just-LYNN GUISSINGER: Nobody in particular?
SUSAN SPERO: Go ahead, Mike.

MICHAEL EBER: Thank you. So two, four, and then the Chair, Barbara, Peggy, Lynn-- excuse
me. OK, great. I got everybody's names. Thank you very much.
All righty. So you've seen the objectives. You've seen the agenda. What questions do you have?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Can you repeat that?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, can you repeat that, please?
MICHAEL EBER: Sure. So as Susan mentioned, you hopefully have the agenda. Hopefully you've
had a chance to look over it. So we wanted to start off by asking, what questions do you have?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, let's see. Do you have the agenda for the-- yeah, you have the
agenda for the-PEGGY CATLIN: The retreat.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: The retreat.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, we just got it.
LYNN GUISSINGER: We just got it.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. I think it looks pretty accurate to what we had discussed
with you at the last executive committee meeting.
VINCE BUZEK: I agree.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah.
MICHAEL EBER: Great Thank you.
SUSAN SPERO: Are you just now looking at it for the first time, all of you?
ALL: Yes.
SUSAN SPERO: OK. Then let's give you a minute to read through. Well, let's look at the
objectives first.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And Director Cook doesn't have it in front of her yet.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, she's on her way.
SUSAN SPERO: OK.
MICHAEL EBER: OK. Thank you for letting us know.

SUSAN SPERO: If you just look at the objectives first, anything there that's unclear, that needs
different wording? Anything that's left out?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No. Oh, here's Director Cook.
[PHONE BEEPING]
PEGGY CATLIN: So I do-- I just wanted to make a point that on the objectives and the five key
issues, I think we ought to have a discussion with the whole Board about those. Because the
Executive Committee is the one that came up with those five. And so I think there needs to be an
opportunity to have a discussion as to whether those are the five, whether there are additional
objectives, or whatever, or even some framing of those to make sure that those are what the rest
of the Board thinks are important objectives.
SUSAN SPERO: Well, actually we asked that question in the interviews.
PEGGY CATLIN: Oh, you did? OK.
SUSAN SPERO: Yeah. And these were five that have been proposed.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
SUSAN SPERO: Those [INAUDIBLE]. And some people said, OK, those are fine and other
people said, well, this one's my favorite, or what do you mean by this. And so some people had
some conversation about each of the five. And we may share a little more of the detail on the 1st.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Good.
SUSAN SPERO: But people were generally fine. Maybe there were a few people that said, well,
I don't think those locations. But for the most part, they resonated with people.
VINCE BUZEK: Good.
MICHAEL EBER: Who-- which Director was just asking that question?
PEGGY CATLIN: This is Peggy Catlin.
SUSAN SPERO: OK. It's helpful just to let them-MICHAEL EBER: Director Catlin, hearing now what Susan just said, and you and the rest of the
Executive Committee, do we need to build a five-minute or so overview for some composition of
the Executive Committee to say how these five topics came to be?
PEGGY CATLIN: Um, it might be helpful to understand what your interviews yielded in terms of
those, or the discussion about those. I'd be interested to hear that. But if that was the general
consensus among all 15 Board members, I'm fine moving forward.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And you talked to everyone, right?
SUSAN SPERO: We did. And I'm not sure we need to spend time. I don't remember people saying,
well, where did these come from?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
SUSAN SPERO: And I think if any-- I might had had one person ask. And I said, they came from
discussions with the Executive Committee and the conversations they had with the rest of the
Board. And the person said, fine. So I'm not sure that's an issue.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
MICHAEL EBER: And I would echo, the one or two things that I heard that and that was to say,
hey, could we also added this type of thing, at the same time honoring and respecting the majority.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Gotcha. OK. Great.
SUSAN SPERO: Good. What else?
MICHAEL EBER: Good. So that's one of the points of the objective. Anything else on the other
three objectives?
PEGGY CATLIN: This is Peggy Catlin again. I would say, it says, review 2020 goals. I would say
and tactical plan, and revise as needed. Because the goals themselves are broad enough to be
achievable. It's some of the tactical goals that, in light of certain circumstances, that being service
cuts and other things, we may want to take a look at those tactical goals.
That's my suggestion. I don't know what the rest of the group thinks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No, I think that-- this is Angie-- I think that makes a lot of sense,
particularly on February 1st. Hopefully by then we'll have our interim, right? So we will be able
to start discussing what we think the plan of action should be for this person to move the agency
forward in the next year while we launch off our permanent General Manager position. That's kind
of what I was thinking would kind of happen there. What do you guys think?
VINCE BUZEK: This is Vince. Yeah, that sounds good, as well. I agree. And Susan and Michael,
this is a good place to start. And I know how you guys operate. So you'll flush all this out during
the retreat.
SUSAN SPERO: OK.
MICHAEL EBER: Great. Great. Thank you, both directors, for that input, and adding the word
tactical plan into the second objective.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Michael, Director Cook has something to add.

SHELLEY COOK: On the five key issues, one part of what we might discuss are some things we
can do near term. I don't know if the idea of time frame in terms of-- because we'll be talking later
about the 2020 goals and revisiting some of those in light of what's happened, but also whether
there are some near term things that we could or should look at with regard to some of these areas.
Just speaking of governance, we'll be reviewing, as a matter of annual practice, our bylaws in midMarch, in the March time frame. So are there some things we want to look at for that? Question of
transparency. I've seen mention of live streaming our meetings. And that's come up before. So just
these kinds of topics that we have discussed previously, don't have in our goals but might be
something we can move forward on in the nearer term versus the long term.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: You know-- this is Angie again-- I'm glad you brought up the
whole thing about filming or relaying our meetings. And one of the things that I've learned in the
last couple days is it's out of our capability because we don't have the brand-- the brand?
Bandwidth, and that the City-- it's a City of Denver issue with CenturyLink. And they've been
working on this for quite some time.
And it was just announced this morning that it looked like they were moving a little bit forward.
But it's really been stuck there. And I think it's really important for us to understand, like when we
bring up an issue, if it's in our control or if it's out of our control. Because I think that's going to
make a huge difference on how we talk about it in terms of short-term and long-term goals.
Because I'm with you. I've been like, why can't we just stream, like everybody else does it.
And then this morning, it clicked. I can't use my phone in this building. It just will not allow me.
And I thought, hmm, is it-- but it's all part of that bandwidth-- thank you.
SUSAN SPERO: So a question about the last two comments from the Chair and from Director
Cook. We say some things we can do in the near term. Are you suggesting, Director Cook, that
when we go through those five issues, that one of the discussion questions is, given these things
we talked about, about governance or reimagining RTD or whatever, what are some specific
actions that we as Board members should take in the next few months? Is that what you're tying it
to?
SHELLEY COOK: Or at least ask for information and set a goal regarding it. And they might be
things like, we have talked about expediting parts of Reimagine and bringing that discussion
forward. So that would be something we'd undertake and get feedback from. We're already starting
that discussion with our staff.
SUSAN SPERO: So you're saying, including action steps for information you needed or of setting
a goal regarding short-term things for each of those five areas.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes. Low hanging fruit.
MICHAEL EBER: OK.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, it's a good one, low hanging fruit.
SUSAN SPERO: OK.
MICHAEL EBER: And to add just further clarity. Instead of just an open discussion where
everybody talks and shares their points of views and perspectives, we're also possibly looking if
something gets captured, specifically things that they can do around each of these five themes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
VINCE BUZEK: I think that is right.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah
MICHAEL EBER: OK. OK. I know not seeing you, I'm sure that there's lot of-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I know. We're shaking our heads.
[LAUGHTER]
We're all shaking our heads.
VINCE BUZEK: Can't you hear that?
SUSAN SPERO: [INAUDIBLE] nonverbals.
MICHAEL EBER: Exactly. The other piece I wanted to just go back to, because I think we
resolved it. At the same time, I wanted to be sure so we didn't misconstrue anything. With regard
to the five topics, specifically the question was asked, did something more formally be said about
either where the topics came from or to make sure that the Board in total understands how they
came to be? I didn't know if possibly, Chair Rivera-Malpiede, if that's something in the few
moments of opening remarks, if you want to use that as a place to just set that context?
I also am happy that for Susan and I, when we bring up the five issues, that we just give the context
of, these were the items and the vast majority, and take it that way. What's going to be most
effective for the majority?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: This is Angie. I think I want to open up, when I'm speaking, about
these five issues and how the Executive Committee in the very first meeting identified these as
key issues we wanted to bring forward to the entire Board to focus on for 2020 so that we can
really move forward in unison, making sure we're changing the actual districts, the perception of
the district, as we launch forward.
SUSAN SPERO: OK.

MICHAEL EBER: OK. Super. Super.
VINCE BUZEK: And this is Vince, Michael. And I think it's also a good idea then when you talk
about the-- again, bring this up, the five key issues, how you guys in your interviews with the
Directors fleshed those out and confirmed with everyone else that that was kind of the consensus
that you've received.
SUSAN SPERO: Got it. Good.
MICHAEL EBER: Great. OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. Barbara?
BARBARA MCMANUS: This is Barbara McManus. I have a question. Just to what the Chair just
said. So we talked about near terms and extended, what we can do right away and down the road.
But are all of these objectives-- objectives of the Board inclusively of 2020 as Board initiatives?
Or are we adding these to the 2020 revised tactical plan and goals for staff? Or really is the
extension of some of these five things pushing forward to the goals for 2021?
SUSAN SPERO: I want to understand your question, Barbara. Are you talking about the objectives
that are listed on the-BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, the five key issues.
SUSAN SPERO: Oh, OK, the five key issues. The objectives are what are we going to accomplish
on February 1st. And I think you're asking, are the five key issues, do they need to be folded into
the tactical plan for the staff or the Board? Is that what you're asking?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, the staff or the Board, or both. And is it for 2020, meaning near
term and extended, or are we working in the near term to get some of these things done in 2020
and some are going to be part of the 2021 goals? I'm just trying to understand the scope of what
we're trying to get to of all of those elements in the short term or the long term.
SUSAN SPERO: I'm not sure we can answer that yet, until we see where the conversation goes.
But if I go back to Director Cook's suggestion to make sure that we identify specific action items,
part of this is improv theater, we don't-- we'll structure the conversation with specific questions for
each of the five elements, but we won't know where the conversation will end up. And depending
on where it ends up, what we can build into our structure is before we go on to the next element,
what are specific steps that the Board, the staff, or both need to take in 2020 or beyond, and get
some ideas for actions steps.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Right. I just wanted to clarify. Because the Chair said 2020. And I was
understanding it that the near term and the extended was not defined yet. So I just wanted to clarify
that.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: But-- and this is Angie. And the other thing is, if you recall in that
first meeting we talked about just stopping, because we were not going to be able to achieve the
goals in 2020, if I'm correct. You guys can jump in in that. We really need to just to kind of stop
everything, evaluate where we were, and then determine how we were going to move forward,
correct? They're shaking their heads.
VINCE BUZEK: We're shaking our heads.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: They're shaking their heads in the affirmative, just so you know.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah.
SUSAN SPERO: OK. So Barbara, I think that's a question, and I don't think we know the answer
yet. But you're asking the question, and the Chair's and Director Cook's comments will help to sort
of formulate how we structure those discussions.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Perfect.
MICHAEL EBER: Well said. So as a final opportunity, sounds like we are now with the slight
revision to objective 2, we are all on board with the core objectives, question mark?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah.
MICHAEL EBER: Great.
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: They're broad enough, I think, that we can-MICHAEL EBER: Super. I hear lots of heads nodding.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: There are.
MICHAEL EBER: So that's good.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Hearing rattling, huh?
MICHAEL EBER: Great. What modifications would you suggest, if any, to the agenda itself?
SUSAN SPERO: Or what questions do you have?
PEGGY CATLIN: This is Peggy Catlin. Is there any thought behind the order that we're taking
these five key issues? Because in my mind, they might be reordered a little bit, based on some of
our priorities.

SUSAN SPERO: And what reorder occurs to you?
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, I think transparency in relationships is probably one of the keys for a lot
of people and, you know, dealing with external stakeholders. And that might create some action
items. The RT-- or the rider experience, similarly. And then all those might roll into, OK, what
does that mean for Reimagine RTD? And what does that mean for governance? Rather than the
reverse order.
It's just, that's the way my mind's working. I don't know. I see Director Buzek nodding.
VINCE BUZEK: I'm nodding. Yeah, I think that some of that might make some sense. And I also- what were you, go ahead, answer that. I have a question afterwards.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I would agree with-SUSAN SPERO: Do you want to-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I would agree with that.
SUSAN SPERO: Do you want to say that or want me to?
MICHAEL EBER: So I guess first is, before the question for Director Buzek, thoughts, comments
from others with regard to the ordering?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I agree with Director-- excuse me, with Director Catlin.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, I do, too.
SHELLEY COOK: The one question would be not making rider experience the last before a break.
Make it start a session. Because I don't want to give it short shrift, is one thought. So any other
reordering, I think, makes sense.
SUSAN SPERO: I didn't hear all that. Say again, please.
SHELLEY COOK: I just didn't want rider experience to end up third before a break, or at the end.
And I like the idea that it was starting off a block of time. I didn't want to see it get short shrift. So
any other reordering makes sense, from what you all have said.
SUSAN SPERO: So you like rider experience right after the break?
SHELLEY COOK: Either. Yeah, or first.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Having Reimagine RTD-- this is Lynn-- having Reimagine RTD last
makes some sense. We will have talked about some of our issues. And then we're going to be
talking about how we plan for the future.

PEGGY CATLIN: Either that or governance could be the-- one of those two could be the last, I
think.
SUSAN SPERO: It's interesting that we're having this conversation. Because Michael and I had it
as well, and we were sort of moving the blocks around like, what should come first, chicken or
egg here. And initially, I think it was Michael who proposed similar to what you're saying.
And I played devil's advocate from that, and I said, I think the relationship piece is going to be the
toughest. And should we save that for last and get through some of these other issues quickly? Or,
because it impacts how you discuss the other ones, should we get after it first? And if you're all
comfortable with us starting with relationships, I could make a strong argument in favor of that.
LYNN GUISSINGER: What are we talking about there? Like relationships with local
governments and state and all of-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: With everybody.
LYNN GUISSINGER: OK.
SUSAN SPERO: I think it starts with what we heard a lot in the interviews, and we'll share this on
the 1st, is that how you treat each other, how you talk to each other, how you talk about each other,
tenor of your meetings. And any time you get more than two people in a room, there's a potential
for disagreement and tension and whatever.
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, I have disagreements with myself all the time.
SUSAN SPERO: Well, I could disagree with myself alone in a room, so I'm with you on that. And
this will be the third time I've worked with you all. And I've heard some of that in the last two
years. But both of us saw, in listening to the interviews, it was amped up this year because of
obvious reasons. And people talked about it.
One person even said, and I wouldn't say this on the 2nd-- on the 1st-- but we're not playing nice
in the sandbox. And if you all are comfortable with us starting with relationships, I can make an
argument for that.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah. That is different than I originally thought. But it's valid. I mean, that's
one reason you called around was to get everybody's take on that. But given that, if we need to
work out some of those issues, I'd rather do that last, just as you had proposed.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
SUSAN SPERO: OK. Because-- I'm sorry, Michael-- it's how you talk to each other, but it's also
your relationships with the SLT, with the public, with the media, everybody else.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think that's worth-- this is Peggy-- I think that's worthwhile to bring, to have
up front.

BARBARA MCMANUS: You still have to work with each other the whole day.
LYNN GUISSINGER: It may be two different topics, the relationships of the agency and all of
the Board with the world out there, and then-SHELLEY COOK: The interpersonal stuff.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, the interpersonal stuff, yeah.
SUSAN SPERO: I didn't hear all that.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I'm sorry. This is Lynn. I just said it may be two different topics or two
sides to a topic that the relationships of the agency and the Board with our stakeholders and
everyone out in the world, and then the relationships within the Board. And just respect, really. I
mean, you know-PEGGY CATLIN: But transparency is a key word, though.
LYNN GUISSINGER: That's true.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It is. This is Angie. And I'm thinking the same thing. Bless you.
When we're talking about relationships that we're talking about professional relationships, of
representing the agency and our constituents. Then when we talk about personal relationships,
that's how we work with each other in terms of common ground, respect, and that kind of stuff.
And I see it as two separate topics.
SUSAN SPERO: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So Susan, does it make sense to do the inter Board relationship portion
at the beginning as part of the ground rules before we get to these five? And then that way, we're
not discussing the Board's interpersonal relationship. That's part of the relationship, which is a
bigger picture.
SUSAN SPERO: Well, it takes more than a-- I see it as taking a lot more of a conversation than
just the ground rules. The ground rules is a fairly short conversation. And I'm still arguing in my
head-- I don't know about Michael-- but the advantage to talking about both the flavors of
relationships that you've all identified first is that we could hopefully make some agreements, and
that might color how the rest of the day goes.
The disadvantage is you're starting with the touchiest topic. Maybe it's not the touchiest. Maybe
they're all touchy. And the disadvantage of putting relationships last is that we wouldn't have
enough time.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, and the other thing I would argue is this is at 8:00 AM,
which could be really difficult to have a discussion like that about-- I can't help but think that some
people aren't morning people to begin with. I'm like, oh, my gosh.

MICHAEL EBER: Sure.
SUSAN SPERO: Well, and that's a-- go ahead.
MICHAEL EBER: I was just going to add, Chair, I think that it's a valid point that what time-- two
points. One, what time is best for everybody? Do you have more people that are more morning
people than afternoon people? And I think the second question is in some ways, by taking on some
of the bigger topics, like relationships and transparency, early on, generally folks are a little more
fresh, and while maybe not fully awake, at least they are less likely to react more aggressively the
later it gets. Because we know with fatigue and things like that.
SUSAN SPERO: Well, and it's also, just from a facilitation standpoint, it's generally risky, even
though they know us and we know them to some degree, to start off with a really-MICHAEL EBER: Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah.
SUSAN SPERO: --with a really personal topic.
I'm going to suggest that Michael and I take your input, we think about it, and we send maybe to
Chair and Barbara a revised agenda when we play with the order a bit. Is that OK?
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That sounds great.
SUSAN SPERO: OK.
MICHAEL EBER: OK. So the two parts with that one is one, whatever the order is, make sure
preferentially that rider experience is right after the break. And then in terms of what's sort of one
and two and what's four and five after that, Susan, and we'll circle back So that sounds good for
that.
What other comments or questions do you have on the agenda?
VINCE BUZEK: This is Vince. I'll go back to my question that I had. And I think I know the
answer, but could you please explain your strategy in putting the review of the 2020 agency goals
after the address of the five key issues, instead of before?
SUSAN SPERO: You or me, Michael?
[LAUGHTER]

MICHAEL EBER: I'll start it off. You know, it's great when like minds think alike. Because in
fact, Susan and I had that same conversation as well. Do you do the goals first or do you do the
topics first?
And the reason that we settled, and certainly appreciate your input to this going forward, is that
the five key issues will provide not only shared agreements, hopefully, understanding and some
common ground. as well as the outcomes of those five topics may lead to a different approach to
addressing the 2020 agency goals than if you were to address the 2020 agency goals right out at
the beginning, you may not have some context. And people may be wondering, oh, but there's all
these other components.
VINCE BUZEK: That's what I thought your strategy was. And I agree. So thanks.
SUSAN SPERO: Good.
MICHAEL EBER: Great. Thank you for asking. Good. Other questions?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Anybody else?
VINCE BUZEK: No.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Barbara?
No. We're good.
MICHAEL EBER: Wow.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I know.
MICHAEL EBER: You're-- all righty.
PEGGY CATLIN: So then just to wrap up. This is Peggy Catlin again. You're going to think about
this a little bit, send a revised agenda to the Chair and Barbara, and then for input, and then, would
you send it out to the whole group? OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
SUSAN SPERO: To the whole Executive Committee or to the whole Board?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: The Executive Committee, right?
SUSAN SPERO: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We'll get up-- we'll get the final copy to the full Board prior to the
retreat.

SUSAN SPERO: OK. OK.
MICHAEL EBER: OK? Great.
SUSAN SPERO: Go ahead, Michael.
MICHAEL EBER: You took-- you were perfect, Susan. I was just going to say, what else do you
need to hear from us with regard to the agenda and the framework for February 1st?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Ask that question again, please.
MICHAEL EBER: Any other-- what else do you need from us with regard to the agenda and for
the planning for the February 1st date?
VINCE BUZEK: Nothing for me.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right now, nothing. But I'd like to reserve the ability to call you
if we come up with something.
SUSAN SPERO: OK. We have one request of you. Like you, Chair, we'll probably come up with
more before February 1st. But here's our request. And I want to phrase it as tactfully as I can.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Uh-oh.
SUSAN SPERO: It's an important request that Michael and I have thought about. We need to know
that once you agree on the agenda, today or whenever, that you will support it. And you saw last
year that we can be flexible. And we know that as facilitators, we sometimes need to adjust things
based on how conversations go.
That said, we both found that what happened last year to be a disservice to you, collectively.
Because there were several things that people specifically requested that got dropped because of
the objections of one or two people. And our experience of that was that there was no pushback,
there was no backing of what we had agreed to from leadership. And so as a result, while you
appreciate our flexibility, several people were disappointed that some of the things that we
promised them got dropped.
And so we'd like to know if we have your commitment that if any individual pushes back on parts
of the agenda that you'll back us up.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We are all nodding our heads yes. We promise to stand up with
you guys arm in arm, regardless of what the ramifications are to moving forward.
SUSAN SPERO: OK, that's helpful to hear.
MICHAEL EBER: Thank you so much, Chair.

PEGGY CATLIN: This is Peggy Catlin. This is Peggy. Thank you for asking for that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, thank you.
SUSAN SPERO: You're welcome. OK. Well, hopefully.
MICHAEL EBER: Beautiful.
SUSAN SPERO: Whatever.
[LAUGHTER]
VINCE BUZEK: Don't mess it up.
MICHAEL EBER: And you'll be hearing from us, Chair and Barbara. And that's all for now.
SUSAN SPERO: And We hope that your meeting on Tuesday goes well and that you make a swift
and unanimous decision.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
SUSAN SPERO: You're welcome.
MICHAEL EBER: Yeah. Well said.
IN UNISON: Thanks. Bye.
SUSAN SPERO: Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: I don't think it's going to be either.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm not even Catholic anymore. I'm still genuflecting.
VINCE BUZEK: OK, good.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Thank you.
All right. Next agenda item is discussion of legislation regarding RTD. So Lynn, I'm going to turn
this over to you and see if you'd like to do kind of an overview of this piece.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Well, discussion of the legislation. We spent-- I'll just tell you what's been
going on generally. And then we had a meeting two days ago that was with Jack Tate and Robert
Rodriguez and Dominique Jackson and JoyAnn Ruscha, who is working for him, and went through
specifics. Staff, our legal team, has come up with comments. Great comments. I think Jennifer did
a great job, . And whoever else was helping her. I don't think it was just her.

And we had a meeting this morning that Angie and I were in, along with Matt Gray and Faith
Winter and Jack Tate and Robert Rodriguez, and just talked about the bill that he's probably going
to drop tomorrow. And we don't know for sure. But he's probably going to file it tomorrow, has a
lot of different things in it.
There are provisions on people with disabilities and requiring additional compliance, creating a
state private cause of action that has actual damages, compensatory damages, and attorneys fees.
And there's one for disability community and also Title VI, both creating state causes of action.
I think our biggest comment there is that it creates, it could potentially create a lot of litigation. So
we get guys like Vince Buzek who-- no, I'm just kidding.
VINCE BUZEK: Only thing better than one lawsuit is two lawsuits.
[CHUCKLING]
LYNN GUISSINGER: And we're working with them. You know, I think that our position is very
clear, not even coached by Pauletta. We want to work with you. We want to help you figure it out.
We know there's frustration. We read the newspapers, too. We know that the Capitol and people
throughout are frustrated.
There are kind of two types of provisions in the legislation is that sort of prescriptive provision.
And there's also some governance provisions. Governance provisions authorize the governor to
appoint two people, one to represent-- to the Board-- one to represent the disability advocate,
disability, people with disabilities and from groups, and one to represent-- along with equitable
transportation, they also proposed two ex officio. Those people could be voting members, two ex
officio members, one appointed by the CDOT Director. It says the CDOT Director or his or her
designee. And the other one is the Treasurer for the state, or his or her designee, who would not
have voting authority but would sit with the Board.
And then a lot of just kind of clean up things. They're putting in a campaign finance provision.
They're making RTD subject to Amendment 41, which, of course, we, internally we have mirrored
those requirements of Amendment 41. But the Ethics Commission had said we're not officially
bound by that amendment. But it didn't seem like a big problem since we do it anyhow.
So there's some things in there that, you know, we do anyhow. It says that-- I guess the original
statute said we had to meet quarterly, says the Board has to meet monthly. Well, we meet monthly.
We meet all the time, right now, I guess.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Twice.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Twice a day?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: A week.

LYNN GUISSINGER: So some of them are really no big deal. But I think trying to help them
clean up the language in some of those prescriptive provisions.
Oh, there are a provision-- there's provision that takes out the fare recovery, the fare box recovery
requirements. And that's one that staff is welcoming for sure. And then there's a provision that is
aimed at helping with TOD development. You know, what we learned this morning is that a lot of
the problems with that are federal rather than state. So I'm not sure. They will have to look at that
some more and see if there's something the state can do that helps.
Anything else in there, Angie, that you can think of?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No. I mean, I think one of the big issues is educating each other.
Like one of the, the thing under the communities of disability is letting them know that we currently
have three committees that advise RTD. And they did not know that.
So I mean, it's really been a great way of sitting together in a room and kind of talking back and
forth about different things. And I think that that's always good as people are advocating on our
behalf and that we are also letting them know we have a Title VI department, we have a civil rights
division.
LYNN GUISSINGER: A robust Title VI division.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Very, very robust.
PEGGY CATLIN: One of the best in the country.
VINCE BUZEK: And the composition of our current Board, we have several members that are
zealous advocates for disadvantaged communities and the disabled communities. Where do-- do
they think we're falling short somehow in that regard?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, the Senator said to me, because I asked him what his
definition of diversity was. And he said, well, for instance, Claudia Folska will not be on the Board
forever. And so we just want to ensure that there's someone there. Those were kind of how he had
talked about it.
We did say to him, we're an elected board of over 200,000 constituents and we literally represent
every demographic. And there are-- I can't think of one person on the Board who is not an advocate
for folks with disabilities or low income or people of color or language differentiation. But they
really just want this in there.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And an example, I think that's one of the advantages of having an elected
Board. Because I'm not trained as an advocate for the disability community, but I'm involved in an
issue right now where someone's having troubles. I've been involved with Via when we change
the software for dispatch. And Via is a critical nonprofit in the northern area for providing our para
transit service.

So I think we all, by nature of being elected, get involved in these issues.
VINCE BUZEK: Sure. Just like legislators do.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Exactly. Just like legislators do. And we are the choice of the
people. It's not like we're being appointed, but that we actually have to go through a campaign and
get elected.
VINCE BUZEK: I just raised that because when I first saw that, I was just confused about what-I don't get this. It doesn't-- it seemed like a solution looking for a problem. And it may still be. But
there are some other things, I think, in that legislation that I understand, and some things I would
even support.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So that's kind of where we all are. And if it drops, it goes to Senator
Winters' Transportation Committee on the Senate side. And she'll have control over the calendar
and all of those things.
PEGGY CATLIN: And will she let you know then when-- let Brandeberry-McKenna know when
that would be calendared?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Oh, yeah. We'll be staying in close touch on it.
PEGGY CATLIN: So we would know as soon as-LYNN GUISSINGER: I think it will change.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for you guys staying on top of that.
SHELLEY COOK: Is it your sense that they're seeking representation on the Board because the
advisory groups we have don't have a loud enough voice, or is there a way that we could work
through the existing process or-LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, I think that some of that-- I think they haven't figured out what the
governance model. I mean, I'm not saying maybe, maybe they have, Senator Tate and his cosponsors. But I'm not sure that that will be the final model. I think that there are a lot of people
looking at different things.
They want to-- you know, there's frustration with what's going on, with service cuts and all of the
different things. They're not going to be-- they don't have money to give us. And they recognize
that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: But I think the good news is that they are being educated in depth
about who we are and what we have in place and how we are governed. And so I don't think they
had that much information when I started putting these together. And I think they were really
surprised by our Title VI, our civil rights, all of those components.

So I think it's been great meeting with them, getting to know them, and them getting to know us.
LYNN GUISSINGER: It will be a continuing process.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks again. That's great.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah. Thanks for your hard work.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Sure.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Anything else?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Not from me.
VINCE BUZEK: No? Good.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Any other questions, comments?
VINCE BUZEK: None from me, thanks.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Are we on Other Matters?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Now we are under Other Matters. Is everybody-- so you're all
done, we can go on to Other Matters?
LYNN GUISSINGER: All done.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, thank you.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So I know that the Chair and the Vice Chair have been making calls
and trying to get a consensus on the formulation of an executive search committee. We will be-on Tuesday, one of the Board reports that I handed out earlier is the budget transfer for the external
vendors that we would be going out of RFP for.
So I don't know what date we're thinking that we'll have a final committee. Because that committee
has to start making some decisions pretty quickly before we can think about moving forward on a
permanent General Manager. And as you all know, because I've shared 100 times, I'm really
nervous about the timing.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right. Right.
Director Catlin, do you have any update on your conversations about folks?
PEGGY CATLIN: I have the ones that I met with. But we needed to get our-- we needed to get
together to compare notes on that.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So we all called Board members to see if they were interested, to
sitting on the committees and stuff.
PEGGY CATLIN: They need to get it tallied.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So now, we'll tally it for you. Because we also know that we're on
a really short timeline.
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, and I proposed a couple of conversations with people who indicated that
they wanted to be on the committee but there were some concerns about the time commitment.
And so I have follow-up conversations on those.
LYNN GUISSINGER: That was what I was hearing. If there are 34 meetings, I don't want to be
on any. I heard that.
PEGGY CATLIN: But there are some people that would like to be on it but don't want to commit
to 34 meetings. So we kind of have to-LYNN GUISSINGER: Which makes a lot of sense.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah. I mean, when we go out to RFP, there are a group of elements
that each of the RFPs includes. There's the strategic planning group. There is the group that
coordinates the focus groups. And sometimes that can be one RFP. Last time, it was two separate
RFPs for the communications piece, and then the executive search firm.
LYNN GUISSINGER: That was three different?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Last time, it was three. And so looking at those three, what happens is
by the time we send the RFP out, the RFP gets responded to, we get together the group, we review
all of the content of the proposals that have come back. We decide on one. We announce who that
one is. Then we have to get them here and work with them to put together, see what they-- we'll
have a-LYNN GUISSINGER: One search committee, search firm.
BARBARA MCMANUS: For the search firm, initially. Because they'll help us, regardless of the
other RFPs, they will help us put together a timeline of what we want to do.
Now I can't really put in there that the deadline is December 15, 2020, because we may not be able
to get there. But we can write it that it can be that we want them to bring back to us an aggressive
timeline.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, let me just say this. When we were calling people, we were
asking, are you in favor of moving forward with an executive search firm? And my tally says, yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: Mine does, too.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, that the majority said go forward with it. So you do have
the ability to do that.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Although a couple people said, well, let's get the RFP out. We don't have
to decide to do it, ultimately, which-BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, the search committee needs to approve the RFP. So we have to
have the committee first.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: In place.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Can't we approve the RFP right now, until we set a search committee?
BARBARA MCMANUS: You could. But the search committee may not like that, depending on
how that winds up. I mean-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, we've already done a-BARBARA MCMANUS: I mean, I can just write it and put it out. I mean, when I was ready to
put it out when the Chair said, the Board wants to wait until the new executive committee and a
search committee is appointed. So that was what my-PEGGY CATLIN: I think I recall that it was a new Executive Committee was appointed. I think,
personally, since the Chair asked me to head this up. I personally think that if this Executive
Committee can get feedback to me as soon as possible on the RFP, then we could go out before
we name the search committee.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I agree. I agree.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think we can expedite it that way.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I do, too.
PEGGY CATLIN: So I'll meet with-BARBARA MCMANUS: I'm all for that.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah. I'll meet with the Chair and we'll do that.
And then when we name the executive committee and subsequent buddies, then let's just say in
the interest of time, we have issued this RFP.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And how long does it go out for, three weeks?

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And it isn't-- the Board has already been alerted that this is
something that we're-- and they're in agreement with it. So it's not like they're going to go, what is
this?
PEGGY CATLIN: I think that our search committee needs to approve the RFP. I think-SHELLEY COOK: Question about the RFP, though. Does include a baked-in process, or can we,
the negotiating group, can they work with them on the process, the number of meetings, the how
you structure the outreach, that kind of stuff?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, we ask them to bring a plan to us based on what our goals are.
SHELLEY COOK: So is that something the executive search committee itself approves?
LYNN GUISSINGER: You mean the executive committee or the search committee?
SHELLEY COOK: The search committee.
PEGGY CATLIN: Search committee.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So if this committee is going to move forward with approving the RFP,
which I'm in the middle of writing.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: To go out.
ALL: To go out.
BARBARA MCMANUS: The one for the executive search firm. Then it's out. But by the time it
comes back, then-PEGGY CATLIN: We will have an executive search committee.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes. And then the folks that aren't on it from this group, then-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Will review.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Will not be part of that.
SHELLEY COOK: And then will they have-- whoever it is, and the timing, will they have a chance
to review the process and maybe identify some ways it can be modified this time around? Because
I did hear some of that. Do we have to have 34 for meetings?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, you know-LYNN GUISSINGER: Why did we have 34 meetings? Are they public meetings or what was--

BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: Many of them were. And part of the outreach.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: For the permanent General Manager, we have to introduce them
to the community, and the community needs to have that voice in there. That's why.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Just think how many meetings we've had for the interim.
SHELLEY COOK: Internal, mainly.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Almost half that.
SHELLEY COOK: So the question is, will that committee have a chance to look at the process
that we've used before and rather than just assume that we're going to do it the same way, take on
a different-BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, the committee can do anything it wants to do.
PEGGY CATLIN: But they're going to come back with a proposal for a timeline and a scope that's
fleshed out, an aggressive timeline, as Barbara-So let's put a date to this. This committee needs to review the RFP, which we have.
LYNN GUISSINGER: We do have it?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, I'm working on it.
PEGGY CATLIN: Oh, OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I was thinking I was going to get some marching orders from someone
on what they wanted. So I have a skeleton. I need to fill it in, based on what you want. And I can
send to this group what I have already.
PEGGY CATLIN: Do you have your hands on the RFP that was issued last time? OK, so if we
can have that for reference. And then your skeleton, if you can send us that. And then if we could
provide our comments, collectively, back to Barbara, would Monday be OK? Or would you-BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, I'm preparing for Tuesday on Monday. And Tuesday is a really
big day.
SHELLEY COOK: What about Friday?
BARBARA MCMANUS: So how about Wednesday?
PEGGY CATLIN: Wednesday is fine with me.

BARBARA MCMANUS: Oh, wait a second.
PEGGY CATLIN: I didn't mean to rush you. I just wanted to know when you would like it. I'm
just trying to put some dates that we can commit to.
VINCE BUZEK: Right.
PEGGY CATLIN: And hopefully by Wednesday, Angie and I will have figured out who the
executive search committee will be, and who their buddies are.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And what it does-- I'm still unclear what exactly the executive-- what
comes to the Board and what is-VINCE BUZEK: Yeah. I think everything comes to the board, but the process of getting it is
another thing.
PEGGY CATLIN: The roles and responsibilities of the Executive Committee.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So it's the Search Committee.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Do you have that somewhere?
BARBARA MCMANUS: I know what happened last time. And the committee basically made all
of the decisions and just gave an overview of the decisions they made to the Board as they moved
along.
LYNN GUISSINGER: What decisions?
BARBARA MCMANUS: All of the decisions.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Like picking the GM, or-BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, no. The rest of the Board is going to be involved in all of the
outreach, all of the strategic plan, you know. But the decision making doesn't go to the full Board.
It goes just to that committee.
PEGGY CATLIN: But each of the committee members has a buddy or two and their
responsibilities are to reach out and dialogue with those and then come back and report.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Right. Keep them in the loop of what's going.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Kind of like what we're doing now when we call Board members
to get updates and information and stuff. Yeah.

BARBARA MCMANUS: The one thing I would say is pretty important is that when we review
what comes back is that if we don't like it, we change it right then, that we do not make any changes
to it as we're moving along.
LYNN GUISSINGER: In terms of the RFP and the plan? Is that what you mean?
BARBARA MCMANUS: In terms-- well, yes, in terms of the final RFP.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Scope of work.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Right. And that any changes do cost money, of course. We all know
that. So I want to say it out loud. Any changes along the way costs dollars. And we're moving
$400,000 over, all said and done. We're hoping we're not going to need anywhere near that. But
we don't know. I mean, we don't know.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And we wanted to be ready to move it.
PEGGY CATLIN: So to recap. Barbara will send out to this group the previous scope of work in
RFP, which is the scope of work is contained within the RFP, and your new outline. And then we
will get back-- I can gather all those comments or whatever by Wednesday. So we will-- so the
Executive Committee will review by Wednesday, and the Chair and I will propose the Executive
Search Committee and buddies and roles and responsibilities by Wednesday as well. OK.
I just wanted to get this documented.
BARBARA MCMANUS: That's fine.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Is that OK?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: All right. What will comprise committee, and roles and responsibilities. OK.
That helps me a lot. Get the process moving.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: And then you will issue the RFP upon final agreement from this group,
probably end of week next week, provided there aren't too many changes.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah. I'm not going to tie myself down to that. But I will try to get that
done by next time.
PEGGY CATLIN: No, I just want-- actually, I'm not trying to tell you what to do, I'm trying to
find out what you would like to do.

BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, I don't know. It depends on what everything looks like and what
changes we make. And last time it was, I think it was pretty cut and dry. Based on the process that
I've seen so far for the Interim General Manager, that is what I'm looking at as far as adding and
subtracting things from what I'm working on now.
PEGGY CATLIN: But I just-- I heard at the beginning that you're just nervous about the time line.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I am.
PEGGY CATLIN: Trying to be respectful of that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Could you also send us the job description of the permanent
General Manager, just so we have that as well as we're doing-BARBARA MCMANUS: It's the same as the interim.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, then we're good.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, you all have that already.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, we do have that.
VINCE BUZEK: I have it at my fingertips today.
BARBARA MCMANUS: There you go.
SHELLEY COOK: And we talked about the executive search firm helping us to identify parts that
are especially important now or if we want information.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, right. The more groundwork we have done-PEGGY CATLIN: The less costly it will be.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, and the timeline will move quicker.
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, we have the start of a process then, which makes me feel a little bit better.
I don't know if some of you saw that Jessie has sent out-- or they've sent out the schedule for the
public meetings for the service changes.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Oh, we have those?
BARBARA MCMANUS: They're all in the two-week calendar that you'll get with the packet
today.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. All right.

VINCE BUZEK: Thanks.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you. So I get to have one the day after our retreat.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: On a Sunday.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Really, on a Sunday?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: They'll make it that night.
SHELLEY COOK: On a Sunday?
PEGGY CATLIN: Sunday.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Better check.
PEGGY CATLIN: Sunday at the Columbine Library.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Did he send it to us, too? Or it's just going to be on the-PEGGY CATLIN: No, they sent-- I got an email with all of them today.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Can we talk just finally a few minutes about the executive session
on the 28th at 3:30 PM? And I want to just say a couple of things. I've asked Barbara to bring food
in early. So be an early, like so we can eat there.
But one of the things we've been talking about is how do we want to configure this? And so one
of the things that I was really wanting to make sure was that we all could participate in the
discussion. Because the last time we did this, Peggy was facilitating some. I was. Shantelle. And
you lose the ability to actually sit down and really converse and have a good kind of dialogue.
So I asked Miss McManus to help me find a facilitator. And so we have someone from the
Innovation Team. Can you just talk-BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah. They're from our Education department.
LYNN GUISSINGER: It's an employee?
BARBARA MCMANUS: It's an employee.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
BARBARA MCMANUS: She has facilitated sessions like this. Mostly she facilitates, of course,
teaching and educating. She's a fairly strong facilitator. We met yesterday and we went over what
the process has looked like from the beginning up until now, and what our end goal is on Tuesday.

And it was my understanding, when I had the conversation with her, that we would be making a
decision and moving that forward on Tuesday.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Correct.
That's my thing. I think that if we prolong it to the 30th, this is just going to go on and on. And we
really-- this is the short-term, interim position. And I think that we've given it its due diligence in
terms of the comments from the community and that stuff.
So before we have this on the prior Friday the 24th, by the end of day, we will have all the survey
results and all of the comments to every Board member. So they'll be able to review those over the
weekend, along with the binders that we have with the five resumes of the folks. And we're asking
that by the end of business day on Monday the 27th, that you select your top two choices to come
in, which is kind of-LYNN GUISSINGER: Is that ranking?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No, just your top-- How did we do it last time?
BARBARA MCMANUS: So it doesn't have to be in a particular order. What we'll do is when we
get all of that information on Monday, we'll put the names on a flip chart, like we did the first time
when we did the eliminations. And we'll put how many ticks that were voted for by all 15 folks.
And that will sort of create a ranking that will start the discussion.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I have a problem with that, in that there are a lot of people who may have
a significant first choice and a much lower down second choice. And that doesn't account for that.
And so I don't think that's-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So that's why I wanted to have this conversation. Because I've had
four suggestions of four different way to do this. I have a matrix. I have a nomination. I have-- so
what would the preference of this committee be?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Well, Bob Broom suggested one thing to me, and I'll just throw it out, that
I thought was good, that he's seen in the past. And I think he'd say this, too. He said we would go
in and we would take nominations.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That's the nomination.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So in case somebody drops out. I mean, chances are, you'd get all five
nominated. But who knows? And then everybody votes for one. And if you don't get eight votes
for one. You drop the bottom one away and you go to the next.
Let me ask a question. Is that vote done in public meeting?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No. It's all in executive session.

LYNN GUISSINGER: OK.
VINCE BUZEK: It's not voting.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It's not voting.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We would come out and-VINCE BUZEK: Polling.
LYNN GUISSINGER: --and do a final vote.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We would come out and-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And then make it public, and then do the-- then do the vote.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Make a public appointment of the Interim General Manager.
PEGGY CATLIN: So, excuse me, at one previous meeting we talked about bringing forward no
more than three.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right.
PEGGY CATLIN: And so now we're changing that-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: You're saying your top two.
PEGGY CATLIN: --process a little bit. I'm just warning you that some people thought that they
could bring forward no more than three, which we probably shouldn't bring three.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I guess my concern is I don't like bringing forward two, unless it's just to
nominate them. But again, it weights them the same. And we don't individually-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That's why we're having this conversation. So what is the pleasure
of this Executive Committee? Because I think we've really all talked to so many different Board
members. And I've also heard the nomination piece. I've gotten a matrix. I've gotten something
else.
And the point is, we want, on the 28th, when we go into that meeting, to come out with a decision
of who we want to move forward as the interim GM. How we get there, I just want to make sure
we're all on the same page so that our staff isn't going nuts trying to figure out what we're doing.
PEGGY CATLIN: So I did hear from a couple of people that unlike the last time, there wasn't an
opportunity to really speak on behalf of a candidate or maybe in opposition to a candidate and that
it would be nice to have all of the Board members have an opportunity to participate or make

remarks, pros and cons, based on all of the information they're getting, which, by the way, will
include a summary of the background checks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes. It should-PEGGY CATLIN: Will that be in our packet?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Is that right?
The reference checks? No.
PEGGY CATLIN: There won't be a summary?
LYNN GUISSINGER: When do we get the reference discussions?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Natalie and Roger will give you those at the beginning of the session
on Tuesday.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Is it possible to get those sooner? I mean, there may be something that
needs to be responded to, or-BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, if there's any flags, we'll hear that. But I mean, I can talk to Roger.
He's not-- I mean, he said socializing, that stuff is not something he's comfortable with.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: He will be at this meeting. So he'll be at this meeting and so will
Natalie. And the idea was to have them report on the reference checks, like what happened.
I sent you a copy of the questions. They're very uniform, traditional questions. So we thought that
that would suffice. But if-PEGGY CATLIN: I was just trying to clarify if we were going to get that or not.
SHELLEY COOK: Vince is-VINCE BUZEK: Go ahead. You can go.
SHELLEY COOK: I kind of like the Bob Broom approach. Or if we do talk to them, we should
rank them, because of the concern that Lynn said. So if we did one, then the easy thing is
eliminating the one that doesn't get as many votes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So I guess my question to you is then do we want people to submit
their top candidates, or do we just want to go in and do the nomination?
VINCE BUZEK: So yeah, it's important that we have a process defined and that we stick to the
process.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes. Correct.
VINCE BUZEK: I don't mind that process at all, that nomination-type process then people start to
fall out. It's important that we get buy in from everybody that when we go in and that they agree.
Because when their people start dropping off, their favorites, they're going to protest. That's what
people do. I don't like this process. So we need to get people buying in on the process right away.
And if we do take input from directors on why they want who they want, or why they don't want
who they don't want, we should time limit that, and we should get everybody-- everybody has to
bring one choice to speak. It's not a dialogue. When Lynn says something against my person and
I don't agree, I don't get to speak again, because we have to just-- you get your three minutes and
everybody can talk about who they want to talk about, and we're done. It's not a dialogue. Because
we'll be there for the rest of our lives.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That's right. Barbara?
BARBARA MCMANUS: So I think we're sort of talking about the same thing. With the top
choices that we get, we were going to be outlining them, just like we did in the process before. I
think it's important that we don't change to how we do things in the middle. And this is the way
we did it before.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Well, that was to narrow it down.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, we still need to narrow it down.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Well, we need to pick one person. So in other words, if we picked three
people before, we were picking three or five. And now we're picking one. I mean, if we had people
do their two, I don't think it should-- maybe it just is the way of nominating, see everybody's name
shows up.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I guess-BARBARA MCMANUS: But if we-- like let's say out of the 5 candidates and 15 directors, there
is only, one of the candidates only gets two votes, well, then we vote to drop that person off, just
like we did in the past. And so then we talk about, maybe there's two folks that only get two votes
out of 15. And we decide those two to drop off. Then you have three to talk about. And then you
can do the nomination portion of it.
I think, I don't know-PEGGY CATLIN: Can I-- I personally think that since there was an agreement that we would
submit no more than three names, there is an expectation that-LYNN GUISSINGER: Where was this?
PEGGY CATLIN: --we do something in advance.

LYNN GUISSINGER: I don't know where that was.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, there was. Because first it was three, and then we said, no, let's do no
more than three.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I mean, I think that-SHELLEY COOK: Vote for the five. But we came back-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We came back to 5, and then we moved all five forward. But
you're right. But I'll bet you people are remembering three.
PEGGY CATLIN: There is an expectation, yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So I think that's where that's coming from.
PEGGY CATLIN: So I think to submit in advance the two to do a first cut, and then have
nominations and discussion would probably be, in my opinion-LYNN GUISSINGER: Again, I would say, you know, if you put it up there and you say, this
person got 12 votes but they're all second choice votes. That's not a measure of-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I didn't see them.
LYNN GUISSINGER: The other thing is, you know, we've talked about the plunking. Someone
could say, OK, I'm only going to put one person down and that artificially weights their person.
Or they could say, my second person, I'm going to pick someone I don't really think will do well
so my first person does better.
PEGGY CATLIN: Do you think people would actually do that?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, I don't know. But all I know is what we've already sent out to the
Board as instructions. And now it sounds like we're looking to change it. And that just confuses
everything. So I'll do whatever-LYNN GUISSINGER: I think that's OK, as long as we get a good, fair process.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I also think the other part of this, Miss McManus, is that this
Executive Committee is really committed, we split up the Board list and we called them all to give
them a heads up. Like once we figure this out, then we can call everybody and say, you know
what, we met, we looked at the agenda for Tuesday for the interim, and here's what we would like
to present to you. And this is what we're going to do, but we want you to know ahead of time.
And I think that they've been really appreciative of hearing from us consistently. So I think it's up
to us to determine. We did send out an email and we said, OK, send your top two choices. Don't

contact candidates. We're going to do this and this and this. So they've gotten that piece yesterday.
If we're going to change it, then we need to call them today.
PEGGY CATLIN: I wouldn't feel comfortable changing it since that email already went out, to
submit your top two.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So let me suggest this, that if they submit their top two, that we tell people
the purpose of that is to see if somebody is getting like four votes or less, and then we'll drop them
away. But we don't put up there that somebody got 12 votes if half of those are second place votes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right.
LYNN GUISSINGER: That we put, OK, all of these people. We set a cutoff. You had to get four
or five votes on that first round to make it into the nominating process.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: The other thing we can do is not reveal that, go in and do our
nominations, and look at that as well as a secondary.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Not use it?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, you know, I mean, I think that-PEGGY CATLIN: I think it's a good baseline.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It's a good baseline to work from. But I don't think we need to-do you think we need to work from it?
LYNN GUISSINGER: I would just be worried that people would say, why did we do it, if we
ignore it. I don't know. I'm just, that would be my-VINCE BUZEK: And then if we're going to give our top two, we have to say-- I think you have
to say, this is my number one choice, this is my number two choice. And you can't name the same
person twice. And both people have to actually be finalists. You can't name finalist A and Mickey
Mouse. You've got to be-- so the more clear we are, the more we don't have to-PEGGY CATLIN: I agree. Since the email went out yesterday saying two, I think we have to stick
with two.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I mean, I think we-PEGGY CATLIN: And I like yours, first and second.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I think I can clarify what we've already sent out by saying your number
one choice and your number two choice, in that order.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And it must be the five finalists.

VINCE BUZEK: They must be different people.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Different people. They cannot be the-- you cannot vote twice for
the same-SHELLEY COOK: You must submit two.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We've done it in retreats, where they put all the dots under one thing
that they want.
LYNN GUISSINGER: [INAUDIBLE] called yesterday, because he ran it before. And he said, oh,
they can sabotage it other ways. You know, somebody can put somebody they don't think can
move forward, you know. I'm not saying they will.
So what do we do with that? I mean, we still need to let people discuss, try to convince people and
have a vote. So that's sort of-PEGGY CATLIN: We need to have that dialogue.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Can we say that that's just a way of cutting off people that don't get more
than four votes or something?
SHELLEY COOK: We're saying we should suggest if there are any obvious eliminations, for
example.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Right. And that's what this process would do.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And what's an obvious elimination?
SHELLEY COOK: Somebody who gets far fewer votes than any other folks, for example.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right. Or one or two. Remember, we cut it off at one vote and
then two votes the last time.
VINCE BUZEK: There were pretty clear breakouts the last-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, there were pretty clear breakouts.
LYNN GUISSINGER: What I object to is putting-- I don't object to cutting off people below a
certain amount. I object to putting numbers next to the people. You know, this person got 12 votes,
this person got 13 votes. Because those aren't-SHELLEY COOK: If they're aggregated. So that's an important point. So we're not going to take
person X got 5 plus 2 total votes and put that as their score. That's what I think we're trying to
avoid.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, I see what you're saying. Like my first choice is so and so,
my second choice is blah, blah, blah. By the time you get through 15 people, it could be if my first
choice is this and your first choice is the same, second choices, then those go together.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, they can't be aggregated. That's taking away that vote.
SHELLEY COOK: So for what we report when we get back together on Tuesday, it's not a name
with a single number by them. Does that make sense? Because the point that Lynn made, that
you're then weighting the first and second choice evenly, and that may not be valid.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, what would you like it to look like? Because-- yeah, what would
you like it to look like?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Personally, I would say let's just set a number. Anybody who doesn't get
four first or second votes, or five first and second votes, would just drop away. But then, because
otherwise, what's the point of letting people talk?
SHELLEY COOK: OK. So I think somehow showing a column for each one, or-PEGGY CATLIN: Two columns for each one.
SHELLEY COOK: Two columns for each one.
BOTH: First and second.
SHELLEY COOK: First and second.
VINCE BUZEK: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: Two columns for each. So you put first choice, second choice, first choice.
VINCE BUZEK: --eight first place votes and no second.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So we're doing that before people talk?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, they've already made their decision.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think that's fine.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think that is, too. Because then we discuss. And then maybe
people, then we're thinking then people can nominate from the floor, right? That's kind of what we
did the first time is people put in their ideas of who they wanted. And then we talked about the
candidates. And people were talking about why they were supporting so-and-so. We had a great
discussion.
PEGGY CATLIN: But I do like the idea of going around in three minutes and--

VINCE BUZEK: Yeah, because otherwise-LYNN GUISSINGER: There had to be discussion.
PEGGY CATLIN: And no-BARBARA MCMANUS: There has to be discussion.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: There does.
VINCE BUZEK: Well, I mean, in terms of advocating for someone. But then if Peggy says, well,
I disagree, but I've already spoken. I'm sorry, you don't get to speak again. This is my turn. And
then we go on to the-- because otherwise, wait, I disagree. Oh, I agree. I disagree.
PEGGY CATLIN: But, as Lynn is suggesting, if somebody doesn't get any more than four first
place votes or whatever, then that person is eliminated from the discussion as well, which could
streamline it.
VINCE BUZEK: So maybe we do this initial discussion of winnowing first, based on these
numbers that are coming Monday and the chart that gets made up. And then the first thing we do
is say, look at the numbers, we need to drop off candidate A and B, because they got four votes.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Do we have to call everyone and say, we'll do this if everyone agrees that
they will rank their first and second and they're two different people?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I don't think so. I think the chart will show it. And there might be
something up there that says, you must vote for two people and they can't be the same people.
PEGGY CATLIN: But this will be an email beforehand. Because we've already had the two-we've already said bring your top two. And then this will clarify saying, rank them first choice and
second choice.
SHELLEY COOK: And there must be two.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And you must vote for two and they have to be different people.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And they have to be one of the five finalists.
Or two of them.
Yeah, exactly.
PEGGY CATLIN: Gosh, I can't believe that. Never mind.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Is everybody good with that?

SHELLEY COOK: So on Tuesday, we're going to present the results, then have our roundtable
discussion. Everybody gets three minutes. And then we'll do it again. Is that basically what you're
saying?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Vote again, you mean?
SHELLEY COOK: Or we'll eliminate some who don't get at least some showing, some substance
on the first-VINCE BUZEK: I think that's probably the best way to go right off the bat. I mean, if there's some
clear breaks where, you know, candidate A got one vote of any kind, well, candidate A probably
isn't going to get eight more, eight people to vote for him.
PEGGY CATLIN: I don't think you're going to persuade-- that one voter is not going to persuade
all 14 to-VINCE BUZEK: I know Lynn can be very persuasive. But she's not that good.
[LAUGHTER]
LYNN GUISSINGER: Gee, thanks, Vince.
PEGGY CATLIN: So then after that, after the discussion then we will vote again? But will we
vote for one or two?
LYNN GUISSINGER: One.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: One.
PEGGY CATLIN: Just one.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We're down to one.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think that's fine.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And if we don't get eight votes, then do we drop someone away?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Pardon?
LYNN GUISSINGER: If we don't get eight votes the first round, do we do Bob's suggestion and
drop-- you know, say there are four people still in after we put the numbers up. If we don't get
eight votes in the first vote, do we drop someone away?
VINCE BUZEK: The lowest vote getter.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: The lowest vote, is how we did it last time.

LYNN GUISSINGER: I was just clarifying to understand.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So as it progresses, whoever is the lowest vote would drop away,
right? And that's the process of elimination we did last time. And it worked really well, where we
were narrowing it down to seven or five.
PEGGY CATLIN: It just was going from five to three at that point.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I know. All right. Miss McManus, are you clear on-- OK.
Is everybody else clear? And then, we'll have a facilitator who will guide us. And Roger will be
there. So if we have questions about HR or whatever, we can ask him.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And John's familiar with the process. And he's going to be the scribe
anyway. So he'll be working with Pam.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think really some discussion of the ground rules and what's appropriate to talk
about and not to talk about.
VINCE BUZEK: Give the facilitator a taser.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So somebody's going to write up the ground rules?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, I have them for review, for you review.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And I will send them to all of you to look at them, to sign off.
PEGGY CATLIN: But it'll be fun seeing Vince go.
[LAUGHTER]
VINCE BUZEK: I'll go fishing.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, wait a minute. Is there anything else anybody else wants to
talk about before you leave?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Are we leaving too soon?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No. I don't have anything else, so unless anybody else does.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Thank you.
