BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
January 2025 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

November 14, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
December 3, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors (Board) to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for January 2025
service changes to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Martin Romero, Transit Equity Manager, Civil Rights Division
Carl Green Jr., Director of the Civil Rights Division
Jessie Carter II, Senior Manager, Service Planning and Scheduling
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 27 service changes proposed for January 2025 facilitate opportunities for bus and rail personnel to
select new work assignments and for the Service Development Division to adjust the overall operations
plan for the transit network. Additionally, with the Board’s adoption of the Reimagine RTD System
Optimization Plan (SOP), several of the service change proposals reflect the first phases of SOP
implementation to provide the best possible value to customers.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard
to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Service Equity Analysis Requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The January 2025 service

Packet Pg. 3

1.D.1

change proposal includes eight major service changes out of 27 total changes. Thus, an analysis is
required to be brought before the Board for its consideration. The complete Title VI Service Equity
Analysis report is included in Attachment A.
Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy:
A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the service hours of any route that
would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service changes will be subject to an equity
analysis.
Title VI Policies:
• Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
•

Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

DISCUSSION
Staff proposes changes to 22 bus routes, two FlexRide zones, and three rail lines commencing January
2025. Of these changes, eight services have proposed additions to service 25% greater than that of
baseline service and thus meet established thresholds for a major service change. Those routes are
shown in bold in the following table.

Methodology: Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line
level, route/line block group, and network level to identify any potential disparities in service changes
based on race/ethnicity or income.

Packet Pg. 4

1.D.1

Summary of Findings:
• Potential disparate impacts and disproportionate burdens were identified at the individual route
level: of the eight bus routes with major service changes (Routes 35, 49, 83D, 100, 139, AB1,
FF5, and LD1), three routes (Routes 100, AB1, and LD1) had a potential disparate impact finding,
and one route (Route 139) had a potential disproportionate burden finding.
o Route 100 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving
0.42% less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 0.03%
more benefit than non-low-income populations.
o Route 139 has a potential disproportionate burden finding due to low-income populations
receiving 0.18% less benefit than non-low-income populations. Minority populations
receive 0.18% more benefit than non-minority populations.
o Route AB1 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving
0.39% less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 1.09%
more benefit than non-low-income populations.
o Route LD1 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving
0.21% less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 0.05%
more benefit than non-low-income populations.
o While not considered a major service change, the truncation of the Route 1 impacts equity
(i.e., minority and low-income) populations more than non-equity (i.e., non-minority and
non-low-income) populations. Minority populations are impacted 0.53% more than nonminority populations. Additionally, low-income populations are impacted 1.01% more than
non-low-income populations. Truncation of the Route 44 also has a potential
disproportionate burden finding due to low-income populations being impacted 1.0% more
than non-low-income populations (whereas populations are impacted 0.09% less than nonminority populations). On the other hand, the merger of segments from Routes 1 and 44
into the 1/44E Art District Connector had no potential findings and will maintain service
availability to the truncated portions of the Routes 1 and 44.
•

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate, at the network level, to
determine overall impacts to equity populations compared to non-equity populations. At the
network level, minority populations stand to benefit more than non-minority populations (10.61%
vs. 10.32% respectively). This difference does not meet the disparate impact threshold of
9.29%. Therefore, no system-level disparate impact finding is found with the proposed major
service increases. Low-income populations stand to benefit more than non-low-income
populations (12.8% vs. 9.89%, respectively). The difference does not meet the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold of 8.9%. Therefore, no system-level disproportionate burden is
found with the proposed major service increases.

Conclusions:
Although three major service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact and one major service
change resulted in a potential disproportionate burden at the route level, staff recommends the January
2025 service plan as proposed, as there are no practical alternatives to avoid, minimize, or mitigate the
potential disparate impacts and disproportionate burden. Additionally, the network-level analysis provides
holistic understanding of changes to service levels for Title VI-protected populations across the service

Packet Pg. 5

1.D.1

area compared to the route level. The analysis revealed no network-level findings. In fact, both minority
and low-income populations stand to benefit more at the network level from the major service changes
than non-minority and non-low-income populations. All eight bus routes facing major service changes
serve higher than average low-income populations, and three of the routes serve higher than average
minority populations with only three improvements (specifically, to the Routes 100, AB1 and LD1)
serving areas with relatively low minority populations as compared to non-minority populations.
Improving service on these routes does not raise concerns of inequitable distribution of benefits given
the results of the network-level analysis indicating that Title VI concerns are minimal (0.42%, 0.18%,
0.39% and 0.21%, respectively).
In adopting this report, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community
Value while maintaining compliance with Title VI federal regulations. RTD will continue to assess the
equity implications for all subsequent service change proposals and will propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

1.D.1.a

Executive Summary
This document summarizes the analysis of major service changes proposed for January 2025 to ensure that
the changes will not inequitably impact minority and low-income populations.

Methodology
RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group levels to identify
any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes
RTD proposes changes to 22 bus routes, two FlexRide zones and three rail lines of RTD’s forthcoming
January 2025 service change. Of this change, eight services meet established thresholds for a major service
change. The service tabulated below has proposed adjustments that were greater than 25% of baseline service
and are proposed for the long-term (will remain in effect for 12 or more months).
Route Modification
(one service)

Route 35: As described in the SOP, segment reinstated east of Englewood
Station to Nine Mile Station primarily along Hampden Avenue
Route 49: Daily service frequency increased to 30 minutes throughout the
service day; service span expanded to extend to 11 p.m. on weekdays, to
commence at 5 a.m. and extend through 11 p.m. on Saturdays, and to
commence at 6 a.m. and extend through 8 p.m. on Sundays
Route 83D: Weekday midday and evening service increased to 30-minute
frequency
Route 100: Service frequency increased between Federal Center Station (W
Line) and Arvada Ridge Station (G Line)

Service Increases
(seven services)

Route 139: Service spans expanded to extend two hours later on weekdays and
to commence one hour earlier and extend two hours later on Saturdays and
Sundays
Route AB1: AB2 trips reinstated from Downtown Boulder Station; daily service
increased to 30-minute frequency throughout the service day
Route FF5: 3:02 p.m. eastbound trip added from Downtown Boulder Station to
Anschutz; 2:45 p.m. westbound FF5 trip shifted to 2:30 p.m.; eastbound 4:02
p.m. trip added to interline with current westbound trip at 5:15 p.m.
Route LD1: Two morning and two afternoon/evening peak trips added from
Bross St/8th Ave to Denver Union Station in each direction

Minor Service Changes
The service tabulated below has proposed adjustments that were less than 25% of baseline service. This includes
one route merger proposal that, while not currently included in the major service change policy, represents a
significant change to the alignments of two bus routes. Other adjustments include service increases under the
major service change threshold and schedule timing changes.

Schedule Timing
(Five services)

Route 42: Running time adjustments due to changes on Route 45
Route 52: Schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance for all
service days
Route 65: Schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance for all
service days
Route 76: Schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance on
weekdays
NB: Minor changes to weekday schedule to account for class start/end times at
Boulder High and Nederland High, as well as operational hours at Eldora Ski
Resort
D Line: Schedule adjustments due to ongoing maintenance work

Service Increase
(Six services)

Route 24: Service spans expanded to extend two hours later on weekdays,
and commence one hour earlier extend and two hours later on Saturdays and
Sundays
Route 73: Daily service span increased to provide later evening trips
Route 205/205T: Tripper service added to address overloads on Route BOLT
due to increase in Boulder High School usage
Route 208: School tripper service added to address overloads on the regular
scheduled 7:51 a.m. westbound trip due to increase in Boulder High School
usage
E Line: Reinstatement of 15-minute frequency (temporary change)
H Line: Reinstatement of 15-minute frequency (temporary change)

Route Adjustment
(Seven services)

Route 1: Service east of 17th/18th Streets truncated and rerouted to Civic
Center Station via Broadway/Lincoln. The new routing would serve the current
alignment between Lakewood Commons and 17th/Stout.
Route 15: Routing updated to reflect a current detour, which removes access
to the stop at 13th Avenue/Lisbon Street, due to inability to reliably and in the
safest manner, resume westbound operations after serving the stop. Service to
13th Avenue/Lisbon Street bus stop will start as soon as the traffic signal is
completed at Colfax Avenue/Picadilly Street.
Route 44: Service east of 17th/18th Streets truncated and rerouted service to
Civic Center Station via Broadway/Lincoln. The new routing would serve the
current alignment between Wheat Ridge/Ward Road Station and 17th/California
Streets.
Route 45: Routing updated to reflect ongoing westbound detour related to left
turn at unsignalized intersection from Ireland St onto 56th Ave. Buses will
operate in a loop via Maxwell, right on Dunkirk, right on 56th Ave and right on
Ireland. Buses will serve the same stops on Ireland St, Dunkirk and 56th Ave in
both directions. Original routing will be restored when a traffic signal at the
intersection is installed and operable
Route 1E/44 (Art District Connector): Eastern portion of the Route 1 and
Route 44 combined, connecting the Baker and Five Points neighborhoods from
Alameda Station to 40th/Colorado Station; the western portions of the Routes 1
(Lakewood Commons to Civic Center Station) and 44 (Wheat Ridge/Ward
Station to Civic Center Station) retained into downtown Denver, with the new
merged routing renamed as the ART Connector
NBFX (Broomfield North FlexRide): Boundaries expanded to include a new
area
ILFX (Interlocken/Westmoor FlexRide): Service boundaries expanded to
include a new affordable housing development

Findings
Major service changes included in the 27 proposed January 2025 service changes include route adjustments
as well as service increases to eight bus routes. Of the eight routes with major service changes, three serve
populations that are above the district average of minority populations, and all eight serve populations that are
above the district average for low-income populations.
When considering the demographics within the service area (within a quarter mile) of the major service increases
and as a proportion to the district overall, low-income populations receive a higher increase in service
(i.e., were more positively impacted) compared to non-low-income populations. Low-income areas received
2.92% more of a benefit than non-low-income areas. This difference is above the 10% minimum threshold.
Minority areas received more of an increase in service (i.e., were more positively impacted) compared to
non-minority populations. Minority areas benefitted 0.29% more than non-minority areas, a difference above
the 10% threshold.
Finally, potential disparate impact findings were identified at the route level for the changes proposed for
Routes 100, AB1 and LD1 and a potential disproportionate burden for Route 139.

Service Equity Analysis: January 2025

1.D.1.a

Introduction
Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver region.
An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit service without
regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact
on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that are proposed to occur between the
current and proposed runboards. Routes with major service changes include one major increase and one
reinstatement of a formerly suspended route pattern. These changes and all others have been reviewed
individually at the route/line level and in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential impacts to the
communities RTD serves.

Service Change Philosophy

An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD. These
changes include the addition of new routes/lines, the elimination of existing routes/lines and changes to the
alignment and trip frequency within existing routes/lines. RTD has established principles to identify the service
changes needed to meet the diverse travel needs of those within the district and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system.

Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes (Family of Services) depending on service type, route
alignment and frequency. Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all
routes within each class. RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in
ridership and operational performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify
services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as
warranted. In keeping with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish
performance metrics used to identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses
these metrics to identify a series of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of the proposed major
service changes on minority populations and low-income households at or below 150 percent of the Department
of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies

Based on requirements within FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD, as an agency receiving federal funding,
must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy.
Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity
and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service
changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes,
but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects
and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10
percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150%
of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and

RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources and Methodology
Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5Year Estimates for years 2018 to 2022 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level. Other data
related to the analysis includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into
a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with changes in service at a
geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts to district equity communities.
The equity analysis for the January 2025 service change looked at whether an individual bus route’s or rail
line’s major service changes impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the
proportional difference in changes made to equity populations within a quarter-mile service area of a bus route
or rail line. These proportional differences were compared against district population proportions of equity
populations and route/line proportions of equity populations.
Low-income status for population within the district is derived from Census Bureau population estimates and is
based on 150% of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services
guidelines), based on local context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of three. Minority status
is based on the non-white and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area is based on the
collection of block groups wholly or partially within district boundaries.
Route/line service area population is determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area is then used to calculate the percentage overlap of block groupbased population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contains 100% of the underlying block group,
100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block group
was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
RTD calculates the net change in service hours for each route/line proposal to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change meeting or exceeding a 25% change (either positive or negative) from
baseline is flagged as a major service change for further review.

Public Outreach Overview
Three public meetings were conducted October 21-22, 2024. The comments collected on service changes during
these meetings are summarized in the table below. Table 1 captures the meeting locations, dates, number of

There was a total of 1,289 responses on the proposed service changes, with 65% indicating a very positive
impact and 20% indicating a somewhat positive impact. See below for route-specific feedback:
•

Route AB1: Received strong support with 87% finding it very positive and 11% somewhat positive

•

Route 35: Positive response with 72% very positive and 16% somewhat positive

•

Route 49: Mixed feedback with 40% very positive and 30% somewhat positive, but 10% very
negative

•

Route 83D: Generally well-received with 61% very positive and 28% somewhat positive

•

Route 100: Mixed reviews; 59% very positive, 18% somewhat positive, and a combined 18%
negative

•

Route 139: Predominantly positive at 60% somewhat positive, though 20% noted a very negative
impact

•

Route FF5: Mostly positive, with 41% very positive, 32% somewhat positive, and 12% negative

•

Route LD1: Highly favorable with 53% very positive and 36% somewhat positive, and minimal
negative feedback

Overall, the feedback reflects substantial support for the proposed changes, with a few areas where impacts
are more mixed.
Additionally, the Transit Equity Office collaborated with Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) to share
information on service changes and encourage customer feedback on the proposed changes to the routes.
Through this partnership, three CBOs attended a total of nine events, directly reaching 944 community members.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden

comparison. Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their identification within the prior
(current) network using 2018-2022 American Community Survey (ACS) five-year demographic data.
A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to review the routes/lines individually. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the district. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of Disparate Impact (for minority populations) or Disproportionate Burden (for low-income populations) and was
flagged for a potential finding of impact.

Major Service Change Test
Identify routes with proposed major service changes (based on trips or hours) of 25% or more

Changes by Transit Mode

For the January 2025 runboard, 22 fixed-route bus routes and three rail lines will undergo various service
changes. Of these, 12 routes will see combined increases in bus service of over 407 total weekday revenue
service hours and 541 additional weekend service hours.1 While not considered a major service change
under current policy, the proposal to merge portions of Routes 1 and 44 represents a significant change in
alignment and service patterns. Service increases on other routes include additional service frequencies and
spans of service (longer hours of service) on several routes both for weekday and weekend service.

Major Service Change Review

A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases (service increases of 25% or more related to new or restructured service)

Major Service Change Reductions
There are no major service reductions proposed for the proposed January 2025 runboard.

1 The reinstatement of 15-minute frequency on the E and H Lines are not noted here as an increase in service hours given that their

baseline frequency prior to ongoing maintenance projects (notably, the Coping Panel project and Downtown Rail Reconstruction project
in 2024) was 15 minutes. Thus, there is no change in service hours.

1.D.1.a

Major Service Change Increases

Eight bus routes had proposed major service increases which include service increases of 25% or greater.
Improved headways and spans of service are proposed on Routes 49, 83D, 100, 139, AB1, FF5 and LD1 for the
January 2025 service change. The proposed segment reinstatement of the Route 35 is outlined in the RTD
Board approval of the System Optimization Plan (SOP).

Other Changes

While not currently included within major service change policies, the proposal to truncate Routes 1 and 44 at
Civic Center Station and combine those truncated segments into the new 1E/44 (Art District Connector) route
represents a significant change in alignment and service patterns. While the truncation may impact some
customers who previously rode through downtown to the respective route ends, data supporting the proposal
indicates potential improvements in trips for customers who formerly had to transfer to complete the new route
pattern as well as improved service to and through downtown Denver.

Route- and Line-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route/line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (DI) and/or
Disproportionate Burdens (DB). Both service reductions and service increases are analyzed. For service
increases, the analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority
and low-income populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse
effects of the reductions are disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.

Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the district’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were reviewed
for potential DI or DB findings. For service increases, the following analysis examines the extent to which the
benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and low-income populations. Because these are proposed
service increases, protected populations falling below these thresholds are flagged for potential concerns. The
narrative analysis of each individual line follows, which includes further considerations of access to jobs,
education, health care, food and social services for minority and low-income populations.

Route 35
Proposal: Segment reinstated east of Englewood Station to Nine Mile Station primarily along Hampden Avenue,
as described in the Systems Optimization Plan.
As shown in Table 3, a slightly higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from
the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (0.98% vs. 0.79%,
respectively). This difference does not meet the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.71%). Therefore, no
potential route-level disproportionate burden is found. Additionally, a higher percentage of the district’s minority
population benefits from the proposed major service decrease as compared to the non-minority population
(1.10% vs. 0.65%, respectively). This difference does not meet the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.58%).
Thus, there is no potential disparate impact found at the route level requiring further examination (i.e., access
to key public service destinations, community engagement and network level analysis).

Proposal: Two morning and two afternoon/evening peak trips added from Bross St/8th Ave to Denver Union

As shown in Table 10, a slightly higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit
from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (1.13% vs. 1.08%,
respectively). This difference does not meet the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.98%). Therefore, no
potential route-level disproportionate burden is found. A lower percentage of the district’s minority population
benefits from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-minority population (0.96% vs.
1.17%, respectively). This difference meets the 10% disparate impact threshold (1.05%). Thus, there is a
potential disparate impact found at the route level requiring further examination (i.e., access to key public
service destinations, community engagement and network level analysis).

Analysis of Minor Service Change
A route level analysis for minor service changes is atypical in RTD’s equity analyses but was performed to
understand the potential impacts to minority and low-income populations currently served by Routes 1 and 44
and to provide supplemental information for the January 2025 service change. Because of the truncation of
these routes prior to a merger and the potential for new transfers, proposals on the extent routes are considered
service decreases. The merged segments creating the 1E/44 (Art District Connector) is considered a service
increase. As with major service changes analyses, the demographics of each route were reviewed for potential
DI or DB findings.

Route 1
Proposal: As described in the SOP, service east of 17th/18th Streets truncated and rerouted to Civic Center Station
via Broadway/Lincoln. The new routing would serve the current alignment between Lakewood Commons and
17th/Stout
For the purposes of this analysis and as a conservative measure, this proposal is assumed as a service decrease
due to possibility of forced transfers at Civic Center Station. As shown in Table 11, a slightly higher percentage
of the district’s low-income population stands to be impacted from the proposed major service decrease as
compared to the non-low-income population (2.13% vs. 1.12%, respectively). This difference meets the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold (1.23%). Therefore, a potential route-level disproportionate burden is found.
Additionally, a higher percentage of the district’s minority population is impacted from the proposed major service
decrease as compared to the non-minority population (1.61% vs. 1.08%, respectively). This difference meets

For the purposes of this analysis and as a conservative measure, this proposal is assumed as a service decrease

of the district’s low-income population stands to be impacted from the proposed major service decrease as

Additionally, a lower percentage of the district’s minority population stands to be impacted from the proposed
major service decrease as compared to the non-minority population (1.64% vs. 1.74%, respectively). This
difference meets the 10% disparate impact threshold (1.91%). Thus, there is no potential disparate impact
found at the route level requiring further examination (i.e., access to key public service destinations, community

New 1E/44 Art District Connector Route
Proposal: Eastern portion of the Route 1 and Route 44 combined, connecting the Baker and Five Points
neighborhoods from Alameda Station to 40th/Colorado Station; the western portions of the Routes 1
(Lakewood Commons to Civic Center Station) and 44 (Wheatridge-Ward Station to Civic Center Station)
retained into downtown Denver, with the new merged routing renamed as the ART Connector, as described in
the RTD Board-approved Systems Optimization Plan. Under current policy, this change is not considered a
Major Service Change.
As shown in Table 13, a higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the
proposed merger as compared to the non-low-income population (2.02% vs. 0.90%, respectively). This
difference does not meet the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.81%). Therefore, no potential routelevel disproportionate burden is found. Additionally, a higher percentage of the district’s minority population
benefits from the proposed merger as compared to the non-minority population (1.31% vs. 0.92%, respectively).
This difference does not meet the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.83%). Thus, there is no potential disparate
impact found at the route level requiring further examination (i.e., access to key public service destinations,
community engagement and network level analysis), and the creation of the 1E/44 helps maintain service
availability following the truncation of the Routes 1 and 44.

Systemwide Analysis
In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program Update, a systemwide analysis is required in addition to routeand line-level analyses. A system level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for
Title VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring
further review. Once average district thresholds for low-income and minority populations are established,
subsequent equity analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service
changes of 25% or greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major
service changes experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes
with major service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group
levels (block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•

Systemwide, bus service increases by over 407 weekday revenue hours and 541 weekend hours
Of the nearly 320,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes, equity
populations represented a higher share of population compared to district averages. Of this total, over
55,000 people with low incomes and nearly 122,000 people in minority communities would receive service
improvements.

1.D.1.a

•

At the systemwide level, equity routes and non-equity routes2 were compared only for those with major
service changes. All bus routes serve higher than average low-income populations. Of the eight bus
routes with major service changes, three serve higher than average minority populations.

In review of the proposed major service changes at the systemwide level, there are no potential
disparate impact or disproportionate burden findings.
An analysis was conducted of all district block groups and their service levels to establish the baseline equity
thresholds for low-income and minority populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of
the September 2024 to January 2025 service changes. Block groups with low-income and minority
populations at or above the district average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas
non-low-income and non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (14.2%) and
minority population (37.5%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in population for equity
versus non-equity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for potential
adverse impacts.

There are 2,197 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District.3 Using the 2018-2022
Five-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the total
minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the District-wide lowincome and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average.
While the percent minority figure of 37.5% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.064
million), the low-income population percentage of 14.2% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure
(3.02 million). This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine.4
The thresholds summarized in Table 14 yielded 824 (37.5% of all) block groups above the district average for
low-income population, and 846 (38.5%) block groups above the district average for minority population.

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate by transit mode to determine overall impacts
to underlying population. Table 15 summarizes the change in service for total block group populations

2018-2022 Five-Year ACS estimates were used for population identification.
3 Some block groups are not completely contained within district boundaries due to differences in boundaries between the District and
Census-defined geographies.
4 The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total population due to the inability
of the Census to determine income for everyone estimated to reside in a particular block group.

populations stand to benefit more than non-minority populations (10.61% vs. 10.32% respectively).
This difference does not meet the disparate impact threshold of 9.29%. Therefore, no system-level disparate
impact finding is found with the proposed major service increases. Low-income populations stand to
benefit more than non-low-income populations (12.8% vs. 9.89%, respectively). The difference does not

Summary of Findings
The systemwide service modifications proposed between September 2024 and January 2025 include
schedule improvements, expansions of service spans, alignment changes, and additional trips on regional routes.
Eight major service changes include those for Routes 35, 49, 83D, 100, 139, AB1, FF5, and LD1.
Route-level Findings:
•
•

•

•

•

•

Of the 27 total services with proposed changes, taken individually, 4 had potential DI or DB findings.
Route 100 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving 0.42%
less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 0.03% more benefit than
non-low-income populations.
Route 139 has a potential disproportionate burden finding due to low-income populations
receiving 0.18% less benefit than non-low-income populations. Minority populations receive 0.18% more
benefit than non-minority populations.
Route AB1 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving 0.39%
less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 1.09% more benefit than
non-low-income populations.
Route LD1 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving 0.21%
less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 0.05% more benefit than
non-low-income populations.
Additionally, while not considered major service changes, the truncation of the Route 1 impacts equity
(i.e., minority and low-income) populations more than non-equity (i.e., non-minority and non-lowincome) populations. Minority populations are impacted 0.53% more than non-minority populations.
Additionally, low-income populations are impacted 1.01% more than non-low-income populations.
Truncation of the Route 44 also has a potential disproportionate burden finding due to low-income
populations being impacted 1.0% more than non-low-income populations (whereas populations are
impacted 0.09% less than non-minority populations). On the other hand, the merger of segments from
Routes 1 and 44 into the 1E/44 Art District Connector had no potential findings and will maintain service
availability to the truncated portions of the Routes 1 and 44.

Table 16 summarizes major service changes by change type, provides findings of potential disparate impacts
and disproportionate burdens based on a comparative difference analysis, and it provides the individual route
service change.

Systemwide-level Findings:
•
•

Routes 35, 49, 83D, 100, 139, AB1, FF5, and LD1 comprise the January 2025 runboard’s major service
changes.
Almost 320,000 people live within a quarter mile of bus stops on routes with major service increases.
Both minority and low-income populations are represented at higher shares of the population than district
averages (38.2% and 17.7%, respectively). Low-income populations received a slightly higher
benefit (were more positively impacted) compared to non-low-income populations. Lowincome areas benefited 2.92% more compared to non-low-income areas. Minority populations
received a higher benefit (were more positively impacted) compared to non-minority
populations. Minority areas benefited 0.29% more compared to non-minority areas.

Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether there is an alternative
that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or disproportionate burden on
low-income customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals.
Title VI concerns are minimal with the proposed January 2025 service change proposal. Although three major
service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact and one major service change resulted in a
disproportionate burden at the route level, RTD recommends keeping the January 2025 service plan as proposed
as there are no practical alternatives to avoid, minimize or mitigate the disparate impacts and disproportionate
burden. As noted in the route-level findings, improving service on these routes (100, 139, AB1 and LD1) does
not raise concerns of inequitable distribution of benefits given the minimal differences (0.42%, 0.18%, 0.39%
and 0.21%, respectively) between the comparator groups.
Additionally, the network-level analysis provides holistic understanding of changes to service levels for Title VIprotected populations across the service area compared to the route level. The analysis revealed no network
level findings. In fact, both minority and low-income populations stand to benefit more at the network

level from the major service changes than non-minority and non-low-income populations. All eight
bus routes facing major service changes serve higher than average low-income populations, and three of the
routes serve higher than average minority populations with only three improvements (specifically, to the Routes
100, AB1 and LD1) serving areas with relatively low minority populations as compared to non-minority
populations.

Routing updated to reflect a current detour, which removes access to the stop
at 13th Avenue/Lisbon Street, due to inability to reliably and in the safest
manner, resume westbound operations after serving the stop. Service to 13 th
Avenue-Lisbon Street bus stop will start as soon as the traffic signal is
completed at Colfax Avenue/Picadilly Street

Route 44 would be combined into a new route service, connecting the Baker
and Five Points neighborhoods from Alameda Station to 40th/Colorado Station
and thereby connecting the Santa Fe Arts District, the Denver Theatre District
and the RiNo Arts District, inspiring the ART route name. The western portions
of the Routes 1 (Lakewood Commons to Civic Center Station) and 44 (Wheat
Ridge/Ward Station to Civic Center Station) would be retained at current
service levels

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
January 2025 Service Change

November 13, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
December 3, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the January 2025 Service Change as revised and summarized in
Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators impacted by the service changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
In alignment with the service change and work shift process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) shared between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union 1001 (ATU), the January
2025 service change process facilitates both an opportunity for bus and rail operators to select new
work assignments and for Service Development staff to adjust the operations plan for RTD’s transit
network.
DISCUSSION
Considering the current staffing levels and anticipated attrition, the January 2025 Service Change
recommendations were designed with careful consideration toward the availability of staff. The
recommendations are centered on continued System Optimization Plan (SOP) implementation, the
restoration of services and system capacity, and improving system performance and reliability by way of
service enhancements, reductions, and adjustments.
The January 2025 service change recommendation contains several SOP-related increases. Among the
more notable changes are:
•
A restructure and combination of segments on Routes 1, 1E/44, and 44
•
Increases to spans of service on Routes 24, and 73
•
Increases to service frequency on Routes 49, 105, and AB
•
Reinstatement of the eastern segment of Route 35 along Hampden Avenue
•
Reinstatement of 15-minute service on the E and H light rail lines, based upon progress achieved
in ongoing rail maintenance projects in the Southeast Corridor

Packet Pg. 72

1.D.2

Following RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Customer Excellence, and
recognizing the agency’s people power constraints, the proposals herein are directed at improving ontime performance, maintaining compliance with RTD’s CBA with ATU, and adjusting service levels to
match ridership demand.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on RTD Service Standards
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit-dependent markets
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the district and family of services, and the ability to enhance
service when possible
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, there is no disparate impact on a minority population nor a disproportionate
burden on a low-income population
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
The service changes summarized below are further detailed in Attachment A.
The service changes with impacts from the SOP and full SOP are outlined in Attachment B.
Summary of Public Outreach
Between September 27 and October 31, 2024, staff reached out to the community via public meetings,
civic and non-profit organizations, and direct contact efforts at bus stops and rail stations. Additionally,
an updated feedback process was employed to collect customer input by impacted route or line. Written
communications, survey data, and public comments collected during this public comment period have
been summarized and listed in Attachment C of this report.
Revisions to Preliminary Modifications
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service modifications are communicated to the Board. Depending on the outcome of the
public comment process and continued analysis, staff may recommend additional revisions to these
initial modifications. The following modifications have been added or significantly revised:
Route 11 – Mississippi Crosstown – schedule adjustment affecting eastbound evening trip
Route NB – Boulder/Nederland/Eldora – schedule adjustment to better coordinate with bell times for
Boulder and Nederland schools
SERVICE CHANGE SUMMARY
SOP-Related Changes
The following recommended changes are reflective of service provision as contemplated in the SOP, the
comprehensive operational analysis of RTD’s transit network services adopted by the Board of Directors
on July 26, 2022, as a component of Reimagine RTD:

Bus Service

Route 1E/44 – Art District Connector
As described in the SOP as the 1/44E, eastern segments of the Route 1 and Route 44 combined
into a new route service, connecting the Baker and Five Points neighborhoods from Alameda
Station to 40th/Colorado Station, and thereby connecting the Santa Fe Arts District, the Denver
Theatre District and the RiNo Arts District, inspiring the route name. Western portions of the
Routes 1 (Lakewood Commons to Civic Center Station) and 44 (Wheat Ridge/Ward Station to
Civic Center Station) retained at current service levels.
Anticipated cost: Reallocation of resources from Routes 1 and 44
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue
Eastbound afternoon schedule adjusted, shifting the current 3:58 p.m. trip to leave 5 minutes
earlier 3:53 p.m. from Broadway I-25 Station. This change better coordinates with bell times at
Denver South High School.
Anticipated cost: No anticipated impacts
Route 15 – East Colfax Avenue
Routing updated to reflect a current detour, which removes access to the stop at 13th Avenue
and Lisbon Street, due to inability to reliably and in the safest manner, resume westbound
operations after serving the stop. Service to 13th Avenue and Lisbon Street bus stop to commence
as soon as the traffic signal is completed at Colfax Avenue and Picadilly Street.
Anticipated cost: No anticipated impacts

As described in the SOP, the former segment east of Englewood Station to Nine Mile Station
reinstated along Hampden Avenue.
Anticipated cost: 5.5 FTE weekday, Saturday and Sunday/holidays

Schedule adjustments due to changes on Route 45, since the routes are interlined (trips
integrated).
Anticipated cost: No anticipated impacts
Route 44 – 44th Avenue
As described in the SOP, service east of 17th/18th Streets truncated and rerouted to Civic Center
Station via Broadway/Lincoln; this routing serves the current alignment between Wheat

and Arvada Ridge Station (G Line), using the existing routing primarily along Kipling Street.
Anticipated cost: 4 FTE weekdays

and Sundays.

Attachment: 2025 Service Changes-Attachment A (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

Routing update to reflect ongoing westbound detour related to left turn at unsignalized
intersection from Ireland Street onto 56th Avenue. Buses will operate in a loop via Maxwell Place,

replace the former AB2 while Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station remains closed.
Anticipated cost: 2 FTE weekday, 2 FTE Saturday and 2 FTE Sunday/holiday
Route FF5 – Downtown Boulder/ Anschutz
Consistent with the System Optimization Plan (SOP), eastbound trips from Downtown Boulder

Dear RTD Board Chairperson Davidson and General Manager Johnson,
The City of Boulder appreciates our long-standing partnership with RTD in supporting and
advancing regional and local transit services. We are encouraged by the latest trends in
ridership return after the pandemic and RTD’s growing operator workforce that is allowing the
addition of bus service in January 2025 as subscribed by the System Optimization Plan (SOP).
The proposed January 2025 service additions will greatly improve mobility options for travelers
throughout the Denver metro area, including University of Colorado students, Denver
International Airport employees and travelers, Anshutz Medical Center essential workers and
visitors, and many others traveling within and to and from Boulder.
In addition to supporting these expanded service offerings, the city seeks to reiterate through
this public comment period the critical need to return bus service at Boulder Junction. As
context, the city and RTD financially partnered on the development of the Boulder Junction
Depot Station which opened in 2015 and features an underground passenger lobby, six (6) bus
bays, public restrooms, and a customer service kiosk in a car-light district. Concerted efforts

1.D.2.c

Before the pandemic, six (6) RTD bus routes connected at Boulder Junction Depot Station, yet
service at Boulder Junction has been suspended since the implementation of the RTD COVID19 Service Plan in April 2020. The SOP calls for the restoration of Flatiron Flyer and AB
Airport/Boulder services, critical regional routes that allow workers, students, and visitors from
across the metro area to rapidly travel between Denver Civic Center Station, the US-36
corridor, DIA, and Boulder Junction. We are requesting a plan and timeline for the return of
bus service at and the reopening of Boulder Junction, and we are interested in partnering,
including with a potential city HOP route realignment to the station, to help make this a
success. A schedule for service return and the station’s reopening would greatly help address
community questions, preserve and build ridership demand, and further bolster community
support for RTD. We hope this can be accomplished quickly.
Thank you for your consideration, and please feel free to contact me to further discuss.
Sincerely,

Aaron Brockett

Dear Chair Davidson,

Attachment: January 2025 Attachment C (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

RE: January 2025 Proposed RTD Service Changes

The City and County of Broomfield is pleased to express its support for the proposed January service changes that improve service delivery on
the AB1, LD1, FF5, North Broomfield FlexRide (NBFX), and Interlocken/Westmoor Flexride (ILFX).
The AB1 is a very important RTD service among Broomfield residents. Broomfield staff frequently hear about capacity issues and limited
service hours. Reinstating a 30-minute frequency in the mornings and evenings on weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays/holidays, along with
later service hours on weekdays, would be greatly appreciated by RTD customers in Broomfield.

The LD3 service currently operates with a one-hour frequency between Longmont and Broomfield, requiring a transfer at Broomfield Station
to access Denver Union Station, making it a less viable option for local and regional travel. We therefore strongly support the proposed
addition of two morning and two evening trips on the LD1 for one-seat trips between Longmont and Denver and encourage RTD to continue to
increase the overall frequency and convenience on this important regional connector.
Furthermore, Broomfield commends RTD’s efforts to phase in the restoration of services on the Flatiron Flyer, a critical link between
communities in the Northwest Denver Metro Region. The proposed additional FF5 trips would support commuters, students, and residents
needing to access medical services at Anschutz.

Broomfield has a growing population of residents within vulnerable demographic groups who need transportation options that are safe,
reliable, and affordable. The North Broomfield and Interlocken/Westmoor FlexRide services address this need by providing a convenient and
affordable mode of transportation that can be used to access medical appointments, grocery stores, and community resources. As such, we
strongly support the proposed service boundary expansion of the North Broomfield FlexRide that will increase resident’s access to the larger
community. This expansion may also help alleviate the high rate of denials on the Broomfield FlexRide, which is currently one in four.
Broomfield kindly requests that RTD consider expanding the proposed North Broomfield service boundary to include the Broomfield Civic
Campus so that north Broomfield residents can access community resources, including the Broomfield Community Center for wellness
activities and affordable meals, Senior Services, Library, Motor Vehicle, Workforce Center and Health and Human Services. Broomfield also
appreciates and strongly supports the proposed service boundary adjustment of the Interlocken/Westmoor FlexRide to include recently
constructed income-aligned housing and the larger Via Varra neighborhood, thereby improving access for these residents to shopping and
employment opportunities.

Lastly, Broomfield continues to encourage RTD to support the impacted riders of the suspended Route 128 by expanding the operational
capacity of the Broomfield Flexride. It also remains a top priority to restore Broomfield's transit access to Wagon Road Park-and-Ride and the
Eastlake and 124th N-Line Station with convenient and reliable options. Broomfield looks forward to continuing to partner with RTD to
optimize service, operations, and connections to regional transit facilities.

In summary, the proposed service changes are needed and appreciated investments to restore access to transit in Broomfield, which has been
significantly reduced since April 2020, to support community needs for transit options for all ages, abilities, and incomes. By supporting our
residents and expanding regional access, we are ensuring that the Broomfield community and the Denver metro region remain strong,
vibrant, and inclusive. Broomfield commends RTD for the proposed service changes and urges RTD to move forward with these proposals.
Sincerely,

Guyleen Castriotta, Mayor of the City & County of Broomfield

Dear RTD Staff:

First, we are pleased to see expanded service for the AB (SkyRide) bus, one of the most popular
RTD bus routes and one that is consistently experiencing standing-room-only service. We also
appreciate the increased service on routes 205, 208, and NB recognizing the increased ridership
of Boulder and Nederland High School students thanks to Zero Fare for Youth.
The service increase for the well-used FF5 route from downtown Boulder to Anschutz is also
very impactful, as this offers riders an important regional connection. We would similarly like to
see additional service added to the popular FF2 express route between downtown Boulder and
Denver Union Station, as we have received numerous requests for additional regional express
service from employees in both Boulder and Denver.
Second, we remain concerned about the lack of service to Boulder Junction. While commuter
behavior has changed since 2020, Boulder Junction has continued to grow, with more than 25
businesses now in the district, as well as 2,000 residents and 2,400 employees with diverse
needs and incomes, all of whom have access to free EcoPasses. Boulder Junction and its RTD
station have the potential to serve as a vibrant model for the rest of the state following the
passage of HB24-1313, but until reasonable transit service is restored to the station, other
communities that are considering investing in dense, mixed-used TOD’s such as Boulder
Junction, are understandably very reluctant and concerned to do so without assurances that
reliable and regular transit service will be in place for residents and employees in these areas.
RTD’s System Optimization Plan (SOP) clearly shows the demand for transit to Boulder Junction
as part of the Core, Connect, and Commute Routes. The SOP, in particular, calls out the demand
for AB (SkyRide) service to and from Boulder Junction. Our team is also currently conducting a
transit demand assessment survey in the Boulder Junction neighborhood, and we look forward
to sharing the results with RTD staff later this year. We hope that the results of this survey can
be taken into account for RTD’s May 2025 service changes.
Third, the service changes indicate a resumption of AB2 service to Denver International Airport,
but currently call for this service to start in downtown Boulder and travel down Canyon and 28 th
Street. We would like to see RTD explore ways to allow Boulder Junction residents and workers
to board the AB2 in the Boulder Junction neighborhood. The Park-n-Ride at Boulder Junction
also makes this a very practical and convenient location for residents from Gunbarrel, Niwot and
Longmont who are seeking faster and more direct AB bus service to the airport.
We thank RTD for considering our comments and addressing so many vital transit needs in our
region.
Sincerely,

Karen Worminghaus

Excellent. Alright. So good afternoon everybody.
I'm the manager of community engagement here at the Regional Transportation
district and I am joined today by my colleague Dan Merritt.

He is our senior service planner and scheduler on the service planning and

development team. We're going to be presenting to you today our proposed service
changes for January 2025.

We also have some other RTD team members on this call to answer any.

Specific questions about the route patterns and things like that as we go along, I do
ask that you remain on mute until the question and answer period.

That way we can get through the proposed changes and then have more of a
discussion about them at the end.
Oh, right.

So for today's presentation, I'm going to give you an overview of what service

changes entail and kind of the process that we go through to make these changes.
We'll go through the specific proposed changes for January.

Will tell you how you can provide your input, and you'll also be able to provide input
to us today, and then we will finish by talking about the timeline and next steps for
implementation and adoption.
So what are service changes?

Service changes are modifications to RT vs bus and rail system that happen generally
3 * a year in January, May and September.

These are changes that are done for a variety of reasons, including increasing our
reliability, improving our on time performance, enabling our representative

workforce to select shifts accounts for changes in ridership ridership, whether that be
an increase in ridership or a decrease.

It also is helping us advance our system optimization plan, which is our five year plan
for bringing service and optimizing it to the confines of our realities with post

pandemic and people power and all of that.

We also have these changes to support our maintenance projects that are scheduled.
So we have 5 categories of service changes and I wanna outline them briefly for you.
So that way they're clear, the first one is route adjustments.

These can be temporary or permanent changes or detours to a particular route, or
stop to optimize the efficiency of the route, improve accessibility, respond to
changing travel patterns, or facilitate maintenance projects.

Has quite a few route adjustments that are geared towards our system optimization

plan and really making sure that the routes we're running are going to be as efficient
as possible.

Service increases. These are changes that either increase the frequency, the number

of trips, the span of service, or the operating hours for a particular rail line or a bus
route.

Really excited to stay that we have quite a few service increases proposed for January
2025. A service reduction is the opposite of a service increase.

That's where we're contracting and reducing the frequency or the number of trips or
span or service or operating hours on our bus or rail lines.

I'm happy to say that we have 0 service reductions for the proposed January service
change.

Then we also have seasonal adjustments.

These are temporary adjustments made to bus and rail service in response to
seasonal variations, so think of.

Tripper service. When we have school in session, we'll have a few more buses
running.

Because there are more students on the buses. But in the summer when school and
university are out of session, we don't necessarily need those extra buses running.

That would be a seasonal adjustment and then the last service change is a schedule
timing adjustment.

These are very small adjustments to the running time of our bus or rail network and
they help us to better align connections between different buses and rail routes,
improve our on time performance.

And align with customer demands.
Reschedule timings are very small.

They're generally a minute or two difference.

In this proposed January service change.

1.D.2.c

It's not adding a service or increasing the frequency, it's just modifying the times at
which they arrive at different points on the route.

And so with that, I'm going to pass it off to my colleague Dan Merritt, and he's going
to go through the proposed service changes for 2025.
Dan Merritt 5:05

Thank you, Brandon.
We are making many changes here for the upcoming January 2025 service change.

We'll start off with our rail and proposed service increases. We proposed to enhance
reliability and reduce wait times to better meet the needs of our customers by
reinstating a 15 minute service frequency on.

Both the E line, which runs from Denver Union Station to Ridgecote station.
And the H line, which runs from 18th and California station.
To the Florida station. Next slide please.

We also have many changes proposed for bus side.

We are looking at making changes and creating a route which is which is referred to
in the system optimization plan as the one E 44 which we're calling the art District
connector.

You also just for reference here the S the system optimization plan referred to as the
SOP. During this meeting, both names are synonymous.
We also are looking at some changes to Route 24.

Route 35, Route 49, Route 73, Route 83 D, Route 100, Route 139, the A BS1 and two
the FF5 and the LD.

We also are looking making some changes to adjust some schedule timing.

These are where we're not changing the routing on some routes, just changing the
time to improve on time performance. As Brandon explained previously.

The AB two you probably saw the name downtown Boulder station through DEN to
Denver. The AB2 pattern previously ran out of Boulder Junction, however.
Boulder Junction will not reopen yet.

Instead, we will start operating AB2 trips from Downtown Boulder station.

Via Canyon, 28th St. Tabernacle and then the regular routing to come the airport.
Also, quick update on the NB as we're going through the process for January

recommended changes we received quite a bit of input regarding the recent NB
route changes and had to occur in September in order for us to adhere to the
collective bargaining agreement with the Union.

We've taken that input and we're looking to recommend additional changes on
Route NB that will then better match the Bell start and end times.

Older high school and KC Middle School, as well as some of the other times that

might be of purpose for NB route writers.

Sorry.

Yes, hi Brandon.

This is Moe Sullivan.

I'm a senior service planner and scheduler for our E team and thanks for your
feedback Jayden.

So right now, unfortunately, we're not able to serve the stop at 13th Ave. and Lisbon
with any bus because there's not a Safeway for our buses to get back onto Colfax

Packet Pg. 103

1.D.2.c

because there's not a signal currently. So unfortunately, due to safety reasons, we're
not able to.

Jaden Stoll 16:40
Alright.

Oh, OK.

Do any routing there?

There is a signal coming.

So hopefully within the year we can route to that stop and provide that service, but
until then, we have to update our maps to reflect the current detour because it's
causing quite a bit of confusion for customers and frustration for our operators.
Jaden Stoll 16:59
OK.
Oh.

OK.

Wait, wait, are you guys changing the route 66?

Is that gonna affect like access rides for like throughout 66 if you change if you
change the the access right boundaries is it gonna affect me?

Because I use excess rods, eventually my like day program which I'm at now.

Oh, is that gonna affect me?
Maux Sullivan 17:37

So the 15 change will not impact the flex, the accessor right boundaries.
I don't know.

Jayden, does anyone else have any questions or comments?
It's just another second. Ponder it.

And also just remember you also have plenty of other opportunities to provide your
comment with the survey customer care, the e-mail. So we want to hear from you

even if you don't want to talk to me today, you can still reach out to us at any time.
All right. So let's talk about the next steps.

Right now, RTD is undergoing an extensive public engagement process for service

changes and we are accepting comments and feedback through October 31st. After

that point, all of the comments that we've received will be compiled and shared with
the Board of Directors, Operations, Safety and Security Committee and.
We will take all of that feedback and work to incorporate it into.
Our planning documents for the proposed changes in January.

Once we have incorporated feedback and gotten a presentation out to the operation
safety and Security Committee, then it will go to full board of approval Board of

directors approval rather on December 3rd. And if it is approved and ratified, the
service changes would go into effect on January.
19th.

Karen, you've got a question.

Attachment: January 2025 Attachment C (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

Brandon Figliolino 17:53

Karen Worminghaus 19:31
I just.

Hi, it's Karen. I just had a question, Natalie. Thanks.
I just got the AB2 map that you sent.

I'm reviewing it right now, but just out of curiosity, is is it slated to stop at the street
level at Boulder Junction?

Packet Pg. 105

1.D.2.c

I'm like sort of in real time trying to review them that map or does it bypass bulb
Egyptian completely?

Nataly Handlos 19:53

Now, so we still have the information folder junction for the AB2 on there because

for the SOP it is supposed to come back for folder junk junction when it opens and
so we will not delete it from there.

starting the AB2 at Downtown Boulder station.

Come down Canyon to 28th St. and 28th St. down to your 36th and Table Mesa and
then 36 to 470 to get to the airport.
Karen Worminghaus 20:20

OK, I'll I'll take a I'll take a closer look at the map and then thanks for thanks for that
clarification.

One quick question though.

I know because I think, at least in the summer, the business and I know the flex both
stop at the like on street at Boulder Junction.

Is that something that RTD had looked at or could that be a possibility so that the

station wouldn't have to get open, but if the bus could just stop basically the same
place that the flex stops? If that was looked at?
Nataly Handlos 20:45

If we were to start our end trips at that location on street, we do not have a turn
around or layover recovery.

We would have to either dead head to the garage or dead head to downtown
Boulder station anyway.

That is pretty significant as it comes to additional running times and resources that

Attachment: January 2025 Attachment C (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

It's a little bit confusing when you look at the map of what we're proposing is

would be needed. Therefore, it makes most sense to operate out of downtown
Boulder station where all the other AB one trips operates start.
Karen Worminghaus 20:57
OK.
OK.

Packet Pg. 106

1.D.2.c

Nataly Handlos 21:11

End allows for more flexibility, more efficient inter lines between the AB and other
regional routes.

So starting it at Downtown Boulder station versus on streets.
Karen Worminghaus 21:19
Replay.
Nataly Handlos 21:24
It's yeah.

Karen Worminghaus 21:24
OK.

Thanks. Thanks for.
Nataly Handlos 21:25

That way we can instead of wasting the resources in Deadhead or you know where
the past just runs between that stop and the garage or then back to downtown
Boulder station. We can take those times and resources and put them into the
schedule so that it becomes EFF.
Karen Worminghaus 21:41

Thanks for thanks for having looked at it.
I I figured you had.
It just wasn't.

Yeah, wasn't certain.

Yes please!
The AB is always standing room only by the time it stops at Flatiron—increased frequency will alleviate this issue!
It would also be excellent to add a Boulder -> DEN bus between the 3am and 5am that currently exist. The 3am
bus is always packed!
We love increased frequency and reliability!
Please continue to increase service frequency of AB1 ! This is my preferred way to the DEN airport, and it's nearly
always full. Several times are standing room only. Adding more runs every 30 minutes, and later into the night, will
be fantastic and I will not have to worry if the bus is too full for me to ride to DEN!

Current service between Table Mesa ParkNRide to Denver Airport is not adequate. Regularly, people have to
stand in the aisle for the duration of the trip because of overcrowding, or are not allowed to ride at all. As much as
I love the AB route, the uncertainty of whether there will be space available is a real concern when planning travel
by public transport.
Additionally, service slightly later into the night would help immensely with those of us who fly back and forth to
the West Coast. I often have no RTD option available to me when arriving after 11PM (accounting for 20 min to
get from airport gate to bus), meaning I must take an Uber or Lyft all the way back to Boulder. It is expensive, and
dis-incentivizes the use of public transportation. 1 more late-night bus option (12:20a) would be amazingly helpful
for those of us coming in slightly later. The airport is quite busy still at this hour, so I am sure many are in my
situation.
Ridership from Denver airport to Boulder during the 4:00pm-7:00pm timeframe on weekdays has increased
significantly. I have been on the 4:20pm and 5:20pm buses from the airport several times in recent weeks that
necessitated standing in the aisle because all seats were full. Several people were turned away and had to wait
an hour for the next bus. RTD should NOT WAIT until January 2025 to add another bus between the 4:20pm and
6:15pm bus departures. It is needed now!
I wish there was a bus running parallel to foothills so I could get to valmont and foothills without needing a lift
service or friend/family to get the rest of the way home. Currently it would take me just as long to take a bus
around the city to get to valmont as it does to get from the airport to Boulder (going into the Boulder stations
doesn’t help reduce the time)
I wish the airport bus went later at night because my flights often get in then especially if they are delayed
The increased service hopefully will help with the bus being full many times at the via Varra stops. I’ve had to
stand on the bus the past 5 times due to the bus being full.
Improving frequency is a very good change. Previously the service was not good, the buses were frequently full
and would refuse to let customers on, which is unacceptable for a route that directly serves the airport.
Late-night bus services will greatly increase flexibility in terms of being able to take later (and often substantially
cheaper) flights and not needing to have a back-up plan in case of delayed flights.
I relied on the AB1 to get to the airport extensively when living in Boulder, but I now live in Longmont which the
route doesn’t serve. In addition to AB1/2, having a new airport bus route that serves Longmont would be an
excellent addition to RTD services
This will greatly improve my experience with the airport bus service. I will be more likely to take the bus when I
have very early or very late flights or have significant delays whereas I could not currently.
Every time we take the AB1 we say to ourselves, if only this bus ran more frequently! There's always a guessing
game: do we want to be an hour too early or cut it close. The proposed timing makes much more sense, and will
help with holiday traffic loads as well.

My family had stopped taking the AB buses in the last year, especially during peak travel times, due to buses
being full and passing by our stop or the timing being so long as to require us being at the airport hours in
advance.

increase service if possible on those days around the holidays. I'm sure its hard to staff appropriately with staff
also wishing to enjoy holiday time off.
Many of us use RTD for our travel, this helps the commuters.
Love it! As a frequent user of this service to get from the airport to Flatiron Station/Broomfield stop, it would be
great to have increased service times. If it means a slight increase in fees that would be acceptable as well.
AB buses frequently fill up but are our favorite way to get to/from DIA!
Yay!
This should have happened a long time ago.
I ride the AB route frequently, and almost every time 8 or more people have been required to stand for at least 35
minutes of the route. I also would appreciate more frequency, as I have had to get to the airport over 45 minutes
early, or wait 45 minutes for a bus to depart from the airport.
As an airline employee riding AB bus at least 12 times a month, I appreciate the good service. However by the
time the bus gets to the Flatiron stop in Broomfield, it is almost entirely packed and many times standing room
only. This bus route is probably the most utilized in the entire RTD system. 30 minute service all day is necessary.
Charge more for this incredible service to pay for the airport. Make sure Broomfield residents can get a seat.
Perhaps paid reservation system would help
The current AB1 route eastbound is frequently full. This line needs to come at least 2 times per hour to meet
customer demands. There are many times I have waited for this bus only to be told by the driver he or she can
not accept any more passengers because the bus is full. Additionally the service leaving the airport at night has
been sporadic especially during the holidays where the bus is late traveling westbound or does not show at all.
This line badly needs additional buses traveling in both directions.
Excellent! We always have a backup plan should the bus be full. Can’t wait another hour. Thank you!!’
Why the Route AB1 does not stop in Longmont to pick up or drop off passengers.
More frequent service at times would be great.
The ridership on this route is consistently high. I believe even with increased frequency the buses will be full.
Thanks

Stopped using AB because of the lowered frequency (less convenient, more crowded, etc) Increased service
would make me consider it again
about time
This bus is very crowded, and it's better than parking at the airport! I hate getting in after the last bus, this will
save me time and money!
Airport service needs to be perfect. You can't strand people for no reason. It has to be sufficient for demand, all
the time.
Morning and afternoon buses, especially on weekends and holidays are often full or standing room only. 30min
intervals would improve this. Also, with many flights landing between 10-11p, a late bus is needed to
accommodate these travel itineraries
I’ve been on the bus when people have been turned away. I think it is a good idea to add buses. When I go to the
airport, I need to use the bus. I can’t afford a taxi there.
Since the AB1 route schedule was changed to limited hours and only running on the hour, my wife and I have
experienced packed buses (having to ride standing - no seat available) and very professional but overworked
drivers. The fares have always been an excellent value and the RTD app has made purchasing tickets easier and
convenient. But the buses need to run more often (every 1/2 hour) and they need to run earlier and later to cover
expanded airline schedules at DIA.
run them even later!
Please extend DIA to Boulder times past midnight to enable passengers from end of day flights arriving 11pm to
Midnight or so to make it to destinations. Thank you.
I regularly fly from the Seattle to Denver. Often, due to the hour gained, I end up arriving in Denver after 11:30pm
and missing the final bus from DIA to Boulder. Because of that, I have had to spent nights sleeping in DIA waiting
for the 5am bus. Have you ever been woken up to a rider vacuum cleaner riding towards your face? Well I have.
It's the stuff of nightmares. And sure, every time they turn at the last minute avoiding a collision. But like, what if
they didn't? Would I be the first fatality in a freak riding vacuum cleaner accident? Would they have to pick pieces
of me out of the spinning circular bristle pads? That could take hours! Thankfully, if there were a single later bus
than the 11:20pm bus, no one would be doomed to this potential fate. For those reasons, I highly encourage the
team at RTD to expand the hours of operation for this route. Thank you for your time!
We use this bus whenever we travel and having more options instead of every hour will be great as sometimes
the bus is full!
Happy to see the increase in times for this bus. Also wanted to communicate yet again that you need to bring
back the FF bus that provides service along the 36 corridor to the Civic Center station. Please please please!!

We pick up this bus at Flatiron Station and it is almost always full, with people standing the entire ride. Additional
routes would be very welcome and alleviate some stress about if we'll be able to fit on the bus to catch our flight.

Excited for this change. Buses have been crowded and 30 minutes frequency would be appreciated.

I rely on the AB Skyride to get me to and from DIA. It is often quite crowded and there are times when a
significant number of passengers have to stand. I am 81 years old and would really really like to be confident that
I will have a seat for the ride to DIA.
Past midnight trips should be Westbound (Denver to Boulder) to better align with flight schedules; there are many
flights that arrive just before midnight and no flights that leave a couple hours after midnight.
Much needed, especially for trips from the airport. Often crowded
Increased frequency of AB1 trips would make a huge difference! I travel often and always ride this route, and over
the last 6 months or so it has been excessively crowded—standing room only in both directions. More flexibility in
the schedule would be a huge benefit too, and later service from DEN alleviates having to scramble through the
airport to not miss the last bus of the night.
This neeeds to happen! AB1 buses from the airport (and to the airport) are frequently packed to the point where
people sometimes have to wait for the next one, which is an hour+ wait sometimes! :'(
When are you going to restart the FF6 and reopen Boulder-Junction station? You're turning our TOD housing
project into a transit desert! Stop running RTD like it's suburban car infrastructure, and start running it like a
service for people who dont want cars!
This is great, but I would think we'd want the post-midnight trips to be *from* the airport.
I recently took AB1 from DIA on a Sunday. Plane got held up at the gate for 15 minutes, and I missed the bus by
less than 5.
I had to wait 50 minutes for the next one. 20 minutes would have been very acceptable.
I wish the service ran in 30min intervals all the time. I frequently see buses fill up in the afternoons and that is
when I travel most, not morning or evening.
Airport bus service every half hour is extremely helpful, both from a timing and capacity perspective. This is a
popular line and is often quite busy, and when it only runs every hour you frequently just miss it and have to wait
awhile, or you have to arrive almost 3 hours early for a flight. Thanks RTD for considering expanded service on
this line!
This would increase ridership and align better with daily flights out of DEN.
Hooray! 30 minute Frequency will make it considerably more likely that I’ll use the bus instead of driving to the
airport

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

This bus is very much in need of increased service at all times of day and night.

This bus has to run well, otherwise we run the risk of clogging the already overloaded highways of Denver with
more passenger vehicles. I don't really understand the past-midnight East bound change - I think a past-midnight
Westbound increase makes more sense for later flight arrivals.
I often take flights (5 times a year?) that get back just after the last bus, the midnight bus is going to be awesome.
Service frequency should be 30 minutes for most of the day, not just rush hour. Right now there are only about
five busses on the 30 minute interval, but flights go in and out all day. Past midnight is needed for DEN to Boulder
but not the reverse. And an additional bus between the 3:04 and 4:34 bus from Boulder to DEN would be helpful.
One time I had to drive to the airport because the 4:34 bus would have been too late, but 3:04 is way too early.
Additional service during the end of holiday weekends would be a huge help!
Improved frequency and late hours will help to make the bus an easier choice. The drive through Flatiron P&R is
such a terrible experience. The road is not up to standards for heavy buses with lots of tipping, potholes and a
jarring ride. Could you improve the road or move the stop? That part of the trip is such a waste of time for a
couple riders. Maybe a small shuttle could take those riders to a stop on the toll road? Or create a bus only exit to
the flatiron p&r.
This is very much needed. I just waited 50 minutes for the AB bus. Of course there are people that are forced to
stand.
Increased frequency is great! I'd love to see it increased even more to 15 minutes, this would make it even easier
to plan around.
Please re-open Boulder Junction station and re-start service from there. That area is very poorly served by public
transit, and I would be able to use RTD transit much easier if it was open.
Always need later bus coming home from the airport
Would love a more frequent bus from and to the airport. I love the AB1 and use it every time I am trying to get to
the airport.
Fewer times of missing the bus at the airport by a few minutes, leading to an hour wait for the next. Less stress
about getting stuck at the airport trying to make the last bus to Boulder.
I don’t understand, however, why the latest bus is going from Boulder to the airport. Surely you’d want to prioritize
the other way round??
Increased and particularly later service would be very beneficial for me.

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

I have had to use other services like Uber and cabs to and from the airport last several years because there just
wasn't a bus to get me there on time. That makes me sad because I believe in public transportation (it's better for
the planet than uber)

Buses are often very crowded with no seats
Increased service increases my likelihood of using the bus.

There is really no other good way to access the airport. But getting in late or trying to align flights to bus
schedules is pretty bad.
For flights arriving late at night, the last bus is too early and 1hr frequency is too sparse. For example, if landing at
9:30pm, the 9:40pm bus is impossible to catch, but one could be home before the next bus is scheduled to leave
at 10:40pm by driving a car. Increasing frequency in the evening and morning and scheduling a later bus will help.
The more service to and from the airport, the better.
Would prefer this to be at 30 minute intervals all open hours. Would also benefit from the hours ending at 2 am
each way.
The AB1 bus is the most useful bus in the Boulder Area. I would vote to expand hours into the later
evening/morning hours to help with flights that get in past 12am.
I am always afraid I won’t get a seat on the bus because it is always so full. It would make a huge difference in
planning for my trips and getting home in a reasonable amount of time instead of waiting for up to an hour in
between busses. This is a great addition and many will be thankful for it!
This is a very popular route. It’s frequently standing room only. Please increase the frequency!
We need more AB frequency and buses in general but especially around high travel times like the holidays. Have
had to stand or miss bus regularly.
Would even support more frequent service times
This would make me much more inclined to use public transportation over a personal vehicle. It would also save
me money in parking and/or ride costs
This would make such a difference in using the AB1 to the airport!! I’m often too early or too late based on current
1 hr bus times. 30 min bus times would make a significant positive impact
This would be so helpful! Last time I rode the AB1 route from Denver to boulder there were too many people and
the bus filled up. We had to wait for another one. Having buses run more frequently would help so much.
Thanks! The buses have been getting crowded, and half hour frequency will encourage to ride
Love it
This is. A great service but doesn’t run enough and I’ve missed getting on first bus a lot so I have to wait and take
a second

More buses are essential to make this route more accessible.
Please! I swear every time I fly back to Denver I end up missing the bus by 5 min and have to wait another hour. I
would love if we cut this down to every 30 min. Also I would love if the bus ran later in the evening because I’ve
almost missed the 11:15 pm bus and that would have meant waiting until the 5 am bus or taking a very expensive
uber.
We desperately need increased frequency on this route. We use it every time we go to the airport and lately it’s
been standing room with some people being turned away. Plus it’s brutal having to wait an additional 40 mins to
get on the bus after your flight.
I use this service for 99% of my trips to and from DIA. Buses on this route have standing room only during peak
travel times. Sometimes passengers waiting in line are left behind. An increase in service would have a strongly
positive impact to this route. Please increase the frequency to every 30 minutes during peak times.
Would prefer a past midnight bus from DEN to Boulder more than the other way around. Many flights get into
Denver after the last bus departs, and the old 1am bus really helped.
Yes! This line needs more buses more frequently
This service increase will make me more likely to take the AB1 to the airport from my house near Broadway and
Table Mesa. Currently, I take it when the AB1 is well timed for my flights in both directions, but the infrequent
service outside of core hours makes me take other transportation options sometimes. I’ve also been stranded at
the airport when my return flight is delayed, and I arrive after the last AB1 bus arrives. It’d be nice to have one
more AB1 leaving the airport at 1 am every day so I don’t have to worry about paying over $100 for an Uber when
I’m exhausted and just want to get home.
More late night service please. I've been stranded at 2a.m. too many times
I've had to stand or wait for the next bus due to overcrowding to the point that I drive to the airport instead
depending of flight times.
Reopen boulder Junction route. Based on the current, consistent limited availability and uncomfortable fullness of
AB route (standing room only)I have discontinued use. Definitively increase frequency. Standing room only on the
way to the airport, and long lines with completely full buses resulting in inability to board at DIA are unacceptable.
Particularly at seasonal/CU breaks, an increased number of buses on routes are a no- brainer. Or just give me
the train I paid for.
This bus is now regularly standing room during non holiday periods. Both dangerous and unacceptable. More
frequent buses are necessary.

30 minute intervals will likely allow me to get a seat on the bus from mccaslin. Every airport ride I’ve taken in the
last year has people standing by mccaslin or flatirons. An additional early morning one to beat the 90 minute gap
between the 3:30 and 5am one would be super helpful too.

Later busses from DIA would be extremely helpful if a flight arrives late. Thank you!

This would be good since most buses going both ways are full. I’ve been rejected from boarding multiple times by
the time the bus arrives at Via Varra stops.

Great idea
The proposed change would increase our usage of the AB1 to and from DIA,
Every 30min service would be awesome because the wait at the airport can be pretty long if you just miss the
bus. Thanks for doing this!!
The 30-minute service in the morning and evening is very much needed. Buses to the airport in the morning
frequently are standing room only all the way from the back to the front of the bus and evening buses are full.
Expanding to midnight for trips from DEN to Boulder would be very much welcomed for times when flights come
in late; for us, this has been happening multiple times per year.
Critical to expand service on this route as it is much-used - great to have it be later in the day if flights are late or
scheduled to arrive too late to take the bus.
30 minute service interval all day would be even better!
Expanding bus service frequency between Boulder and Denver Airport is a crucial step toward enhancing regional
connectivity and sustainability. Increased bus frequency would provide a reliable and convenient transportation
option for travelers, reducing the reliance on personal vehicles. This shift not only alleviates traffic congestion on
the I-25 corridor but also significantly decreases greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with broader environmental
goals. Moreover, a more robust public transit option would serve students, professionals, and tourists alike,
making travel more accessible and affordable for all demographics.
In addition to environmental benefits, expanding bus service frequency can stimulate local economies. Enhanced
connectivity can attract more visitors to Boulder’s attractions and businesses, while also providing Boulder
residents with easier access to the economic opportunities available in Denver. Improved bus service can also
reduce parking pressures at the airport, making travel smoother for everyone. By investing in public transit
infrastructure, we can create a more integrated transportation network that not only meets current demands but
anticipates future growth, ultimately fostering a healthier, more sustainable urban ecosystem.
I take this bus to/from the airport regularly. Having more frequent and later service will help me a great deal.
Thank you
This is an excellent change. I’m extremely grateful for this, as this will absolutely stimulate more ridership. It may
be a good idea to run a related advertising campaign in the Boulder area, “$10 to DIA every half hour” or
something to that effect.
Please please PLEASE re-open Boulder Depot and have either AB1 or AB2 start/end here - incredibly useful bus
line prior to COVID and it is sorely missed.

30 minute frequency all day would be preferred because it's so frustrating just wanting to get home after a trip but
instead you have to wait up to an hour for the next bus to come.
The AB1 is a great route that is almost always packed and encourages me to not use a car so this is great
Thanks. I’ve been stuck paying $140.00 for an Uber late at night from the airport. If flights are arriving and
departing, there should be bus service.
I am so happy to hear about this service expansion. I do wish there was an even later night service from DENBoulder, perhaps at 1am or 1:20. This would strongly support my ability to book flights that get late into DEN. Not
entirely sure what the benefit of a midnight Boulder-DEN bus is. Increased frequency just makes me more likely
to use the bus instead of driving!
I always use the bus for transport to and from the airport. More frequent buses would improve greatly!
Would benefit from past midnight trips from DEN to Boulder. Many flights arrive around midnight, and it would give
me the option to take these flights without having to choose between an expensive Uber and sleeping at the
airport.
I love taking AB1 to the airport, but I'm always a little afraid it will fill up.
Buses are very full, to the point where I have concerns if there's going to be space. More trips is very welcome to
reduce congestion and allow for more options.
Also really excited about more late night trips to accommodate late flights.
Thank you for reinstating AB1 service past 11pm. This is a crucial missing service.
Almost always there is no capacity from DIA to Boulder until waiting an extra hour for the next bus. The bus (or if
certain hours are less busy, smaller shuttle) should always depart at least every 30 minutes.
The increase in frequency is EXCELLENT. I would be curious to hear from RTD about the previous practice of
sending out extra buses when people on the AB route were left at the bus stop because the bus was full. I
experienced that back in 2019 and it was such a relief. I'm sad to hear about so many people scrambling for
transport when they were not allowed on the bus and the only alternative from RTD was to wait an hour for the
next bus and HOPE it wasn't also full.
I am confused about why the east bound route would run later than the west bound route. I've never had a flight
time where I couldn't take the bus because the flight was too late, but there have been MANY times where we
couldn't get home on the west bound route because a flight came in too late to catch a bus.

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

The last two times I was on the AB, there was standing room only. On the way to the airport, we could not pick up
the last stop, and I felt terrible for those riders. For this reason the increased frequency is essential.

We need later buses from DEN to Boulder - do you realize how many flights arrive at midnight or later? This is no
other cost-effective way home. This is consistently a crowded bus to and from the airport - added service is
certainly justifiable.

Increased schedule frequency solves all of my problems with AB1.

This would reduce anxiety about relying on the AB route for late rides back from the airport, and for ensuring I'll
definitely get on a bus on the way to the airport. I'll likely ride it more now with these changes.
I support this change; however, as someone who lives near the Lafayette park and ride there are still no good
ways for me to get to the airport using RTD.
We need more routes from the airport to Boulder. With a frequency of only once an hour, it often means choosing
between a 45+ minute wait at the airport or just getting an Uber. That’s the route that would have the greatest
impact for ridership. The narrow window to make a bus that leaves every X:20 means I’m usually getting a ride
share home.
When I use the RTD AB1 line it's generally a good experience but it's very typical for me to have to wait a long
time for the bus back to Boulder. I live in Gunbarrel and would like to drive to McCaslin RTD, park and ride the
bus to the airport.
I'd love to see the route run every 30 mins. Getting off the plane and having to rush to the bus can be stressful. If
theres two buses per hour this would be an huge improvement.
this is sorely needed, thank you
Bus between Boulder and DIA needs to be more frequent - people not being allowed to board due to full is totally
unsat - NOT OK for people to miss s flight due to bus. People having to stand the entire way is also unsat and
potentially dangerous.
Bus should run 24/7 in my opinion - there is such a thing as a delayed or simply late flight that gets into DIA at
midnight, etc. Unsat to have to shell out $100 for taxi due to lack of bus. Unsat to have to wait in airport for hours
until bus resumes service the next day.
These proposed changes are great and will likely spur additional use, particularly on the DEN to Boulder route as
people are more willing to wait 30 minutes rather than an hour if they just miss a bus on their return travel. I am a
regular (at least 1x/month) user of the AB1 and while I always take it to the airport, I’m likely to take an Uber home
if I have a 30+ minute wait for the next bus. This will largely resolve that problem.
More frequent buses means I'll be taking Uber or driving my own car to the airport less. I'd also like to see buses
after midnight from the airport to Boulder, for times when flights get in very late.
Please have trips past midnight from den to boulder
Increased service will ensure me and others will have a reliable way to get to the airport. I really enjoy the AB1

Please make this change! I use this bus, visiting friends and family use this bus. I am a NECO pass holder and
love RTD. It is incredibly frustrating to not be able to make a bus home because it’s too full.
The Boulder AB1 bus is always packed and could show a huge benefit from increased service. Also, many times I
have been stuck at the airport due to lack of late return busses from the airport to Boulder, and this change would
help alleviate that.
The AB buses are often at capacity, making the trip to the airport uncertain. A higher frequency of bus would help
with this. The last bus from the airport to Boulder is too early, stranding many travelers who arrive on later flights.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
On several occasions, I needed to shell out for an expensive uber due to the infrequent/inconvenient airport bus
schedule. I want to take this bus, but a frequent schedule is a requirement for it to by my default choice. Plus -- it's
always so packed!
Extending hours to midnight would allow us to take the AB1 on return trips back to DIA.
Longer hours and more frequent services!
This is much needed, especially during the holiday season. Thank you very much for listening to your riders!
Lately it’s been so crowded the entire aisle was filled with standing passengers right up to the driver’s shield.
Would love more frequent service so folks can have seats.
Additionally the once an hour current schedule means having to get to airport extra early OR having to drive/Uber
if you miss the route or can’t fit on because next bus is too far away. (Once bus was cancelled and folks had to
hop in strangers cars to still make flights). Would like more flexibility and backup options and 30 min frequency
would definitely help.
Great idea. Will be so useful
The changes in frequency and lateness of the final departure from DIA will make a huge difference in my travel
planning and execution. Thank you for listening to your customers on this route!
Great changes and will result in people waiting around less
Providing "past midnight" service from Boulder to DEN does not make a lot of sense given that security screening

I love having accessibility to the AB1 because the proposed light rail to/from boulder/Denver never happened.
Ridership has increased dramatically in the past few years since Covid, the buses in service need to respond
accordingly. I now do not consider taking the AB1 as I am unsure if I’ll actually be able to get on board at the east
flatiron station stop due to how often the buses are full and riders are turned away. The AB1 services riders in
Broomfield, Lafayette, Boulder, Louisville, Erie, and more. It’s tragic it’s taken so long to bring service back up to
match the demand of this line.
Increased airport route usage is a positive step. Particularly adding later service which will allow travelers to
spend their money on public transit rather than expensive Ubers.
Having access to usable transit options requires that transit to come at a rate where it is useful to many groups of
people and more time options is an essential part of that. It is difficult to catch a transit option that does not come
frequently as the time may not work for many people's schedules. Adding increased service frequency is vital to
many transit users in making lines actually usable for them.
I’ve been using AB1 for a couple of years now (and wish I’d started much sooner). I use this route to get to and
from the airport when I travel. As I see it, if I miss my bus another will come along in 30 minutes so that would be
very helpful.
AB is usually standing room only. Change is desperately needed.
I've heard that this is a profitable line for RTD. If that's the case, why not increase frequency to every 15 or 20
minutes? Make this line so appealing that it's profit supports other lines. Most people won't wait 30 minutes, they'll
just drive.
This is a good change. The bus is frequently full/over capacity for the 2:47pm DEN arrival eastbound on Fridays.
I have been stuck at airport for an hour after just missing a pickup. I’ve avoided taking this route if there wasn’t a
convenient time in the past.
Traffic is bad on this street and I support bringing more bus transit to keep the roads moving!
I ride to work. 30 freq. makes more usable before and after work. 30 min. Freq. makes the Sunday schedule time
change less impactful.
I don’t understand why the schedule is only 1 bus an hour from the airport. This causes unnecessary lines and
wait time. The schedule should be every 30 minutes each way, especially during holidays and peak travel times.
I live in zip code 80023 in Broomfield. Our community has grown very fast and there is not enough public
transportation in our area hence we are forced to use cars.
Adding an AB1/AB2 stop near I25 and 470E interchange area will increase your ridership significantly. We all talk
about this in our community meetings.

2) Increased frequency equals improved convenience which is what is required to improve ridership, NOT the
other way around
3) This route and improved convenience will further alleviate car traffic for those who still want or need to drive
Thank you for any and all increased service frequency on the AB routes. Buses are often standing room only
which is dangerous and makes travel with children difficult!
It's great to see increased frequency, this will make taking the bus to the airport much easier. 15 minute frequency
would be even better!
Please reopen Boulder junction station, and have the AB2 bus start there. There's so much housing being built
there but poor transit service. I live walking distance from that station but can't easily or quickly get access to the
AB or FF buses.
Increasing bus frequency/capacity is sorely needed. Often riders are turned away at peak hours.
Very happy to see more AB1 times and the addition of AB2. We've stopped taking the AB to the airport because of
the reduced times that it runs and because of bus overcrowding. It would be great to be able to take the AB again
with these changes!
The addition of a midnight westbound trip is fantastic and very much needed. However, the after-midnight addition
should would also be more beneficial if it was Westbound as well. Perhaps, the midnight westbound route runs to
Boulder, then immediately returns back to the airport at 1am, and then again goes back to Boulder at 2am. This
would be ideal, as there are many many flights that don't arrive at DIA until midnight or later, and then are often
delayed which requires a bus at 1am or later.
As a frequent AB1 rider, I greatly appreciate the expansion to service every 30 minutes especially as buses have
been full and lines long lately. It would be great for service past midnight to be from DEN to Boulder instead of
Boulder to DEN.
I'm very excited about more frequent AB1 scheduling, as it is currently frustrating to try and time the bus both for
arriving at the airport & for returning to Boulder after a flight. Nothing more frustrating than missing the AB1
departing the airport by a couple minutes and having to wait an entire hour. The switch to half hour frequency,
even if not universal, will be a much appreciated improvement.
Prefer more evening Westbound service.

Thank you for providing more service, including longer availability during the day and more frequency, to make
taking transit a more convenient option.

Good efforts and start. Would prefer more evening/night Eastbound services (DIA to downtown Boulder).
Past midnight trip would be better from the airport to Boulder, instead of it being from Boulder to the airport. Thank
you.

Extending night time and increasing frequency is a huge improvement. midnight is still a bit stingy for west bond
given that flights can get delayed
This change is long overdue. I am happy to see service finally being increased to the Airport!
Buses every 30 minutes would be much more convient and help reduce crowding on the bus. A later midnight bus
from the airport would also be convient as many flights arrive late at night.
The number of times I’ve been stranded at DIA because my flight got in past 11pm is crazy. This has been
needed for a while
I don't know why past-midnight service is being considered for eastbound service, but not westbound. Given the
choice, I'd MUCH rather have later westbound services. Hands down, no contest. I have never needed the
eastbound AB1 at 1am but I have needed the westbound AB1 at 1am.
I am very excited for the midnight bus back to Boulder as I have missed the 11:20pm by a mere 5 minutes too
many times to count! Very good change!
So great to see a later WB bus from the airport! This is such a great change! Would love it even more if there was
an after-midnight WB bus from the airport, too.
30 minute frequency is badly needed for the AB route. The bus is very often standing room only, so there is
clearly demand for it. And missing a bus home from the airport because your incoming flight is a few minutes
delayed is much less of a problem if you don’t have to wait a full hour for the next bus. Thank you so much for this
change!!!
Long overdue, given the high ridership and often packed buses. It has also been very important that many fewer
trips are canceled/delayed, since I don't know what people do when their airport bus (particularly a very early
morning one) is canceled, since there aren't any good alternatives -- and that no doubt turns them off from using
the bus the next time.
Also, a comment on one change in particular. You note that you will restore a late bus from DEN to Boulder at
midnight. That's great, but it used to be at 12:20am, and, yes, I can assure you from much experience that those
20 minutes makes a big difference, so please consider going back to that schedule. You also note that there will
be a bus after midnight from Boulder to DEN, which makes no sense to me unless you really mean another early
morning bus, which would be nice since there is a 90-minute gap between the first and second bus to DEN.
We fly into DIA fairly often from Vermont and almost always take the AB to Boulder and then back to DIA at the
end of our visit. It's a great service and a terrific value. There are many times that we fly into the "rush hour" at the
airport and have to wait another hour to catch the bus. While this may not seem like a deal (and it isn't compared
to many other issues)it is frustrating when we just miss the bus. And conversely from Boulder to DIA sometimes
we have to leave earlier than necessary because the busses don't leave at 30 minute intervals.

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

The past midnight trips should be from DIA to Boulder rather then from Boulder to DIA. Not many flights leave
past midnight. Thanks :)

I appreciate this. I get on at flatiron station and with the number of homes and ppl in this Indiana corridor, and
from Boulder, the buses are packed. I actually was denied a week ago bc there wasn’t Even standing space!
Thank you!!
I really appreciate having a later trip from DIA to Boulder; it will be nice to not have to stress about missing the last
bus when my flight is later, and as a result will save me the cost of an Uber from Union station to get home after I
miss the last one.
This will be amazing to have increased service to and from the airport--so happy to see this come back!

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

This is a much needed change. This bus is my preferred way to get to the airport and every time I ride, it is always
full, and often standing room only, or has to leave people behind. Additionally, I’ve had to stay overnight at the
airport due to delayed flights, so having midnight buses will make that less likely and provide me more flight
options.

More frequent service makes it much easier to get to key locations(Airport, downtown) and makes the light rail a
more reasonable mode of transport
This will be very helpful in me getting to Union station.
I take the light rail when the bus is delayed and sometimes the light rail and bus are equally delayed. The
proposed changes would be beneficial as a more reliable form of transportation
Could use another minute or two between when eastbound W line reaches Auraria West and southbound E line.
How many additional operators are projected to be needed between now and the implementation of this schedule
in order to truly provide 15-minute frequencies with no/minimal dropped runs? Even at 30-minute frequency, I was
still seeing multiple dropped runs every day.

E Line is goated
Trash service damn it just run on time.
Would love to see higher frequencies during rush hour. Every 7 mins between 8am-9am and 4pm-5pm. That
would be amazing!!
This is a great start though and big improvement. 15 minute intervals makes me more confident in choosing to
ride instead of drive.
Increasing service frequency to every 15 minutes M-F between 7:00 - 9:00 AM and 4:00 - 6:00 PM would be huge
for convenience of commuters as well as those attending events at Ball Arena / Coors Field / Empower Field and
surrounding business district!
I will believe these "proposed changes" when I see they are actually working. What are you going to do about
security on the E-Line, Union Station, and between Union Station and the E-Line? Will there be ANY coordination
of timing between the G-Line and the E-Line? There is no safe way to get from the commuter rail lines to the light
rail. You either have to dodge traffic (which is usually SAFER) or deal with the homeless in the bus terminal
running under ground.
Lifted all the speed restriction
The return of service every 15 minutes is fantastic news
Since the beginning of summer, the E line has seen drastically diminished service capacity due to repairs and
route changes on the H and D lines. A return to 15 minute service frequency would be a huge boon to the
commuters that frequently take the E in the mornings and afternoons. Thank you!
YES!! We need every 15 minutes back. Having the train be reliable is a game changer for my day and trust in
RTD. I would greatly appreciate this change
Please do this it will make a huge positive impact on my commute!
Thank you and thank all at RTD
Finally!
I have had to drive 30 miles to work daily. I will be able to return to my rail commute.
This will be amazing!!

Reduced frequencies on the E Line make commuting between central downtown and anywhere south of
Southmoor Station a logistical headache with little margin for error, especially since the shutdown of the F Line.
Whether heading north or south, any cancellation or delay on the D, E, or H Lines often means missing a
connection and being left waiting for a long time at a station.

Reinstated 15 minute service on the E Line, with reliability to keep to the schedule, is an absolute non-negotiable
for me. The delays, construction, lack of drivers, whatever the current excuse may be, is pushing me to leave the
city of Denver. I have lived coast to coast and never experienced inefficiencies like I have with RTD over the past
4 years. What should be a painless commute under 25 minutes door to door regularly takes me over an hour, as it
did this evening while the sun went down and the temps plummeted.
I'll believe your
trains will be on time when I see it happen. You're just gonna cancel every other
like you do now so who gives a flying
I don’t ride the light rail anymore since the F line was removed so this would cause me to consider taking it again
Thank christ
I used to take this train every day but it has become unreliable so I’ve been walking over a mile to bus for the past
few months. Higher frequency will be great, but more important is that the RTD app and Google maps time of
train arrival is accurate
More scheduled times between Union Station and Ridgegate (and vice versa)are a good thing. I just wish the
duration of the trip could be faster. Even if RTD could add “express” routes like they do in Japan…don’t stop at
every stop to get you to your destination faster. Maybe try on big sports or concert days. Or during rush hour. Just
a thought.
Please!
This will make it so I can increase how often I use transit.
Light rail for E and H is HORRIBLE at the moment. Has been useless for two years. This would be great
improvement!! I could take public transport to work again.
Thank you for going back to 15 minute intervals! It will make my life so much easier when it comes to commuting
by train.
Increase frequency to every 15 minutes is great but only if you don’t cancel all of the increased trains. Service to
the very south since of town(Ridgegate station) has been poor and very unreliable to the point of being
completely unusable.
Increased E line frequency would be incredibly helpful to transport to and from work! Increasing to 15 minute
intervals would give me more flexibility to plan to take the rail to work!
More frequency would really help me as I get out of my job at different times of the day and sometimes I just
barely miss the E and have to wait 30 minutes. It’s still so much better than once an hour!

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

Please reinstate the 15-minute schedule for the E line. People have to get to work. It's astonishing that you think a
regular commuter line should run every 30 minutes. No mass transit system in the country runs its lines so rarely
(unless we're talking about longer-distance commuter rails on Sundays). It's appalling that you have screwed
around with our schedules this much over the past year and a half -- please stop.

finally

Is the allowed speed ever going to return to normal?
The slow speed of trains does not encourage us to ride.
I use Yale Station and I could almost walk faster than the trains this summer.
Post new schedules NOW! I spent 40 minutes waiting for the e line the other day. Why would I use such an
unreliable form of transportation?
I can't wait till all the lightrail trains are back running every 15 minutes. I've been so frustrated with the slow downs
and cancelation. It's been a hassle to get anywhere under 2 hours if you're using the train.
I am often left waiting 15 minutes or more for an e line train to arrive. I am a student in boulder who lives in
denver, and the first bus I can take to union gets me there at 4:00, and the e line freqeuently does not arrive until
4:20-4:25 or later, this would make my commute significantly easier and allow me to effectively increase my free
time by at least an hour a day.
If this change is unreliable, however, it does even more damage. Please ensure that this change is done with that
in mind. Reliability is the most important trait of strong public transport to people like me who rely on it
Definitely a great proposed change!! It feels like for every E line train there are 2-3 W line trains :(
the line is very unreliable right now. trains get cancelled all the time or the schedule is not updated to reflect
cancelled trains. the 15 minute frequency would do a lot for people who ride the train but if frequency is
increased, we need the operators available to do it so trains don't get cancelled. there would be no reason to I
crease the frequency if half the time trains are cancelled like they are now.
Going back to the 15 minute service frequency would be much appreciated, as well as eliminating the current
slowdowns that are making transit slower. Thanks !
Greater frequency and reliability may improve usage and demand of RTD rail services by employees. We are
looking to renew our RTD Eco pass but employees don't use it much as its unreliable and there are not many trips
offered.
Increased timing of trains that go to Ball Arena are only helpful if frequent trains are still provided when scheduled
events end. Please ensure the 15 minute train timing continues through at least 10pm
With increased 15 minute service frequency, making connections from D line would save us time commuting
south Denver to downtown or to airport for work and travel. Thank You RTD for moving Denverites around the city
with ease. Very much appreciate the work and help you provide us.
This change is very important to my commute.

THANK YOU!!!! I stopped using the light rail when the schedule was made less frequent and I know of at least
two other coworkers that felt the same. I will love taking this train to work again with the increased frequency.
I need the E Line to commute to school everyday and I have been unable to do so this semester due to the
construction, constant delays, and unreliability of the train. It would positively effect me to change back to 15
minute frequencies
More frequent trains are always welcome!
when the E-line only runs once an hour, it makes it difficult and a waste of time when trying to get downtown for a
game or to Mile High to watch the Broncos, and the carts are jammed packed, so you have to wait another hour
for the next train to arrive
Please increase frequency to 15. It helps a lot, thank you.
Thank you so much for going back to 15 minute intervals. This summer has been infuriating. More than anything,
please prioritize being ON TIME. It is impossible to plan my life around trains that show up super late or not at all.
It will be positive if the trains will run on schedule, but that has not been the case for some time. Will this change
increase the likelihood of the trains running on time?
Current service is pathetic, terrible there is no such thing as on time, reliability. There is one time on RTD app, at
station on display another time (if display working) and train comes at different times, slows down, stops on the
tracks totally thrash. You currently have very low or no bar as reliability, customer service so anything is better
than current nightmare
Thank you for this
I could start taking it to work again, I did most of last year but started driving when it reduced frequency because it
wasn’t practical
I like what you have proposed. More!
The Increased Swvise would allow me and many other to be able to rely on the light rail line more rather than
what it is at now.
Thank you. I gave up riding the E Line on a routine basis for at least the last 2-3 years, due to scheduling,
extended ride times, crime and poor communication. .

The 483 bus that I like to use does not always align with when the E line arrives at or leaves from Lincoln Station.
A service increase -if achieved- will certainly reduce wait times for me and make the 483 bus more viable. I think
an increase of frequency of the 483 bus would also help, but this should be a first step.
Re-instating 15-minute frequency will help me visit my friends more often and travel to the Denver tech center
without a car more often.
Love the 15 min frequency on the E line. This will really help me use the RTD for commuting to work.
ELine was really not reliable for commute.With this I had to spend 1:45min each way for my office commute.
Totally not acceptable. It was all ok until 2022 with 15min and very reliable schedule without delay in the middle.
With 5days work week coming back this is blocking me from continuing my work.
It would give me more flexibility during my commute between home and work.
I used to take the E line daily. However, when the schedule was reduced and then the reliability of the E line
showing up on time became nonexistent, I could no longer count on the E line to get to/from work so I ended up
purchasing a vehicle instead, which puts additional vehicles on our already crowded roads!
The schedules should be adjusted to better reflect delays please!
Increasing frequency to 15 minutes is a great first step towards higher frequency and improving transit. Thanks to
the RTD
The current e line schedule is very unreliable with many of the common commuter times hit having an available
driver. With the proposed service changes, I expect there to be more reliable service, trains leaving and
ARRIVING in time, and to have drivers available throughout the day. The frequency increase does no good if
there are no drivers available.
Yes please! More frequency makes the whole system more usable!
Currently the wait times are longer than projected. Delays and 30 minute increments make it difficult to navigate
the city. Reinstating 15 minute intervals will be great for everyone!
Please bring the E Line every 15 minutes!
It’s critical that we have the E line back to 15 minute headways. It’s still very difficult to use, especially when trying
to make connections from other lines, at the current frequency.
The schedule needs to be more consistent and on time. I am a college student and I have to arrive an hour and a
half early to school every day to ensure that I am on time and not late because of how inconsistent the trains are.

Increasing to 15 minutes will ensure students get to school timely, especially when trains are running behind.
There is no benefit to taking the train if you can drive faster and more reliably.

I live in Castle Rock & Ridgegate is the closest station… I used to ride the light rail to Denver every weekend to

I work at Ball Arena and the Stadium at times. Having every 15 minute service will get more people in and out
faster from events.
Thank you for the proposal to restore 15 minute headways. I hope this can continue through the summer to make
light rail more usable!
Needs to be more reliable as many students at Auraria campus use this line.
Thank you!
I’ll believe it when I see it ::shrug::
This would be an excellent change. As is, my commute on the E line used to be 30 minutes now takes over an
hour. With the delays, there have been time where I missed my train and had to wait an extra 30 minutes. When
you’re trying to get home to your family, a 30 minute commute vs. a 90 minute commute is a big difference.
Thanks!
Reliability back on the line would be immensely helpful. I have been late to work while repairs were done and
often had to use rideshare,.which got very expensive. Better reliability would also mean I can go to appointments
on time
I'm totally in favor of increasing it back to the 15 minute increments!
I work in LoDo next Union Station and since service interruptions there has been no reliability in the service of the
E line to get to work on time!
I travel from Englewood via route 12 to Louisiana and Pearl to the E line in the past now I have to rely on the 0 to
get downtown!!
It sure would be nice to be able to rely on the frequency of the E line or even bring back the C line Mineral to
Union Station.

Slow downs on the E line this past year have made commuting to work much more difficult. Reinstating 15 min

I take it to work daily and it helps a lot when they run every 15.
These lines are so important for my commute and seeing family. The 15-minute frequency would reduce my wait
time.
Would like to see increase in service back to 15 min and more reliability.
Could you let us know if the speed restrictions will be lifted?
Please reinstate 15 minute frequency on the e line. It will help me get to work on time.
This line has frequently been delayed or has been running every hour. I’ve had to either take a commute that’s
too early or pay for another method of transportation. I’d like to continue taking public transportation but the
current schedule does not help my needs. Increasing the frequency will help tremendously.
Increased frequency means it will be easier to make light rail travel fit into my schedule and increases the
likelihood that i will utilize it.
I would take the train more often if missing it didn’t mean having to wait a full hour to catch the next one.
Thank you, increased frequency is very helpful for me and my family!
It would mean I wouldn’t be an hour late to work every time I miss the train because my connecting train is
running late :)
Appreciate the improved frequency!
The reinstated 15 minute frequency is extremely helpful and beneficial to my morning and weekend commute.
Love to see this back to its regular 15 min frequency.
Increasing stop frequency will make the trains actually usable.
RTD can do a better job of running a few extra trains after big events (coors field, ball arena, empower) to help
encourage more transit. Sometimes I have to wait 30-40 minutes for a train after an avalanche or nuggets game.
Same for leaving a Rockies game. If a night game ends after walking to Union Station it’s a 30’ minute wait if I’m
lucky. I can usually take D,E, or H trains back to my stop at Alameda station. But others don’t take the train
specifically because it takes too long to get home from events.
Looking forward to this line getting back to a reliable and dependable form of transportation to get downtown.

I take the lightrail every day and the recent timing from the maintenance over the past few months has really

I frequently transfer to the E line from the D line, so having shorter wait times would be awesome.

Traffic is bad on the i-25 corridor and I support bringing more rail transit to keep the roads moving!
Please follow-through with re-instating 15-minute service frequency on this rail line. I really want to use the train to
commute downtown, but with current level of service and unreliability of schedule with the derated tracks and
slow zones it can be unusable and often leads to me adding to traffic on I-25.
Shut down portions of the lines for a period so that you can focus on track maintenance day and night. Hire
outside contractors and have buses transporting people from stations if need be
The rerouting of the D and H line to Union during the first phase of the rail reconstruction project was extremely
beneficial for me. I was able to catch a train downtown essentially every 5-10 min. It was such a luxury! Now that
phase 1 has been completed and just the E goes to Union, I find myself catching trains earlier than I would need
to due to concerns with delays. I could miss a train and the next one doesn’t come for another 30 min, not
including whatever additional delays could be potentially setting the arrival back. Those 30-50 min could be the
difference of me making a flight or not. Increased frequency of the E would be greatly appreciated.
Shockingly, more consistent service means better connections for people who plan their work commute using
RTD. Who would have thought?
I'm excited that you're moving back to 15 minute intervals, at least on paper. But I'm extremely skeptical that it can
actually be implemented, given that there are cancelations almost every single day due to no drivers being
available. I'd rather have less service that is 100% reliable, than have more service that is only 25% reliable.
I think higher frequency results in not needing to check the schedule before using transit. This is a big factor in
increasing ridership. Public transit should be easy to use and this is a great improvement.
FREAKIN FINALLY. Trains that run on time? Yes please. I could actually use this to commute to Boulder daily
Before the pandemic we used to have a 10 minute option to go from Ball Arena to Arapahoe. I could use E line or
F line. Those were the good times. But having every 15 minutes is acceptable and will encourage more people to
use the train.
The E line has been very unreliable recently, so increasing service will be great for me and for the people who
need it for their commutes.
15 min headway's would make it rideable again. I haven’t been able to count on train since headways were
increased because it’s hard to count on trains. Longer headways also made for difficult airport timing for both the
a line and the express busses
Given limited service lately we have had to drive when we would have preferred the train. Every 15 min would
change that!!

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

This is what it was prior to September change and never should have dropped to every 30 minutes. The first time
I tried to catch a 30 minute one it was cancelled...so that means every 60 minutes!! In over 25 years of riding RTD
it has been the worst and most unreliable the past two months. This is not a way to increase ridership.

15 minute frequency on the E & H Lines will be a profound improvement. But scheduled frequency means nothing
without reliability. Since the September service changes, both the E & H lines moved to 30 minute frequency, but I
find they are just as unreliable as over the summer. Trains are regularly cancelled and frequently very late. The
real time tracking is often inaccurate, when it’s available at all. I want frequent service, but I need service I can
rely on.
Thank you for reinstating the 15 minute service frequency of the E line, it will make traveling using the RTD
system much better for a lot of people, myself included. I notice that schedule adjustments are also going to be
made, which I have some constructive feedback for. Please try to adjust the schedule for trains departing on the
south bound tracks (E, W, etc.) in a way that makes transfers more reliable for folks taking other commuter lines
in (N, A, 120X, etc.). A lot of customers who ride the E and W lines are transferring from lines from the other part
of the metropolitan area, and the current schedule often only allows a minute or two to make a transfer, which is
not feasible, considering the southbound trains board 2 blocks away. Adjusting the departure times of south
bound trains to accommodate for these folks would improve the transit experience for them, without really
impacting riders whose original destination does not require a train or bus ride to get into Union station.
Thank you.
I used to take light rail all the time, but then found I had no ability to predict when it was coming next, and it was
often late or slower than biking. So I'll be glad to go back to taking the light rail
The E Line really serves many passengers and sometimes the trains have standing room only when I use this
service. This is much appreciated! I look forward to this service change! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
The long wait has been killing me so it arriving every 15 min will be such an effective change.
YESSSSS THANK YOU!!!!
The 30-minute service frequency on the E Line makes commuting between DTC (where I live) and the downtown
business district (where I work) extremely challenging. I strongly prefer riding the train to driving, but it is difficult to
justify doing so when I cannot reliably connect from the D or H Line to the E Line without getting stranded at a
station for up to 30 minutes (or, god forbid, up to an hour if a trip is canceled). Restoring 15-minute headways
would give me a lot more confidence that I can get from home to work and back without wasting a huge chunk of
my day waiting for a train to arrive.
Thank you for increasing the service interval for the E line but my community would rather have the return of the
C line service to Union station. This would increase train frequncy to Union station and improve accessiblity to this
destination that does not rely on mulitple transfers.
We chose to live where we do based upon having frequent service on these lines to downtown. It's important to
return to the 15 minute headways.
Hello - I am slightly concerned about how reliable going back to the every 15 minute schedule will be. There have
been a lot of route cancellations in the last 2 years over insufficient staffing, and the slow zones have made the
routes not so reliable. Can you please keep us up to date in case there might be a struggle transition period still in
Jan 2025?
I would love for my regular transit method to go back to every 15 minutes - these days I get to work faster via bike
because of those slow zones - but am nervous that it will be unreliable still

Should be 5-10 minutes.
RTD cant even operate the 30 minute schedule it has now for the E line.
RTD service is a joke!
You should be embarrassed about the service that your provide!
I think it is a mistake to increase frequencies on the E and H lines again until RTD has enough operators to
consistently operate all scheduled light rail services. Even at the current 30 minute frequencies, services are
routinely being cancelled due to the operator shortage, and these cancellations often mean that it is just easier to
take a few buses rather than waiting to see if the light rail service will actually show up or not. The frequencies
should stay where they are until there are enough operators to consistently operate the scheduled service.
Thank you for providing more service, including longer availability during the day and more frequency, to make
taking transit a more convenient option.
We need an easy to west connection on Arapahoe. Serve the business parks.
Restoring service to 15 minute intervals is a huge step in the right direction. Once the slowdowns are corrected, I
hope RTD can begin to restore trust in the consistency of service to the these parts of the metro.
Yes! All light rail lines should be 15 or less headways
This is the most important service improvement to me
15 minute frequency would be the most absolute perfect change this city could make on the E train line especially
with everyone going south to work
Please prioritize service reliability as well. Does going back to 15 minute frequencies mean an increase in
cancelations due to lack of available operators? I was never confident in the ability to shift from hourly to 15
minutes this fall, even before the slow zones and 30 min frequency. Please only set this schedule if you are
confident you can keep trains running to the posted schedule.
Having the 15 minute increments back will help tremendously.
As a part time student that lives on the I-25 corridor this will massively improve my transportation experience and
will add an hour of studying back into my schedule. Thank you to all the workers that made it possible to resume
15 minute frequencies
I am hopeful this increase in timing will help mitigate the time I wait to get home. The 30 minute schedule paired
with the continued delays north can cause me to wait and extra 30-60 minutes for a train home from work. This is
further impacted by the increased ridership during game nights at all the arenas.

Why are there not east-west routes for every station south of Evans? How can we have a complete network if we
must rely only on the empirically unreliable rails to reach these stations? Dry Creek station is an unconnected
island for example

My daughter rides E LIne to MSU, and returning to the previous frequency will be very convenient for us.

This would be a great benefit to me and many other riders who take the E line to commute. It would make
connecting to any bus or other rail line much more feasible, as some connections required a wait of 30 minutes or
more during this summer when service was reduced to one train every hour. I think it would also greatly help
decrease crowdedness on trains during peak hours, especially on days when many people are taking the E line
downtown for sporting events. I hope that RTD is able to honor this promise of increased reliablility by also
ensuring there are enough drivers.
I would much rather have faster trains than more frequent service. If this route could take you from ridgegate to
union in 20 minutes it would have much more passengers.
Returning to 15 min frequency might help timeliness
Increasing to every 15 minutes would be a Godsend. Right now the service is so unreliable that I am
contemplating stopping taking the light rail. When the train only comes every thirty minutes and you never know
when that is going to be, it makes it impossible to plan your day.
I would rather you keep it every 30 minutes if you can't staff enough trains for every 15 minutes. Also if the
slowdowns will still occur there's no reason to have every 15 minutes. Please fix the slowdowns and the
cancelations before adding more trains.
Please increase to 15 minutes my job would very much appreciate it.
For the love of God please keep it at 15 minutes
Yes
This would make the line rideable again
PLEASE finish the repairs quickly to the tracks to eliminate the slow zones that have made trains late and
unreliable all summer. Also figure out how to hire and retain operators so trains aren’t cancelled due to no
operator available.
Especially at peak hours, 15 minute frequency is desperately needed
I live in Denver and I work at Charles Schwab in Lonetree. I have really been wanting to use the E Line to
commute to and from work but have not been able to do so. This increase would greatly help, but I cannot rely on
the light rail to get to and from work until the frequent service delays stop. I need assurance I will not be late for
my job. If there is a delay, I would appreciate better communication to plan ahead for this. Currently, the listed
times are inaccurate and it breaks trust for potential riders. Many of my colleagues share this sentiment. We wish
to ride the E Line but right now we can’t trust that we will arrive at the scheduled time.
This change would allow those like me to very reliably not only get to where I need to in a timely manor in any
direction but also decrease congestion on trains
Please bring back the F line from Ridgegate

Coming from west Denver (W line), increased service is very helpful to get around Denver. Large wait times at
Auraria west station were common with longer gaps in service of E line
Every 15 minutes on the E line would be great for connection from commuter rail lines
Good job on this change! Very much needed! We would also like to see the F line reinstated from the Lone tree
area to the downtown loop (18th and California).
Bringing back more frequent and reliable rail service would be great. I know many who have lost faith in the
reliability of this line but this could make a huge impact towards improving that confidence in transit riders.
I use the train exclusively to get to work and 15 minute intervals fits this need much better.
This would allow me to get to work on time every day. With the current schedule I have to get there 30 minutes
early or 15 minutes late.
This is fantastic but only if it can be maintained. If trips are getting canceled on a daily business this doesn't help
riders. Please expand the schedule but hold to it!
Southmoor to Colorado Slow Zone makes time much slower, need it to be finished fast.
This allows me more flexibility on my commute. I go from Castle Rock to Union Station every day, so having a 15
minute interval means I'd be better able to meet my home and work commitments. However, better planning for
operators is needed, too
Lots of work commuters use this line and the current 30 min can make getting to work or heading home on time
harder. 15 min would greatly increase reliability and make the train the more convenient travel method
Please reinstate 15 service. I stopped using once the line switch to every 30 minutes as it is very difficult to plan
around
Please also increase speed of travel to pre-construction levels; the light rail used to be the most time-efficient way
to travel 1 or 2 stops down the light rail, but it isn't at the moment
Sometimes the 483 bus does not always align with the arrival of the E line. This change would increase my
options for using the 483. It would also reduce total travel time and waiting time.
Looking forward to having more options!
Please. Please. Make the E line usable again. I've wasted so much time over the last year, between the coping
panels and the slowzones and the hourly headway times. Please go back to 4x/hour!

I appreciate the service increase, I take the E/H from 10th & Osage to Southmoor every day for work this would
benefit me a lot. I hope there is enough staff to implement this successfully without lots of canceled trains as
reliability is as important as frequency. Also please ensure Google Maps real-time info is accurate.

This route is already well served by the AB1 (and by the FF1 with a transfer to the A line) and it would be a better
use of RTD's resources to create new routes or increase frequency in under serviced areas.
Yes please!
Same as my comments about AB1 - there is just not adequate vehicle capacity nor late-night options on this route
to make it a reliable option to those of us traveling to the airport. When it works, it works great. When you get left
on the curb because there's not enough room, it is a real emergency to find alternate travel options.
Everyone I know that uses the bus loves it!!!
This will lessen the burden on the AB1 which was previously far too infrequent.

I've been on very overcrowded morning buses to the airport from Table Mesa Park and Ride. I'm glad there will be
more frequent service at peak times. Also very glad to read that service to and from the airport will go later, as I've
arrived at DIA after 11:00 a few times and either had to Uber home, or drive the car to long term parking prior to
the trip in order to be able to get home. There seem to be many arrivals at the airport after 11, and other modes of
getting to Boulder also peter out at about 11. These are welcome changes.
We as a community love this bus. It provides us a quick and safe transport to the airport.
I relied on the AB1 to get to the airport extensively when living in Boulder, but I now live in Longmont which the
route doesn’t serve. In addition to AB1/2, having a new airport bus route that serves Longmont would be an
excellent addition to RTD services
I think this will help ease the congestion on the AB busses, allowing folks at the MCaslin and Broomfield stops to
be able to board buses that aren’t overfull or completely full, as has happened the last few times I’ve tried to take
the bus to the airport.
This would be amazing to have express option.
Many of us use RTD for our travel, this helps the commuters.
Please see prior comments for the AB1 route changes - they are the same for this route. Basically, I have seen
many people forced to stand for over 35 mins of the route, and I would appreciate more frequency.
This bus is frequently full and needs additional times traveling both directions. It frequently can not accept
passengers because the bus is full. An additional bus both directions will alleviate customer demand
This potentially means that I would not have to take a car from Glenwood Grove to Table Mesa Park and Ride to
catch the AB bus. It is VERY inconvenient and time consuming to take 205 to downtown and have to have all the
stops along the way on 205 and AB bus from downtown, not to mention the challenge of bringing luggage on the
205. At least the Boulder Junction option allows only taking 205 to the 28th and Canyon stop to do a transfer. I am
hopeful the timing will work out for the transfer.
I do not understand why the AB2 line will run only at peak times. Anyone riding AB knows that peak time includes
evenings and often late night as well. The AB2 route should expand to evening and night service as quickly as
possible. If not 2025, then 2026 for sure once the demand is proven.
Why the Route AB2 does not stop in Longmont to pick up or drop off passengers.
Thank you
Looks good
Thank you! The airport buses are always full, and increased service would make it more convenient :)
Would consider AB2 and RTD for airport travel again.

I miss the AB2. It was super convenient when it existed! (also, if it had a later route that would be super
appreciated as well). Thank you!

Please don't decrease service to South Broadway on the AB1
This should help with the frequency from table mesa.
The AB2 is often quite crowded and it is common for a significant number of passengers to have to stand. I am 81
years old and would really like to have a seat for the ride to the airport. I rely on RTD for my DIA transportation.
Concerned the AB2 has been modified and will not have service to/from Boulder Junction - disappointing and
causes more community uncertainty about when RTD will restore services at Boulder Junction.
Why isn't this starting from the Boulder Junction?
Would support if also had a stop at table mesa
The AB bus routes are a god send, and the more accessibility, the better.
Boulder to DIA buses are often very crowded. More bus routes will make travel to airport more convenient.
I would probably take this bus! Please make it connect well with the Dash and I'm there :)
I usually get on at table mesa, so it sounds like this does not impact me. Why not Boulder Junction Depot
instead? That would be more convenient.
I ride the AB to and from the airport with some frequency. It would be very convenient if the schedule were
increased.
Any additional AB services will be a huge improvement for the entire AB system.
More frequency from Table Mesa is excellent. It would be helpful to re-open the closed bus station at the depot
square area. There are tons of people living in that area and it's easy to uber to most businesses around boulder
from there or Table Mesa P&R.
This is great for us near Canyon!!!
Let’s do it!!’
Please re-open Boulder Junction station and re-start service from there. That area is very poorly served by public
transit, and I would be able to use RTD transit much easier if it was open.
28th and Canyon so far from Boulder Junction, even if the station can't be opened immediately, please move the
stops closer.

I used to take the AB2 mostly back when it ran, the 28th st stops will be much appreciated to have back!
More buses between boulder and the airport!
Help me understand what happens once people get to Table Mesa. Are you dropping them off at Table Mesa?
Isn’t the route to the airport?
More buses and routes, including express routes to the airport, would be great. Please provide some express
routes that people come to one place and you have a bus full rather than multiple stops.
I would take this or the ab1
More frequent busses to/from the airport will be very welcome!
Expanding bus service frequency between Boulder and Denver Airport is a crucial step toward enhancing regional
connectivity and sustainability. Increased bus frequency would provide a reliable and convenient transportation
option for travelers, reducing the reliance on personal vehicles. This shift not only alleviates traffic congestion on
the I-25 corridor but also significantly decreases greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with broader environmental
goals. Moreover, a more robust public transit option would serve students, professionals, and tourists alike,
making travel more accessible and affordable for all demographics.
In addition to environmental benefits, expanding bus service frequency can stimulate local economies. Enhanced
connectivity can attract more visitors to Boulder’s attractions and businesses, while also providing Boulder
residents with easier access to the economic opportunities available in Denver. Improved bus service can also
reduce parking pressures at the airport, making travel smoother for everyone. By investing in public transit
infrastructure, we can create a more integrated transportation network that not only meets current demands but
anticipates future growth, ultimately fostering a healthier, more sustainable urban ecosystem.
This is an amazing change. More service is highly welcomed!!
Please please PLEASE re-open Boulder Depot and have either AB1 or AB2 start/end here - incredibly useful bus
line prior to COVID and it is sorely missed.
I walk to pick up the AB, and a pickup on 28th@Canyon is .7 miles closer to where I live, which is great!
Hopefully some day this bus can pick up at or near Boulder Junction again.
Having the service cancelled negatively impacted my ability to get to the airport. Maybe if you could offset
departure times with the downtown station the service would be more valuable.

AB1 buses are very full, to the point where I have concerns if there's going to be space. Having another route to
service Boulder is very welcome and provides more options to get the to airport.
This should provide for stops along the way, like at Broadway & Table Mesa. The Park-n-Ride at 36 & Table Mesa
is too risky for theft of entire car or car parts. Make that great parking garage secure!!!
A direct route would be a welcome addition!
This would help everyone at times that are high demand for the route to the airport.
I support this change, but as someone who lives near the Lafayette park and ride there are no good ways for me
to use RTD to get to the airport. If RTD is going to consider adding a modified Boulder/Airport route it would be
nice if one consider the needs of Boulder's suburbs.
Would AB2 proceed then from Table Mesa to the airport?
Having additional service routes to DIA from Boulder would be very welcomed, I have to take anywhere between
6-10 flights a year and having a more sustainable way to park and take a bus into DIA would be so helpful.
this is sorely needed, thank you!
Bus between Boulder and DIA needs to be more frequent - people not being allowed to board due to full is totally
unsat - NOT OK for people to miss s flight due to bus. People having to stand the entire way is also unsat and
potentially dangerous.
Bus should run 24/7 in my opinion - there is such a thing as a delayed or simply late flight that gets into DIA at
midnight, etc. Unsat to have to shell out $100 to taxi due to lack of bus. Unsat to have to wait in airport for hours
until bus resumes service the next day.
This increased service will help me and others be more confident that there will be an available bus when we
need to go to the airport
This would help reduce the load on the AB1 bus, which is almost always packed at peak times
Like the proposed changes to AB1, this will make air travel much much easier. I live on this proposed new route
and will be happy to have the additional option.
More routes to/from Boulder/DIA will encourage more riders and increase the confidence that riders will actually
be able to get on the bus wherever their closest stop is and make it to DIA/Boulder promptly
I’ve only ever had good experiences taking the AB1 route to the airport and back and imagine that I will eventually
ride AB2 and encourage friends and relatives who come to visit me to do the same.

Reopen Boulder Junction. We paid for it; open it and run AB2 from it. While you're at it, reinstate FF4. It's
embarrassing that Boulder Junction remains closed, especially as the transit oriented development around it has
grown substantially despite the transit part being a lie.
Traffic is bad on this street and I support bringing more bus transit to keep the roads moving!
We would really like a stop at I25 and E 450 interchange.
YAY- thank you
Thank you for providing more service, including longer availability during the day and more frequency, to make
taking transit a more convenient option.
1) This route connects the airport to an area that doesn't have easy access to the A Line or other options which is
extremely beneficial for people coming from both directions
2) Increased frequency equals improved convenience which is what is required to improve ridership, NOT the
other way around
3) This route and improved convenience will further alleviate car traffic for those who still want or need to drive
Thank you for any and all increased service frequency on the AB routes. Buses are often standing room only
which is dangerous and makes travel with children difficult!
Please reopen Boulder junction station, and have the AB2 bus start there. There's so much housing being built
there but poor transit service. I live walking distance from that station but can't easily or quickly get access to the
AB or FF buses.
28th & Canyon is already closer to the downtown station, so it's hardly helping much to have the AB2 start there.
Increasing frequency/capacity is sorely needed as riders are often turned away at peak hours.
Same as previous
As a former user of the old AB2 route (from Boulder Junction), I am somewhat enthused to see a return of AB2 in
any form... though its usefulness will probably depend on the exact route. If I am able to use AB2 directly without
needing to go to downtown Boulder, it will be incredibly useful.
Having more busses, and also busses nearer to my house are great
I am happy to see service finally being increased to the Airport!
This would be great! I have to walk about 20 minutes to the Downtown Boulder Station to catch the AB1, so being
able to walk less than 10 minutes to get the AB2 would be a big improvement!

Having access to usable transit options requires that transit to come at a rate where it is useful to many groups of
people and more time options is an essential part of that. It is difficult to catch a transit option that does not come
frequently as the time may not work for many people's schedules. Adding increased service frequency is vital to
many transit users in making lines actually usable for them.

Anything that increases the frequency of buses between Boulder and the airport is a positive change. Judging
from the number of times I’ve been on the AB with standing room only, there is clearly demand for more buses.
Thank you for this change!
This is going to be a significant improvement to the airport transit as a resident living near 30th and Colorado.
Previously we had to walk over to Broadway and it was a hassle particularly in early morning time. We would
greatly benefit from this AB2 bus, and it would be even better if it offered early morning (3-4 am) service to DIA
and late night (11pm - 1am) service from DIA.
Great that this new route will result in some 30-minute headways from Table Mesa PnR. While I agree that
running a bus down Canyon and then 28th Street will be helpful, I still think that you need to restore the old AB2,
which started at the now completely unused Boulder Junction terminal.
Yes please we need this.
I’m very excited for this route since I live right off canyon blvd. An alternate route will make service even more
convenient for me.
There are riders of the AB bus who come in from Gunbarrel, Niwot, and Longmont. There are users of the AB bus
who live or work in Boulder Junction. While I appreciate bringing some service a bit east and serving the 28th
STreet corridor, I don't understand why RTD is not bringing the bus by Boulder Junction. Residents of this area
have virtually no transit, despite living in a transit oriented community. These people don't need to park for the
bus, they need a bus that brings them where they live.
Those of us who live north, just need a simple connection in to town to catch or come home from the airport bus.
I've found that if I have to drive and I park at Table Mesa, I can be home in the time the bus takes to get to
downtown Boulder. Other riders have taken the bus to stops like 28th & Canyon where they can get off the Bolt
and make a quick connection to the AB bus. Let's try to make this easier to be more attractive to users.
For my most recent trip, we got an overpriced Lyft to get to Table Mesa then take the bus to the airport. Busing all
the way would have added an hour in the morning. On the way home we were pleasantly surprised that we did
make the Bolt bus home. Despite the schedule saying we had ten minutes for the connection, the full bus that day
gave us only three minutes for the connection.
I've talked to many people living northeast of Boulder who would love to use the airport bus more often but want
the connections to be easier. I'm hoping that the timing of the AB2 will be such that one can confidently take the
205 or Bolt and make the transfer and save us from traveling all the way downtown
This will be amazing to have increased service to and from the airport--so happy to see this come back!
Downtown Boulder station AND table mesa station are already served by the AB1. Trips to the airport can also be
made via the FF1/FF2 and the A from both these stations. It seems like these service hours could be better used
for service improvements in Boulder or additional Intercity routes.

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

Please increase service frequency! Half hour frequency is much needed on this crowded line. I also appreciate
extending service past midnight, but a WB (DEN to Boulder) line would be much more valuable after midnight
than EB (Boulder to DEN), which is proposed, since few flights depart so late but many arrive late.

Similar to my last answer, I take the light rail as an alternative to the bus, and theoretically it should be faster but
sometimes both the light rail and bus are equally slow or infrequent. I would really like if frequency was increased
even more than 15 minutes to guarantee reliability, but this change would still be a big improvement to still
improve efficiency
I am a student and I have suffered alot from those long wait times of RTD and the very few times that the train
come,
The unreliability of the train slow downs has made it impossible to plan accordingly. The train shows up when it

Current delays due to track maint have been a challenge. Hire more drivers. I had to catch the D line and have
my wife pick me up today due to cancellations. I live a block from the Dayton station so it is easy for me to ride
when the trains are on time
I'll believe your
trains will be on time when I see it happen. You're just gonna cancel every other
like you do now so who gives a flying fuck!?
The increased frequency will allow me to once again use the service without a lot of challenges, delays, and
waiting.
This is a good change, but most importantly, digital schedules and tracking apps need to be updated to match
with the new times. They are close to useless at the moment because they are very unreliable and inaccurate,
which often results in missed departures.
It's about time
I used to take this train every day but it has become unreliable so I’ve been walking over a mile to bus for the past
few months. Higher frequency will be great, but more important is that the RTD app and Google maps time of
train arrival is accurate
15 min should be a minimum
Light rail for E and H is HORRIBLE at the moment. Has been useless for two years. This would be great
improvement!! I could take public transport to work again
Thank you for proposing to reinstate the 15-minute increment for these trains. Please also consider doing the
same for the R line, which runs so seldom it's not worth taking.
Yes please! Too many of us have had to be late for work or college classes due to random missing scheduled
rides or trams being ridiculously late!

I look forward to faster service and the return to downtown.

New temporary schedule now. Your riders won't wait till January. The drop in ridership won't bounce back unless
RTD is actually communicating about the schedule. "Delays up to 30 minutes" when you know where and how
long the speed restrictions are is unacceptable
I can't wait till all the lightrail trains are back running every 15 minutes. I've been so frustrated with the slow downs
and cancelation. It's been a hassle to get anywhere under 2 hours if you're using the train.
This would be GREAT!!!! thanks 🤞
Please reinstate 15-minute service frequency! This will drastically improve the commute experience of H Line
riders.
Any improvements to service on this route are a benefit to commuters. I would hope it increases ridership. While I
do not use RTD frequently, it is a good way to get into the city without driving.
RTD will never be able to maintain the every 15 minute schedule. RTD is currently unable to maintain the every
30 minute schedule. This will just have passengers stranded due to cancellations. Also the speed restrictions
seem to be permanent, but RTD will not accommodate them in the schedule. I used to use the H line, it is so
unreliable now I can’t use it to get to work.
H line should never be less than 15 minute intervals, I understand alot of students use this route but so do a lot of
professionals so reducing it to 1 hour every summer makes it impossible to use. With denver becoming
increasingly more expensive, professionals are moving to Aurora more and more and this train line is crucial to
serving those people and getting them downtown. Back to 15 minutes is something that should never change
This change will give ease to many college students who use the H line to get to and from class everyday. Less
wait times can allow for more time to be dedicated to school work.
This directly serves our office bldg. Greater frequency and reliability may improve usage and demand of RTD rail
services by employees. We are looking to renew our RTD Eco pass but employees don't use it much as its
unreliable and there are not many trips offered.
I haven’t taken the H line (which is my main line) for 3 months due to the timing of the line and required transfer
heading north on the R line. I would return to taking the light rail with the service increase.
I use the H line often. I am 73. The wait time this past 10 months has been almost inhumane. How about shorter
trains and more frequent service.
PLEASE increase it to 15 minute frequency. This would help so much. Thank you very much.
Again.... It will be positive if the trains will run on schedule, but that has not been the case for some time. The H
has been so bad for months. Incredibly late trains and dropped trips are the norm, often with no notifications or
Service Alerts being sent. Will this change actually increase the likelihood of trains running on time?

I am a student that commutes to my University everyday. Sometimes I have 8 am classes that are in person. I
really appreciate H line as it helps me get to my school in a timely manner. Although an issue I have been running
into is the fact that there are cancellations which therein has me late to class. I know there has been some
change on what frequency works, it would be beneficial to know just the reliability that my train won't get
cancelled. As a student I really enjoy your new Youth Pass initiative, it has changed many lives including mine.
Thank you for all you do RTD!
The H line frequency was going to be increased from 15 min intervals to now remaining at 30 min intervals.
Please add a train that gets downtown to 18th & Cal that “arrives” at 6:57 AM! It’s insane that every :27 & :57 after
the hour have an arrival except 6:57 AM. Does RTD not think that people start work at 7 AM downtown? Because
of the unreliability of the schedules it is not efficient to take the E line and connect to the D line at Broadway since
the E is never on time as well. Thank you!
The H line is the easiest way to currently get to aurora for me by rail. The H line staying at 30-minute frequencies I
feel will hurt the aurora and the southeast corridor. I'm just wondering when the 15-minute frequency will be
added back to the H line.
The trains are currently running 20-30 min late. Some of the earlier morning trains simply get skipped, and two
will come in succession within 10 minutes. It’s super hard to estimate when the train will come and accordingly
come to the station on time, I usually end up sitting at the station for 20-30 minutes.
I know you’re short staffed so you can’t really do much but we would love some consistency on times. Every 30
minutes works fine and I would even settle back to the every hour one but so many of my trains get cancelled
randomly with no warning. This really sucks because it’s made me late to classes which I really can’t afford
anymore, and I don’t have time to show up at the station two hours before hand just in case the train gets delayed
again. The H line also needs more carts, even one more would make a huge difference. It’s one of the most
popular college lines and is constantly overflowing with people.
I used to take the H line daily. However, when the schedule was reduced and then the reliability of the E line
showing up on time became nonexistent, I could no longer count on the H line to get to/from downtown, so I
ended up purchasing a vehicle instead, which puts additional vehicles on our already crowded roads!
The schedules should be adjusted to better reflect delays please!
Please bring back the H Line every 15 minutes!
I use to take this line to work and home every day. However, it’s been so bad that I had to find alternative routes
to get to work and home. They are not running according to the schedule posted. Sometimes, I would be waiting
almost an hour for one. It use to be 45 minute commute. Now its almost two hours to commute. I understand the
slow zones and construction is necessary. But for no train to be running is insane. I have only seen the D Line
and E Line running more consistently. The H line serves a lot of students and people who need it to commute to
downtown. The 30 minute intervals were a good start after the construction was done. However, it has not been
happening. It is more like every hour or two. If it cant go back to being every 15 minutes, that’s fine. Please find a
way for it to at least follow the 30 minute. I appreciate RTD and for it getting me places where I need to be. I am
just hoping the H Line can improve.

Finally!!!

These lines are so important for my commute and seeing family. The 15-minute frequency would reduce my wait
time.
Could you let me know if the speed restrictions will be lifted?
Thank you, increased frequency is very helpful for me and my family!
More frequent stop times mean the trains are actually useable
RTD can do a better job of running a few extra trains after big events (coors field, ball arena, empower) to help
encourage more transit. Sometimes I have to wait 30-40 minutes for a train after an avalanche or nuggets game.
Same for leaving a Rockies game. If a night game ends after walking to Union Station it’s a 30’ minute wait if I’m
lucky. I can usually take D,E, or H trains back to my stop at Alameda station. But others don’t take the train
specifically because it takes too long to get home from events.
Increased frequency is always good!
I’ll be able to ride to MSU for classes reliably again. The unreliability that came with 30 minute made me drive
instead.
15 minute frequency is the absolute minimum to make this route rideable to the general public.
Please follow-through with re-instating 15-minute service frequency on this rail line. I really want to use the train to
commute downtown, but with current level of service and unreliability of schedule with the derated tracks and
slow zones it can be unusable and often leads to me adding to traffic on I-25.
Shut down lines for a temporary amount of time so work can be focused on fixing the slow zones. Have a bus
transport people while the maintenance is ongoing. Hire outside contractors to facilitate the process of
maintenance on the tracks
It's unclear to me if this change also means that the horrible slow speed zones will end. If they do end, then this
service change will really help me in my commute to downtown Denver. I hate driving there, and the H Line is
very close to my home. The more frequent trains make it easier for me to use the H Line to get to weekly
community events I attend.
I'm excited that you're moving back to 15 minute intervals, at least on paper. But I'm extremely skeptical that it can
actually be implemented, given that there are cancelations almost every single day due to no drivers being
available. I'd rather have less service that is 100% reliable, than have more service that is only 25% reliable. You
are losing longtime customers like me who have reverted back to driving into downtown because of how
unreliable the H line schedule is. I can only take lightrail when my arrival time is unimportant. Rush hour traffic on
I-25 has become more reliable when I need to be on time.

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

Would rather train go to union station

I used to take the H line from 9 Mile to downtown every work day. Then with all of the maintenance I started
driving again. Now with the increased every 15 minute frequency I will be trying the light rail again. Thank you!

I think it would be amazing to increase frequency and also the SPEED pls it should not be taking me ONE HOUR
to get from illif station to colfax at auraria not only that but instead of focusing on changes in Jan 2025 you should
be fixing the unreliability of the H line now because I rely on it every single day and yet half of the time it’s over 1
hour late, 4 schedules H line trains just don’t even show up and that is a big problem because I have stuff to do
and places to be yet I can’t because the H line is
and never on time it’s always always late and not even by
15 minutes no no it’s ONE HOUR LATE and that is unacceptable you cannot promise what you can’t keep like not
only me but other people rely on this h line for work now what are they supposed to tell their bosses oh the train
took over an hour no that’s not a reasonable excuse especially with the amount of times it’s been happening
recently just absolutely unacceptable and this must be fixed as soon as possible
This will make me use the lightrail again
FREAKIN FINALLY. Trains that run on time? Yes please.
Same as for e line. E and h are the lines I use most. I can use them to get to work but with the long headways it’s
been impossible. I also use them to get to the a train or the express airport busses and shorter headways would
make it so I can use the train again and not have to park at the airport where spots often fill up
Would make it much easier to opt not to drive.
Thank you for decreasing wait times!
15 minute frequency on the E & H Lines will be a profound improvement. But scheduled frequency means nothing
without reliability. Since the September service changes, both the E & H lines moved to 30 minute frequency, but I
find they are just as unreliable as over the summer. Trains are regularly cancelled and frequently very late. The
real time tracking is often inaccurate, when it’s available at all. I want frequent service, but I need service I can
rely on.
The 30-minute service frequency on the H Line makes commuting between DTC (where I live) and the downtown
business district (where I work) extremely challenging. I strongly prefer riding the train to driving, but it is difficult to
justify doing so when I cannot reliably connect from the D or H Line to the E Line without getting stranded at a
station for up to 30 minutes (or, god forbid, up to an hour if a trip is canceled). Restoring 15-minute headways
would give me a lot more confidence that I can get from home to work and back without wasting a huge chunk of
my day waiting for a train to arrive.
On days where the D Line is down/experiencing disruptions or station closures, the H Line becomes my go-to
choice. However, that becomes everyone else's choice too, and the trains get to be incredibly packed. There have
been times where I have not been able to physically get onto the train because there are so many people on
board. Hopefully the increased frequency will alleviate that.
We chose our living location based upon these frequent headways on these H/E lines. It's important that they are
being restored.

E/H line are both routes I typically take for work, though not for the last couple years due to the slow zones, route
repairs, and even more so the lack of drivers to properly staff all the trains. I am super excited to see these guys
going back to their normal schedule, but I am also very nervous that the slow zones and driver shorter may still be
a big impact in Jan 2025. Can you keep up the communication so we had have the most up to date status news
going into 2025 for this transition!
I am an eager watcher on the slow zone maps as they improve, but so far the E/H slow zones near me have not
made any improvements yet.
Should be 5-10 minutes.
I think it is a mistake to increase frequencies on the E and H lines again until RTD has enough operators to
consistently operate all scheduled light rail services. Even at the current 30 minute frequencies, services are
routinely being cancelled due to the operator shortage, and these cancellations often mean that it is just easier to
take a few buses rather than waiting to see if the light rail service will actually show up or not. The frequencies
should stay where they are until there are enough operators to consistently operate the scheduled service.
Restoring service to 15 minute intervals is a huge step in the right direction. Once the slowdowns are corrected, I
hope RTD can begin to restore trust in the consistency of service to the these parts of the metro.
Yes, 15 minutes or less headways should be the standard.
Same as E line
You need to reinstate the 15 minute intervals as people rely on your service for employment. You are public
transport but you act like you just a just there for tax money. People rely on your service and you continue to drop
the ball
Again faster trains more important than more service.
Increase reliability - I take the train from the Auraria station and sometimes it doesn’t even come or it’s 30-40 mins
late
Would be helpful for students
I am looking forward to the train to be back on regular schedule
The shorter wait times and more consistent service would be great!
I appreciate the service increase, I take the E/H from 10th & Osage to Southmoor every day for work this would
benefit me a lot. I hope there is enough staff to implement this successfully without lots of canceled trains as
reliability is as important as frequency. Also please ensure Google Maps real-time info is accurate.
More frequent trains are essential.
I use the train exclusively to get to work and 15 minute intervals fits this need much better.

Can you please use the same light rail schedule that was in effect before the shutdown of the D Line that started
in May 2024 that lasted through September 2024? I take the 402L bus to the Mineral station and the light rail
schedule that was in effect prior to May 2024 worked really well with the arrival and departure time of the 402L.
Now, if the 402L is just a few minutes late to arrive to the Mineral station, I will have to wait 15 minutes for the next
light rail train. For example, I take the 402L that is scheduled to arrive at Mineral station at 8:14 with the D Line
leaving at 8:18. If the 402L is late by just 2 minutes, that will not provide me enough time to walk from the bus
stop, walk the bridge over Santa Fe and then down to the light rail. I would then have to wait until 8:33 for the next
light rail and that causes me to be an additional 15 minutes late for work. Prior to May 2024, I think there was a
light rail that left Mineral station around the 8:20 or so mark -- that worked really well if the 402L was running late.
It feels like the scheduling of the light rail does not always take into consideration that some riders have
connecting buses and the departure times of the light rail do not line up very well. Thank you.
I'll believe your
trains will be on time when I see it happen. You're just gonna cancel every other
like you do now so who gives a flying
?
There is not enough information about what the proposed change is. Please provide more information
Please bring back the C Line from Littleton to Union Station!
I really appreciate the light rail from Littleton to downtown. I miss having the C Line that would take me directly
from Littleton to Union Station, but understand Covid changed everything and the frequency of riders has to be
taken into account. That being said, I like that the D line is also very convenient and only minor changes to the
schedule are appreciated.
Would really like to see more predictable, on time service for this line.
Also appreciate the route moving back to its usual route instead of Union station
This would be beneficial to all the commuters and students from Auraria Campis. Thank you!!
please keep D at union station..much better and more direct connections...at least at some times and/or reinstate
C
You keep cutting/ eliminating train schedules what used to be a 45 minute commute before the pandemic is now
over an hour. My options to get from Englewood to Downtown went from about 5 options between D and C lines
to 2 D line options now. Bring the C and F line back....you would have more riders
You need to post a temporary schedule between now and January. RTD is unreasonably unreliable with the
posted schedules being wrong for 4 months due to speed restrictions
I can't wait till all the lightrail trains are back running every 15 minutes. I've been so frustrated with the slow downs
and cancelation. It's been a hassle to get anywhere under 2 hours if you're using the train.
This directly serves our office bldg. Greater frequency and reliability may improve usage and demand of RTD rail
services by employees. We are looking to renew our RTD Eco pass but employees don't use it much as its
unreliable and there are not many trips offered.

15 minute timing needs to be reinstated for this line too! Increasing the frequency of trains from the east side of
town leaves a significant amount of riders in a lurch

Please add back an earlier morning train, about six months ago there was like a 4:19 am from Mineral, then a
4:49 am and 5:19 am or something close to that. Now the earliest train is 5:19 and with the incredibly long and
timely slow zones we cannot make it to work by 6 am
Well your changes outlined are very vague, but I know that how slowly D line has been moving has made me late
many times. So I hope the timing improves and gets faster and that you stop skipping trains mid morning.
Your service from Spring to now has been unreliable and made my day longer every day I take the train. Union
Station was terrible. My commute was 1.5 hours of transportation, sitting on a train and then bus. Waiting for a
train or bus times included. Months of this to be told everything would be normal in late September. We still have
unreliable trains that make the train ride 60-90 minutes. When will it end?!
No idea. It says that it’s minor changes but doesn’t say what the changes actually are.
The schedules should be adjusted to better reflect delays please!
D line needs to 1) match up with the E line for Union station both north and south.
Or 2) periodically change to Mineral Station to Union station
There are many of us , seniors , who find it difficult to access DIA via light rail due to C line being discontinued,
and the in effective scheduling of the E line.
Waiting 20 minutes at Broadway Station is not useful. Especially in late hours or during inclement weather.
We need a 0530am departure from Mineral to 18th and California.
Proposed departure times:
0515
0530
0545
Having a 30 minute gap (as it is now) is really ridiculous for prime rider times.
Please bring back the C line. Also, don't drop down to every 30 mins until after 9
Now the current schedule is meaningless. We need a reliable schedule. Also, more frequent trains after 9PM are
needed for travel from the Theater district after concerts and plays.

I believe that by improving on time performance, for this line and others, will have both a positive impact on me
and other commuters. Recently RTD has been extremely lacking with both communication and on time
performance which has been super difficult for me as a commuting student. By making sure that the on time
improvements will actually be implemented and followed this will impact me as someone who uses the online
schedule and I can actually trust the times posted instead of just winging it. I also hope that the speed restrictions
are lifted soon as 1. Operators are inconsistent about where the speed restrictions are and a lot of the time they
will go slow when they don’t have to 2. The scheduled times are false and it takes WAYYY more then 38 minutes
to get from the Mineral to Colfax at Auraria. Recently it took me 1hr and 30mins. Which is absolutely absurd. I
believe that these issues also impact your ability to arrive on time. Please make changes, please do better,
please do the needful. I really believe that public transportation is extremely beneficial for many people and it is
more then disheartening that all of this has been handled so poorly.
This statement offers no meaningful information to judge off of. What I do know is that the D Line has been an
unacceptably unreliable service. Between slowdowns, trains that show on the app but never show or pass
through as “out of service” despite only running twice and hour anyway, leaving folks sitting in unsafe areas for an
hour or more at a time.
Improving on time performance is a necessity and a bare minimum of a transit system that every citizen is paying
tax into.
Please have an option to get all the way from Littleton mineral to union station with just light rail!
I need to be to work at 5am, you no longer have the D line leaving mineral for Denver at 415am. How am I to get
to work by 5am on 1505 w 3rd .
RTD can do a better job of running a few extra trains after big events (coors field, ball arena, empower) to help
encourage more transit. Sometimes I have to wait 30-40 minutes for a train after an avalanche or nuggets game.
Same for leaving a Rockies game. If a night game ends after walking to Union Station it’s a 30’ minute wait if I’m
lucky. I can usually take D,E, or H trains back to my stop at Alameda station. But others don’t take the train
specifically because it takes too long to get home from events.
The current schedule is not reliable and limits the number of options for me to get to and from work within a
reasonable amount of time. Your minor adjustment of time, which isn't known at this time to your riders, could
cause problems since I only have one slightly reasonable option to get to work on time as of now. I am afraid to
see your changes because it will mean l have to leave earlier just to ensure I get to work on time. Post the new
schedule times BEFORE they go into effect
I think tweaking the timing of the D line has potential to noticeably improve service. But what I would really like is
the return of the C line. It was great for me when the D line was running to DUS, like the C line used to, because I
didn't have to transfer to a different line. I know there's a lot of overlap between them, but it would be a great
reason to increase frequency (whichwould help a lot on days with large events), and it would minimize the
number of transfers for people like me.
The current 10 MPH for 4 stations is awful and no news on how long it will be in place.

Shut down the D line for say 2 weeks, focus all efforts to fix the track issues so that the trains can go back to
intended frequency, and slow zones can be lifted. Hire outside contractors if needed to help the process. Add bus
connections between the stations to help any who absolutely need service between the stations
Without details on what those change will be it is difficult to comment. But I assume it will be positive. I think that
bringing back the C line will be more beneficial.
Please fix the speed issues for the D Lone all lines actually. It impacts everyone’s quality of life. If you can’t then
driving downtown is going to become the norm.
Hopefully, there will be earlier trains like there used to be starting around 4 am going downtown Denver from
Littleton.
Summer service was literally garbage. Had to spend $100s of dollars on Uber to GET TO WORK ON TIME
BECAUSE RTD CAN'T GET A ROUTE TOGETHER. THIS IS RIDICULOUS YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF
YOURSELVES. Seriously this is the worst public transit mess I've ever seen. Do you people even ever TRY to
use these routes to get anywhere ON TIME? We're not all going for a fun day at a Rockies game, some of us
have bills to pay. Thanks for making 2 hours of my check per day useless. Keep up the subpar work RTD. This is
why no one uses the trains. Trash.
FREAKIN FINALLY. Trains that run on time? Yes please.
The D line needs to arrive at Englewood station so that riders who then need to catch a 0 to Highlands Ranch are
not waiting for 30 minutes.
On that note the 0 should have 15 minute headway between Highlands Ranch and Englewood station and 7
minute headway between Englewood station and downtown.
An improvement in on-time performance of the D Line is something that really matters to me. I am very excited to
see this proposed change!
Please bring back the C line service to Union Station. Increased service intervals for the D line are appreciated,
but my community would rather have both C and D line service from Mineral Station instead. Transfering trains to
Union Station has also become practically impossible due to service delays and cancelations associated with the
construction.
It was actually more beneficial for me when the D Line was re-routed to Union Station. Granted I can still do so
with the E Line, but that requires me to make a transfer.
Thank you for providing more service, including longer availability during the day and more frequency, to make
taking transit a more convenient option.

the tracks soon, so trains go faster than 5 mph. I used to religiously use RTD for 20 years, but now opt to drive.
Sad.
Please restore service from Littleton to Union Station
I work at the Concention center and sometimes the downtown hotels. Since last spring the service has been
terrible. Cancellations and of course, the summer maintenance continuing into fall. These delays and
cancellations need to cease in order to provide a service on which riders relay. Must be every 15 minutes during
working hours. Until resolution I will continue to car pool with my coworkers. #dobetter
I would like more detail on these proposed changes. What times will the D line be departing the Mineral station in
the morning? I used to catch the 5:42am train but that no longer exists. The trains just get later and later which
has caused me to have to shift my work hours and get stuck on a packed train with college students in the
afternoon. If you want commuters to take the train have early trains. Please send me or publish the proposed
schedules.
Says the train not running on time. I have to spend my money on Uber. That’s ridiculous in the first train Oxford
station leaving at 5:26. We need to try a little bit early. Everybody needs to go to work.
Anything that can make the trains run on time is needed
Trains and trams are suppose to be as fast to get to places with a car if not faster with safety as a priority
obviously but going 5Miles an hour is not either fast or safe I be late to my classes usually because of this train
and downtown has limited parking for me to drive to my school it was way better and way faster back in Fall of
2023 but with how slow this tram/train goes it’s just unacceptable I’ve never showed up once and the train was
here on time it’s either 10pm late or 10pm early and with winter coming it’s going to be so much worse to be
waiting outside in the cold
This would be great to have!!
Please run the D line trains every ten minutes at least.

Don't know about this change, but reverting the line back to 18th and California from Mineral is going to adversly
effect my use of RTD. The wait to connect with a train at Broadway, to go to Union Station, is way too long
(usually almost 25 minutes). I took the train much more when it went directly to Union Station for the past few
months.

I use the train exclusively to get to work and 15 minute intervals fits this need much better.

Please bring the C-Line back, people in Englewood and Littleton also want to go to the airport or to places like
Arvada or Thornton and we don't want to wait over 15 minutes at I 25 and Broadway for an E-Line. You could also
start up a new rail line that connects Englewood and Littleton with Aurora using the single track going from
Mineral to Peoria, it could run every 60 minutes to begin with then increase to 30 minutes once the demand kicks
in. You could call it the S-Line or the Z-Line.

I hate this route. It’s always late going to Denver in the morning and coming home. The bus spends way too much
time in Lafayette and the bus drivers take their sweet time getting to stops. Most nights I miss my connecting bus
at 8th & Briss because the driver has no idea where they’re going or they drive extra slow. Do something - change
the route so the bus goes down Longs Peak in the evening. Remind the drivers not everyone drives to the bus
stop. People need to make their connections and way too much time is wasted to make this an effective
commuter route.
If I had a car, I’d drive to Broomfield to catch the bus. That’s how much the LD1 sucks.
A very exciting addition, thank you for the increase in additional trips.
I have been hoping for additional service on this line for almost a year! Very much looking forward to this service
change

This is the slow route to Denver. Most days (in good weather) it takes me 2 hours to get to work one way. Please
give us back our express route b/w Longmont & Denver. I’m so tired of crawling through Lafayette & Broomfield
just to get to downtown.
THANK YOU!!! This is such welcome news and I greatly look forward to seeing these approved and having more
options to get to/from Lafayette. I so appreciate this, and hope to see even more in the future (and maybe some
weekend options)?
I would definitely benefit from having more time options for the LD1, especially if there’s an LD option for the
weekend
much potential for inc freq
I’d me more interested in specific times for this service increase as I currently commute from Longmont to
Highlands Ranch and by the time I get to Union Station, the LD1 has left an hour earlier.
Longmont-Denver needs trips for SUNDAY. Not kidding. Making Longmont from Union Station on Sunday can
take you 2 hours and 30 minutes. You have to go to Boulder, and then, Bolt raids once per hour (which is fair).
I would definitely use LD1 on Sundays, since I need to go to Longmont quite often, and Sundays are a day which
am normally off.
Infrequent current service levels means LD1 is not a viable option for travel to Denver
I believe the LD route should operate every 30 minutes from morning until mid afternoon. I do commute and use
this route to see Doctors and specialists in longmont
It's really going to depend on timing. Right now, the later one in the morning is getting me to work a little late, so if
you could make one earlier that would be fantastic! I would also like to see LD1s that ran a little later in the
evening as well. It would definitely help with my commute.
Add weekend buses. Particularly evening and night for Longmont residents who would like to see a show
downtown.
Or just build the train that voters approved and which you are legally required to deliver. We have been waiting so
long for the thing that other train lines (THAT WE HELPED TO FUND!) need repairs now. Longmont, Lafayette,
Erie, Niwot, Louisville, Superior, and Boulder would love to see any real action from RTD, make Parker and
Golden pay for ours like we paid for theirs.

I live in Lafayette, Longmont has almost daily events and lots of fun weekend events, so I look forward to being
able to stay and enjoy all the fun offerings there. Currently, I rarely go there because of the bus service, but with
these improvement, I will defintiely take advantage. Also, have family members who prefer taking the bus there
and to Boulder in the winter—no one wants to drive in the snow, so will have family on board!

I wish this route ran on weekends too

LD from Longmont to Denver is a must have route for commuters working in the Longmont area going to Denver
and back again.
Please add rides from union station to Longmont in the morning on weekdays as It helps people travelling from
Denver to Longmont.
First of all thank you for not cutting off the LD1 at Broomfield park-and-ride. Secondly, thank you for adding
service to this route. Instead of adding additional LD1s, my suggestion is to bring the LD2 back to avoid the
significant running time loss that happens when the LD1 goes through city of Lafayette. My guess is that the
majority of your boardings are happening in Longmont and you’d be likely to get even more if you had more direct
route between Longmont and Denver. Again thanks for continuing to work on bringing service back to prepandemic levels and considering this suggestion.
With the changes I believe the LD1 would be more efficient with timing as the 7 am one in Lafayette is often late.
The bus is often packed in the morning and afternoon and these changes might assist with allowing more
flexibility for certain riders.
I would use this route if it ran more reliably on the weekends.
I commute from Broomfield Station to Union Station, and would LOVE additional bus options. The LD1 is always
very full when I ride .
Need even more frequency
The Broomfield station has more housing being built with residents wanting access to routes to Denver. This will
be great for helping manage the increased demand from this area
I just moved north to Lafayette this summer and I was ELATED to see a bus that goes to Union Station from up
this way. I was a little disappointed when I saw only two morning and two evening weekday options - especially
with all the delays to the E line this summer (which I connect to). I do hope service is being added later in the day.
The 5:21 last train north is much too early for those of us who don't work downtown (I work in DTC). I can handle
waiting for the next bus but not having to get an Uber for a daily work commute.
PLEASE BRING BACK THE LX. The commute time on the local route is too long, and is a terrible burden for work
schedules and those of us with school aged children, or one car per household.
Traffic is bad on this street and I support bringing more bus transit to keep the roads moving!
The current LD1 schedule forces me to drive to Broomfield for the FF1. Hopefully this service increase will allow
me to use the LD1 from Lafayette.

The amount of service Longmont receives compared with the amount of money we have given RTD is ridiculous.
It is an absolute fiasco trying to get to the airport or Union Station from Longmont and it should not be. We need
reliable service at 15 minute intervals. Also, we want our train. Also, RTD needs a CEO who uses public transport
daily.

1) This route connects multiple suburbs to each other and to Denver
2) Increased frequency equals improved convenience which is what is required to improve ridership, NOT the
other way around
3) This route and improved convenience will further alleviate car traffic for those who still want or need to drive
4) The economic impact is also great with increased traffic through Longmont, Lafayette, Broomfield, and Denver
which will be further improved with the future extension of the W Line.
I live in Denver (moving to Arvada) and work in Longmont and there is never a bus available when I need to go to
work or return home (normal business hours)
The more one-seat trips between Denver and Longmont, the better! This is a very welcome change, now my
friends in Longmont could have a more reliable commute to and from Auraria, and for me personally it makes it
easier to visit friends and family in Longmont
It’s hard to say if this proposed change is positive or not without knowing the exact timing of the proposed
schedule. The newest change now arrives at Union Station around 7:55 am, which is too late to get to work on
time. A route that arrives to Union Station around 7:35 am (reliably) and leaves at 5:30 pm would allow
commuters who need to work a full day in Denver to use the service. More evening options would allow people to
go to an event in Denver and still be able to get back home
Thank you for the additional times. The best scenario for me (and several other riders I have spoken with) is
bringing back an express route that hits interstate quickly rather than meandering through Lafayette and
Broomfield.
My request is re-open again LD1 in the mornings at 7 am it was working really good before pandemic... After
pandemic it was closed .... Thanks
As a one car family, when I need to go to Denver my choice is to take the bus to Boulder, get a ride to Table
Mesa, or get a ride to Niwot Rd/287 for the LD. I rarely am taking the latter as the current schedule is far too
limiting. More service on this route would give me more options in my travel.
I am very pleased to hear about additional trips on the LD1! I travel between Denver and Longmont a lot, and the
LD1 is the fastest and easiest way to travel between the two cities by a landslide, and I wish it ran more, so I am
glad it is getting this service change.

Thank you for thinking to add these route times! I live in Denver but work in Boulder. I take the FF5 in the morning
and it significantly shortens my journey. Thank you for adding the eastbound routes in the evening! This makes it
even easier to get to where I need to go and not take a car.
This is a great route and I love the expansion of EB buses in the afternoon. Thanks for helping get us where we
need to go!
We don’t need a later bus from Boulder to Anschutz. We need another morning bus from Boulder to Anschutz and
another late afternoon bus back to Boulder. I use this bus to commute to work and the times were much more
convenient bf Covid
Adding a 3:02 and 4:02 eastbound time to FF5 could cut my commute in half. I commute from Aurora to Boulder
for work, and I currently have to take FF1 or FF2 because none of the FF5 times are late enough for me to come
back on, which makes my commute long by having to get to Union Station first. These service changes could help
many people in my situation I think.

Again - please bring back the FF line that provides service along the 36 corridor to the civic center station. It
would make my commute 20 min faster and so much more pleasant!
Please re-open Boulder Junction station and re-start service from there. That area is very poorly served by public
transit, and I would be able to use RTD transit much easier if it was open.
The FF5 really needs to run more often for people going to and from the hospital zone in Anschutz.
It would be wonderful to bring back the FF6 express route from Boulder going east. The FF1 routes are PACKED
after work hours and don’t serve parts of Boulder commuters who work east of CU Boulder. The FF6 was a great
option to bypass all the stops FF1 makes and alleviate how many people are crammed into the FF1.
some additional morning routes eastbound would help me more.
Please increase the number of Westbound afternoon trips and add another trip later than 5 (ie 6pm trip as there
was before COVID)
Please add a bus that arrives at the hospital at 8 so those of us working standard shifts can actually use the bus
instead of driving. There are plenty of afternoon return options.
Hi! I have been taking the FF5 to and from work every day for the past 4 years. I love this route and was excited
that times were being added but am confused about what was added. I do not know who would be able to use
these new times, going Eastbound in the afternoon. How would they get back? There is 1 bus going west bound
in the morning, which has never made sense, and that still doesn't make sense. What we really need are more
times going WESTbound in the afternoon. On some days it is almost standing room only. A 4:45 and/or 5:45 bus
going westbound would make the most sense to me.
More routes please
FF5 would be a great way to for people with CU health insurance to get to Anschutz, but the frequency has to be
often enough and dependable enough for me to give up driving my car. Right now it's not.
Having access to usable transit options requires that transit to come at a rate where it is useful to many groups of
people and more time options is an essential part of that. It is difficult to catch a transit option that does not come
frequently as the time may not work for many people's schedules. Adding increased service frequency is vital to
many transit users in making lines actually usable for them.
Traffic is bad on this street and I support bringing more bus transit to keep the roads moving!
I’m excited to have more options for when I can commute from Boulder!

It would be nice to eventually add another eastbound trip (or move up the current trip that arrives just before 9)
that can reliably get to 17th pl and aurora (where most of the passengers get off) around 10 minutes before 9 AM
even with traffic. This would let a lot of us get into our offices and join meetings/classes on time and without
having to rush like we do now.

Thank you for providing more service, including longer availability during the day and more frequency, to make
taking transit a more convenient option.
1) This route connects employees and a vital service to the Boulder community, along with people residing around
the Anschutz campus who may want to travel to Boulder
2) Increased frequency equals improved convenience which is what is required to improve ridership, NOT the
other way around
3) This route and improved convenience will further alleviate car traffic
Hello. There was no option to select: please bring back the FF4. There are dozens of coworkers at my office
including myself that would use it to get to Boulder from Denver. The Transit center in Boulder Junction has now
be closed for over 4 years.
Like the added service as need is growing from campus to Boulder
Well, I'm just using the FF5 change as a way to offer a comment on the FF2 -- which is not changing, alas. It
remains extremely annoying that after spending $250M, and opening the express lanes for buses with huge
fanfare, those lanes are essentially not used by RTD except for a few buses each day. Long past time to run more
FF2 buses -- the last times I got a chance to use them they were quite full -- and also to re-open the now-closed
terminal at Boulder Junction and run some FF2 buses which start/end there as well.
I am writing to provide feedback on the absence of proposed RTD service changes to the FF2. I commute from
Union Station to Boulder-Broadway/Euclid Monday-Friday and take the FF1 because the FF2 is not offering
routes that arrive by/before 8:00am in Boulder. Between this summer and fall, during my commute, most FF1
buses I have taken are standing room only and most buses from Union Station to Boulder run out of room for
bicycles by US36/Wadsworth. Given this tremendously high demand for FF1 and FF2 buses during peak
commuting hours (arriving in Boulder by 8:00am and departing Boulder by 5:15pm), I want to urge RTD to
consider adding additional FF2 routes to support the high demand for ridership. Adding additional FF2 routes
during peak commuting hours (arriving in Boulder by 8:00am and departing Boulder by 5:15pm) would free up
room on the FF1 buses for travelers who are picking up the bus after Union Station west-bound and free up room
on the FF1 buses east-bound for travelers not going directly to Union Station. While I am happy to see RTD is
increasing the frequency of FF5 buses, I urge them to reconsider adding more frequent FF2 service.

I am a nurse practitioner at Children’s Hospital Colorado and my commute is exhausting. It would be so incredibly
helpful if the FF5 ran later and left Anschutz at 7 and 8pm as well- so many of us healthcare workers work 12
hour shifts that end at 7pm, and by the time we sign out to the rest of the medical team it’s often 8pm.

I’ll be using this bus on a weekday during winter and I support more service on it.
As a ski instructor at eldora I do not trust the consistency of the bus schedule. Many times the bus drives by my
stop and I am unsure to whether another one will be coming, sometimes one comes & sometimes an additional
one does come. The bus schedule has made me late which forces me to loose all the $ that I would’ve made in a
day as if I’m late then I loose the lesson for that day. Also the schedule does not align with employee start times. I
have to be at work at 8:45am but the bus does not arrive till 9:02 or 9:52. These erratic times have made me get
in trouble at work and made me loose valuable income. A more consistent bus schedule as well as providing
additional buses when buses are full would allow me to actually use the bus system as opposed to having to drive
my own vehicle.

I usually drive to Eldora, but I occasionally take the NB1. I’d take it more often if there were more frequent buses
scheduled, and if there was a stronger guarantee that the buses would adhere to the posted schedule. I
remember reading about skiers who were stranded at Eldora after the NB1 return service was unexpectedly
canceled for the day during a previous season.
More frequent busses are really crucial. I have never been on the bus where it wasn't completely full (including
the isle filled with standing people). There is so much demand on weekends and it is so predictable.
Provide more insight into this timing. Similar to the airport route, this bus is often overful, which dissuades people
from using. More buses at peak times are needed.
Sometimes I take this to Eldora but when you have to wait 45 extra minutes for another bus if the first one fills up,
and then it's stressful at Eldora to get back to Boulder, this inhibits transit usage.
The weekday timing doesn't do much for me, but running to/from Eldora every hour on the weekends would be
great.
I was really excited when this bus line started, but I ended up never taking it after hearing about riders being
stranded at Eldora and told to find their own way home. If this is within the bounds of acceptable to RTD, how is it
communicated to everyday riders? Are there warning signed on or outside the bus?
So, the most recent change was considered minor and meant to better match rider demand. It is/does neither for
students. I don't have enough info/specific timing to comment meaningfully on the next purposed - except to say it
can't come soon enough. Please restore an option that gets mountain kids to Boulder closer to the school start
time - 8:30 and provides a ride home - that isn't after 6 pm. Thank you very much. And, we have ecopasses - so
we are good either way but I think providing youth free rides is really good thing.
Please add hourly buses eastbound around 7am, 8 am & 9am for commuters.
And hourly buses westbound around 4pm, 5pm & 6pm
Please support us riding NB to and from work at pre pandemic service levels rather than adding to traffic with
drivers who can’t make current limited bus schedule coordinate with their work shift schedule
I love the NB1 and NB2, so if you're increasing frequency that's a win in my book. I love taking day trips to
Nederland and intend to use the NB frequently this upcoming ski season.

I use this route twice per year and find it suits my needs. If it were a little more frequent and more protected by its

Any Changes to RTE 15 is hard.
Thank you for this route. Very convenient.
This is not the forum, but I feel that riders need clarity on where all the new stops will be during the construction
on East Colfax, and when existing stops are phased out in favor of new BRT stations
how long will this signal work possibly take? Will it still be an issue in April?
My main concern is that serve the 13th & Lisbon stop should be served by the 15l to allow more space other then
that keep the times the same as the current schedule

Thank you for extending the hours of this bus route, allowing additional flexibility to travelers along this line.
Route 24 buses should start from 40th & Colorado Station 3 minutes after the arrival of eastbound A Line trains
and 4 minutes after the arrival of westbound A Line trains. Suggested time: xx:09 past the hour.
I would also request that you return to having the bus every 30 minutes too.
This will finally allow a direct trip in the evenings without going through and transferring downtown, especially
during cold season! Whew
Hi, and thank you for making these improvements.
I am glad that coverage is increasing, but I would also like to see greater frequency/reduced headway. For
context, I live in Whittier in a one-car household and go to school once a week at DU. Currently, the 24 comes too
infrequently to be a reliable way for me to take the bus even though that's my preference.

route with most potential. consider 24Z from university station north to zoo..overlay..providing 15 min service from
u station to the zoo with 24N in much needed area connections with colfax 15 and brt...long badly needed
connection
The hourly schedule for this route makes it difficult to use on a regular basis. A more frequent schedule would be
beneficial to riders.
I'm glad to see it running for more hours
I have been using the 24 to commute to work and errands for the last 11 years and is my primary mode of
transportation. I am very excited for the expanded service hours but would like to comment on the SOP
(24N/24S). I would encourage planners to reconsider the proposed 24N southern terminus (Hampden/University).
I would suggest the proposed 24N terminus continue to be C470 and University Blvd Park-N-Ride. This would
bring service frequency (30-min) back to pre-covid levels. With large employment centers (shopping districts) at
the Arapahoe, Dry Creek, and County Line intersections, I believe the proposed terminus of Hampden/University
would force many 24 users to endure an additional transfer on their way to work and errands. Additionally, if the
24N terminates at Hampden, there is a missed oppertunity to improve transfer opportunities along the 66 bus
route.
Increasing Service span without increasing midday service isn't going to have the ridership boost as it is still a
very unusable service vs the 40 or the 12.
Thanks so much for increasing these service hours. Please consider increasing the frequency as well.
This would make getting home from work a lot less sketchy because I bought a bike to do the 20 minute commute
to the next station over since the 24 stops before i’m out of work
I can use the 24 more often if this change is implemented.
When I lived near Downing St, RTD's decision to split the 12 bus route into two routes (incl. the 17) at 38th &
Blake dramatically improved service reliability. Are there any plans to split the 24 bus route at the DU light rail
station? I would be strongly in support.
One hour intervals make it impossible to use. Southbound light rail may have to wait an hour for next bus. Make it
30 minutes or 15 would be better.
RTE 24 sucks - Its too long and should be divided like RTE 15 and 16.
The split should occur at DU/ light rail/ Hwy and have more frequent trips for the north RTE 24. I can't really speak
to those traveling south from DU - but going north it does not align with a good schedule for RTE 40 etc.
Good to get more service but it would be great if it was more than every hour. Makes the transfer hairy.
Extension of hours is welcome. Increased frequency would also be helpful, even if only during selected times

This will help our commute to/from Boulder

I wish the 24 happened more frequently. It is this closest bus to my house. It is well connected with many parts of
the city. Work commutes and leisure trips would be much faster and convenient with more frequent trips.

While I like the increase of the number of buses in the evening, I would again suggest that buses should run
every 30 minutes instead of every 60, particularly between 40th and Colorado Station and Hampden Ave as this
would be helpful to DU students and people going to Cherry Creek Mall, and I also believe that you should have
two 24s, one that follows the route south of Hampden as you have it and the other making a turn to Englewood
Station where it would help out people in Littleton who want to go to University Blvd. I also suggest a route 25 that
runs every 60 minutes along University starting at Englewood Station and going down to C-470 University Park
and Ride, this would help give Englewood a better connection with Centennial.

The re-instated portion of the route that turns off of Hampden and onto Akron looks like it will miss two stops that
are currently fairly active on the 105 bus - Hampden/Akron and Hampden/Dayton; both of which provide access
to the nearby Walmart. Hampden/Yosemite is also a popular stop and is within .2 miles of Hampden/Akron. How
will these stops work with the 35, are there plans for consolidation of any of these stops, and is there an
advantage to routing the 35 onto Akron instead of Dayton?
Please set the old route, back up!
Thank you for bringing this back!! If it can sync up with the increased headways for the 40 that would be amazing.

This is great news for the 35 to go down to the nine mile station. It is a bad idea though to not use the frontage
road of 285 as the route for the western side of Sheridan Blvd. Not using the current route creates an
infrastructure loss since a bus will not replace that route. This creates more transfers to the 76 in order to get to
Southwest plaza. This will make the 76 more crowded than it is already
I chose the route closest to my house, but I wanted to generally thank RTD for adding service. Increasing
frequencies and providing additional hours of service across the network are the only ways to make transit a
realistic option for many people. It's clear from all of the proposed changes for 2025 that RTD is focused on
moving service in the right direction. Thank you.
Bringing this route back from Englewood to Nine Mile would be a life saver. This route was a total time saver!
Bring this route back RTD, help make lives better with public transportation that works for the public, not against
us! Please & thank you!
This depends on which hours the route is expanded. If the route is expanded during mid-to-late evenings and
weekends, I will definitely ride.
The segment east of Englewood Station to Nine Mile Station being reinstated will provide a great interconnect
between rail segements of the system and is very useful for me.
Reinstating the eastern segment of route 35 along Hampden would give people in the area better service, and
would create better opportunities for people by creating a one-seat connection from the Southeast to Englewood.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING ROUTE 35 out east! My doctor is on this route, and right now if I bus its
a 52-minute indirect trip because there is no direct route on Hampden from SE Denver to Swedish medical center
in Englewood. I am SO EXCITED TO HAVE THIS ROUTE BACK
Should never have gone away. Maybe better to break up route like you planned. Will you ever do that? Waste of a
study if not.
Thank you for providing more service, including longer availability during the day and more frequency, to make
taking transit a more convenient option.
This would be a welcome expansion for an underserved area!
This is needed, current service levels along hampden are inadequate
This bus is extremely close to my work. I would always pass by the old stops and wonder why the 35 doesn't
come by that area anymore. It would be very convenient to take this route & keep the 105 as an alternative.
This is wonderful news!! I support this change as it will benefit many residents who live east of Englewood Station
connect to rail service and other high frequency bus routes, heading both north and south. This will improve
access to employment, groceries, and medical care for many in the surrounding neighborhoods. Thank you!

I am just wondering what this service change really is. Route 83D, which operates on Quebec Way and Dayton
Street, only runs on weekday peak hours and it seems unlikely that RTD would make such a major expansion of
service including weekends. 83L already runs on 30-mibute headways 7 days a week.
This change will make it much easier for me to take the bus to work work on days when I stay at my partners
house. I really love this change and I appreciate that RTD made this change! Whatever research you did to
support this change definitely reflects my experience.
I use this route when the H line has problems, so I'm glad you are increasing frequency.
I look forward to the increased service frequency of Route 83D. Thank you for this helpful adjustment!
Thank you for providing more service, including longer availability during the day and more frequency, to make
taking transit a more convenient option.
This is a great improvement in making this heavily used transit corridor more frequent and reliable through the
day. This does a lot to make transit a competitive mode on the corridor at all times.
This would be especially valuable if it was staggered with the 83L to give 15 minute frequency on the common
portions of the routes
Yes sounds good

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

Having access to usable transit options requires that transit to come at a rate where it is useful to many groups of
people and more time options is an essential part of that. It is difficult to catch a transit option that does not come
frequently as the time may not work for many people's schedules. Adding increased service frequency is vital to
many transit users in making lines actually usable for them.

Please consider restoring stops out to 75th and/or through Heatherwood. Many students take this bus to school.
Anything to manage the high school riders is positive so the rest of us can still ride without feeling unwelcome.
However, I'd also like to suggest that you re-add the later service that used to exist from downtown Boulder back
to Gunbarrel, at the very least on Friday and Saturday nights, so those of us who prefer not to drive can still enjoy
events in Boulder.
If it ran more frequently, specifically during work start /end and weekend trips with the family downtown, I'd be
much more likely to consider that an option, esp during weather!

My son uses this route to/from high school
It would be great to have a policy that allowed small strollers on the bus during off hours. It is too far for a toddler
to walk from my house to the bus stop, and very cumbersome to try to get a toddler, a folded up stroller, and a
bag onto the bus.
I don't know what "tripper service" is, I wish it was explained better. Maybe then I would have said "very positive
impact."
I regularly ride the BOLT bus and have been on some very full buses with school kids riding in town. This change
could take some of the burden off of the Bolt and help improve its service speed. But I have always wondered
why the 205 and Bolt run simultaneously. If these buses were staggered, I could get the 205 if I have missed the
Bolt and have a bike as I could ride the last leg of the trip. I think with them running at the same time, some
people are just riding the comfier regional bus. LIkewise, when buses are coming in to town, if the 205 would
arrive at stops shortly but not immediately before the BOLT, it could potentially reduce the number of people
boarding the bus for in town travel

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

Service on the 205 should not be directly aligned with the Bolt. If the schedules were staggered so they left
Downtown Boulder Station at different times, the two routes would provide service every 15 minutes along
Canyon Boulevard and 28th Street. As it is now, they leave at the same time, resulting in two buses covering the
same route every 30 minutes.

Two problems: You have not picked a number designation for the new route (it won't be 1E/44. obviously, and
should not be, and will not be, called the Art District Connector or any other cute name). Also, you do not indicate
the frequency or span of service for the new route. If you're planning to run this route starting in January, this
information must be provided.
This is a great idea!!! We need more accessible and usable public transit in Denver, the traffic is so bad and for a
city that’s so big on environmentalism the transit system does not support that! I drive everywhere and am looking
forward to some valuable changes that will allow me a reliable way to get around Denver and surrounding areas
without relying on a car
Pending details on schedule and route, this is a very appealing idea!
I love the changes to the system, they provide a much needed North-South Connection. I do have a concern
about the route numbering. 1E/44 is not a great option and it would be much better as the 2 which hasn’t been
used since 2009 or just any number (without letters)
Based on the infprmation provided, it is unclear to me if the proposed change would positively or negativly impact
me. I currently ride the 1 from the Baker neighborhood into downtown and get off on Blake and 17th to get as
close to Union Station as possible. If the proposed changes are made, would I still be able to catch the 1 at the
Galapago and 2nd stop and get off at Blake and 17th?
This is a really cool idea for connection between the two arts districts. We frequently use the 40th & Colorado
Station for the A line and would love this service improvement. We often go to RiNo from Baker and would gladly
take public transit over rideshare services.

This route needs to be extended to 1st and Colorado Blvd, like it was before COVID, and continue to service the
Baker Neighborhood west of Broadway. Broadway is already well serviced while Baker is underserved. Even
more now that the 1 only runs once and hour.

It isn't possible to know what impact this will have without a proposed map and time tables. Surveying without that
information is sort of insulting.
The 1 is the only bus that serves my neighborhood. The best option for changes in this route would be to return to
the time (every 30 minutes) and route (all the way to Cherry Creek from Lakewood) prior to COVID.
It’s important w the weather that bus shelters are real. Strong winds fast storms waiting at stops can be terrible on
the elderly or disabled and young children/ women. The routes should never be shortened. Rerouting is
something that serves the businesses not the people who ride it.
I support the split of the 1

While the truncating of the line is most likely to have a positive impact, the Number 1 definitely needs more
frequent service as called for in the SOP. While it may not possible to fully implement 30 minute headways yet,
even adding 6 extra trips for rush hours (6-9 AM, 4-6 PM) would vastly help the overloaded line.

I just sent a long reply about how the current 100 is a huge disservice to anyone who lives west of Wadsworth in

You need to specify exactly what "increasing frequency" means.

YOU NEED TO RUN THE BUS ALL THE WAY TO WALMART AND KING SOOPERS AT RALSTON AND
INDEPENDENCE ON SUNDAY
I've lived at Kipling and 26th ave and over the past few years have seen reasonable transit service (albeit no bus
AT ALL on sunday, so at least i guess, uh, thanks for that tiny fairly useless bit of service between 2 rail stations,
and NOT ACTUAL USEFUL SHOPPING SLIGHTLY BEYOND ARVADA RIDGE) but have also seen the
frequency drop to once an hour *(its OFTEN QUICKER for me to WALK AN ENTIRE MILE to 38th or Colfax
instead of WAIT AN HOUR if I miss the bus by a minute or 2)
You KILLED OFF the 28/32 running west of Wadsworth - Why cant they come to at least Kipling? They SHOULD
both make a run to Youngfield and come back so that again, USEFUL SHOPPING at Youngfield and 32nd can be
accessed without a 2 mile walk. I literally have to HOPE that the 100, meets with the 38, so I can access King
Soopers and any other shops up there, or walk 2 miles. This is SO USELESS!
Finally - your bus schedules and G line schedules DO NOT MATCH PROPERLY.
You NEED to have the bus meet up with the train.
If the bus is going to sit for 5-10 minutes at Arvada Ridge doing nothing but perhaps the driver taking a
smoke/toilet break, then leave literally 2 minutes before a G-line is scheduled to arrive,(*This happens at EVERY
single station, with EVERY single bus I have relied upon since I started working in the DTC in 2007!) THIS IS
WORTHLESS. THIS IS NOT A TRANSFER. THIS IS A DISSERVICE TO YOUR RIDERSHIP!
I have so many complaints, along with MANY other riders literally getting to a station on a train, the bus PULLING
OUT OF THE STATION AFTER SEEING THE TRAIN ARRIVE, and having to wait an hour, or call an uber since it
was the last bus of the night and there are no other transit options.
So, please, for the love of god, MAKE THE 100 RUN UNTIL AT LEAST 8:30PM LIKE IT USED TO SO I CAN GO
TO THE STORE AFTER WORK AND NOT HAVE TO WALK MILES HOME
MAKE IT RUN ONCE EVERY HALF HOUR ACTUALLY ALIGNING PROPERLY WITH THE G LINE (at least W
line is back to every 15 mins, so regardless of how late the 100 is at least its not toooo long for another one)
MAKE IT RUN TO USEFUL SHOPPING AT 52nd(ralston) AND INDEPENDENCE ALL DAYS OF THE WEEK
OR BRING BACK THE 28/32 TO AT LEAST LOOP AT YOUNGFIELD NOW THAT THERE IS NO PNR AT I70
AND WARD ANYMORE.
There is NO useful transit in this part of wheat ridge.

Is it possible for the southbound buses to depart US 36 and Sheridan about 10 minutes later so connections to
the W and G line trains can be improved?

If the frequency of the 100 increases, this would be life changing. I have to take the 100 to the w line to get to
work. Right now one bus an hour is not enough as it leaves too much room for riders to be stranded or miss
transfers.
Having access to usable transit options requires that transit to come at a rate where it is useful to many groups of
people and more time options is an essential part of that. It is difficult to catch a transit option that does not come
frequently as the time may not work for many people's schedules. Adding increased service frequency is vital to
many transit users in making lines actually usable for them.
I like the increased frequency for the 100. I have heard from some other riders that they would prefer it to run
later.
1) This route connects suburbs instead of having to go downtown first
2) Increased frequency equals improved convenience which is what is required to improve ridership, NOT the
other way around
3) This route and improved convenience will further alleviate car traffic for those who still want or need to drive
4) The economic impact is also great with increased traffic through both Arvada's (Olde Town) and Westminster's
core downtown areas which will be further improved with the future extension of the W Line.
Maybe extend route to Littleton downtown station
This will be extremely good for the 100, I would add that the 72 would greatly benifit from higher frequencies as

12 Responses
I'd love to see the 44 offer more frequent bus service that complements the 38 bus.
15 min service, extend w to golden on at least some branches coordinated with g line,
I think is a great idea to connect. I hope it will not affect the 38th route
As someone with somewhat limited mobility, I ride the 44 to the 43 to get to my job at CU Denver. While I
appreciate the goal, I don't love having a more challenging trip to work.
This may work very well, if it runs twice an hour!

The description of the service change does not bother to mention that the discontinued segment east of
downtown will be replaced by the (not properly described) 1E/44. I had to go to the SOP to find the proposed new
route.
Two problems: You have not picked a number designation for the new route (it won't be 1E/44. obviously, and
should not be, and will not be, called the Art District Connector or any other cute name). Also, you do not indicate
the frequency or span of service for the new route. If you're planning to run this route starting in January, this
information must be provided.
The 1E/44 would be a good route, which is not the case with many other elements of the SOP.
Traffic is bad on this route and I support bringing more bus transit to keep the roads moving!
Why would you shorten anything on the east - why do you not service the northeast community
Thank you for providing more service, including longer availability during the day and more frequency, to make
taking transit a more convenient option.
44 should run more often
I am in full support of the split but I am worried about the timings out of Wheat Ridge, I would hope that timings do
not significantly change.
Extend This Route To I-25 & Broadway Station

Westbound route 52 buses should consistently leave Olde Town Arvada Station 6 minutes after the arrival of
westbound G Line trains. Suggested times: xx:25 and xx:55 past the hour.
With this adjustment, how is the timing planned to work between the 52 and 19 in the overlapping portion of these
two routes in Sunnyside/Highlands?
This route is great and needs to run more often!
I think making the timing different on this stop would also be helpful. Not only is the guy at 8pm near 63rd and
wright always late, the 52 barely gives you enough time to connect to the G line and that will make me late to
work or have to get an Uber AND THIS HAPPENS MULTIPLE TIMES A WEEK. I have emailed multiple times and
never even heard back from anyone, and that dude continues to be late

You did not provide enough info. for me to make a decision. It states minor time change and that's it. If it's a
matter of a few min. it should not matter,just adjust your schedule.
Please keep the 52 going west from Denver to Arvada

I am excited to see an increase in FlexRide service area; however as a FlexRide customer, additional changes I
would like to see are an improved app, and better advertising for the service at nearby transit hubs. Both of these
seem like they would be at least as effective at increasing ridership as expanding the boundaries.
While this service change doesn’t impact me specifically, increased access to public transit for Broomfield
residents (and everyone!) is always a good thing. I fully support this change. Thank you!
Please continue to expand Broomfield FlexRide service, it provides a valuable service to the community
especially after RTD cutbacks in Broomfield County in recent years!
As an equity concern, there should be RTD service that connects to Colorado Children's Hospital - North Campus
(869 CO-7, Broomfield, 80023) - right now the hospital is only accessible via private transportation and this is a
disservice to the community.

I would like to see the regular RTD route to 136th North Orchard Parkway or even to the Denver premium Outlet
mall where I work. It’s hard to find a bus or even flex ride from 96th Huron to that mall.
The proposed change still fails to provide connections to fixed route service. Please move the southern boundary
further south to 120 for connection to the Route 120 bus. Or extend route 7 north to Denver Premium Outlets
where a connection to this service would be available. If neither of these are feasible, could it be combined with
the Wagon Road/144th Flex Ride?
Please add a connection to other RTD routes on the east side of this zone, such as at Wagon Road park-n-ride or
the Eastlake/124th rail station on the N Line. It doesn't make sense to travel west all of the way to US36 when
other service is available on the eastern border near I-25.

We live on Navajo street between 152th Ave and 156th Ave. The area east of Zuni is not serviced by any Flexride
routes in the area but has significant population and Amazon warehouse as well. Walking to Orchard mall is
extremely dangerous on Huron street and requires to have a car. We would like to see Flex route expanded either
for Wagon Rd or Broomfield North route

This is a good proposal for better commute
I appreciate this service increase as I occasionally prefer to travel to my makerspace via bus. What I'd really
appreciate though is an option to return home after 7pm.
Need the 208 to be every 30 mins instead of 1x/hour. It's ridiculous to miss a bus (and sometimes they are early!)
and then have to wait an hour - instead I drive or find other modes of transit.
When the hundreds of apartments are finished at 28th and Iris, you should increase the frequency.

This is a frequent bus route used by me. This is a positive change for my transportation needs during the later

Route 49 buses should start from 40th & Colorado Station 3 minutes after the arrival of eastbound A Line trains
and 4 minutes after the arrival of westbound A Line trains. Suggested times: xx:12 and xx:42 past the hour.
The resources used to create 30-minute weekend frequency on this route presumably come at the expense of
keeping other routes at hourly service on weekends. Why was the 49 chosen for 30-minute weekend service over
other hourly weekend routes - for example the 19 which had higher weekend ridership as of the Jan24 schedule
period?
more freq needed
It would be a huge increase in availability for riders on this route.
Thank you.

I like that this route will run later during the week it really makes it easier for games and concerts, I do feel

Having access to usable transit options requires that transit to come at a rate where it is useful to many groups of
people and more time options is an essential part of that. It is difficult to catch a transit option that does not come
frequently as the time may not work for many people's schedules. Adding increased service frequency is vital to
many transit users in making lines actually usable for them.

The adjustments in theory work well, but it doesn’t do enough justice to provide transportation for those on the
Southeast Denver side. 65 is the only bus running from Quincy Avenue to Southmoor yet only twice an hour,
which is unjust for those needing to catch the train for work and school. This route needs to run more often on a
similar schedule that other Southmoor buses are running on.
this route has very high potential with improved frequency

Wouldn't it be much much better if 65 and 73 were departing 15min after each other?? (For instance: 65 departs
10.25, then 73 departs 10.40)
I live at Monaco and 6th ave, the northbound bus passes Leetsdale 3-4 minutes early 50%+ of the time, I miss the
connection from the eastbound 83/83L by 2-3 minutes so often that I am better off taking the 3 to Alameda &
Monaco and walking, which adds 20-30 minute wait for the connection from 83/83L to 3, then 15 minute walk,
My comment concerns the Central Park Station.
It would be very helpful if an enclosed/warm/out of the wind waiting area could be installed in the bus stop/train
area. Waiting for a connection during the winter months can be very uncomfortable.
Thanks
Could the timing be integrated with the A-Line more? It is frustrating to have bus pull up the same time the Airport
bound train does, requiring 15-30 minute additional time to commute to the airport.
By transit, my commute to work at the airport is calculated at around 1.5 hours. It's often closer to 2. Which is why
I drive the 30 minutes there.

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

I would like to propose a change in schedule either of line 65 or 73. As for the moment during the weekdays they
depart at the same time from the Central Park and go south almost paralel.
To get to south Denver in the neighborhoods around Monaco and Quebec Streets, if someone misses the
departure time of these lines, he has to wait next 30mins for next one!!!

It used to come once every hour. I hope it’s going to be better now. Since after I come late on the h line, I miss

Route 139, is a very helpful line that effectively helps people in neighborhoods that do not have a reliable mode of

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Transit Police Department Update

November 13, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Steve Martingano, Co-Chief, Transit Police and Emergency Management
Glyn Horn, Co-Chief, Transit Police and Emergency Management
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
On January 19, 2021, the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) submitted a written request to the
American Public Transportation Association (APTA) for a peer review of the existing RTD Security
Model. APTA accepted the request and convened a peer review panel of highly experienced transit
policing leaders. Implementation of the panel’s recommendations has been led by RTD Police Department
(RTD-PD) leadership. This report describes ongoing operational and strategic changes and those
anticipated over the next several years.
DISCUSSION
RTD-PD’s strategic focus involves:
1. Proactive and positive engagement with the community to form trusted partnerships
2. A focus on crime prevention
3. Commitment to the application of evidence-based strategies and the development of solutions for
complex problems, and
4. Promotion of organization-wide infrastructure improvements that enhance stakeholder safety and
facilitate crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED)
The framework for the enhancement of the RTD-PD community policing, Back to Basics, People Power,
and Welcoming Transit Environment strategies are described herein within the context of four topical
areas discussed in depth in the associated presentation:
1. Strategic Implementation
2. Evidence-Based Policing
3. Strategic Priority Alignment
4. Performance Data Outputs
Community Policing
RTD-PD continues to assume a more visible and active role in improving overall public safety throughout
the transit environment, through the ongoing phased hiring of sworn officers, while remaining sensitive

Packet Pg. 232

1.E.2

to societal issues. This approach leads to a Welcoming Transit Environment for customers and
employees.
Increasing police-stakeholder engagement also includes the expansion of key partnerships with agencies
throughout the service area, facilitating a more coordinated multi-agency approach to improving law
enforcement and public safety outcomes. As RTD-PD becomes a more active participant in proactively
addressing regional criminal and social challenges, additional sworn hiring allows the agency to expand
its reach, while 24-hour staffing will meet customer and employee safety expectations.
Examples of RTD-PD’s expansion benefits include:
• All members of the command staff undergoing intensive background clearance checks for
participation in the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force (FBI-JTTF)
• Actively connecting with social service providers to meet specific sector needs
• Meeting with police agencies in surrounding jurisdictions to improve collaboration that will benefit
everyone in the community and the RTD service area, and
• Partnering with Colorado Bureau of Investigations (CBI) to conduct laboratory testing associated
with narcotics arrests
People Power
As of the writing of this report, there are 81 sworn officers and an additional seven police recruits
attending the police academy that graduates in December 2024. The department has 17 authorized
positions to hire by end of year 2024, to include detectives, additional lateral police officers that are
Colorado Peace Officer Standards and Training Board certified and recruits to enter the January 2025
academies.
As RTD-PD continues to transition towards a majority sworn police workforce, it is becoming better
positioned to:
• Build stronger community relationships
• Mitigate conditions conducive to crime, and
• Expand its capacity to serve those with mental health, addiction, and housing struggles without
over-criminalizing non-chronic offender behaviors
Welcoming Transit Environment
Recent accomplishments in applying evidence-based policing to deter crime are highly positive indicators
of the approach recommended by the peer review panel and have enabled the RTD-PD command staff to
engage in more creative deployment strategies to address crimes and aberrant behaviors.
An example is the consistent decrease in crime trends reported in targeted areas like Denver Union
Station (DUS). The decrease in criminal incidents at DUS demonstrates how a strategic and intentional
reinvestment into personnel in the form of transitioning away from contracted security guards to sworn
police officers and upgrades to the hardware and use of technology in facilities benefits the agency, its
employees, and customers.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan

November 13, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Environmental Sustainability
The Board of Directors has collectively demonstrated a deep and abiding commitment to addressing the
climate impacts of the agency’s services, programs, and initiatives throughout the Denver metro region,
both in terms of operating and administrative facilities as well as the existing fixed-route bus fleet.
First among RTD’s Board-adopted Strategic Plan Priorities is Community Value, which states: “RTD
strives to be a community partner, providing value to customers as well as to the broader Denver metro
region while sustaining planet Earth.”
In support of this priority, the agency is committed to supporting local, state, and national efforts to
mitigate, to the extent feasible, the impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including those derived
from operating and administrative facilities, as well as fixed-routes buses.
Current Bus Facilities
RTD currently owns and directly provides transit services from three bus division facilities across the
service area. The Platte, East Metro and Boulder facilities were purpose-designed in the late 1970’s for a
diesel fleet and became operational in the early 1980’s. Over the years, these facilities have been
modified to accommodate diesel bus fleet replacements and upgraded to current building codes. These
facilities meet RTD’s transit service delivery requirements.
Current Diesel Bus Fleet
RTD’s current fixed-route bus fleet includes more than 900 clean-diesel vehicles, which are operated by
RTD directly and by contractors. Given the size of the current fleet; the current federal minimum (12year/500,000 mile) service replacement cycle requirements; and the magnitude of the facilities
enhancements that will be required to house, maintain, and support alternatively fueled transit vehicles,
the transition toward lower-emission and zero-emission buses is a significant undertaking that will
require many years to fully implement.
Alternatively Fueled Buses

Packet Pg. 257

1.E.3

RTD was an early adopter of low/no emission technologies. The agency’s first steps toward a low/noemission bus fleet transition were taken in 2000, with the deployment of hybrid electric/compressed
natural gas (CNG) buses along the 16th Street Mall. A subfleet of hybrid diesel/electric fixed-route buses
followed in 2008. The CNG-powered MallRide buses were also later replaced by a fleet of 36 zeroemission BEBs in 2017. The agency has garnered operational knowledge through the deployment and
maintenance of these low- and no-emission vehicles, as well as industry best practices and lessons
learned, both by RTD and other public transit service providers throughout North America and globally.
Transition Planning
On April 25, 2023, the RTD Board of Directors passed a motion to approve the summary scope of work
for a solicitation, and to subsequently authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) to enter into a
contract, for consulting services for the development of a holistic Low/No Emission Facilities and Fleet
Transition Plan (Plan) compliant with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), Pub. L. 117-58, in an
amount not to exceed $10,000,000.
Following the Board action, the agency subsequently released a solicitation on May 23, 2023, to select
a consultant to lead the planning process. After reviewing proposals from five qualified firms, WSP USA,
Inc was selected to lead the Plan. On August 24, 2023, RTD executed a contract with WSP USA, Inc to
complete the Plan, and the project kicked off shortly thereafter.
DISCUSSION
The Plan assesses four major areas of transition – facilities, fleet, workforce, and finances. The fleet
analysis assesses RTD’s future fleet needs utilizing various propulsion technologies, including battery
electric, fuel cell electric, diesel hybrid, compressed natural gas (CNG), and diesel. Because different
propulsion technologies require different infrastructure at supporting facilities, the facilities analysis will
determine what changes need to be made at RTD’s operating divisions to support a new fleet
technology. The financial analysis will evaluate costs associated with making the transition, and the
workforce development analysis will identify existing skill gaps and training needs to ensure the
workforce is adequately prepared for a transition.
This Discussion Item outlines high-level results of the Plan as well as steps for completing the Plan,
which will be finalized by December 13, 2024.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this discussion item.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps

November 13, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Stuart Summers, Chief Communications and Engagement Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
On Tuesday, February 27, 2024, the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) commissioned a peer review
of RTD’s paratransit service delivery, to be conducted by transit industry subject-matter experts. The
American Public Transportation Association (APTA) convened a peer review panel that included a
geographical representation of panelists from across the country. During the course of the months-long
thorough review, the panelists leveraged their expertise and professional experience to assess both
RTD’s Access-a-Ride (AaR) service, the agency’s complementary Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
paratransit service, and RTD’s Access-on-Demand (AoD) premium supplemental paratransit service. A
copy of the APTA Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next steps were distributed to the Board of
Directors on August 21, 2024, by the GM/CEO.
The overarching goal of the peer review was to help the agency better understand strengths and
opportunities, with respect to both ADA complementary paratransit and premium supplemental ondemand service, and to note potential improvements that support long-term sustainability. The panel
conducted a review of RTD’s paratransit operations to identify (1) best practices employed by similar
transit agencies, including for demand-response programs; (2) model program parameters, including
responsible cost controls and sound customer-facing processes; and (3) software, hardware, or other
tools to ensure optimal service performance and program cost-effectiveness.
DISCUSSION
Staff will provide the Board of Directors a summary of policy recommendations under consideration for
changes to AaR and AoD services. These recommendations are a culmination of recommendations from
the APTA peer review, public feedback collected related to the peer review recommendations, and other
sources of information such as other transit agencies. Staff will also discuss next steps in the process.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There are no financial impacts associated with this discussion item.

If RTD is REALLY serious about creating greater paratransit rider satisfaction', it starts with
implementing an escalation path for managing disputes with ride sharing companies. The world
is not made up of perfect individuals, and money and power corrupts. When an unfulfilled trip
occurs through NO fault of the passenger, they lose their AoD voucher. Unfortunately, the
voucher is not reinstated, despite RTD's payment to the vendor. People with disabilities deserve
equal access to all areas of community life, including the private transportation services
provided by companies like Uber. You have got to see this as blatantly wrong.
Additionally, Uber has fraudulently charged my debit card cancellation fees even though the
driver did not arrive, or, failed to complete the trip due to driver misconduct. Uber has been
violating their own refund polices by refusing to issue refunds when good cause exists. The
egregiousness of this action is that most people with disabilities live on fixed incomes and do
not have money to burn. When I take Uber, there is an expectation of civility and professional
courtesy. I have had unpleasant encounters with some drivers just for asking for their name
(per Uber's recommendation), prior to boarding to ensure that I am getting into the right
vehicle. One driver cancelled the trip. The other incident involved my inability to see the license
plates because it was dark out and they were covered in snow. When I asked the driver's name,
he too, drove off and yelled an expletive in the process.
The above incidents reflect my concern that Uber is hiring drivers with abusive, toxic
personalities which make them ethically unfit to work in a customer-facing role, especially when
it involves the most vulnerable among us. RTD's management was of NO help when I reached
out to report the incidents. RTD's excuse was that ride share companies are unwilling to share
their findings directly with them. However, rideshare companies can communicate directly with
the passenger. The promise of a follow up never came to fruition on more than one occasion.
Silence is the message of dismissal. Trying to communicate directly with Uber about an issue
results in being asked to repeat yourself. When they do not want to deal with the issue, Uber's
excuse is that you reached the wrong team, which is designed to make you frustrated that you
give up. Customer service and safety are not mutually exclusive and should always be a top
priority for RTD and rideshare companies. RTD's inability to provide rigid oversight is a
symptom of the problem.
An escalation process for disputes can include: 1. Identifying the root cause; 2. Listening
actively to the parties; 3. Communicating is key; 4. Timely escalations/resolutions; 5. Designing
simple escalation paths; 6. Designing an escalation policy; 7. Documenting previous escalations
can be helpful in improving the experience in the future; 8. Emphasizing the importance of
making passengers feel heard and valued, and, instilling a disabled passenger-centric culture
are effective ways to increase customer satisfaction. Thank you for the opportunity to provide
feedback. I hope it will be taken seriously.

Have awesome weekend
Hello! I just wanted to share that I love the little shuttle vehicles and how homey and
comforting they feel to me. I know they're a bit bumpy but I actually enjoy that, and I know it
is hard for some and I'll be a little sad when the vehicles that pick me up aren't as glorious and
beautiful as Accessawhy.¸ someday it's my dream to go in person and see all the Accessarides
lined up together. I want to go to the yard and see all of them, I have named each one and I
love them so so much!
Some of the changes in procedure are beginning to streamline operations most times. Metro
Taxi, subcontractor for Access on Demand, still leaves a lot to be desired many times. On
Saturday, 09/19, I requested Access-on-Demand to take me to 7370 W 52nd Ave in Arvada to
pick up a prescription. (There were a couple of other items I wanted that were unavailable.)
This seemingly simple errand took a total of 7.5 hours to accomplish. It recently took me 1.75
hours to get an AAR bus to take me to the Colfax WalMart store which is 3.5 miles from my
home. These kind of experiences stand out in one's mind when considering paratransit
reservation requests. There are times that these systems work smoothly, but nasty episodes
tend to stand out and make one leery of using RTD services.
If RTD wants to save money perhaps they could contract with a company like ride obi
https://rideobi.com/ or create an APP that competitively shops the ridesharing companies and
whichever is cheaper the APP selects that one. I know from first hand experience at any given
point there can be a 20% to 40% difference or cost savings by selecting one or the other. This
would also help the users keep track of how many trips they are using as a whole vs what trips
they booked on uber and what they booked with on Lyft separately.
My son sustained a TBI in 2018 and we live on the northern boundary line for RTD. We found
AaR to be completely unreliable even if they actually showed up. There were multiple trips
where he would ride for over two hours and miss his appointments. One trip picked him up
early for a dr appointment in Denver. Then two hours later my son called me stating that he
had to go to the bathroom, but the driver wont stop. I looked at my, "find my friend AP," and I
could see he was way over in Wheat Ridge nowhere close to where we live or to Denver. I
talked to the driver and he ended up pulling into a gas station so he could go to the bathroom.
The driver assured me he was the next stop, but he would likely be a half hour late to that
appointment. I got side tracked with my job and about an hour and a half later AaR showed up
at the house dropping him off. I asked the driver what are you doing here? You were supposed
to be taking him to his appointment in Denver. The driver asked, "I was supposed to be taking
him somewhere?" I said yes, do you think he was just going for a joy ride on a bus for 4.5
hours. Then the driver said, "I can take him to Denver now", and I told him no his Dr
appointment was two hours ago. Unfortunately, it is a true story.
We have tried metro taxi, yellow cab, but they dont service our area. We have tried intelliride
and I think they canceled just about every appointment we scheduled given our location. AoD
has been the only reliable transportation to get my son to his speech therapy, physical therapy,

hippo therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, monthly blood draws, primary care appointments,
psychiatry appointments, group therapy, personal counseling, and to /from his part time
sheltered employment. Please figure out how to keep AoD as it is a much better and more
reliable solution for people with disabilities.
I am going to provide feedback about RTD's Access a Ride program in regards to my young
adult son's experience using it (and my experience helping him with Access a Ride). I am very
disappointed that RTD is thinking of eliminating Access on Demand which felt like not only a
game changer but also a life saver. I wish RTD would think outside the box and try to
determine how to keep Access on Demand. Below is a list of issues we had while using Access
on Demand.
It was very cumbersome to schedule a ride. Sometimes we would call to be told that we were
7th or 8th in line and put on hold inevitably. The recording would say your wait time is
approximately five more minutes. The problem was 5 minutes turned into 10, 10 turned into 20,
20 turned into 40 and before you knew it you'd been on hold for an hour. What's even worse is
being on hold for that long and because you're on a cell phone somehow your call gets
dropped. Well guess what? you have to start all over again and you've lost your place in line.
The other issue for my son is that he previously had a severe and significant brain injury. This
affected his voice so that sometimes his words were slurred or difficult to understand. He would
want to be independent and schedule a ride but many of the customer service reps that he
spoke to could not understand him so that he would have to put "mom" on to help schedule his
ride.
Another disappointing aspect of access a ride was the amount of time one would have to waste
in order to even use the program. time is money and those riders were losing a lot of time. My
son would have to schedule his pickup time way, way, in advance of his actual appointment.
Sometimes that wasn't even enough and he would be late missing therapy minutes. Then on
the pick-up end, he would have to wait another 30 to 45 minutes for a pick up. One simple
appointment could turn into a ¾ day ordeal solely due to the time gobbling Assess A Ride.
Sometimes my son would end up with a very questionable driver. One time he was picked up
by a newly hired elderly driver. My son was supposed to be getting transportation to a vision
therapy appointment in Cherry Creek. Instead what happened was the driver took him way up
into Boulder County and my son recognized that was not right and alerted my husband. My
husband discovered his location through GPS and my phone feature. My husband had to cancel
the appointment because my son never would have made It in time. That makes my son get hit
with penalty charges of $25 to $50 depending on what type of appointment he's missed even
though it was no fault of his own. A different time my son was picked up and he should have
been heading to an appointment at approximately 8845 Wagner Street in Westminster. instead
I got called by him and he told me that he was way down south. I thought that was strange
and I checked his GPS and sure enough he was nowhere near his appointment. I called
dispatch and they could not tell me why he was driven so far past his appointment location. So
basically he went on Access a Ride from north Thornton all the way past his original destination
to Wheat Ridge to pick up another Access A Ride customer, and then back again to
Westminster. My son spent so many hours on that particular day, just riding around. Another
time he was supposed to be picked up around 5 pm or so. He waited and waited, but the
Access a Ride never came. He ended up having to call us because Access a Ride didn't have

1.E.4.d

Packet Pg. 337

another driver that could be dispatched out to pick him up. He would have had to pay an
expensive $50 Uber ride home for one way, or what he did was call us and we had to drive 30
minutes down to Denver and then back home to pick up our son. This could have been
dangerous especially since it was approaching nighttime in downtown Denver. A different time
my son was never picked up at home after waiting for a long, long time. A back up ride was
supposed to be sent and that didn't happen. Access a Ride dispatch never could tell us what
happened. Disorganization.
The fact that Access a Ride is only available on days that a particular fixed bus route goes by
one's house makes it difficult in terms of work. For instance, during the weekdays there is a
fixed route that goes nearby so on weekdays he can take Access a Ride but not on weekends.
This makes it difficult if he wants to pick up hours or gets scheduled on a weekend with his
employer because he does not have guaranteed transportation.
Similarly, the fact that one needs to live within a certain distance of a fixed bus station route,
really limits where one can look for a house regardless of if my son were to look on his own for
a place to rent or live, or if we wanted to move into a new house. We might find the perfect
place to live within the RTD district and pay the RTD tax, but be restricted because the house is
not on the fixed bus route even though we are paying the RTD taxes. That is too constraining,
limiting and not fair since we would be paying for the services.
Always needing to schedule 24 hours in advance for Access a Ride is not realistic. What if one
gets invited to a social event last minute, or needs to pick up a prescription right away, or
asked to work an extra shift? Well guess what due to the 24 hour rule, one is out of luck.
I am a high school special education teacher. I view Access a Ride as a type of accommodation
of sorts. Accommodations are supposed to "level" the playing field for people with disabilities.
In reality, Access a Ride does not "level" the playing field. Access a Ride makes things
cumbersome and difficult for those with disabilities where in contrast the Access on Demand
program was actually leveling the playing field.
I really hope that in a world where those with disabilities feel like they have lost so much in
comparison to those without disabilities, I hope RTD will think outside the box and figure out a
way to keep the Access on Demand program more affordable so that those who need it the
most and are disabled don't have yet another "loss". Perhaps instead of 60 one way trips a
month, it is cut back to 40 one way trips. Or perhaps there are a certain number of $25 credit
voucher rides (only four to five one way), but more $15 to $20 voucher credits one way, and
the most of $10 to $15 ride vouchers. There ARE other ways to problem solve.
My suggestion is to eliminate access to Uber black and Uber XL. They are more expensive than
simply Uber x. Another recommendation is to cover Uber share. It is price less expensive than
even Uber x. Thanks.
Hi, First of all so grateful to have access a ride and it's been life changing. My only concern is
the fact we cannot add stops to the rides. I've found it's much easier and cheaper to use a
single ride with a super quick stop (running into store, pick up prescriptions etc) then to do two
separate ones. It is especially harder to wait outside in the cold waiting for another driver who

My son lives about 10 minutes from work, but has been taken all the way to Commerce City
instead of being dropped off first. When I called RTD they said he should have been dropped
off first but couldn't get hold of the driver to find out what happened. The drivers have taken
other riders before my son like all the way to Casa Bonita so he was late to work. The drivers
have come up to 45 minutes early and just wait. It seems like there could be a better system. I
would like to see a more efficient way of picking up and delivering people to work. Sometimes
they take him to the wrong King Soopers and he has to tell the driver how to get to the correct
one. Thank you.
My resident is outside of the bus route. I don't feel that Access Ride little buses should fall
under those guidelines when a passenger request Access Ride to their home. I am certified to
ride but cannot get the service due to my home is 3/4 mile out of the service area for buses.
But I can go to the mall to be pickup which is 7 minutes from my home. I need a lift vehicle
therefore the service of Access Demand Ride want work unless you have a vehicle to pick me
up with a lift. It is very difficult to get to my medical appointments without this service. No
family or friends available to pick me up. Please take this under consideration to change Route
for Access Ride to accommodate me and others living in this area. There is a neighbor who is in
a wheelchair, and they could not get any service. Please take this request in consideration.
Before I moved, they told me I could still get the pickup. I was told to go up to Wal Mart which
is 7 minutes at the Southland Mall and access ride would pick me up there, first of all medical I
cannot drive so that is not an option for me. I am asking Board Members to please take a look
at my situation and approve for Access Ride Service to come pick me up since I am already
certified for the service. Thank you.
I love Access on demand and depend on it almost daily.
I don't understand this my feedback to RTD as an 69 year old wh just had heart surgery in
September and is being scheduled for total hip replacement surgery to be able to assistance
with my free rides to grocery store to doctors even to visit my grands I am so very grateful
these rides has been the best ever for me much appreciated
My Son rides your accessaride services to go to his day program every morning during the
week. He has been in a the vehicle for more than an hour and a half for a lousy twenty minutes
drive. This has been a coming theme with drivers having 3 participants or more and way too
long for members to be stuck in a vehicle. There is no limit to the amount of time the
participants can be stuck in a vehicle just to get to their destination. I will be complaining to the
attorney general regarding this. It is inhumane and absolutely ridiculous!!!!!!!!
I'm glad there is this transportation for seniors and disabled. However, I believe that being on
social security, it costs me too much if I have to depend on Access A Ride all the time. Thank
you

Greetings, RTD Staff and Board of Directors, I know you have a lot of feedback to parse, so just
a few points: * If you restrict AOD to 3/4 mile from a bus stop and only the hours the relevant
bus line runs, I'll lose my part-time job at the Amazon sortation center in Aurora. It simply
won't make sense to pay full price for an Uber round trip four days a week, which will likely
exceed $80 some days. * If you reduce the max trips to 40, that would mean that people who
commute to work five days per week will have 0 trips to do anything else, especially if you
refuse to reinstate the multiple stop option. That does not seem equitable. * Everyone I know
who uses AOD is willing to pay some sort of fare, but raising it from 0 to $6.50 or similar would
be an unreasonable burden. I would say a good max would be $5. * Fred indicated that he
thought that one reason why the AOD cost per trip was rising is that AOD riders were taking
longer trips because they were able to under this program. This makes no sense to me, and I
don't know anyone who is doing that. * Like it or not, you have indeed created a separate
market with AOD, but this is driven by AAR's limitations, most importantly 24-hour-ahead
scheduling, the time it takes to reach your destination, and the inability to schedule immediate
round-trip rides. * If AOD is a premium service as you say, using equity as a reason to disallow
the use of multiple-stop trips is a logical fallacy. It's either a premium service subject to
different rules than AAR, or it's not. Circumstances clearly indicate that it is. * My
recommendation: Raise the fare to $5; raise the cap to $30; keep the trip limit at 60 per month.
Create an app that riders and staff can use as an AOD dashboard to keep track of number of
trips, etc. As this app will need to interface with several APIs from taxi and ridesharing services,
it will probably be quite costly to create, but the staff time/salary savings should eventually pay
for it many times over. Investigate working with the new employee-owned ridesharing company
Co-Op Colorado. They're a new ridesharing platform that's employee owned and trying to gain
a foothold. You might be able to work out a deal that gives them the guaranteed business they
would get by being an RTD AOD provider in exchange for paying less per trip than you would
Uber, Lyft, or any other company you're currently working with. * For Board members: By now,
staff should have furnished you with data regarding how AOD can be put on a sustainable path.
If it's incomplete or doesn't pass the smell test, demand better data until you're comfortable
endorsing their recommendation or modifying it to best suit all parties involved. * As you're
reading this, you've undoubtedly been deluged with a whole bunch of rider feedback on top of
staff's recommendation. If you're not comfortable voting on that recommendation at the
November meeting, by all means, table it until December. This will allow staff to answer any
questions you may have as well as giving you more time to digest all this and think of any ways
staff's recommendation could be improved upon. Thanks, RTD staff and directors, for all you do
to keep Denver moving! Cheers, Tim
My daughter, Kayla (age 26, intellectually disabled), has been using Lyft via the Acess-a-Ride
program for more than two years. The program has been life-changing for Kayla and me
because Kayla has transportation independence and I (single parent of disabled adult) am no
longer a 'taxi service' (I say this nicely; truly) for my daughter. While I was always willing to
take Kayla where she needed to go, Kayla's transportation independence gave me a new sense
of independence and allowed me to start dating again, etc. I am incredibly thankful for this
program. Thank you!

independent thank you so much for listening to my story
I have recently become a user of these services. My second time I scheduled rides was
unpleasant due to the length of time I spent in the vehicle and the frustration of one of the
drivers. This particular time I needed a round trip to the doctor office. On my way to the visit, I
was in the vehicle for almost 2 hours which would've been okay if it hadn't wreaked havoc on
my body. The ride back wasn't much better as the driver was upset about where he had to
drive me. He proceeded to speed and weave recklessly through traffic to get me home while
muttering angrily under his breath. I understand that the job is stressful especially with the
significant increase in traffic making rides take longer but this was a bit much for my delicate
body to take.
Access on demand program is truly revolutionary and the best program in the country! Please
keep it the way it is and don't make drastic and negative changes to it. I rely heavily on it and
as someone with limited income, I am saving so much time, hassle and money. Its a true life
changer!

RTD's Access-On-Demand adds immense value to my life. I am 75 years old. I have rheumatoid
arthritis, diabetes, and double vision and can't drive. My husband works long hours and can't
take me to most of my medical appointments. Without AOD I would almost be a shut-in and
would not be able to go to medical appointments as often. Please continue this wonderful
service. Thank you
I thank RTD for allowing those of us with disabilities the opportunity to use Uber/Lyft to get
around town. It was often difficult to get picked up in my area using the bus. The credit
towards a car ride has been a huge benefit - I often would be unable to get around without it.
Hello. I am sorry I missed the meetings and have not provided as much feedback as I probably
should have. I am guessing it is a little hard for RTD to get feedback on these services. I will
say I very much appreciate the services for my son. Without them, he would need so much
more support from an individual to provide the services. Without them, he would have a very
difficult time and probably not be able to do the things that he is able to do because of these
services. Access-a-Ride is a good service but it seems to not be very reliable and there is a lot
of wait time. We use Access-on-Demand primarily. It has been a life saver. He is able to get
back and forth to and from day program and work reliably and timely. Without this he would
not be able to have the job that he has or probably go to day program. He needs structured
time, day program and work. Without Access-on-Demand these things would be very difficult to
access. The host home providers do not provide transportation and riding the bus is not very
safe for him. He is impulsive and does not make good choices often due to his disability and the
Access-on-Demand is a safe and reliable tool for him to use. I hope this is helpful.

My Access-r-Ride # is 113527. I live at Adara Nursing home 12975 Sheridan Blvd, Broomfield
80020. The company now running these handicapped buses has Stopped weekend pick-up for
this address. This has had a high impact on my ability to visit family and friends. Maybe You
don't visit family and friends on Saturday or Sunday. If that is the case it would Not affect you.
I do not expect change, just more disappointment. Respectfully, Richard D. Edmondson
I had a great visit with RTD's Access-a-Ride they from the ride there to the facility where they
do the test. For me the only thing that I had concerns with is when you make the appointment
that they get the appointment address and where to pick up the person from address is right
when they make.
I think RTD is doing a great job. I have lived in many other places and states. Florida you could
not take a bus from one county to the next even though it was populated, Texas the same
thing, California you could get from county to county but it would take you 9 hours. So
comparing all above Denver has the best public transit in the country. Keep up the good work
I don't believe passengers should be penalized for going over 60 rides when services don't sync
up and track how many rides have been used. Even if customers try to check their usage, they
are given false information and are mislead and then punished for it by services being
suspended, when they count on it for transportation to work, medical appointments, and for
required errands like picking up prescriptions, groceries, etc. This service has introduced a
tremendous amount of flexibility and independence to the lives of people with disabilities, and
to have that wrenched away is devestating.
I already submitted a feed back so this won't be long. Sorry was interrupted and didn't want to
loose what I had written though I hadn't yet proofed read it. In my prior feedback I need to
just clarify that many of us do not have availability of family and friends to help us with daily
tasks requiring transportation that are often taken for granted. That's why the on-demand is
important. The other issue concerns making a quick stop to drop something off or pick
something up. I get that regular bus service does not have this option. In this situation, I would
think it would actually be a cost savings over another trip call through the app. Naturally there
would have to be some time parameters. (3 to 5 minutes) Example of its use might be a family
who has children to drop off at school. I know personally of this need by family/families. Also
an instance where a prescription or a necessary item needs to be quickly picked up when it can
be waiting at the register or customer service. Thanks for reading this additional note. Feel free
to contact me if more clarification or explanation is needed.
I am a school bus driver with a sister who rides Access-a-Ride. She is in a wheelchair with
disabilities including communication and behavior issues. I know as a school bus driver, we
work very hard to keep children from being on a bus too long, yet your dispatchers make no

how my sister was forced to go by her house and continue to someone's house up north. I am
talking about nights where she was sent to the other side of Denver and back. There are no

limits to how long you are keeping her on the bus - as a school bus driver, we go out of our
way to make sure the kids are not longer than an hour per run. Your dispatchers seem to be
into a special kind of torcher for the disabled. There should be a limit for adults as well as kids.
If it can be done for disabled children, it should be possible for disabled adults who have no
choice but to use your services.
Thank you for reading this feedback. I'm a long time Access-A-Ride rider and I have greatly
appreciated the service During the past years. At this point I'm able to travel alone without
assistance generally so I find the OOn-Demand service meets my current needs way better than
A-A-R. Currently Even as a guide dog user with the issues of being passed up, and being
rejected for a ride, I'm willing to continue using On-Demand because of the advantages not the
least of which is being able to get to appointments timely. We can also act independent
scheduling our Maneeded rides. any of us don't have access to transportation by friends and
family for daily living tasks including medical. When I ran into an issue with Access that made
me concerned for my physical safety I began using OnDemand and haven't looked back. I know
others who have done the same for perhaps different reasons. I would like to see this
incorporated in to regular service rather than complementary. I also tip the driver generally.
Perhaps we could do as On-Demand riders a little more cost sharing though it would likely cut
in to the tip amounts. I. Understand that ADA transportation in other parts of the U.S. is less
than what I was paying per person individually fn regular Access when I was riding it
previously. So I understand that here, it is more expensive than many places. Because Denver
has instituted the On-Demand, at least for now and I hope we don't loose it, why shouldn't RTD
lead the way with ADA and not be a follower. I appreciate that other agencies have made
recommendations in the study and some are good. However, I'd like to see Denver be a leader
and not a follower, thus potentially bringing down sthe quality of service here. I recognize the
issue of dealing with cost savings which could take some creativity. Thanks for reading. I did
attend one of the online meetings, but there were too many of us to speak and I was one of
those with a hand up for all that time. I sincerely hope everybody's comments are taken
seriously and with deliberation. Thanks again.
This service is great , bring back multi stop options
On behalf of my adult son, 25, who relies on Access a Ride multiple times a week, I urge RTD
to keep the Access On Demand option open and available (even if you need to increase the
buy-in/voucher price point) because it is the ONLY way many in this community can have a
chance to get to a (usually part time) work shift or program meetup ON TIME. The shared ride
bus system is very restrictive because the routes can often be so long - 2 hours or more, and
countless times arrive well outside the 30 minute window. This prohibits independence building,
access to community events/jobs and 'life' outside of the home setting, increasing isolation and
desperation. Access on Demand should be the basis of all future planning to provide
reasonable, reliable and safe transport options for disabled, particularly IDD impacted users like
my son.
I want to state again that the AoD has been a lifesaver for me. I haven't had this freedom to
set appointments and know I can get there quickly since 2003. It is also freedom to shop at
stores I wouldn't have had access to before. My only request is that if there is a base fare
charge in the future, it be done on a sliding scale according to one's income. Thank you

I think the entire program is amazing. I became paralyzed in Oct 2023. I liked going places and
doing things. Before I was approved for paratransit, WAV transport was 400% to 600% higher
and some 1000%. All of the proposed cost changes are reasonable. My concern is AaR vs AoD.
AaR is great, if you know exactly what and when. AoD is great for the flexibility. I personally
don't have a rigid schedule, so I rely heavily upon AoD. Reducing to a 30 or 40 trip per month
max means 1 per day, or just enough to get to work and back, then being forced to use AaR
with no flexibility day of. Charging $3.50 is a steal. My concern is who is getting the $3.5? RTD
to offset the fair they are subsidizing? The up to $35 fair? If it is subsidized, then leave the max
at $25 and increase the cost with the surcharge of $3.5. Then the $10, 3 mile, 10 min trip is still
free, but if I want to go across town, I pay for it, but a very reasonable charge. Second, if you
are going to make a fare charge per trip, you should have a better system running the AoD. It
shouldn't time out, it should create a que, your dispatchers should have access and authority
over drivers. The software or dispatch should be able to see all drivers where they are and
destinations and have the ability to assign a driver to a pickup. So instead of me getting
assigned someone to drive 30 minutes across town to get me, the system should show that in
5-10 a driver 10 minutes from me can pick me up. Faster for me, fuel efficient and more cost
effective for the AoD program. The fuel and pay wasted on drivers going past a sitting bus has
to be an enormous overhead cost. I love this system. I win so much more than I lose. But when
I lose, it's atrocious. 2 hrs to get a ride? I would love to discuss this if anyone has questions!

When It Comes To The Access-A-Ride Service, I Would Like To Suggest That There Be More
Consistency With Requesting IDENTIFICATION OF THE PASSENGER(S). Currently It IsUp To
The Discretion Of The Driver To Ask For ID NUMBER AFTER THE PASSENGER HAS BOARDED
OR THE PASSENGER IS ASKED TO PROVIDE THE ID PICTURE AND/OR ID NUMBER BEFORE
BOARDING. The Second REQUEST I WANT TO PROPOSE IS THAT AN INVESTIGATION INTO
THE CONSISTENT OVERCHARGING VIA BOTH UBER AND LYFT ON-DEMAND SERVICES. EVERY
WEEK I ALWAYS HAVE TO DISPUTE CHARGES EIITHER DIRECTLY WITH UBER AND LYFT
SERVICES VIA THEIR APP OR VIA MY PENTAGON FEDERAL CREDIT UNION. PLEASE. THIS
ABUSE HAS GOT TO STOP. LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS TO BE A PART OF THE
INVESTIGATION. PLEASE. BOTH SET OF EMPLOYEES OF RTD ON-DEMAND AND THE DRIVERS
OF BOTH LYFT AND UBER. THE LAST CONCERN PERTAINS TO THE ACTUAL SURVRY THAT
YOUR AGENCY SENT FOR ME VIA BOTH EMAIL ADDRESS AND POSTAL MAIL. THE QUSTIONS
OVERALL SEEMED TO BE FINDING AS IT'S OBJECTIVE A WAY TO JUSTIFY REDUCING THE
AMOUNT OF TRIPS (CURRENTLY 60 TRIPS) PER MONTH). I THINK THAT IS A SAD AND
UNFORTUNATE .I STAND TO BE CORRECTED AND WRONG. HOWEVER, I FIND THAT THE
QUESTIONS WERE OVERWHELMINGLY AN EFFORT TO JUSTIFY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF
TRIPS THAT RTD CURRENTLY PAYS THE FIRST $25 DOLLARS OF EACH OF THE CURRENTLY 60
TRIPS TO A LOWER AMOUNT OF TRIPS. THAT IS MY OPINION OF MY OBSERVATION. LETS
RAISE THE STANDARD AND OVERALL QUALITY OF THE OBJECTIVE(S) OF THE SURVEYS AND
TRANSLATION IN TO THE IMPROVED SERVICES THAT IS PROVIDED TO THE DISABLED
COMMUNITY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS EFFORT TO
IMPROVE THE PARATRANSIT SERVICES PROVIDED TO THE DISABLED COMMUNITY. THANKS

My name is Aliah Aragon, and I have been a dedicated Access A Ride customer for several

participating in the activities I enjoy, especially on weekends. This limitation affects my ability to
attend social events, go to work, and even make it to critical doctor's appointments. Access A
Ride has been a vital service for maintaining my independence, but recent restrictions have
made it increasingly difficult for me to live my life freely. It is disheartening to face these
barriers, which result in isolation simply because of where I live. I kindly ask you to consider
expanding the service area or reducing the restrictions in regions like mine to ensure that
Access A Ride continues to provide the independence it was designed to offer. More flexibility
would greatly improve my quality of life and allow me, and others in similar situations, to
remain active and engaged in our communities. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely, Aaliah Aragon
I think RTD is doing good.
Hello! I wanted to thank you so much for the access on demand program! I am a vision
impaired and mobility challenged single woman living alone. I do not have any family. Your
service has allowed me to continue functioning with independence. I am so appreciative of the
generous amount of rides with vouchers you have provided. I do realize that the costs of this
service are substantial, but keeping the program as it is would be such a blessing. I am on
private disability, (having worked at University Hospital I do not qualify for SSD), and my
monthly disbursement has remained the same since I first became disabled in 2015. With the
costs of EVERYTHING continuing to escalate, an added expense for transportation will add to
the struggles I am already facing. If lowering the number of trips I am allowed per month
would help in the financing of this program, (say from 60 trips per month to 30), I would be in
favor of that. Adding an extra fare would definitely be a burden for me. Thank you.
I set up a taxi to get my son to the hospital for an appointment. The call center said the cab
would pick him up with it an hour. I called back because no one showed up snd was told it
would be another hour. I then had to drive 50 miles to get my son to his appointment. The
entire attempt to get him to the appointment was a failure, and it created a lot of stress for my
son and the staff at the assisted living home. I need reliable service for my son, and better
communication from your end. I wish I could depend on the service that you have to offer but
that really was not the case. Thank you. Joan
I appreciate the services provided to my daughter through RTD as I've never used them until
now. They are efficient and professional. Hopefully, we will be able to continue using them and
certainly know that they are reliable.
My final feedback... As you might suspect, AOD is critical to supporting my independence. I
depend on AOD to get me to work in a timely manner. This is one of the main reasons I've had
to rely on AOD instead of AAR. In other words, AAR has not been a reliable form of
transportation to get me to destinations on time. If I had to only rely on AAR, I'm sure I would
be written up for being late to work, if not terminated from my current job. Before AOD, I relied
on family, friends, and co-workers for timely transportation. There are other times that I can
opt to use AAR without being so concerned about timely transportation but even then I can't
rely on pick up time. In other words, AOD is critical to my work life because drop off and pick
up times are not reliable with AAR. I have two final asks: - Please ensure that the cost to use
AOD is affordable for all riders regardless of income, and that AOD tipping and other RTD public
transportation costs for riders with disabilities are taken into consideration. - Please change AAR

information about the number of other pick ups (i.e., stops) or if the ride is a non-stop, and/or
a list of daily times that show which ride has multiple stops and which rides are non-stops.
Thank you.
I have, on occasion, NOT BEEN PICKED-UP, at my home to go to doctor appointments. The
reason, I was told by Dispatch, was that not enough drivers showed up that day! Please work
on correcting that situation. Other than that I am VERY satisfied with you operation. The drivers
are always professional, safe and get me where I'm going on time.
I use access a ride for my transportation and I depend on it.
I absolutely rely on Access on Demand to get to work and doctors appointments and church
and visiting family and friends!
Whith out Access Cab, I would be home bound, I have scoliosis and can't get to the bus stop
with all the walking. I live in a Senior building and we almost all use your services, and we are
so thankful for them !!!
Everything was great, Thank You
I appreciate RTD Access A Ride very much. Without it I wouldn't be able to take care of very
important errands that are very essential to my living.
I did not use paratransit until on demand service was a thing. I had been told enough horror
stories about the big paratransit vans to know for a fact that they were not for me. I am blind
and use a mobility cane and I preferred getting lost in the snow in 0 degree whether on
occasion than to having to rely on paratransit vans which have historically ben inconsistent and
stigmatizing. Then again, I am fortunate and could always call my wife to come and bail me out
of a jam. I have also been fortunate enough to be able to afford the occasional Uber at full fair.
With the arrival of the on demand service, though, this all changed for me. I was an avid user
of this service and found my life had been greatly enhanced. I was able to reliably pick up my
kid from school if he was sick. I was able to run a quick errand for my wife. I was able to do so
many things without having to think about the extra time and hassle it would take me to use
public transportation. I only had to keep in mind the number of rides I had remaining in a
month. At the time I am writing about, I think the limit was 60 rides per month. I recognized at
this time that the system was likely over extended but -shrugs- who was I to say? I wasn't
going to self ration because I knew that no one else would. I studied econ and finance in school
and I understand incentives and why the overuse of public goods occurs. My sincere hope for
the system is that the cost per ride remain economical for riders who need to go a short
distance. I'd say a minimum payment of $2 per ride contributed by the patron with a $25 max
or something like that. I think a $6 minimum is far to high and would negatively impact people
who need to make full use of the service to get to work and such. I think it is perfectly fair to
prioritize passengers who are going a relatively short distance over passengers with longer
routes by subsidizing the first few miles over later miles, although, I understand this creates a
diferent sort of challenge for some. Still, I think more people will benefit a greater amount by
subsidizing the first few miles over later miles. Perhaps it would be just as reasonable to tell
folks they can go X number of miles in a month , rather than x number of rides? For

Hi there - just wanted to write in my support for and appreciation for the Uber integration. It
gives me more freedom and independence than I can possibly put into words. I know it's not
100% usable for everyone, but for me it is absolutely perfect. I hope to see it as a continued
part of the program moving forward. Thanks!
Contined: If the Access drivers used the lane on the left. There are many people who
experience chronic pain. The Center for Disease Control claims that 30 % of people aged
20â€60 years old and people over age 65 years it increases to 70%. So this affects a number of
people. In addition to helping riders it would result in less damage than to your vehicles.

and busses that are primarily in the lane on the far right. ers used the left lane primarily n to
The ride in the small bus is usually very rough and bumpy. I have chronic pain in my back and

Access on demand has changed my life. I am able to shop, get to medical appointments,
church,, and look after an elderly parent. This program is much more efficient than access a
ride.. I have been stranded several times due to staffing issue. Access on demand is a lifeline.
I work til 11pm & there is no safe place to walk or wait once the store closes. I can call uber as
my shift ends. It's not safe having to wait up to 30 minutes for AaR by myself & I'm anxious
Drivers need to clean their car and themselves. The order is unreal.
As a parent of a frequent user of limited bus transportation and only 15 or so times utilized
AoD, these are my insights. 1) Your "Peer Review Team" members from New York, LA, and DC
represent cities with larger public transit systems that are more accessible to people with
disabilities. Denver's population and its transit busse do not compare. It is an apples and grape
comparison. The people with disabilities are dependent on complementary or supplemental
services. If busses in Windsor to Fort Collins to Denver exhisted, we'd have the eccessability we
need for doorstep to provider care. But we don't. 2) "A new market" has been created? No. An
unserved/underserved population's needs are now being met for the first time ever. But it is not
working for everyone. 3) The only positives for AaR level of service seem to be that the drivers
are nice and the on-time pickup stats have improved a little. But the pick up times leave most
to be desired...and creates a lack in safety for my at risk adult daughter. The trip duration and
arrival times which are currently why AaR does not meet the needs of most. The peer report

implies that RTD is not meeting the FTA requirement for measuring on-time performance or
missed trips. 4) The Peer Review Report recommends a "ridership analysis that would guide
development of an appropriate structure". Will this be done prior to making recommendations
to the board? Understanding the impact to riders of imposing changes to fare, per-trip cap, and
monthly trip cap is important. 5) The timing of putting a proposal before the board does not
follow the peer review recommendations and is being pushed thru too fast Although RTD has
conducted surveys with limited riders and has met with limited number of stakeholders, the
majority of stakeholders only became aware of pending changes to AoD with an email in
October about virtual meetings. 6) The input from stakeholders at the virtual meetings does not
match the survey data presented at the September board meeting. 7) Referring to AoD as a
"premium" service is misleading because the reality is that AaR has never met the basic ADA
requirement of a "comparable" service to fixed-routes due to its unpredictable and unreliable
service which is corroborated by rider feedback, but not by the faulty measures RTD has used
to assess performance.
RTD has been an excellent provider of transportation for the 4 years I have been living in
Denver. I would like to take this time to say, "Thank you" for your stellar and excellence
service. Should you need to contact me directly for further clarity, I can be reached at 720 514
2478.
I am quite satisfied with RTD. I am using bus Pass and Huber taxi coupon $25/- . It helps me
lot the way my age is. Thank you. Kuldip Chager

My name is Isaac. I learned to ride RTD buses and light rail as part of my 18-21 Transition
Program with DPS. Most of the time I was able to ride RTD from both my parent's houses in
Denver to my program which met at several different locations in Denver. However, due to my
disability I have poor balance and this makes walking on snow and ice impossible. So, on days
when the sidewalks were snowy or icy, I did not go to my program. Access-a-Ride was not an
option because it could not get me to my program on time. My goal in completing the
Transition Program was to get a job. I worked with DVR and several employment agencies for 2
years trying to get a job at a company located on a bus route but this really limited my
opportunities to work. Again, Access-a-Ride was not an option because it could not get me to
work on time. When Access-on-Demand became available, I learned to ride Uber. This gave me
many more options to look for a job because the company didn't have to be directly on a bus
route and I didn't have to worry about falling on icy and snowy sidewalks. In May 2022, I was
hired part-time at a great company doing work that I love. Access-on-Demand made that
possible. I recently was offered to go from part-time to full-time work (working from home one
day per week) so I use Access-on-Demand for 8 trips per week to get to and from work.
Furthermore, last year I received a housing voucher for Jefferson county so I now live in my
own apartment. I have a longer commute so Access-on-Demand sometimes, with surge pricing,
costs me over $20/trip (which is what I get paid per hour) but it is the only way for me to keep
my job. Since I take 32 trips a month just for work, and take additional trips for groceries and
other necessities, the trip cap needs to be no less than 45 per month. (My mom helped me
write this.)

These are the questions and comments I have as a parent and legal guardian of a frequent
user of AoD. 1) Your "Peer Review Team" members from New York, LA, and DC represent cities
with robust public transit systems which are vastly more accessible to people with disabilities.
Denver's population and similarly its transit system does not compare in scope or size. There is
a critical mass that makes public transportation more effective and Denver does not have it.
Therefore, more people with disabilities are dependent on complementary or supplemental
services. 2) "A new market" has been created? No. An unserved/underserved population's
needs are now being met for the first time ever. 3) The only positives for AaR level of service
seem to be that the drivers are nice and the on-time pickup stats have improved. However, ontime pickup does not equal performance. It misses the trip duration and arrival time elements
which are currently why AaR does not meet the needs of most. The peer report implies that
RTD is not meeting the FTA requirement for measuring on-time performance or missed trips. 4)
The Peer Review Report recommends a "ridership analysis that would guide development of an
appropriate structure". Will this be done prior to making recommendations to the board? This is
critical information in terms of understanding the impact to riders of imposing changes to fare,
per-trip cap, and monthly trip cap. 5) The timing of putting a proposal before the board seems

I have had problems with many of my pick-ups, my rides are always late. I wish you could do a
better job scheduleing the rides. I am left sitting for over an hour most of the time. People are
not nice and waiting for so long could be dangerous. I hope you will fix the late ride problem
soon.
I think RTD does an awesome service for the community considering the different types of
populations it serves. Susan E MillerMBA
It's been happening pretty regularly that my daughter's pick up trip is 1-1.5 hrs. Her day
program starts at 9, and I was instructed several months ago to set her pick up window
between 8-8:30. How can we bring this back to a reasonable time in the car or bus? I've
noticed that it's the cab rides that typically are a lot longer than the bus.
I applied for the RTD program so when I have surgeries I can get to appointments or physical
therapy appointments and not inconvenience anyone. So far it's been very good.
I'm on the program where I can use Uber. It has changed my life I'm so happy. For the first
time in my life, I'm able to go places. Thank you RTD!

Due to the limitations of Access-a-ride and Access-on-Demand we have been forced to use
FlexRide, which has become more unreliable by the day. It is rarely, if ever, on time and even
the trips themselves are starting to take longer and longer. We would love to utilize more of the
paratransit services but RTD is going to need to change the limitations around then before we
can.
16th street mall bus, sometimes they ask where I want to get off and sometimes they don't!
Why?
Hello, Jason here. I have a rare genetic eye condition that's left me legally blind. The RTD rideshare program with Uber has been awesome! It's hard for me to use the Access-a-Ride bus, it
takes up the entire day. You have to call ahead and set it up, then pay $5 each way. It took
them 3 hours to get me home once, after an appointment. Too many riders and not enough
buses and drivers. The buses are big and bounce so much, my body and neck hurt. For me it
feels like I'm wasting my time and it just takes way too long for everything to come together.
Uber gets me there without the hassle, and there's always a ride close by. I get so much more
done now and don't feel stressed out by wondering if my bus will show up. I'm blind and don't
need a ramp or wheelchair access. Waiting too long in one spot can be dangerous in the wrong
area. Me showing my white cane can put me as a crime target also. I feel so much safer using
Uber and feel like a normal person again. Thank you for your time. -Jason Osten
Dear RTD Board of Directors, My name is Payge Nilsestuen, I am an Access-a-Ride and Accesson-Demand consumer, and as a young adult with a physical and developmental disability, I am
an active participant in disability movements throughout the state of Colorado. When I was
approved for Access-a-Ride, I was relieved. I could finally enjoy the freedom of movement
afforded to my non-disabled peers. My elation soon vanished. The service was inconvenient.
The pickup window is long—30 minutes is a long time for people to stand by, particularly if they
are on oxygen or waiting outside in unpredictable weather. Additionally, the trips are often
longer than the fixed route. Due to the unreliability of Access-a-Ride, I utilize the Access-onDemand service for medical appointments, job interviews, and work. These are events for
which I cannot afford to be late. I'd like to iterate that Access-on-Demand is not my preferred
choice. I value local entities and would gladly use the Access-a-Ride service if it were timely and
accessible, just as I would gladly use the bus and train system if it were near enough to my
residence. For one, I have concerns about the compensation afforded to Uber and Lyft drivers,
who are often the victims of predatory hiring practices and wage theft. I loathe contributing to
this practice with my consumption, and I often tip a lot to offset, making my trip more
expensive than if I used the Access-a-Ride system. I don't want to rely on private companies for
transportation; I want to use RTD, a local entity that is familiar with the Denver Metro terrain.
Earnestly, I want to be able to use both paratransit and the fixed-route bus and train system,
and am frustrated by the lateness of the Access-a-Ride service, and infrequency of the buses
and trains. Even more, I am frustrated by the possibility that the "complementary" Access-onDemand service may be rendered more difficult to use, if not cut altogether. In the context of
Denver's transit issues, Access-on-Demand is not complementary, rather, it is necessary
because the ADA-required service is cumbersome, if not outright violating our rights. Since the
popularity of Access-on-Demand has skyrocketed, I wonder if the fare stratifications proposed
in the customer survey will mitigate the cost at all. After all, at one of the feedback meetings
last week, RTD personnel explained that the fares collected from Access-a-Ride trips do not

cover the expenses of running the program. Why should collecting fares from Access-onDemand users be any different? There is a deficit of acceptable transportation for disabled
people in the Denver Metro area, so instead of cutting the only reliable service that works for a
fraction of consumers, RTD should work to make both the Access-a-Ride and Access-onDemand more effective. There should be more of a focus on attracting drivers for Access-aRide, upgrading the fleet to be more eco-friendly, and competing with private transit like To
The Rescue or Innovage. Plenty of paratransit users prefer an on-demand ride-share service,
but for many wheelchair users (especially power chair users), service dog handlers, and elderly
users who don't like website or app interfaces, Access-a-Ride represents our preferred option. I
fear that RTD will exploit our desperation as disabled people. Because many of us are reliant on
public transit services, or even Access-a-Ride exclusively, I fear both the paratransit and fixedroute systems will continue to erode, and we will be left with increasingly subpar services. All
while funding is continuously funneled to the transit police who do not prevent crime, but
harass and bully riders and further drive people away from using RTD in daily life. Please do not

I can't thank RTD ENOUGH FOR TRULY GIVING ME MY LIFE BACK. I am able to do all of my
errands and volunteer work thanks to Access-a-ride, bus and LYFT SERVICES. When I was no
longer able to drive at 72 I felt my life ended as my independence was compromised I fell into
a depression, I heard about this program and I've gained lots of independence back. Thank you
all.

Having Ridden accessories for several years while I was still working, I found the service to be
uneven at best. Since the partnership with uber I have found it to be almost always excellent.
The economy and convenience of this service has been outstanding. I'm so grateful for this
service. I. Would be happy to speak with any representative about the service.
Can I still take another person when I use UBER at no extra fee?
When I take a friend somewhere when we get to her house I have to get out too and call
another ride to get home. It would seem cheaper for you if l could just ride on home rather
than you pay for two separate rides.
Amazing service! God bless
Hi my name is Jeffrey mcphail. I live in Aurora SE and you guys said that you can't be able to

After our experience last week, I have decided not to use the service to get my daughter Julie
Duerst to her sister's house. I will drive her there in the morning and have the bus bring her
home. For weeks the pickup window has been 6:15 to 6:45 to get her 20 minutes away by
8am. last week she was up and waiting at 6:15. when the bus still hadn't come by 7:30 I
decided to drive her which made me late to work. I saw on my ring that the bus finally came at
8am! the time she was supposed to be at her destination. and then I got a nasty little text
saying she was a No-show. in my opinion the bus was a No-show!
Aside from some rides that have come too late, the service has been good. The drivers are
always great.
Keep the access on-demand program maybe reduce the rides to 45 so rtd can save some
money if the access on demand program gets removed you will be affecting 1800 people who

I am visually impaired and have have been using the access-on-demand program for the last
year or so. This program has changed my life. It has given me independence. Being visually
impaired and not driving limits options for employment and having this program opens up
opportunities to work in locations that would not be feasible using other public transit options. I
hope you can find a way to keep these partnerships and this program going. It has been such
an incredible program and provides me with so many opporunities I would not otherwise be
able to afford.
Rapid bus lines in the middle of Colfax and also Colorado Blvd make no sense. These would be
Very Costly, Unsafe, and difficult to maintain. Seems like RTD has money to waste, does not

The access on demand system needs to be looked over and improved. I tried to change the
phone number on my father's account and it took 3 months to do so. When you call to make a
change you are then given Shynesa's phone number. She never picks up the phone and her
voicemail says do not leave a message and to call another number. I called the other number 7
times over two months and while the message says calls will be returned within 48 hours - not
one phone call was ever returned. I finally was able to get everything corrected after my
husband called all the numbers on the page and found someone who picked up and connected
us with Shaneysa. Also, the access on demand drivers ae often rude to my father and his aide.
I have been using RTD's para-transit services for all my transportation needs, whether going to
the doctor's office or shopping. Because my motorized wheelchair is too large to navigate on
fixed routes, this service allows me to be somewhat socially independent. The Access-onDemand service allows me even more independence when I suddenly need to run an errand to
the bank or the grocery store on the same day. I hope you will continue operating this service
and the access-a-Ride, which are imperative to the Denver Metro area and those needing a
para-transit service.
I am an Access-A-Ride customer, and have used Access-A-Ride services and Access-OnDemand (AOD) services. The latter is truly "life changing". I feel like I can "life life" with this
service. I was not able to with Access-A-Ride (AAR). AAR was unreliable, patrons on the ride
frequently fought with one another, but I do understand and appreciate the effort to try to
provide a service for people like me who need an option other than the bus or rail system. I just
want to make clear that the AAR service is Not Equitable with the bus or light rail system. I
challenge you to take it for one month and you will realize how truly broken it is. The AOD
services solved the issue. I heard it called a "premium service". I disagree with the use of that
term or branding of the AOD program. It enables a person with a disability for whom the bus
and light rail system does not work, to get from point a to point b. Therefore, it is equitable for
them. For an able-bodied person, it may be a premium service, but for an AAR customer it is
equitable. Also, I understand the expense of the program has mushroomed. I was in the initial
Beta-test group when RTD was evaluating the program. You had to know that adoption would
increase. With AOD becoming so popular, RTD has saved and eliminated significant expenses
associated with the AAR service - taking vehicles out of service, no maintenance, fewer
employees & benefits expense, less insurance coats, less expenses to store the AAR vehicles.
That saved expense should offset the cost of the AOD service. What are those expenses. I'm
sure these have been considered....I would like to know them in the spirit of full transparency.
Thank you for listening to all of us AAR and AOD clients. We NEED the AOD service. It is truly
life changing. Please call me with further questions....I am an attorney, past biz exec, public
speaker, author, past Paralympic athlete, etc. I never wished to be blind, but now that I am....I
do need help to live life, and transportation is integral to living life. Obesity, depression and
unemployment plague the disabled community. AOD services directly combat those
effects....directly and indirectly. Thank you for listening, Jason
I found the Access a Ride program to be extremely hard and stressful to use: very
unpredictable and often quite late arrivals , stressed out riders and drivers, the need to book at
least a day early, etc. I often didn't go anywhere b/c of this . Absolutely terrible. I was thrilled
with the Access a Demand program which provides cheap, predictable, and last minute rides

The Access - on - Demand program has been a great blessing for me, Considering that I am a

Thank you
Access on demand program is a true time saver. It has brought many efficiencies and brought
blind individuals closer to their sighted counterparts when it comes to completing daily tasks
such as shopping, going to appointments and so on much more reliable. It would be great to
realize full potential of modern technology and allow for multiple stops as that can save agency
more money and the customer doesn't have to wait and request another ride.
I use both the Accessor Ride program as well as access on demand. A major concern I have is
that we would not be able to use access on demand outside of the access of right service area,
I would personally much rather pay a fee and still have access to access on demand Outside of
the RTD Accessa ride service area as I have doctors and other specialist that are not on the
Accessor Ride service route. I am also concerned about how high prices will go for access on
demand for trips within the RTD Accessor Ride service boundaries. Considering that it's curb to
curb and not door-to-door, and that we don't have the additional assistance that we would get
with Accessor Ride, it wouldn't make sense to increase the rates to Accessor service level rates.
I'd be willing to pay a couple dollars per trip, but definitely not $4.50 or above, unless it's
outside of the excess right service area and still with an RTD boundaries. I look forward to
providing more feedback as this process moves forward.

Good people
As someone with a physical disability who has many friends and loved ones who use the
Access-On-Demand program, I know just how vital it has been to their lives: physically,
emotionally, and socially. It provides a sense of freedom and independence in a society that has
not been (historically) designed for those of us with disabilities. While Denver does have public
transportation, it has its limitations - not every one of our destinations has a bus or light rail
stop close by; it often isn't safe when it's dark outside; and there are plenty of days when we
have to wait outside in inclement weather. The Access-On-Demand program addresses these
concerns and is a game-changer for so many disabled people who want to live a full life. It
really shouldn't be a "want." It should be a basic human right to be able to access our
community and be full participants. Please remember the Gang of 19 in 1978. We've already
fought for equal rights to access transportation in Denver. Please do the right thing - again and make sure that the disabled community can maintain equitable access to our city through
the Access-On-Demand program.
I strongly suggest that you contact our Community Center Boards (They have a different name
now), like Developmental Pathways, DDRC, Rocky Mountain Human Services, etc. They provide
the $5.00 passes to use on AAR - ask them to transfer those allocated funds to RTD to support
the AOD program - which is VITAL for my daughter! Additionally, my daughter doesn't use all of
her allocated funding for day programming - because she works and needs AOD. For instance,
she doesn't use any of the funding for "Spec Hab", which is the catch phrase for "Specialized
Habilitation" which is on-site programming. These is a LOT of funding left on the table every
year. THANK YOU for KEEPING AOD!!!!
I tried to work out the problem with the RTD map in our area (it takes 30 mins. to find my

average, up to 10 times a month once in awhile - I have my Dr. to help with any paperwork,
this a necessity for me - Thank you, Sincerely, Angela Good
The passage of Ballot Issue 7A could provide an opportunity to enhance, rather than diminish
services which, for many of us, is critical to living quality lives. However, this will only happen
with better management and more accountability on the part of RTD and its Board of Directors.

2020. When we purchased our home thirty-five years ago, we made sure that there was a bus
route for me to use. This route was discontinued four years ago. RTD acknowledges no
responsibility, when discontinuing routes, for the hardship they place on people who rely on
public transportation because they are unable to drive. RTD's on-demand service enables me to
continue to live an active life. On-demand is far superior to RTD's Paratransit service, which
works when you call days ahead and can get on their schedule, which is often unreliable. Many
of us with disabilities have busy lives, working, volunteering, and giving back to our community,
and we rely on the on-demand service, particularly where bus service is not available. It is
reprehensible for RTD to aggressively move to significantly reduce on- demand service, while
telling voters, in the ballot language of Measure 7A, that the funding is needed for
"MAINTAINING THE AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES." The
general public should be made aware of RTD's efforts to severely cut these services while
asking for more funds to maintain them. Citing transportation needs of people with disabilities is
clearly considered to be a useful strategy for getting this measure passed, but this
misinformation and these half-truths are simply dishonest. RTD is citing budget issues. What
about the exorbitant cost of several staff working to reduce this service. It Tax payers are also
funding enormous salaries for top management, the same management that has mismanaged
RTD for years. RTD has retained millions in TABOR rebates for over twenty-four years and
desires to continue to do so. RTD is the biggest tax collector in Colorado and this ballot issue
represents a blank check. Voters and users of RTD deserve better management, more reliable
service, and more accountability for how RTD spends its money.
I appreciated the time this morning, however, I really feel that the people who conduct the
meetings, are leaving out the people who cannot use a computer, RTD only had 2 programs
and keep emphasizing to go onto the computer many people on AAR who cannot go onto the
computer, I have trouble going on line. they are leaving out a huge number of people on AAR
that are going to be left out. they need to be included on the calls. I wish they would tell us
what the possible recommendations are that are in the loop. I use AAR almost exclusively, most
of my things are on AAR, they should open up more call in sessions. I hope they do more of
these before November. I appreciate everything they are trying to do. I know they are working
hard.
I was not able to join the virtual meetings because I could not connect to them. I humbly
request that RTD continue its Access-A-Ride program, allowing qualified participants to have the
option to use Uber or Lyft. This option has made a huge impact on my son's life. He has gained
a lot of freedom and sense of independence from being able to get to places without having to
wait for rides from family and without having to spend hours getting to and from places having
to use public transportation. The Access-A-Ride program also has provided much relief to us
because we know he is not at a station waiting for the train or bus. We often experienced
delays and had to go pick up our son when the train did not come on time. We had to limit the
places he could look at for jobs and outings because of the challenges of riding public
transportation. Our son ended up in places where he did not intend to go, putting his safety at
risk. So we ask, PLEASE, please find a way to continue this life-altering program. I'm sure there
are many folks in our community who benefit greatly from it. Thank you.
If you make the proposed changes to Access-on-demand, I will no longer be able to afford to
use it, effectively leaving me homebound. I know it will have the same effect for many other
disabled individuals.

Access on Demand has been a lifesaver. I had a stroke so now I'm cognativly impaired and low
vision. I get lost, confused and some times panicked. At night my vision gets even worse.
Access on demand gets me places I need to go without running into hostile strangers or
becoming disorientated. Access on Demand makes accessability possible what I could not afford
otherwise.
By requiring a payment at the beginning, it's not making it accessible to people without a credit
card, or people who are underbanked or unbanked. It is Creating additional barriers for those
who are not strong in tech skills or who are not as high functioning. With AAR, there's always
an option to pay in cash, so Access on demand should be the same way. As an idea, Perhaps
the first 10 AoD rides are paid for fully, up to $25? Then, the next 10, riders might cover a small
fee at the beginning? The lack of Reliability of AAR Makes it really hard for people who work
and who have appointments. Having a small/limited number of trips available for access on
demand helps supplement that a little bit. Access on demand also covers "priority pickup" with
Lyft, which is an extra cost and unnecessary. Metro Taxi and zTrip are almost entirely unusable
because of the limited number of vehicles they have on the road. Thank you for your time and
for listening!
I really appreciate the bus, it has given me a lot more freedom. I really rely on it and it gives
me peace knowing that I have the bus available to use.
Hi I just wanted to say thank you for your services. I hope access on demand continues. I
understand that persins with blindness have been in the media saying that they would pay for
services partially if services are asking for that in the future. That is amazing. People with
blindness get over $1,000 more income than people with other disabilities such as myself. I
would be unable to pay for any transportation because of my lack of income and disability.
Please consider people like me when you are considering charging for the service. This is the
only way I can get around the city independently. And I cannot afford to pay for any of these
services out of my own pocket. Thank you again.
Don't cut a vital service. I am having trouble finding housing within a bus line that meets my
disabled needs. People live 3 miles out of the bus lines (access -a-ride only goes to 0.75mi off a
bus line). How will the blind get to work? How will people whose legs are gone, get to work?
We can't walk to the stops. (Hell, several places in the system it's dirt and gravel to get to a
stop, our mobility devices cant even cross that) Will you house us, on the bus lines? (No, rtd
cannot) We need this Access on Demand, to get to our work, so that we can live. We can't
drive (the blind don't drive. People like me with inability to notice people in the dark can't drive,
seizure sufferers can't drive... It's illegal. But we need to work to live. This service gets us to
our work. There is no other way of getting there. Access-a-ride doesn't go as far and you don't
have enough drivers/equipment to cover the need.

I just heard there was a possibility of AoD Uber/Lyft rides going away. I want to say, my son,
who has Dup15Q syndrome has a whole new lease on life with his access to those rides. The
Access on demand BUS is a TOTALLY different experience as he is picked up HOURS before his
appointments, has to wait HOURS when he arrives at places. He also has to wait up to 40
minutes when they bring him home. He has no ability to get to the store, or to a friends house
without his Uber access. Unless he plans in advance and then to be on someone elses time
frame is very difficult. He has social group and work as well and depends on instant access,
when a shift ends early, or his event is over. He cannot arrive to work 1.5 hours before his shift
starts - just try to imagine what that would be like. It is difficult enough for him as a 21 year old
knowing he will never drive, PLEASE, PLEASE don't take this away from him! Thank you for
your time~
I am glad to see Fred saying he is motivated by the story. And that he is still struggling to
define a Vision. The best piece of legislation Congress passed was the ADA. It is up there with
the Emancipation Declaration. Fred is right however that ADA is showing its age and perhaps an
ADA 2.0 is needed. If Access a Demand comes up with a Vision and a sustainability plan, it
should, in my opinion, encompass the medical story and perhaps, working with our Colorado
Congressional Delegation and state lawmakers, to find ways for Health and Human Services to
chip in. For instance, there is lots of redundancy Medicaid and Medicare have regarding Medical
Transportation to doctors offices, pharmacies, social services. It seems to me that Congress
could possibly look into ways to allocate some funding to RTD for that express purpose or as a
support mechanism. Since I started using Access on Demand, I exclusively use it for doctors
and medical appointments. RTD thus has achieved economies and efficiencies at scale and has
a wonderful transportation system that I believe will benefit the medical transport part of
Medicaid, Medicare. It seems to me that working with Lawmakers for the program sustainability
will be worthwhile.
I have worked with people with disabiities for the past 6 years, both at a day program and as a
job coach/job coach manager. I have directly seen the positive impact that having Access-onDemand has made on the folks that I serve. It is incredibly important that this service remains
available and affordable for people with disabilities! Currently I work in the field of employment
services for people with disabilities. Colorado is an Employment First state and we believe that
all people with disabilities can work and be a part of their community by contributing as an
employee regardless of disability. Most of our participants are not able to drive themselves and
rely on public transportation or Access-on-Demand to get to their place of work. Please take
into account that this population can be more vulnerable and have greater safety concerns, be
it due to physical mobility issues, some impaired cognitive functioning, communication
differences, or decreased judgment skills in certain situations. They are vulnerable to be
exploited, bullied, or ignored - especially if they have communication limitations. It is unfair,
unjust, and unreasonable to expect their family members to take off work or spend their
weekends and evenings driving their loved ones to/from work. Most people with disabilities
want to be as independent as possible and to have purposeful and rewarding jobs and social
lives. As job coaches, we work hard with the people we serve to find good-fit jobs that are
purposeful and we collaborate with employers in the community. This can be challenging, but
the people we serve do not need the added challenge of having constraints due to limited
bus/van routes, having to pay expensive taxi services, or having to wait for excessive time for a
van to show up. Waiting in a public space, sometimes in excess of an hour, for a van to pick
them up, creates a huge safety and health risk! Please consider keeping the Access-on-Demand

consideration, Suzanne Ogborn
We couldn't listen to the whole conference call plus I didn't know it was MS Teams so I wasn't
set up for that app. Please in the future include which media/app you will be using so we can
be prepared. Are you going to continue the Uber option. Our I/DD daughter uses Uber to arrive
at her job site on time 4 days weekly; and then she uses it to return to her host residence after
her shift. She will never be able to drive or to use the bus system due to the degree of her
disability. Does the criteria for who "qualifies" for the mostly free Access A Ride and Access on
Demand need to be increased? Listening to one caller it was not apparent why she was even in
the program. She was very smart, well spoken and did not say she had any physical limitations.
I agree with the suggestion to charge $3 per trip to defray some cost; however you need to
have a smart automated system before implementing this. Also, reduce the number of monthly
rides from 60 to 45. No one has to go to their jobs, doctor appointments, etc. at 60 triips a
month. Do not allow for fun reasons - limit to working and to medical. Some of my thoughts on
behalf of my daughter's needs.
This is a great program. It's a lifesaver for me. It's saved me a whole lot and it's the most
wonderful program. It gets me to the doctor on time. It's a tremendous help in my life. Using
Uber/lyft is much easier and timelier than the other system. This is a lovely program and I
appreciate it so much because it is great for seniors and veterans. Whoever thought of access
on demand deserves a nobel peace prize.
Please continue the Access on Demand service with Uber and Lyft. It has been a blessing for
my medical appointments. Also the ability to be more independent.
First of all, I want to thank the people for making these meetings possible. Access on demand
has made a tremendous positive impact in my life. I am legally blind and live on my own, so I
depend on this service 100% for my daily living. Unfortunately, Access a Ride is not the
greatest option for me due to timing for my job and school. I was shocked knowing how much
is the cost per month for this vital service, so I am willing to cooperate as much as I can to be
able to keep this service available to us. One of the suggestions could be to be allowed to have
at least one stop on the way for short trips. For example: sometimes, I just need to go drop
mail at the post office and that could literally take me only less than 3 minutes. So instead of
ordering another Uber back home and pay a whole fare again, I could be able to do it under the
same fare. This could be saving the program funds and also the trips per month that we are
allowed to do. Instead of using two trips, these types of errands could be done in the same trip.
Sometimes, I've even had the Uber drivers offering so they can wait for me, but I have to
explain them that unfortunately the program I use doesn't allow this. Looking for grants,
sponsors could also be a good idea. Reducing the number of trips per month will impact my life
sadly since I barely can make it through the month for school and work. For all of us whom
depend on this service is a huge impact emotionally, mentally and independently as having this
service has definitely give us more freedom and become independent despite of our disabilities.
I really hope and pray for this service to stay in place and that we all can find the best solution
possible.

Thank you for the Access on Demand program. It has changed my son's life. As a young man
who experiences multiple disabilities and will never drive, he is now able to access
transportation to and from work, to social activities with friends, to and from church activities
safely, without relying on his mom or the bus (that may or may not be reliable and/or on time.)
For a long time, we have been working on independence skills, and managing life without
depending on his mom. The Access-on-Demand is truly a life changer for my son and many
others who simply want to access life fully like their neurotypical peers. Please don't take it
away! Please contact me if you would like to discuss further...
My 24 year old daughter is an adult at risk and cannot drive. She is going to school and will be
employed. However, she will be very limited to jobs based on lack of transportation. Buses
arent everywhere, and she needs transportation to the bus route now. Access or Ride would be
a huge benefit for both work and therapys. Her schedule is static, so she could get a driver that
is consistantly get work with her needs. We live 1 mile outside of the bus route extra driver

wish there was a person at RTD AoR that we could call and go over our needs with who would
help us get her set up. I. Not sure how much longer I will be able/willing to be her taxi.
Charge a small co pay! It's the safety & compatability of this service that our loved ones feel
"normal & independent" AaR stinks, never on time, booking 24 hours is stressful & schedules
for our loved ones change just like "normal" people. The neurodiverse deserve some normality
in their otherwise diverse lifestyles. Co-pay instead of elimination is a win win Please!
What do I need to get approved for the access-a-ride program?
The ability to use Lyft and Uber has changed my life. Prior to this, if I call the taxi through
Access-A-Ride, they often would not show up in Broomfield. Broomfield. The weight was often
hours long. Using the Access-A-Ride short bus requires pre-planning and is significant amount
of extra time. I was taking a lesson at 7:00 p.m. in Inglewood. The Access-A-Ride bus would
pick me up at 5:00 p.m. from my office and take me to the lesson that lasted approximately 45
minutes. I would then have to wait up to another hour for Access-A-Ride to pick me up and
take me home. On one occasion. I did not get home until 10:45. P.m.. Access-Aride also
requires tremendous pre-planning which isn't always possible.
Hello. My name is Mark Solomon, and my young adult daughter, Sadie, is a participant in the
Access on Demand service from RTD. this program has been life-changing for Sadie. Prior to
using AOD, Sadie relied on the Access a Ride service, which was painfully unreliable. When she
would schedule rides with AAR, her pick up was commonly late by well over an hour. Sadie
works and would routinely be late for work due to late AAR pickups and routinely had to stand
outside in the cold and dark for up to an hour or more past her AAR pickup window waiting on
her ride after work. The AOD program is by far the most effective and helpful resource for
Sadie to live independently and maintain employment. I understand that the utilization of the
program has exceeded expectations and budgets, and that is validation of the profound positive
impact that this service is having in the lives of individuals with disabilities. I ask that you
consider all the positive results of the AOD service and find a way to continue to make it
available to our friends and family members who rely on the service to get to and from work,
doctor appointments, and activities that sustain and fulfill their lives. Thank you. Mark Solomon

I'm very interested and would like to comment on the survey forms I did call and leave a
contract about how I love and appreciate the service as it is. Maybe RTD meets more money
with Georgie Moore. I use the Lyft very much and I really appreciate it. It's like company
Safety, and all of those wonderful things that I really do need to feel see you see if the rates go
up unfortunately being financially challenged maybe we'll get a few dollars more a month with
Social Security and disability pay, but it may not be enough to be able to use the service as
often as we would wish Thank you for doing what you do. It's a wonderful program and I
understand you have to meet your financial needs in order to help us, but I don't know you
know the kind of that financially challenged can help. I do tip the Lyft drivers a little bit and
maybe I should be giving that to you I really am sure ethically but I pray it doesn't get too
expensive to use and I'm certainly afraid of riding them a bus, especially on East Colfax, where
I go through the bus stops are not safe for me and I kind of dress up like a guy instead of a
woman to try to protect myself But I put my faith in my angel in God to protect me, but it can
be pretty interesting but awful so a little frightening at times thank you. I know you do the best
you can and maybe we'll get a different kind of transportation alternative on East Colfax bless
you. I appreciate you. Thank you for your time I'm voice texting on my phone because of the
font is so tiny I can't really see what I'm saying and I hope it's OK but I am very appreciative. I
hope we can keep things quite similar to what they are now. Thank you.
I would like to provide the followin coments: 1, I would not mind paying a fee for on demand,
such as $4.50 per ride. 2, having less rides per month for each of the on demand options would
be fine since I use less than half offered now. 3, restricting service area would depend on how
much was restricted, however I think monitoring this would cost more than the current
arrangement / system. 4, the on demand system works so much better than the regular
paratransit because appointments are often changed or rescheduled so advanced scheduling is
difficult.
i I use Access on Demand several times a week. I am not opposed to a fee for rides, however I
do not believe a reduction in reduction in service or service area is necessary. Please do not
reduce or end this service as this is necessary for my day to day needs as a disabled perwson.
Access-On-Demand is crucial for my participants to get to their appointments on time to receive
full services. RTD Access-A-Ride is consistently unreliable. I was so excited to learn about the
Access-On-Demand service that I tell everyone who qualifies for it to apply, it's a necessary
service to help individuals with disabilities keep their independence, it creates jobs and helps
keep the economy stable. Thank you for keeping this program going.
This program is very essential to many disabled people for everyday transport. It is imperative
that it stays in motion.
My good friend Maggie was affected by a stroke in her 30s. Without the ability to drive, she
relies on programs like this. She told me about the program some months ago and it has meant
so much to her, allowing her to be a part of daily life. Before this program she would have to
book so far in advance to travel anywhere locally and be available within a two hour time
window. This program allows her to travel around just as anyone else might and is so important
to make life more accessible for her.

many, many people.
Access-On-Denand is GREAT! Helping disabled people get around town, participate in our

Access on demand is not reliable and not friendly
I am hoping that our travel times will be shortened, to return to the way they were before the
new system was implemented months ago. I still find that I may be scheduled for 1 and 1/2
hours to go 1.5 or two miles here in Longmont where I live. This length of time is the same as
the time to go to Boulder from here by car, to destinations 14-17 miles away on access a ride. I
believe our ride times should be more comparable to those of fixed routes. Please return to the
methods that allowed me and others to go 50 miles,(to Aurora from Longmont), when our
scheduled time from the time of pickup to arrival (door to door) did not exceed 2 hrs. By
scheduling us over 2 hours ahead, we are left in potentially dangerous situations, waiting
outside for extensive amounts of time, even hours, in the the extreme weather conditions we
now experience routinely. It's difficult to shop for groceries when going to the store takes 1 and
1/2 hours on each leg of the trip, with 1 hour at the store. This places a burden on a vulnerable
population to spend 4 hours to complete this task. Nor is it possible for perishable foods to be
outside refrigeration for this long. Previously, I could request trips that were 1-3 miles away
with a requested pick up time, and a drop off time 1/2 hour later. While not fully guaranteed,
this generally resulted in shorter ride times. For example, if I got picked up at 3pm to go a
couple miles, I would regularly be dropped off at 3:30 pm. Then the entire trip (including the
required hour spent at the destination), would take 2 hours total. I appreciate that we have the
delivery option for groceries, but like many people, I prefer to go to the store and see what
produce looks good (or not), take advantage of sales, and simply enjoy going to the store. Also,
not all grocery stores have this service. I myself used to work at a grocery store where I
assisted a blind couple weekly. They used to ask whether the tomatoes or other produce or
bakery items looked fresh and unspoiled since they couldn't see for themselves. In Longmont I
have never once successfully hailed the WAV. I have made numerous attempts and never
succeeded in getting through the queue. Most recently, I contacted someone after I was given
a number to call by customer service. The person there said a bus was 20 minutes away. I
called and was on hold on the scheduling line for 1 and 1/2 hours before I had to hang up. I
then got an Uber which arrived within ten minutes, enabling me to reach my destination. When
a service always has excessively long times to schedule, even excluding the ability to schedule
at all, there is a serious problem that needs to be fixed. For many of us, the WAV would be a
great service, since it accommodates wheelchairs reliably and has drivers trained to support
people with disabilities, but as I say, I've never once been able to get a ride using it. We are
placed in situations where if we did manage to get a ride, our phones wouldn't even hold a
charge long enough to get through the phone queue to schedule a ride home. This is a very
real safety concern. Those of us with various conditions could be waiting out in the elements or
in a dangerous place and find ourselves with a phone that has lost its charge. I am given the
excuse that "it's a shared ride" a lot to attempt to excuse service which has in fact gotten
worse, having increased our already long travel times by a wide margin. The general public

generally avoids public transit when it takes more than 1/2 hour to get a bus/train to a local
destination. Nor would the general public accept trips in excess of 2 hours to go distances of
15-50 miles, or 1 and 1/2 hours to go 1-3 miles. This makes a workday extremely long and the
public will rightfully reject it because they have only so many hours in the day to accomplish
their tasks. The disabled population deserves efficiency as well. We used to be able to state
when we wanted to be picked up with access a ride. For trips that were a mile away, I could do
a requested drop-off and get there within a half hour. This made taking the trip a pleasure
rather than a burden. There is still a lot of confusion around scheduling; when I call in, we have
to tinker around to try to get a pickup time that isn't inordinately long. Errands such as going to
pick up a prescription a mile or two away can take as much as 4 hours. What if the medication
requires refrigeration? What if our conditions make this onerous, when the general population
wouldn't do it? (They might walk or drive). I read (in either the Colorado Sun or CPR I believe)
that there is discussion about cutting back the access-on-demand system using Uber/Lyft/cabs.
This system enabled me to attend church, for example. Using access a ride, I might arrive way
too early in order to be on time, and wait outside the building for over an hour. One never
knows how long a social engagement will last, and if we have to schedule days in advance, we
may end up having to leave before the event ends, or wait long after everyone else has left.
In Longmont, we have never had Access a cab. Never once was it possible to schedule a round
trip through access a cab, or even one way. There are no Ztrip or other cabs here; if there is
perhaps one cab on extremely rare occasions to theoretically serve a city of 100,000 people,
this is not workable. The reality is that we don't have cab service in this city. This supplemental
program never existed here, and despite numerous attempts to try to make RTD aware of this
problem, it was never addressed. Flex ride doesn't fill this gap. I stopped riding because it's
often overbooked. One's pickup could be so late that I would be advised by the drivers upon
arrival that I would arrive at my destination AFTER the pickup time I was supposed to go home.
Drivers would heroically try to make the schedules work, but sometimes I still had to decline the
ride because the scheduled trip times were running so late. Also, in Longmont FLEX Ride serves
as a school bus, so these blocks of time are unavailable, so that kids can get to and from
school.
The access on demand ride share program was the first supplemental program that had quite
wide availability here in Longmont. I have used it to go to medical appointments, for example. I
would like to make the point that we have a serious problem here in Longmont : there is no
RTD transportation to the UC Health Longs Peak Hospital here. Many doctors now have their
office visits at this location. There is no way to access this hospital using any public
transportation here except for Uber or Lyft. I have tried to make RTD aware of this issue, which
remains unaddressed. For many, including those without a disability, access to this center is
critically important. Via is not an option; they told me they are overbooked with regular
passengers and I should try calling access a ride. One begins to feel discouraged that the public
has such sparse transportation coverage in the city. The access a cab service allows me to go to
city meetings, accept an extemporaneous invitation to see someone, get to Longs Peak
Hospital, or address urgent matters in the moment. How many passengers use Accesser A Ride
in the Denver Metro area 2024?
I would really like to have my bus stop back. It is the Amhurst stop on southbound, route 121. I
don't know why the southbound route was eliminated, but it makes a difference for my walk to
the bus stop. Without this stop, my choices are walk to Amhurst, and then into my

neighborhood, walked through the uneven grass on Yale Avenue, or walk on the north side of
Yale Avenue where there is a sidewalk, but there is no crosswalk into my neighborhood. It was
much easier when I could just get off at Amhurst way.
While I have benefited from the use of AoD in the past, any changes increasing the taking of
monies from my limited budget would hinder my ability to use the program in the future.
I would received a warning about changing times within two hours of a visit one or two weeks
ago in my MRI schedule at Health) images changed three times in the same day within two
hours so I have cut back on my use of Access-a-Ride my use of Access-a-Ride this week will be
to go from Longmont to Westminster For a medical appointment and back no other service
including Flexride and Via Mobility Services provide a trip from Longmont to Westminster and
back so this is very important to me and others need to go between cities
It is for older customers to stressful to use the taxi service you offer, It should not be more
difficult than using regular paid taxi service. I used your service only one time , I usually pay a
neighbor to drive me . The only time I used your taxi service the driver hardly spoke English
and was the whole trip on the phone hollering about something in Spanish ti another guy. I was
so stressed by the time I got to Rose Hospital that I never again used the service. I use as
often as I am physically able the bus system. . The trouble with the bus system is that the
crosstown schedule is not correlated to the Avenues schedules in most cases, So one stands
often for almost a half hour and this is for people who have spinal problems too difficult .

Sarah! Thanks for the Uber survey. Did you ever get the Uber WAV here in Longmont? I've had
success getting standard Uber and Lyft. But I never even got through the queue to get WAV…
have waited over one and a half hours, then had to give up!! I was going to suggest that we
ask for "extended service" here in Longmont for access a ride. This would enable us as riders to
go anywhere in the city regardless of the fixed routes. This would really help us get around
since fixed routes are extremely limited here. And I would stress the point that it would not cost
any more to implement this. I read in the Colorado Sun that RTD is thinking of getting rid of our
Uber/Lyft option because it's very expensive. We wanna say no to that, especially since access
a cab doesn't exist here at all. Me: I can't get the wav vehicle because I have a vision
impairment and it's not an option for me from RTD but that's such a pain that you had to wait
so long! I don't think they'll get rid of it the Uber and Lyft option I think they'll probably just
make it cost more :( And fewer rides per month. Which is frustrating to me because I feel like it
takes away our freedom. :( lol clunky thing. I'll have to think on that! I doubt they'll do the
extended service thing because Accessaride is supposed to mirror the fixed route. I also doubt
they'll do the Fort Collins thing because RTD would have to run in fort Collins and that's nearly
impossible. :( Roseanne: Here's the article on access a ride and Uber/Lyft. It was CPR…not
Colorado Sun, sorry. There's an option to hear it if you're interested. I hope you have a
wonderful night!! I really hope they don't take away our Uber/Lyft or even limit it too much! It's
very hard to do social stuff without it! Sorry you can't use WAV, although it's like a phantom
ride—I've never seen it!! I'm glad our rides are free with access a ride here in Longmont; that
really helps. I'm not sure if we had extended service here before, but I think it's an important
concept. I believe it's inexcusable that RTD has such limited service for everybody in Longmont,
disabled or not. We're a population of 100,000 now! Therefore the whole service needs to be
expanded for everyone. Bill Thomas suggested we need a couple buses in town that run
regularly and cover the city (kind of like the hop and Skip in Boulder. Did you receive the article
called "RTD's para transit service is so popular it will likely have to be cut" from cpr? It said
regular access a ride trips (like we did tonight) cost the agency $60. per ride.. wonder why the
Uber is more costly, or whether it really is. We need the access to ride shares to stay as it is!!
So important. For example I used it to go to the ER both ways recently, in the middle of the
night. That's so important; there is no transportation available for that. Access a ride doesn't go
to Longs Peak Hospital at all, not at any time, because the fixed route doesn't … shouldn't
everyone have access to the local hospitals?? Many Dr offices are now located there too.
Regarding the article: I wonder how much more Uber costs per ride if regular access a ride
costs $60. per ride. Sure doesn't seem like a limo ride with access a ride! It's so exhilarating to
have access and actually be able to do stuff! Yeah you're right, even though the cpr quotes RTD
saying they want to get rid of that feature. But taking all the trips individually would seem to be
more expensive, not to mention inconvenient. Nobody running errands in their car goes home
after each and every errand before doing the next one! Good point. I agree with the person
who said the success of the Uber program is because the regular service is "broken." But for
the sake of those who can only use regular access a ride, I think it would be good to stress that
the WAV on demand service with the RTD bus for folks in wheelchairs needs to be a functional
program! I've never once gotten a ride from it. Also, if people wait hours for it outside, their
phones may lose their charge which could be dangerous for them, with no way to call dispatch
or the WAV number, or do anything online.
Not everyone has the capacity to speak up for themselves and many people who use
Accessaride get overwhelmed by the prospect of a survey. I know a lot of friends who struggle
with even checking their email. This is not a corporation, this is the public and the public should

Packet Pg. 365

be given more time, and more ways to voice what they need. There should be meetings where
RTD comes to them and tells them the options, even contacts different day programs and
things. There should be more gabbing with Gabe and Isa. Events about this before decisions
are made by people who can drive and largely don't understand the importance of access on
demand to people with disabilities who can't use other options of getting around. This is an
opportunity for RTD to gain trust and Appreciation with the public, especially those who are
vulnerable and have different disabilities. Uber cost a lot as well as other taxi and rideshare
programs. If partnering with Uber is becoming too expensive perhaps RTD could dispatch some
of their resources toward exclusively access on demand. Asking a public to share their views,
but then not posting anything about it in Access a ride vehicles only asks a sliver of the public.
It's stressful to fill out a survey because you don't know what to expect.
I work at 10055 Westmoor drive, Westminster, which is outside the ADA area but inside the
RTD boundary. Therefore, I can never take the Access a Ride there and rely on Access on
Demand. Access a Ride, when I use it, makes many stops that extends the trip for far longer
than anticipated, leading to back pain. It is also rarely timely and leads to excess wait times
even before I get on it. I am willing to pay a few bucks more for Access on Demand or have
fewer trips a month, but a $6.50 or more fare on Access on Demand is unreasonable. As a
further comment, remember that we tip the Uber drivers. We are expected to tip even when
there is a free fare from RTD. The voucher does not cover the tip. If we don't tip, drivers might
not want to drive. So the cost is always higher than it appears on your end.
Great service with the on demand because I am blind, and the service from Uber is very good
and enjoy the people who service the Uber company! Hope it continues for us all!
Hello - I am writing to beg you to not get ride/nor limit the access-on-demand service. I
recently had a massive stroke that left me disabled. I tried to book rides with access-a-ride to
get to work and they were not reliable, took much too long (impacting work
schedule/performance), and much more inconvenient. I totally stopped using AoR as the AoD
service was/is a total game changer and allows me to live a more "normal" life. I can get to and
from work (on-time), doctor appointments, rehab, etc. You could absolve every other
component of paratransit with RTD and just leave AoD and I would be happy - it is an
incredibly valuable, important, and a "real" program that actually works vs. a bureaucratic
idea/program. Apparently it works too well... But that just means other
ideas/programs/expenses can be absolved and that funding can be allocated to the thing (AoD)
that actually works and provides value to the paratransit community. I've even shared this
program with other leaders in the paratransit and independant living community who laude how
impressive the AoD program is... Please consider investing more into AoD and show you care
about your community by taking care of the whole community through various transportation
options. Then more people can be a part of the world and share their gifts and yes, go get their
groceries.
We recently learned about Lyft and Uber options for our disabled 21 year-old. We were
extremely excited to learn about this access on demand service and are in the process of
signing up. This program would be so helpful. It is often difficult to schedule a ride two days or
a week in advance, as required for other transportation options. The general public isn't
required to do this. If budget is an issue, please consider reducing the number of rides per
month or find other ways rather than eliminating the service.

As a Coloradoan and inclusive design specialist I hope that you work tirelessly to preserve the
access-on-demand program. While alternative routes may meet the required criteria for the
disabled community, Denver's sidewalks and bus stops are frequently not safe for disabled
travelers, and access-on-demand introduced equity by ensuring users can navigate the
community safely. This program must be protected, at the very least until sidewalks and bus
stops across the area RTD serves are safe and accessible.
I help to organize the Achilles international Boulder chapter which is an organization that
provides volunteer guides to help people with disabilities get out on the trails for running and
hiking. The RTD access on demand program using Uber and Lyft has been a game changer for
our disabled participants. It enables them to meet our Achilles group at local trailheads where
they receive exercise, community, and socialization. Many of our athletes are blind, physically
disabled, or have cognitive impairments which prevent them from driving. Our participants look
forward to our weekly meet ups: many of them lead Rather isolated lives in this is a wonderful
chance for them to build wellness through community in physical activity. I hope a financial
solution can be found, and I would be happy to be part of the Discussion.
My disabled daughter uses this program weekly and would not be able to get to her therapist
without it. It gives her independence to go where she wants to on her own without scheduling
Access A Ride days in advance and chancing whether AAR will even arrive at all. AAR is very
unreliable and the Uber program is reliable. Don't change it! It works.

Hi my name is Isaac. I use Uber access on demand to get to my job every day. I cannot drive
because I have an intellectual and physical disability. Without Uber I could not get to work. I

I am the Director of Resident Services at Eaton Senior Communities and have seen the
incredible impact Access on Demand has had on our residents. The program is affordable for
our low-income seniors and allows them to access rides on demand, as opposed to have
schedule rides in advance and hope that there is availability. This makes going to doctor's
appointments, the grocery stores, and other important appointments much easier. It allows our
residents to be active and engaged in their community. Program changes sound inevitable, but
I hope that the program remains affordable and continues to support on-demand services. The
need for affordable and accessible transportation is high and I can't stress enough how
important this program has been to the quality of life of many of our residents.
I feel the service I receive is great. I'm able to make all my appointments on time and I'm
happy with the service. Thank you.

I hope there is a way to keep this very successful program alive. Grants? Federal support?
Smaller bonus for the CEO? You are really creating change for the better in the people of our
community with disabilities, a community that is often underserved. This is a win for them and

Hi, I am a disabled access-a-ride user. It has been truly life-changing to be able to call an Uber
or Lyft on demand instead of having to set everything up 24 hours at least before hand
especially with delays. I have missed appointments and been sent home because I was too late,
taking other rides. This allows me freedom to leave my house and get around whenever needed
because I cannot drive myself due to pain. Please reconsider changing this program in any way
other than improving. Making sure multiple stops are not possible totally makes sense— but
cutting the $25 stipend per ride or limiting the reach/availability would hurt the program's
success. As a disabled person hearing "this isn't what's available to the general public" feels like
an unfair comparison. The "general public" doesn't NEED these services. After talking with
disabled people in other cities who do NOT have a program like this they are much more
isolated and stuck at home or end up paying for on demand services out of pocket when truly
needed because of the poor quality of the other option never being on time. This on demand
service is one of the best experiences I've had being disabled here in Denver. Please do not
limit or take it away.
It is not inequitable to provide Access on Demand to people with disabilities. It IS inequitable to
paint those individuals as getting a benefit no one else is allowed. These individuals qualified
because they do not have other means of independent travel as a result of their respective
abilities. While I can respect the need to keep to a budget, it seems you were wholly
unprepared for the fact that people would utilize a service that offered them greater
independence and was more reliable. I encourage you to continue AoD, adding consideration of
both wheelchair users and service animal handlers who may otherwise be denied rides. I
emplore you to avoid removing or greatly diminishing the AoD service, as it is a game changer
for individuals with disabilities who rely on RTD services to survive.
Without the lyft and uber access-a-ride option I would not be able to participate in life like I do.
It helps me in planning and getting ready. Takes away anxiety of getting somewhere. It allows
me to go do thi gs that I cannot normally do due to time constraints, problems with my pain,

PLEASE don't get rid of access on demand I rely on this part of the programs to get places all
the time, including the urgent care and ER when I need medical help but not an ambulance, I
can't plan my medical emergencies in advance. This program allows my to take a regular Uber
when with my caretaker so that they can load my smaller foldable powerchair into a car and
allows me to take a WAV on short notice when I need to get somewhere as planning my trips
days in advance is very inaccessible to me. Access on demand is the most accessible part of the

Please don't get rid of the Access-On-Demand!! People would be severely and negatively
impacted. Pull the funds from somewhere else maybe? But everyone deserves a ride to work
and doctor appointments.
I think it's great that an underserved group such as those that rely on the use of the access on
demand program. It's great that it is hugely successful. But the demand is greater than the
current budgeted amount at this time. Do you cut services or find more money - a grant, a
donor/benefactor. I'm so glad those with disabilities feel this program is really helping them
improve their mobility. Maybe a reduction in services is implemented until more funding can be
programmed. Perhaps raising fees to those in the district can help to fund access a ride in the
future. My suggestion is for RTD to come up with options for reducing access a ride services
and then ask for feedback from the public.
The old access-a-ride system is archaic and inequitable. If you remove or cut back AoD you will
be stripping countless disabled citizens of their access to equitable transportation and therefore
equal engagement in the community. Many could even lose their livelihoods. Imagine if you
could not get to work in under 2 hours. Or go out after 10pm. Or go to the pharmacy safely for
a sick loved ones. Please consider what life would be like if you were blind or disabled, and how
difficult your life would be without this program. I have many good, blind friends who are
valued members of our community who I would not have gotten to meet if the AoD program
didn't exist. I know people who started engaging in the community again once AoD was
launched because AAR was so unreliable, so constantly made them late or didn't show up, it
wasn't worth even trying. Please don't take away my friends' access to the world.
It is unfortunate that both Uber and Lyft services have denied me rides because I've let them
know and comments that I am blind. I did not get a response regarding a lift no show charge. I
realize there are many people that use this program yet, I expect better service from RTD and
your third party service providers.
Please do not eliminate the Uber/Lyft service. Access a Ride is never on time and significant
waits cause me back pain and other issues. The Uber/Lyft availability has made a world of
difference for my mobility.
Hello- I recently suffered a massive stroke after skiing at winter park. Almost died but came out
ok aside from some pretty serious disabilities. I lived a very active "Colorado life" prior to my
injury. I'm writing to ask that you invest in access-on-demand. This service is huge- I use it
pretty often to get to work (can't rely on access on demand, unfortunately) and if it went away
and/or was reduced, that would be a huge negative impact to my life. Please please don't
absolve this service.
Please put me on your email list for all email communications. Thank you.
Thank you for your work. Please include me in all email communications which are semt out.

The access on demand service has been a huge increase to my quality of life for several
reasons. The first being that I don't feel the access a ride busses are maintained well. I have
witnessed parts falling off the vehicle mid ride on more than one occasion. I have also several

times experienced a bus driver not driving carefully (even on side roads) and my entire body
caught air while going over a bump and completely threw myself into a flare up. As someone
who has instability throughout my entire spine, this caused me immense pain for weeks on
multiple occasions. Additionally, on average my rides with access a ride would last about 4
hours round trip for a single 40 minute appointment. On one occasion, my round trip time was
5.5 hours for a 40 minute appointment. As someone who typically has 5-7 appointments per
week for the last 7 years, it felt like the majority of my time was being lived on the bus or
waiting for it just to take care of my health. (Having chronic fatigue also means that my limited
energy capacity is being used just for the bus and Dr appointments when having only the AAR
bus as an option) Since AAR partnered with Lyft, my quality of life has greatly improved by
being able to accomplish more than one thing in a day. I've been able to pursue other
treatments that my time would not have been able to allow with only the AAR option. Having
hours back to my day when I'm not waiting for or on the bus has allowed for so many
possibilities in my life. I appreciate AAR exploring new options outside of just the disability bus,
and sincerely hope you continue the access on demand partnership with Lyft as it is, or with
very minimal adjustments. I cannot emphasize how having this option has made such a huge
and positive impact on my life, and I genuinely hope you keep the program.
I am not understanding this. I sent you a new application, someone returned my call and
answering my question saying, "Yes they received it."
It has recently come to my attention that the RTD board of directors is considering changes to
the Access-A-Ride and Access on Demand programs. These programs are vital to the ability of
blind Coloradoans in the RTD to conduct activities of daily life such as work, shopping, banking,
going to the pharmacy, and enjoying equitable access to our beautiful region. As the largest
organization of blind people in the state of Colorado, I ask that the National Federation of the
Blind of Colorado have a key seat at the table when any changes to these services are being
discussed. I, and the NFB want to make sure that these programs remain viable tools for blind
people who are not able to use fixed route transit and that any changes made maintain or
enhance the ability of blind people to use these services to live the lives I and others want. I
appreciate and use Access on Demand several times a week. As a blind woman, senior, and
uses a guide dog, this service provides me with independence, dignity, and a sense of
normalcy. Before, when using Access-a-ride, I had to schedule an hour before my appointment,
had to wait an hour at my appointment, and allow for another hour to return. This left a
minimum of a three-hour journey no matter the duration of the errand and/or appointment. I
felt my time was not valued, and certainly felt like I was a sack of disabled potatoes being
schlep from one place to another. And, this was on a good day. I can't tell you how often the
dispatch operators got the pick up or drop-off address incorrect … or I was unknowingly put on
a will-call list, never to be notified and/or picked up altogether. Many times, I was extremely
late for important personal or professional appointments or literally left out in the cold having to
wait hours for a ride. All this was and is unacceptable! With Lyft, I can call when I want (No
windows), leave when I want, and ride like anyone else in the public. I can go to doctor's
appointments, church, concerts, bank, grocery store, or other personal or professional
appointments. I don't have to depend on my friends, worry about being late, and I mostly ride
with little difficulties. (excluding those rides that discriminate due to guide dogs). Without this
$25 off Lyft (or Uber) Access on Demand service, I'd have to be dependent on friends, family,
stay at home, or be forced to live a life of discrimination, isolation, dependence, and negativity.
In a time of equality, diversity, and inclusion, I'd think that RTD would want to continue and

even applaud the continuance of this service. As a side note, I'd think it'd be more affordable to
you in the long run to continue the program with the $25 discount than to have all these riders
who now use Access on Demand go back onto the broken-down system of Access-a-Ride. You
probably don't have the customer service operators, dispatch operators, not to mention the
drivers, or additional busses to allow such an increase. I sincerely implore you to seriously think
about any changes you might be considering. And certainly, don't make changes without
representation from members of the National Federation of the Blind. Thank you for your
consideration and we, the NFB of Colorado look forward to working with you as any proposed

Hi, please contact me. Thank you.
I am a Colorado mother, author, and tax-paying citizen who happens to be blind. I am also a
user of the Access-a-Ride and Access on Demand services provided by RTD-Denver. It has
recently come to my attention as a member of the National Federation of the Blind that the RTD
board of directors is considering changes to the Access-A-Ride and Access on Demand
programs. These programs are vital to my ability as a blind Coloradoan who uses RTD, and the
ability of many other blind and visually impaired RTD users, especially those like me who have
multiple disabilities, to conduct activities of daily life such as work, meeting friends, parenting,
and enjoying equitable access to our beautiful region. As the largest organization of blind
people in the state of Colorado, we ask that the National Federation of the Blind of Colorado
have a key seat at the table when any changes to these services are being discussed. We want
to make sure that these programs remain viable tools for blind people who are not able to use
fixed route transit and that any changes made maintain or enhance the ability of blind people to
use these services to live the lives we want. Access on Demand services have allowed me to
help my teenage daughter participate in scouting activities all across the Metro Denver area.
Without Lyft and Uber services I can access on a flexible schedule as Scout activities are
planned by teens who act on the spur of the moment, since the troop is run by and for its
members with as little adult intervention as possible, I might not be able to keep up with the
changing whims of the Scouts. I have also taken in concerts, hockey games, and other activities
in the evenings by myself now that my daughter is of an age where she doesn't always need
me home at bedtime, thanks to the flexibility of Access on Demand services that don't
necessarily require me to have a specific end time in mind for my return trip. It's nice to have a
bit of freedom as a mom now that my child is older. Access-a-Ride services didn't allow for that,
with their requirements to schedule trips days in advance and their beginning and end times
specifications. Thank you for your consideration. The National Federation of the Blind is glad to
work with you as any proposed changes are thoughtfully and thoroughly considered. Sincerely,

access on demand needs to be able to stop for milk, pick-up prescriptions and service should
allow 10 minutes window or the consumer will have to re-order a trip. Access-a-ride bus beats
consumers to death if they sit in the middle or back and can be painful. If it is full of
wheelchairs, it isn't so bad. Those lifts are RADDLE TRAPS and make a lot of noise when the
bus hits bumps. metro cabs need to come get our orders, or find a different job and quit sitting
in downtown or the airport, and, stop making excuses. stereos or radio should be off while the
consumer is in the cab/uber/lift unless requested.

Hi Staff! One thing stands out immediately: November 2024 • Share all customer feedback
received with the Board • Take policy-related recommendations to the Board for consideration

December 2024 – May 2025 • Staff work to adopt recommendations and effectuate all Boardadopted modifications • Implement major operational adjustments as part of the May 2025
Service Changes This timeline is far too compressed. I'm not sure how you plan to review the
feedback you receive through the various outreach mechanisms you plan to employ. However,
this tells me that you do not plan to change your recommendations based on any input you
receive from the Board following their dissemination of the feedback report, which you are
scheduled to present to them at their November meeting alongside your recommendations. It's
clear from this timeline that you expect them to adopt those recommendations at this same
meeting. This is unacceptable. I would suggest either bringing feedback to the Board in smaller
chunks in their October and November meetings, or, probably most sensibly, moving back the
timeline such that the Board has from their November meeting until their December meeting to
process the customer and stakeholder feedback contained in your staff report and suggest any
alterations to your recommendations. You should not expect them to adopt these
recommendations until their December meeting at the soonest. You should also plan for the
significant possibility that the Board will want to make changes based on customer/stakeholder
feedback such that they will not be ready to adopt these modified recommendations until
January 2025. I realize that this will mean that new board members will need to evaluate these
recommendations, which could push adoption back still further. However, I see this as a logical
progression of this very compressed timeline that staff has put forward. Thanks for all you do,
and stay tuned for more feedback!

IHi everyone, I have a few thoughts! One question: how does the cost of an AAR trip on
average compare to an AOD trip cost of the same length/distance? Another Thought: At
Mobility for All, we had a hard time offering "split payment" ride options because people had to
have $50 in their checking account and if they didn't (usually at the end of the month) they
couldn't use the ride service. The split payment meaning $3 first, then RTD pays the next $25,
then the customer pays the rest. That was confusing for folks at BCHAs. Last thought for now Surveying AAR Folks would be good - "Would you rather have 50 trips/month with the first $25
paid OR 25 trips with the first $35 paid?" or something similar. Thanks!
Will the lyft and Uber rides will renew back to 60 rides if it was lowered to 45?
I am very grateful for the services I receive.
Please fix light rail inefficiencies from Broadway to Littleton Downtown. It is currently ineffective
and dangerous to right the D Line. We ride this line to get to Craig Hospital and Swedish

there is something wrong with I do not ride Access a Ride due to the inept scheduling and

I am very confused because if my county that I pay taxes to and I pay the RTD taxes to opt in
to RTD whether or not there is a stop within 3/4 of a mile or not I should be able to use the
access a ride or access on demand. Often times, RTD has taken away the one route that I had
or someone had, and that makes them no longer eligible. And yet they still pay the taxes for
RTD. As a disabled person, I still shop, I still work, I still am in the community, and you are
taking away my transportation. And I paid the taxes for it. So even though there's no stop but
my county pays the taxes I should be able to use AAR or AoD
Wondering if this will/has been covered.....The people using it to and from work each morning
and afternoon clog it up for the rest of us, during those peak hours.
Yes I would like to know if I can get my rides back foe Uber and left please
I do hope that the AoD program will continue to operate with a few more drivers/vehicles
added. As for the AaR, it seems that recent changes are helping to improve scheduled pick up
and drop off times.
I am. Very disappointed to be reading these changes to AoD and AaR services. These
suggestions are going to make it so many people who need these services are unable to access
rides. It is going to leave out many who need these services. As a mom of 4 disabled kids is
unfortunate that you are considering changes that would make these services less accessible.
And make it so some cannot access it at all. There is already an issue with accessibility, I do
volunteer caretaker work and I am often being asked by people to come and give them rides
when they should be able to easily access public transport but due to it being difficult for those
who are disabled they cannot. I can't always help take them to appointments and it would be
nice if they were able to us public transportation but it is at accessible or safe. (Many that I give
rides to have health issues and cannot risk getting COVID or other viruses and there is no
mitigation practices still in place).

The last thing in your minds should be cutting access for disabled people. The whole point of

access to public spaces. And at a federal level, we decided this was unjust because they have a

Several suggestions contained within this review would be deeply harmful to disabled
individuals using this service, if implemented. I strongly discourage RTD from implementing any
changes to this service which reduce access for their disabled riders, as AoD is currently filling
in massive service gaps within both the AAR service and the overall transit system. Eroding the
coverage of AoD would eliminate much of the benefits it offers for disabled riders over AAR,
many of whom would lose the independence and freedom of movement necessary to continue
living within & contributing to their communities. I have some specific concerns to detail. The
assertion that 60 trips per month is a "high trip limit" is very wrong. This is a service which
disabled individuals are using to be able to attend medical appointments, school, work, & other
essential tasks. In a month, 60 rides just covers commutes to/from work or school for 5 days a
week, with two additional rides per week that can be used for additional needs like doctors
visits or grocery trips (since we cannot add stops to trips, even if it's picking up a prescription
from walmart on the way home). If we have more than 2 additional transit needs a week, we're
on our own (sorry to any full-time workers or students who have to go to physical therapy 3x a
week). 60 rides a month is, frankly, the bare minimum already. AAR is currently a flawed
service, with service disruptions and gaps, and those gaps affect - and harm - disabled people's
health and wellbeing. Late or missing AAR pickups can result in missing doctors appointments,
school, work, pharmacy pickups, etc., all of which can have disastrous effects on our quality of
life. 22.5% of people with disabilities were employed in the US as of 2023. 20% of
undergraduates reported having a disability in 2020. But because many bus routes are
inaccessible on top of being unreliable, and AAR is both unreliable & *not* a same-day service,
we simply don't have the same access to transit systems as able-bodied individuals. AAR could
decide that they will pick a rider up 60 minutes after their requested time, and there is nothing
they could do about it, because it is a "complementary service" despite still costing money. AoD
is currently filling in a large amount of those service gaps, making it possible for many disabled
people to have the independence & consistency required to participate in these essential
aspects of daily life. From a fiscal standpoint, this program has also prevented many of us from
needing to be on welfare benefits. If my eligibility for this service were to be revoked, I would
need to apply for food stamps and Medicaid, because I would no longer be able to get to work
5 days a week, and I would lose my health insurance. The suggestion that fares should be
implemented similarly to AAR is not totally unreasonable, however, I would like to add that AoD
is not an equivalent service to AAR, nor is it a "premium service". Wheelchair and other mobility
aid access is not guaranteed in an AoD vehicle — neither is service animal access, or assistance
with entering/exiting the vehicle. Discrimination is also more common with services like Lyft and
Uber, as they are contract workers and can refuse service at any time. I've had drivers
immediately cancel my ride upon seeing that I wasn't standing outside waiting for them, even
though my disability makes me heat-intolerant to the point of fainting. If this were to be
considered a premium service, contract workers *will not* fulfill that promise; AoD would need
to employ its own drivers to guarantee service & accountability, and that would essentially just
turn into expanding & improving AAR service. I'm not against that in theory, but in practice, if
that was on the table then RTD would have just done that rather than creating AoD. In regards
to the suggestion to "enhance" the AAR and AoD suspension policy by allowing yearly rollovers
of rider infractions like late cancellations (instead of allowing them to continue clearing at the
start of the year): this is blatantly discriminatory. Fully and completely. You know who has to
cancel rides the most? People who have disabilities or chronic illnesses which can suddenly

very poor. Please look for other places to save money, and don't cut vital services for disabled
people!

Packet Pg. 375

worsen. Disabled and chronically ill people should still have access to these services, even if
they have had difficulties making it to their pickups in the past. Suspending them and forcing
them to appeal just causes stress and isolation — feelings which do not encourage compliance.
Finally, on the suggestions of reducing service areas and hours of operation: RTD has already
eliminated bus routes and reduced the hours of operation for others in recent years. This has
decreased access for many communities, but especially for low-income neighborhoods and
historically black neighborhoods. If your goal is to reduce access for your most marginalized
riders, that's what such a change would accomplish. If this entire review was just to make AoD
cost less to provide, and if profit is required for the program to continue, it kind of seems like
the rest of these suggestions are just there to make the addition of a fee look less harmful than
the alternatives. If adding a fee was the plan all along, then frankly this inquiry wasted quite a
bit of time and money, and it's going to enhance public scrutiny on RTD's decisions moving
forward. I do hope this is just a case of "look how much worse it could have been", because
really. Some of these are *out there*. Ultimately, Access-on-Demand is not a "premium
service". This service offers more flexibility than AAR, and offers low-to-no-cost rides to a
disabled population that has often been abandoned by public transit systems; it's a wonderful
thing to finally have created that access. But to make this a legacy of genuine equity, you have
to protect that access. I hope you do.
The Access-on-Demand service is a great asset to me for my doctor, therapy, medical tests,
getting groceries, picking up my medications and etc. I feel it is truly a blessing to not have to
worry about these things. Thank you for all your help.
hi, this doesn't actually say anything of used to us. Are you guys going to shut down access on
demand? Or are you gonna limit it? Because basically all I'm seeing is fancy words that don't
amount too much. Can you please just be direct and actually just tell people if you're going to
shut it down or cut it off? A lot of people actually rely on this service for work me and my
husband being one of them. we work out in Aurora at Amazon, and those rides are incredibly
expensive. Without access on demand, we wouldn't have been able to have this job. not trying
to be rude, but disabled and/or blind people already don't have a lot going for them. Or else I
should say. People are already trying to take braille away from us because it's also too costeffective for them. So can you please just tell us if you're gonna cut it off? And stop beating
around the bush about it thank you.
Access on demand has been fine though surge pricing does get a bit scarey. I believe that the
driver for Access a ride should be able to make certain decisions when the manifest may be a
bit off. For example, This past June I had a bowling tournament that started at 1pm. I was
suppose to be there by noon to pay my fees for the tournament. I was picked up at 10am
which is near Sable and 22nd. . My destination was South Federal Blvd. and Iliff. At one point
during the trip I was in three miles of my destination and because of the manifest the driver
took another passenger home who lived within a mile of my home. I didn't get to my
destination until 12:52pm.
The work you are doing is extremely important. On behalf of the Disabled, Thank You! My
question is this: could synergy be achieved between Lyft and Uber, so as to accurately reflect
the actual balance, or numbers of rides taken, or left? Incidentally, speaking of Data and
empowering the Review noted, could there be an app from Access a Ride, which riders could

The Access-A-Ride system needs to be retained and can/should be improved. Since the majority
of the ridership is simply poor and not handicapped, this is not a possibility. Continue to work
on this project and the more kindness directed, the more riders will benefit. It has been an
excellent experience to be part of the Access-A-Ride group and has offered many unique
insights. I hope this project will be the first to allow membership for all the people that are
necessary.
Thank u so much for the Access a Ride Rides and Uber Rides.. They have helped so much with

year. Please keep me updated.

How to sign up for Metro taxi service under access on demand account
Since connecting with Denver's RTD, Access-A-Ride has been most convenient for my disabled
daughter. It has also helped as she is on a limited budget. However, the last few months
continue to have higher rates varying from zero charge to full rates. She most often takes a 16mile ride and is often charged a miscalculated rate...her trips never go over 25 miles. Is it
because of the time pf day or weekend rates? It is frustrating for her to figure out why
ride/price choices are different. #108987. Please explain why her rides are so inconsistent and
what we should do on our end. Thank you. Mrs. Nivens
Hi, this is Marilyn Kenney: I'm a handicapped person & I called to book a reservation for Metro
taxi pickup at my address: the taxi driver went to the wrong address & after waiting for an hour

was a ( no show) on my reservation. So, I had to book a 2nd reservation: another wait. Just
letting you know. Thank You.

I was so excited to finally get access to transportation without my family having to drive me
and then I had my first access a ride experience. I had to leave for my job almost 2 hours
before my shift, so my mom drove me there. Then, I came out of work 4 minutes after my shift
ended for my first ride. The driver explained that I needed passes or cash and I had neither,
but he gave me a ride anyway. After 10 minutes of trying to explain this to me, he was talking
to angry I was confused. Then, he would not let me pay him when I got back to my house. He
was rude, stating " I already got you here, didn't I?" But then reported me for coming out of
work late. It was a very frustrating experience and I have not tried to ride again. I just use
Uber and Lyft.
I would like to address the limitations and restrictions in the services provided by Access-A-Ride
in my area. As a person with a disability, I find that the available routes are becoming
increasingly limited, and there is a lack of dependable service throughout the week. The current
restrictions have led to a situation where permanent service users may not be able to utilize
Access-A-Ride. The on-demand service also presents challenges, particularly in terms of
reliability and availability of drivers. This hinders my ability to book rides, thus affecting my
independence and participation in the community. I kindly urge you to consider the
implementation of alternative or extended services for areas facing constraints and limitations,
ensuring that individuals with disabilities have consistent and reliable transportation options,
regardless of their geographical location. Your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Myself and my wife use access on demand almost every day. We are both visually impared and
find the system very usefull for shopping, airport trips and general work day activities. The
$25.00 toward rides allows us to keep the costs reasonable. I strongly recoment keeping the
current system.
The new scheduling system is very difficult to work with and makes scheduling my rides to work
frustrating and inconvenient. I am confused as to why this change was made and if possible
would like an explanation so I can better understand. Thanks
This service has been extremely beneficial. I use it for professional as well as personal use. I do
agree that there should be a one stop for max of five minutes to pick up or drop off items.

My daughter, Meridith has used access a ride for years. The best thing that has ever happened
is when she started using the up to $25 Uber rides program. She is more confident, assured
and self-directed than ever. Uber takes her from her house door to the door at each of her
places of work when access a ride did not. Uber shows up all the time or you can order
another. This is not the case for access a ride. She can order and get a ride in 10 minutes with
Uber. Never the case for access a ride. She works weekends and Uber is a great option but
access a ride was terrible. For physically challenged customers you need an assess a ride bus
with lifts. for my daughter and others like her the Uber option just works better, quicker and
faster.

I have been using the Uber WAV service exclusively for almost a year. I have found this service
far superior for my needs specifically in respect to scheduling. It was always difficult to know a
day ahead of time what time I would be returning home. Additionally, the drivers are always in
a good mood as opposed to being stressed and late for pickups as the accessoride drivers
usually are. If you have any other questions please feel free to contact me.
I think it would benefit riders if the drivers of Uber, Lyft and other ride share services RTD
contracts with for paratransit service to receive training on how to assist passengers in vehicles
and with communication because there is often a language barrier which makes it difficult to
inform drivers of specific needs.
to whom this may concern: hello, i'am a blind user who uses rtd services especially access a
cab and access a ride. but, in 2017 i had to move from the denver area to castle rock where rtd
services aren't in the castle rock area for me to use. i like that that rtd access a ride service had
a access on demand service for making duplicate trips to multiple places in the denver area
and, i would love for rtd to have castle rock included in the denver area for access a ride and,
also for access on demand service too. castle rock is a part of douglass county and, is 30
minutes from littleton and, we should as people who live in this area be able to use rtd's
services in castle rock and, also in the denver area too. thanks for listening to me and, i hope
this is solved asap.
Thank you for the update. However, as a blind frequent user that adheres to all the rules of the
program related to ACCESS a right I have some serious questions to ask you. Firstly are any of
the members of the review committee people that are disabled that rely on using this service?
Secondly, it is so easy to understand that people who sit in their ivory towers can make false
and incorrect decisions as related to those that need and use the service. Therefore, I suggest
that everybody who is on the committee be blindfolded and subject to using the RTD service in
any of its Offerings, especially the Access on demand. Thirdly, those that violate the rules of
this program should be subject to removal from the program and not allowed to disadvantage
all those that get such a benefit out of using the access on demand such as myself as well as
many others. If it is an issue related to Financial due to the state of Colorado or the Denver city
mayor who has taken 48.2 million dollars out of our budget to pay for illegals living in hotels
then we need to take that into account as well. Finally, I would be happy to talk at any meeting
you have related to this issue as I will bring up some very valid points and not those points as
seen by Ivory Tower people who don't ever partake in using the system. Thank you Regards,

I use a fold up walker for most places I need to go. There are zero options for me. There are

Hi, I just wanted to comment RTD ON DEMAND Is great, but I have learned it is best to take
Uber Green as Uber X vehicles are often large trucks which are difficult to access. I have not yet
figured out Lyft. I have read you can cancel a truck immediately and not be charged. It might
be good to let people who have trouble getting into large vehicles about Uber green. I stressed
about this for some time. Thank you.
Honestly the existing paratransit services like access-a-ride buses are very unreliable, and
totally unusable when it comes to variable schedules for work/school/medical appointments.
The access-on-demand system with Lyft and Uber is quite literally the only reason I can keep
my job at all. Buses and trains require me to walk and stand for indeterminate amounts of time
(with all the delays and cancellations lately) outside in inclement weather, which my illness
prevents me from doing without risking passing out. There are fewer and fewer covered bus
stops too, and routes keep getting discontinued. I genuinely - truly and honestly - love taking
the bus and train and wish I still could for my daily commutes. But the bus stops are so far
from the places I actually need to go, that I can't physically make the walks anymore. Accesson-demand is the only thing that keeps me independent, able to work, and able to get to my
doctors appointments. Please don't make any cuts to this service in any way that would
jeopardize disabled and chronically ill people's access to it. It's lifesaving.
Please continue the Access on Demand Program. It means the world to me. Access on Demand,
the Denver E-Bike voucher program and the Access A Ride pass have enabled me to travel
easily within the city without relying on a personal vehicle. The Lyft app that I use to hail rides
is so simple to understand. It is with great pride that I show my Access A Ride pass, my e-bike
and Lyft app to my friends and family. These City of Denver programs have greatly enhanced
my self esteem and dignity. Thank you, Larry Wheeler

Demand, rely heavily on this service as parents of a beautiful baby boy. We have been
impacted by suspensions resulting from using multi-stop trips. I recently received an email
about a pending suspension in August for this use of multi-stop functions. This is
counterproductive and undermines family support, which I cannot conjure out of thin air. I have
no relatives or friends who can provide the errand stops that a multi-stop trip service like Uber
can offer. I ask RTD to consider allowing multi-stop transport. The current prohibition appears
designed to punish users and generate financial gain for those who fail to ensure safe, gun-free
transportation. I will be emailing about my suspension soon, but I want to share a serious
story. Clayton, who has also dealt with suspensions and punitive measures reducing his
voucher, could have died on a city bus in Phoenix, Arizona. In March 2021, Clayton texted me in
a panic about a potentially deadly encounter with Steven Marcelino, a veteran who carried a
gun on board. Maricopa County courts eventually tried Marcelino, but why allow him on a bus
to begin with? I also heard of a thirteen-year-old shot to death on an RTD bus simply because
he wouldn't move his leg. These unsafe encounters have dire consequences for families. That
young boy will never graduate, start a family, or hold a job. His body is now in a grave, and his
family may never get justice. That boy could have been blind like Clayton and me. As blind
adults, we have faced untold abuse by family and others charged with our safety. Suspending
service for using multiple stops is unfair and could put Clayton and me at great risk, potentially
leaving our son without parents. If we were all shot to death, there would surely be mourning
among those who care, which may not include RTD representatives. We prefer not to make
RTD answer why a child and his blind parents died. Please consider allowing multi-stop trips for
all users and reversing or providing a stopgap measure for those affected by suspensions. Our
right to travel and our lives depend on this. In 2014, my dear friends Arthur and Diana Yochim,
both blind, were on their way to midnight mass. Their Access-a-Ride van was hit by a habitual
traffic offender, causing a windowpane to shatter. Diana required surgery to remove glass from
her finger. If Malcolm had been in the van, he could have been severely injured due to his small
size. At last check, Malcolm weighs under thirty pounds, and he is only 32 inches high. Allowing
multiple stops would let us run errands as normal adults. We ask RTD to implement such
services fully so all disabled individuals have access to the real world. We also request that no
suspension policy includes multi-stop transportation, as this forces us to conjure family and
friends who don't exist. Due to these unfair practices, Clayton Jacobs and I may consider
leaving Colorado once any active welfare cases are closed. We will not be burdened by punitive
measures and request that our voices be heard and understood.

Please extend Access on Demand to the Southshore area in Aurora. There are a lot of our
seniors living with our children, who do not have access to public transportation. Most of our
children work full time, which means we are prohibited from rides to doctors and other
appointments. My address is 27135 E Arapahoe PL and I have no vehicle and no public
transportation, yet my children pay the same taxes as those 2 miles away who have all your
access. Thank you. 520-678-4290.
As a legally blind single working mother, I am so grateful for the opportunity to use Access on
Demand as it helps me take my child to and from school. However, I too was told (and have
written proof) where the wording said 60 trips per month and did not delineate that it was 60
one-way trips. This has greatly increased the cost of getting my child to and from school and
me to and from work. Taking the bus or other forms are public transportation are not options
for me and whenever I have used Access on Demand I find myself having to stand in
sometimes very inclement weather while waiting on another ride as there is no waiting spot
with shelter at the school. As a person working in the field of Diversity, equity, and inclusion,
often people confuse equity with equality. By saying we are only granting 60 one-way trips to
make i it equitable for all is not accurrate. What RTD is trying to do is equality. However,
everyone has different needs. While I may not need a wheelchair accessible bus, I do need
more trips to help me navigate my space bette.r and more efficiently and effectively. That is
equity. As mentioned, I do truly appreciate CO's initiative of this program as it is far more
advanced than many states. We do, however, have a long road ahead of us in ensuring that we
are truly taking equity into account and my hope is that this survey and feedback you are
gathering will assist with this Thank you for your time and for listening.
Access-A-Ride has really helped me to be more independent with my disability. The lyft/uber

participants I fully agree that stopping for more than a few minutes to drop off a package or

there would be a time limit on this Valuable service. Many visually impaired individuals may

Where is the link to register for Access on Demand
Access on Demand is a fantastic service - please keep it! It is invaluable in supporting access to

Metro has been really good. They want to call on me on a cell phone which I don't use. I wish
they would use my land line to let me know they are coming. My biggest issue is that they have
left if they haven't seen me or if i don't answer the phone right away. The subsidy works out
great for where you are going. I appreciate the service for getting me around. IT is frustrating
that her landline can't be used. I really don't want to see this program go away, as I don't like
riding with other people. This allows me to ride by myself and not have to take longer with
picking up others or dropping off other people.
I would like to know why I CANNOT access my rides?????
Hi, I want to start by saying that I am so grateful to have access to access a ride on demand. It
allows me the freedom to do what I need to do without having to rely on my caretaker for
everything. However, the recent change to no longer allow stops has made it much harder. I
end up using more rides (and in turn more fees) instead of just adding a stop which typically
costs no more than 3 dollars. It makes getting my medical supplies much harder as instead of
going to get them and going home in one trip, I have to wait upwards of 20 minutes with my 6
boxes of TPN supplies outside. Thank you for taking the time to read this. -Emmory McQueen
As a disabled participant who can no longer drive and as a participant of the program. I have
had several Uber driver tell me to just add a stop and they would take me back home. Now it is
1. only costing a few dollars more. 2. it did not go over my $25 budget, however if it did my
debit card is on file and I would be charged the overage. It costs more to have to book a whole
new ride when you get out of 1 Uber and then you are dropping of clothes at the cleaners for 2
minutes then you have to wait for a new Uber to show up. as long as the ride doesn't go over
the $25, but if it does then the customer must pay the difference. If you go over by another
$25 then you are doing more than you should be. If I am only going from my house to make a
deposit at the bank ATM why waste another entire ride when I can use just one ride being
efficient in my travels. as a disabled person who is still working to get her SSDI It is expensive
for me to pay $4.50 Each way to take care of my travel needs when walking is a challenge for
me. I feel that it is wrong to suspend a person for being efficient in their travels because
someone else who has not applied for Access on demand and who may not know how to use it
or who may not even be nice to their drivers for their drivers to want to help them learn how to
use the feature. so I was suspended for 1 week. now I know not to do it I won't however I
think it is not a sustainability issue. If the ride is over $25 we have to pay the excess so please
stop making that the reason. Someone must have taken it way out of the neighborhood. that is

Hello, my name is Melissa Fishburn and I serve on the RTD APAC for paratransit services. As
noted from Deborah Johnson's letter, RTD has claimed they are committed to collaborating with
the APAC. Respectfully, I feel that the community is not being heard on the multi stop trip
matter. Rtd mentions having a review by industry experts, but how is the input from the actual
community that is consuming the services being heard? Why is RTD allowed to take formal
action with suspending service for those before a formal decision is made by the pier study or
the board of directors? The current suspension process does not protect our rights as people
with disabilities and has not underwent a fair review that permits, taking action on the multi trip
allowance. since the inception of the access a ride program and the access on Demand
program, the needs of the community have changed and read updated to reflect real time
changes to match the way the world is evolving. This is one of the reasons we strongly urge
RTD to look at allowing the multi trip option and look at obtaining resources to offer a multi trip
option on the WAV vehicles. By doing research and number crunching, it seems that this access
on demand is saving RTD money, which would open up the doors to provide resources on the
WAV vehicle to provide stops for wheelchair passengers and passenger that otherwise cannot
ride the vehicles that may not be able to provide the efficient service that is needed for various
mobility needs. As 70% of the disability community is unemployed, this suspension and not
allowing multi stop trips is putting an undue hardship on those with disabilities that qualify for
the excess a ride service. The policies which are being referred to in this concern to multi stop
trips are outdated for the needs of our world that is continually stepping more and more away
from brick and mortar stores and converting to online curbside pick up and also needs
consideration to people with weak immune systems that should not be out in heavily populated
public, who are needing to get prescriptions without being exposed to the general public and
going to a restaurant to pick up meals without being exposed to the general public because of
health conditions. RTD seems to think that riders can easily switch their rideshare app to not
use the voucher if they wish to take multi stop trips, but with this, I ask, why would somebody
even bother trying to qualify for such a program as access a ride if he or she could afford to
pay completely out of pocket for their transportation in the first place. This funding has been
given to RTD to help people with disabilities and those who may be indigent in the community.
It causes further safety issues to make a person with a disability who may be defenseless in the
face of danger and adverse elements, to wait for an additional ride when they only have to
make a quick stop at a location for a multitude of reasons. This program has always been
marketed as helping those who cannot drive due to various disabilities to have a sense of
independence, and that is not seeming to be upheld in the situation that we are currently
experiencing. At best, I would ask that RTD would cease disciplinary actions for individuals who
benefit from multi stop trips until an official study is completed by the peer committee and a
ruling is made by the Board of Directors. Thank you for your time, Melissa Fishburn

current AAR system could be updated to allow GPS tracking, it would reduce many of the timing

I feel that not allowing riders to make stops along trips is a disservice and discriminatory. It
forces riders to use additional vouchers when one voucher would suffice to take care of
business like picking up prescriptions from a pharmacy, picking up dry cleaning, dropping off
medical forms. These are things able-bodied individuals take for granted and are not restricted
from doing multiple times a day. If they forget something, if they need to pick something up, or
drop something off, if they need to make an emergency bathroom break, they are free to do
these things without consequence. It is unfair that after qualifying for these vouchers, we are
then regulated on how to use them, just because we have a disability, when the goal is to
improve access. Penalizing disabled people for living their daily lives and getting tasks done in
the most efficient and equitable way available when on a fixed income is unfair and continues
to further the divide. The fact that Access-A-Ride customers do not have access to this option is
irrelevant, it should be a priority to introduce this option to them, while acknowledging that the
Access-On-Demand service is another branch of the program that operates differently. Afterall,
Access-On-Demand customers aren't being penalized for being able to request a ride
immediately while Access-A-Ride users still need to request rides in advance. There are
differences, and if one needs to be adjusted, it should be argued that Access-A-Ride should be
the one to modernize. Access-On-Demand may offer additional stops, but the voucher does not
cover anymore monetarily whether there is an extra stop or not, and using two vouchers
instead of one would in fact be costing the state more, so its pretty confusing as to the
complaint.
As a customer of 8 years I love this service provided for myself and others like myself. I would
really appreciate it there was a service like Uber/Lift for us that need same day service and not
having to stay somewhere for a WHOLE hour before being picked up especially when it's not
going to take a WHOLE hour (ex. 10-20 minutes or less). Please consider this service and it
needs to be for people with scooters/wheelchairs.
As someone who is a single blind mother, adding a stop to my trips would be beneficial. There's
instances where I have to drop my daughter off at school and then myself as well.
Unfortunately, having to schedule two different rides for these matters delays the process of
when I have to be in class. Sometimes I have to leave much earlier than I would wish for
because I have to ensure that I am in classes on time. Adding stop would save time, and on the
app itself, when you do, add a stop, specifically for Uber, the balance shows zero dollars. If this
is the case, then why aren't we able to use, our rides? Lyft, at least it shows that you have to
pay extra or that the voucher is not applied when added a stop. I hope that this could be sorted
out for us because it would save a lot of like myself sometime and rides.
I got in trouble with Uber because I did an extra stop trip and I didn't remember. It causes a lot
of anxiety. I went to get my meds which took me 5 minutes, and just took the same Uber back
home. It helped so that I didn't have to wait for another car in the cold. I guess that isn\'t
allowed. Apparently, they told me in an email, but I didn\'t remember that at all. Wild. It makes
less sense to go somewhere for a couple minutes and have to get and wait for a new ride. I

hate getting penalized for something I forgot about, especially in a program where you\'re
working with disabled + neurodivergent people, you can\'t always naturally and immediately
assume they\'re doing something wrong or bad on purpose!! when they were like \"you were
briefed on this\" in the email, I literally do not remember that at all. I was overloaded with so
much information. The people at the certification center when we went were SO nice and the
drivers are so nice. I'd think they\'d be empathetic and understanding, especially because we
have to jump through so many hoops to get the assistance. How is someone with autism and
ADHD gonna remember every single detail of a meeting? My brain doesn\'t do that. What about
a compromise: something like 20 of our 60 trips per month can be multi stop? That would be
great! Someone who has a harder-to-use mobile aid than me, like my friend in a power chair,
they could pack it up in an Uber and use their cane to grab something quick they need, leave
the chair in the car, and come back for it instead of having to do ALL OF THAT aaaand adding
the complication and expense of needing two cars. It just doesn\'t seem helpful for a disability
service to have that kind of impediment implemented at all.
Yeah I think your service is great with access on demand I\'m telling you for us that are on
disability and social security or SSI yeah but yeah I need delays or any work that has to be
done on transportation yeah I don\'t mind no I just appreciate all the support that you guys can
give us yeah so all the mirrors and all them tax dollars yeah it\'s nice to see that you can get a
little bit back when you need it so yeah my feedback is totally positive towards your program
okay thanks again you guys keep up the good work Mark Barcelona Gilbert Mark Barcelona
Good day, I am blind and use the access ride program and also the access on demand. My
suggestion is to look at solving the problem related to the multi stop issue. Simply let people
know that if they continue to try to use it, they will be, put on a program for three months
where they will have no use of any part of the service at all. Another alternative would be that
they have no access to the access on demand. However, for those of us that do not take
advantage and do what we're supposed to do. The ACCESS on demand is an immensely helpful
tool For disabled people, especially the blind. That said please do not jump to make conclusions
but rather pinpoint the problem and how to fix it. Please do not remove the access on demand
just punish those that don't obey the rules. It's very simple and doesn't take much to figure this
one out. I have used another paratransit service in Florida years ago where they cut off access
to the service to anybody that had more than three no-shows within a month. The cut off time
was approximately two months if memories serves me. People learn quickly not to abuse this
assistant and, the service also allowed sufficient time for a trip to be canceled. Typically, this
was one hour in advance of the pick up time. It could also be canceled very easily overnight
using the 24 hour answering service.
I want to register for taxi or uber but I don't know how?

Stuart Summers started transcription
Fred Worthen 0:03

So my name is Fred Worth and I am the assistant general manager. Bus operations

tonight, as we gratefully described at the introduction, we'll be discussing briefly our
paratransit peer review.

Then we'll talk briefly about some of the observations and recommendations.

I think Stuart will talk about some of our public operating next steps and then we will
open things up for questions.

So that being said, in February of 2024, the general manager, Deborah Johnson,

asked me to assume oversight of our paratransit operations. For those of you who
have not had the pleasure of meeting yet, I have 40 years in the transit industry.
I have worked at 5 different transit systems and I have managed 4 different
paratransit systems of demand response systems.
In three different states.

So I have a very extensive background in paratransit, so Deborah asked me to move
from just overseeing our daily bus operations to our paratransit and service
development.
So.

At the time that I joined the paratransit group and took over leadership, Miss

Johnson also asked that the American Public Transit Association put together a peer
review to take a look at our paratransit operations.

This included our accessorite and access on demand programs itself.

And for those of you who are not familiar with the peer review, it is not what many
people think.

A lot of people think that it is looking completely at the customer experience. It is
much bigger than just a customer experience.

It is doing a complete operational review from head to toe of our services. So we

have a panel of subject matter experts from around the country who actually came
in.

In May and conducting an on site review of our accessoriding access on demand

Attachment: Attachment E - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.16.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

1.E.4.e

Packet Pg. 388

1.E.4.e

basically looked at our operations and they assessed our strengths, our opportunities
and potential improvement areas.

The peer review had three different areas of focus.

Which included identifying best practices employed by similar transit agencies.
This included looking at demand response above and beyond the traditional

accessory type services. It also included looking at our access on demand program as
well. The peer review also focused on modelling program parameters that included
responsible cost controls and sound customer facing processes and taking a good
hard.

Look at our software, hardware and other tools.

That the team uses to ensure that we're delivering service at an optimal level.
And that the programs that we operate are as cost effective as possible.

The peer review panel met in May and they worked from May through August to
develop a full set of recommendations.

I will actually outline some of the high level recommendations in this this

presentation. However, I will give you a link to the full peer review report. So if you
have not read it, you will have an opportunity to read all of the recommendations.

So the one thing that I want to point out is when we bring in a panel of experts, they
are very good at identifying where challenges and opportunities arise.

They share their experiences with us on how they actually resolved issues, but one
thing that is important to note is that.

I'm sorry, it's really distracting with all the pop ups that are pinging.

And when we have to look at each one of the reactions and really look at our own
operating environment.

So even though they have actually assessed our operations and provided a series of
recommendations, those recommendations are not finalized.

We have to look at what they recommend, what the opportunities are and customize
those recommendations to our operating environment.
And ultimately, if there are policy related issues.
Those changes?

Need approved by our Board of directors. We bring them to our board and we'll talk
about how that process works a little bit later on. But anything that is really policy
related, the board has to consider and approve.

So there were three major areas of recommendations that all of the

Attachment: Attachment E - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.16.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

programs, they interviewed a lot of stakeholders, both internal and external, and they

Packet Pg. 389

1.E.4.e

One is they the the team recommended that a clearly stated vision for our paratransit
is developed to guide our priorities with accessorized and access on demand services
right now, accessor ride and access on demand pretty much work independently.

And that wasn't the intent of the programs.
The programs were really meant for access.

Demand to complement access a ride not to work is completely different program
itself.

So one of the the things they recommended vision put together that basically helps.
And cohesiveness to these two programs. Also, they recommended refreshing the
access on demand program structure.

The access on Demand program actually started.

As a pilot project that was very small in nature that has grown from.
Roughly 8000 riders a month to over 65,000 riders a month.
The initial operating cost when the pilot program started.

Around $75,000, the the program has grown to over $1 million a month. And

remember, access on demand is a supplemental program that is premium service. It
is not required by the Americans with Disabilities Act.

It goes above and beyond the Americans with Disabilities requirements.
So it is a supplemental program that is premium in nature.
And the other area of focus.

That they recommended that we work on is leveraging technology and process
improvements to streamline daily work.

This includes improving staff efficiency, reallocating staff to more impact, impactful
work, delivering better service and reducing cost.
So there were seven major.

Actions that were really high level, these were the major actions.

There's a lot of other steps that they really talk about in the report, but when you

start looking at things from a high level, one of the areas they mentioned was that
the accessorized.
Has to have.

Alignment with our service and mission and we need to have basically somebody
who is an empowered owner.
Is number 5 on here.

That is really a champion for not only overseeing the getting into leading policy, but

Attachment: Attachment E - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.16.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

recommendations were received to kind of be clumped into.

Packet Pg. 390

1.E.4.e

also recommended creating a technology and data strategy and also reducing
potential compliance exposures.

There are a lot of complexities in the Americans with Disabilities Act.
But there are times where.

No, an area may not technically be within our service area because of the Americans
with Disabilities Act requiring that if there are customers that are surrounded by

services up to a certain corridor spacing, then they're creating what's called a donut
hole.

So even though those individuals would not be within the ADA service area
requirements because they're surrounded by services.

It's in there within a certain distance of the fixed route services. We would still need
to basically supply.

Access right services.

So they didn't say that we had issues, but they said that we should really look at

making sure that we don't have any exposure and really go back and look really hard
at our policies and procedures.

They also recommended evaluating excessive reporting standards for on time
performance.

Conducting regular checks on data parameters used for key performance indicators
and when we talk about on time performance.

One of the things I talked about was not just looking at on time performance from a
pick up window, but also from the stance of making sure that we are getting people
where they need to be on time as well.

It doesn't do any good to pick somebody up at 9:00 on time if they have an
appointment at 9:30 and we drop them off at 10:00.
So.

The team recommended looking at on time performance and other things through a
little different lens.

They also recommended implementing software that can automate tasks.

This is a really deep subject for us, but there are a lot of manual problems that are

providers and our staff members have to go through manually to oversee the access
on demand and access, provide programs and we have a lot of opportunity to
optimize.

Darling, if you could, could you please make sure everybody can eat it?

Attachment: Attachment E - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.16.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

also to make sure that our services are in alignment with our service mission. They

Packet Pg. 391

Joni Hardy 10:13

Yeah, I'll give it a shot.
Fred Worthen 10:15
Alright.

Also, they recommended that we review contractor management processes and
requirements to improve service and to streamline our operations.

So those were the high level recommended actions and summaries that they gave us.
However, there is much greater detail within the report itself, and with that Stewart,
would you like to take over and talk about the customer and stakeholder
engagement?

Stuart Summers 10:45
Yeah, absolutely.
Thanks Fred.

So as introduced, I am Stuart, Summer's Chief Communications and engagement
officer.

I just want to really quickly talk about some of the stakeholder engagement, which
includes what we are doing here this evening.

So last month we launched a communication outreach plan to directly engage with
paratransit customers.

It was important to solicit feedback from all of you and all of our active customers to
hear directly from you about.

Any of these recommendations? Potential changes?

And discuss some of the impact. We're hosting a number of these in person and
virtual feedback meetings like the one we're here in this evening.

Earlier this month, we launched a couple of customer feedback surveys.

We're now going through the the data collected as part of those surveys.

I do want to emphasize that all of the information that we are discussing this
evening, as well as the full peer review report is available on our website.
It's the paratransit peer review website. You can.

Google RTD paratransit peer review, or the web link is on the next slide, and I'll get to
that in just a minute.

We are soliciting feedback during the stage.

1.E.4.e

Packet Pg. 392

1.E.4.e

important to hear from all of you as decisions are being put together and

recommendations will be presented to the Board of Directors. Next slide, Fred.

So a few things that we're going through timeline right here on the screen. We do

have soliciting feedback over the next month or so and then we'll take that feedback
and put it forward to our Board of Directors for their consideration. Next slide.
Alright, we are now to the stage of opening this up for from those that are

assembled that would like to provide feedback. I do want to note that there is a

feedback form on RT DS web page where you can go in and provide comments,
direct feedback or.
Ask questions.

Staff will be going through all those feedback.

We're compiling all that together to share with our Board of Directors.
That form is available at RTD.
Hyphendenver.com.

Slash Para Transit, hyphen peer hyphen review.

And so it's just the paratransit peer review webpage at this juncture, what we want to
do is we have about an hour and 15 minutes remaining this meeting.

We do have a hard stop at 7:00 PM for those that would like to provide comment,

please do so by raising your hand and I will call on you if you have questions. Some
of them, we may be able to address others. We'll take note of those quest.
And provide answers on that web page at a later time.

We're collecting a number of these frequently asked questions on that web page if

you would. If you're calling in via phone, you can press *5 to raise your virtual hand
and then I will call on you to provide comment like I mentioned. Please keep your
comments and.

Feedback to less than two minutes. If you have more that you want to say, you're
welcome to provide that using that feedback form or e-mail staff.
Later time. And with that I will start to.

Call on individuals that have raised their hand and we will start with Eric Hubler. You
are recognized.

Eric Hubler 14:17

Perfect. Yeah.

Thank you very much, Fred said.

Attachment: Attachment E - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.16.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

As Fred mentioned, no final decisions have been made and so that's why it's

Packet Pg. 393

1.E.4.e

what it is. What is it?

Fred Worthen 14:29

So what they recommended is for us to look at restructuring the program itself.

There are not specific issues that we have actually developed yet, but there were

things that they recommended that we look at, for example, charging an initial fare.

They look, they recommended that looking at our trip cap, they look recommended.
Looking at our trip subsidy, they recommended looking at the access on demand
program more holistically.

To try to ensure that the program is complementary and is not a stand alone
program itself.

Eric Hubler 15:11

Can you, as a follow up?

Can you explain what complementary would mean?
Fred Worthen 15:15

So complementary means that it complements the service that the primary services
so.

Eric Hubler 15:22

Right, without without using the term in its own definition.
Fred Worthen 15:26
OK so.

Please give me an opportunity to respond.
The Americans with Disabilities Act.

The defines complementary service as a service that is supplemental are similar to
fixed route services.

There is a it's very complicated, but there are requirements on what types of services
we have to provide legally. And then there are also services, though that are
supplemental.

That complement the service itself.

So for example, our accessoride meets the Americans with Disabilities.

Attachment: Attachment E - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.16.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

There's a recommendation regarding access on demand, but I don't think he said

Packet Pg. 394

1.E.4.e

supplemental.

It complements the service and the fact that it provides added benefits that are
above and beyond the Americans with Disabilities Act itself.

So it is a supplemental service that is premium that complements the accessorized
services.

Eric Hubler 16:31

Thanks. I'd just say that if some if there's demand for something, that means it's
working well, then you should do more of it.
Fred Worthen 16:38

I do understand one thing that I want to make very clear though through tonight is
this is an opportunity to ask questions and provide feedback.

I am not here to justify a case or to make decisions at this point.

I am here to answer questions and hear individual's feedback. There have not been
any policy decisions made at this point.

This is part of the reason why we go through the public process. There are a lot of
perceptions.

That we have made decisions that we're trying to get rid of, things like access on
demand, that is not the case.

Access on demand is a truly, truly good service for us. However, unlike a a merchant

that when there's a demand they can sell more of a product, we have limited dollars
to be able to fund services itself.
So I can't just.

Go out and sell more product and make more money.

The money that we make from the fare box is very limited.

And does not anywhere near cover the expense that we incur for operating our
services themselves?

So we do have to differentiate between public and private services.
Stuart, you want to go to who's next in the queue?
Stuart Summers 17:55

Yeah, let's. And if anyone would like to provide additional feedback or comments,
you're also welcome.

Attachment: Attachment E - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.16.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

The Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, however, access on demand is

Packet Pg. 395

1.E.4.e

possible, and if you want to do a follow up time, you're welcome to raise your hand
again.

Let's go to Colleen.

You are recognized.
Colleen 18:13

Thank you so much.

I live east of Parker and Douglas County about the same time that I permanently
lost my vision at age 52, I moved to a more rural area that was already in process.
And we did not know that I would lose.

I would wake up and not be able to see.

And so access on demand has been my main option for independence, for getting to
the doctor for.

Having any socialization with any other humans 'cause I live in a quieter area.
And I do not have the opportunity to use Accessoride where I live.

I had no idea it was a, you know, $1 million a month program, but I would love to see
any efforts to apply for Department of Transportation grants or any kind of state or
federal grant programs that could help subsidized access on demand.
Because I think there are a lot of us that are not.

Living right downtown Denver on routes or and there are a lot of us that don't need
a a van with accessibility issues.
I'm able bodied but I just can't.

I'm not on a main road of anything so.

Anything I think there are a lot of us that would happily help, and if there's anything
we could do to get grants.

Governmental or private foundation grants. I would love to be part of that.
Stuart Summers 19:53

Thanks Colleen and and staff are taking note of all this feedback as well.
Fred Worthen 19:53

Appreciate. Thank you.

Like I mentioned, to fill out that form, but let's try and get through as many as

Packet Pg. 396

1.E.4.e

Linda Davis. Linda, you are recognized.
Linda Davis 20:07
Hi, thank you.

So I am the guardian of an adult disabled adult who live.

We live in heatherwood in gun barrel here in Boulder, and there used to be a bus
line and during COVID that bus line was discontinued.
The nearest bus stop is 3 miles from our home.
And so obviously that's not realistic.
She is employed, disabled adults.

She works four days a week and most days we can drive her and pick her up.

But there are occasions when no one is available to do that, and since there is no
longer a bus route in our community.

This has been an absolute amazing service for her.
She doesn't use it often.

Occasionally she will use it to get home from spending some time with a friend.
I will drop her at a friend's house and then I have to go to work.

She's 32 years old, but she, you know, she functions more as a younger person
cannot drive.

She has visual impairment and physical impairments, but she's very active.
She's very engaged with with her work and with a friend or two.
This has really been a lifesaver for her.

And I guess one of the things I would suggest is initially there was a $3 charge I

believe and I think that was you know if if doing something along those lines for
those who can afford that can help to to defray some of the cost along.
The line you know along the way cause $1,000,000 a month.

I know is a lot of money, you know, putting that back in place would be something
we would be more than happy to to accept.

And and I again, I don't if that would help if you know if we could figure out what
that amount would be to make it so that.
Become more affordable.

But you know, a three mile walk for a disabled visually impaired person is obviously
not realistic, and her independence is profoundly important to her.

So I whatever we can do to support keeping this in place would be really, really

Attachment: Attachment E - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.16.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

So we appreciate you providing us that context and information next in the queue is

1.E.4.e

somewhere.

It's it's not a big deal if they're not timely, but it is pretty typical that they are not.
And I I get that there's a lot going on, but they are often not timely.
And she can't be at work an hour late, mom.

Or to a doctor's appointment an hour late and that kind of thing.

So so if this is still something that is sustainable and we can help by participating
with some of the cost, I would definitely endorse that.
Fred Worthen 22:27
Thank you.

Stuart Summers 22:28
Thanks Linda.

Fred Worthen 22:28
And we are, we are.

We are looking at all alternatives. I take it that you were one on the individuals that
was granted legacy status when the pandemic occurred.
Ed Gerhardt 22:38
Replay.

Fred Worthen 22:39

I'm glad that she is able to make usage of the services again.

I I really want to reiterate, I see the value of this I hear from individuals.

I know this is a valuable program we're looking to find some alternatives to make the
sustainable, but make sure we're able to keep program.
Keep the program going.

So I appreciate your comments.

And of your willingness to help with some solutions as well.

Stuart Summers 23:30

+17*******10 23:32

Yes, yes. You know, I was my question first is.

Was this not initially considered of how many people would take advantage of the
service when?

When when it was decided to use the access on demand services to why there are
not?

Why is there not enough funds to cover?

1.E.4.e

Packet Pg. 399

1.E.4.e

Of the service or or was it initially thought that there wouldn't be so many people
that would use the service and also?

It's it's critical that I use the access on demand service because of my job and the

requirements of the employer. To that we take Uber and Lyft from work and things
like that, and it could potentially.
Putting cuts to the service.

Or reducing or creating more of a higher cost could potentially mean disruption of
employment for me.

So it I mean and it has increased my of of course independence initially but but that's
that's my comment on it.
Fred Worthen 24:52

Thank you. And to answer your question, you know when the program started, it

started as a pilot project and it was initially a three-year program that was funded for
$9 million.

This was one of the early programs in the country.

There are a lot of transit systems that are now using transit network providers like
Uber and Lyft for supplemental services and premium services like us.
But I don't think that anyone could have seen the growth.

Demand at the level that it grew, I believe that there was an expectation and hope
that it would grow, but it really boomed.

Like I said, we started out with about 7000 riders a month and Gretchen will correct
me if I'm wrong.

We're up to about 65,000 riders a month now, so since the initial pilot inception.

This service has grown in demand by over 10 times since we first took it on, so it's
been wrecked.

Successful, but I don't know that any.

To project it that it would grow at the rate that it did.

And like I said we we hear loud and clear from a lot of different people how critical
this service is.

So I appreciate the comments.
Stuart Summers 26:11

Thanks, Fred. Next, oh, go ahead, Gretchen.

His situation has a lot of complications and that he lives in a host home in Lakewood,
but his job two days a week is in Parker.

The other issue would be for him to take a bus.

It would take approximately 3 hours with a number of transfers for him to get to and
from, so access on demand would be hugely helpful I've made.

Many phone calls for many months trying to find out who I could discuss this issue
with to see if we can escalate this and get an exception because.
He he should qualify.

But this is again a policy back to your, you know, point of policy change.

What is in place for exception situations where you know if he stays at a bus stop? If
the bus does not come very quickly, he will wander off and that's where we have
issues.

Occur. So this would be greatly beneficial and again I cannot say how much we here,
how wonderful this program is for all his peers in that community.

Gretchen, is there anything you'd like to add, clarify, or explain?
Gretchen Vidergar 30:42
I would yes, thank you.

Well, first of all, I I wanted to clarify, has your son applied and gone through the
eligibility process for access a ride?
Ed Rodgers 30:52

Absolutely. And because he tests so high, he doesn't qualify for access a ride.
Gretchen Vidergar 30:57

So he was determined, not eligible. And did you go through the appeal process for
that?

Ed Rodgers 31:05

We put multiple yes and every time, even when I call in. Now if I ever am able to get
ahold of someone, they tell me, oh, if he if he was denied, that's it. There's no.

The appeal process can only take place within the first couple of months from that

But again, there are.

Always circumstances that are changing and so we encourage people to reapply if
they are interested in trying again.
Ed Rodgers 32:03

OK. Is there someone specifically I should be talking to about this?

Because if he goes in and takes the test again, it will show that he has the ability to

read all the schedules and can and has been able to in the past. You know, take RTD
multiple places.

And that seems to kick him out and show that he's denied because he doesn't need
access, right?

I'm peeking in here.
Fred Worthen 34:41
Hi, Isaac.

Isaac Scholl 34:43

And we spent a good two years trying to find employment for him, working with

DVR and other agencies looking for employment that would put him on a bus line so
that he could take public transportation.
We were not at all successful in that.

It was very limiting in terms of being, you know, finding a position that for a business
that would hire him, that was right on a bus line, he has difficulty navigating his
balance.

Not good. He he can't.

He can't navigate ice and snow and therefore door to door service is really a
requirement for him.

The good news is he has been successful in finding employment.

And he is actively using access on demand to get from his apartment to his work.

And it has been amazing in terms of the independence that has given him and the
success he's been able to achieve in in his work.
Because of access on demand.
Again, the reason.

Access on demand works.
Is because it's on time.

It gets them to his work, predictably, reliably on time, whereas Accessoride
notoriously was not doing that.

So I wanted to just share Isaac's success story and beg that we keep this program
working as is because it's critical to his employment.
Fred Worthen 36:16

Thank you for sharing that.

You know, there's one thing that for those who have not used accessoride for a
while.

We have made quite a few improvements in the Accessor ride program over the last

Attachment: Attachment E - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.16.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

Hi, I'll say hello.

Packet Pg. 407

1.E.4.e

Our on time performance was not the greatest.

But we implemented some new software and one of our.

Internal IT employees actually figured out a way to improve our on time
performance.

For pickups early last year, access on the Accessor side was only arriving on time.
Roughly 7577% of the time.

What as we implemented these improvements starting late last year, we steadily seen
the accessor ride on time performance grow since March.

This year we've steadily been above 90% on time as far as pickups go.

Again, we have opportunities with regard to getting people to where they need to be
on time.

I understand that it's important to get picked up and dropped off on time, but for
those who haven't used the service for some time, it has improved a lot.

We still have opportunity.

We're still working on things.

That's part of the reason why we're going through this process.
But I do think that everyone who hasn't used it.

If you have an opportunity to use accessorize, try it out.
Give it a try.

Now things have changed a lot again.

We still have opportunities, but we're picking up roughly 9293% on time now. So
there's been huge improvements in the services over the last year.
All right, Stuart, back to you.
Stuart Summers 38:07

I appreciate that feedback from Isaac and his mother.

Packet Pg. 408

Cynde 38:21
Mr. Cindy.
Cynda

38:26

First of all, thank you so much for this opportunity to give this feedback and this
input.

Cinda is an adult with an developmental intellectual disability, and she has been
using access on demand very, very successfully.

In fact, she's taught many of her friends that you know, she she hangs with.
How to use it as well?

Because it's been really successful for her.

We did find, as you have has already been mentioned here, that accessoride while
she used it.

Extensively was really difficult and not the the timeliness especially and then that
caused so much anxiety.

So then that caused a lot of difficulty throughout the rest of the day.

And so there were, you know, factors that kind of added onto each other as we as it
went.

So the access on demand has given her a lot of independence.

Has really helped her to be able to go. And so one thing I really like about it is the
the fact that you don't have to schedule.

You know it is on demand. And so she's able to just say I want to go, you know, here
and she can go.

So the accessory takes a lot more planning with scheduling and that sort of thing,

which certainly we're willing to do if it's, you know if the service is better and if we're
able to get where we need to go.
One time, and that sort of thing.

The other thing I wanted to mention was the cost. And whenever she did use
accessorize, she was able to get.

Accessory tickets to pay for the I think it's it was $5 at the time or something.

I'm not sure what it is now because she hasn't used it for a little while, but we were
able to get those through her.

Disability waiver. And so then she was able to pay for that pay for those things with
her.

1.E.4.e

1.E.4.e

Coupons, and so that was super helpful.

And so then if if there were to be a fee for the access on demand or something like
that, I'm just suggesting that if they were able to pay that fee through the waiver.
If there was some sort of way to do that, that would be great.

We she did do the access on demand whenever there was a charge, two or three
dollars or something and she's still she gives tips and she pays that.
Like we buy her Uber cards and she so she pays tips off of that.
So you know, she's she still is paying some for the tips, but.

It just just if those costs were able to be covered by the by the waivers and there was
that sort of thing that would be something that would be super helpful and maybe
an option for revenue, I don't know.
Fred Worthen 41:25
Thank you.

Appreciate the feed.
Cynda

41:26

Anything. I just wanna see if there's anything Cindy wants to add.
OK.

Thank you.

I think I'm gonna run down at about. There should be an option.
That.

You can't be kind out for not backs up. She doesn't like when she gets in super big
trucks 'cause they they are hard for her to get in.

So she says, if there's an option that you could ask for no trucks, she would like that.
But I know that's not what we're here to discuss.
But that's her.

That's her issue with it and we say, and we say hi to Gretchen 'cause, we talked to she
emails Gretchen a lot.

42:09

So thank you so much.
Fred Worthen 42:12

Well, Cinda, thank you.

And just for your education, again, I talked about a lot of the high level things in the

report, but one of the things that the report mentioned is that we should look at our
fleet mix trying to move to some smaller vehicles, maybe a mix of vehicles that.

Have sedans and lifts that are smaller or more economical or more comfortable, and
even trying to improve the comfort of the larger vehicles itself.

So again, I can't go into all of the details of the report because we're very limited.
But those are the kinds of things where when we hear what's important to you, it

helps us with customizing our whatever recommendations we finally bring forward to
meet our local conditions.

So thank you for your time and thanks Cinda.

Good. I didn't know if my headset was working.

I'm. I moved here from Wyoming in 2019 and they actually ran a program up there in
Wyoming called Wyoming Independent Living, and they actually ran a program with
Uber that's very similar to what RTD is doing here.

And so when I first moved down here, it was because of my health.

brain and I was starting to lose my eyesight.

And the doctors had to move me down here to Denver just before the pandemic.

And I live on the West side of of Denver and was going to the University Hospital and
I was using access. The Accessor ride vans, and then sometimes the telehealth and I
was getting abandoned at the end of my long days at the University Hospital and.
It was getting very scary at times for me because I'd be so tired and worn out.

And when I found out from one of my friends who's supposed to be attending some
place here that you guys had access on demand available, I signed up immediately
when I opened up to Denver Metro.

Because I did not want to be abandoned by the Medicaid taxis anymore.
I didn't usually have any problems with that the the the little.

Vans. But I just knew exactly what those Uber rides were gonna be like because I had
the.

For the little bit that I was still up in Wyoming when they had launched that little
pilot up there and it has been a lifesaver for me.
I'm immune compromised. I've been on long.

Low dosed chemo through this whole nightmare that we've been living through as

we've come out of it and it's very hard for me to be even in the small bands around
people and writing a fixed bus would be very dangerous for me at times. And so
being around.

People. If my immune system is not working really well is hard.

And I'm doing a lot better and I'm hoping in another year or so that I might be able
to get a service dog and part of my dream is to maybe eventually someday to be
safe for me to ride regular RTD. We can always hope for that, but.

My thing is that I think I would love to be able to share my story with the public
'cause I think if we got the public to know how important part transit is.

And on demand is for those of us that need it. I think if there was some type of
education program.

For people to hear some of our stories about what a difference it makes in our lives,

it would be very helpful for them to understand when ballots and stuff come up, why
those services are so important. And that was just my feedback and I wanted to give
back.

To you because you guys have given me another life having that access on demand

I First off, thanks for sharing your story and 2nd off this goes back to what I was
saying earlier.

We don't want this program to go away.
We recognize the importance of it.

We just need to find a way to make it sustainable in a way that works for most
people on an everyday basis itself.

But I appreciate you sharing your story.

Such anxiety relief.

I can't explain how bad it was with Accessor ride. She had been using it for 20 plus
years and even earlier in this year when the improvements were made.
Still, there were not enough improvements made so.

Yeah. Everything you guys can do to keep access on demand.

I like Janelle's idea of just bringing it to the people's awareness.
Is there a way we can write grants as somebody else?
I think it was Isaac's family had initiated that idea.
I don't know if you guys are a nonprofit or not.

But some fundraising, some grants, whatever we can do to keep this going. If you
have to charge us a little bit more.
We can do that.

It's just been invaluable.

And then my question is instead of telling me what ADA says and stuff, I'm just

wondering what your vision is in terms of making it complimentary versus a separate.

Entity in terms of how it was originally designed.
Fred Worthen 49:02

Great, great question you know.

Going to your comments itself, I'm going to answer the best I can this question
because I'm still trying to get my vision together.

You know 'cause, I'm still listening to what everybody is saying, but the Americans
with Disabilities Act was written almost 40 years ago.
Reality is written in 1990 and when it was written.

Fred Worthen 49:31

We lived in a different world.

In effect, the same basic regulations, there's been interpretations of.

really, even though we're talking a lot about it.

Access on to the end. I'm really talking about trying to.

Make all the services better across the board. You know, like I said, it doesn't do us
any good to pick you up on time. If we don't get you where you're going.

We I think that there's a lot of opportunities to improve service delivery at several

levels and it may very well be that we have to make some sacrifices to keep access
on demand.

Maybe we lower the number of trips or we ask for a fare to upfront to help with

things, but I I'm trying to look at things more cohesively. A lot of the discussions

have really been about the importance of access on demand, but I want to find ways.
To make the accessorized and access onto the mine more usable where you have a
choice where it's dependable and reliable enough.

Where you can use either service rather than to just say.

Accessorize doesn't work for me, so I'm going to go straight to access on demand.

I think that there's a time and place for both services, but I'd like to see them mesh
together better.

That they operate better and complement each other better. I don't have a clear

answer to that yet because I'm still formulating a lot of that vision based upon the
things that I'm hearing.

But you're right on the accessor side, we have a lot of opportunities.
And that's part of what this process is about.

It's not just about access on demand, it's access a ride.
So I I know that I didn't fully answer your question.

Ask me that question in about two or three months.
I think I'll have a little more clearly defined.

Vision for how all of that fits together, but I'm still working on formulating that.
But I appreciate the stories, though, because these things.
How do I say this?

They help fuel and motivate me.

I've been in public service all my life.

And I am not a person that sits around and lives with the services we provide.

I always like to try and strive for better services for better customer experience itself.
We've got a lot of opportunity and I really now that I have an opportunity to make

I don't know if you guys can see me, but I'm gonna like, look at my notes real quick.
Sorry about that.

Oh, thank you. OK.

Great. Thanks guys.

I had a couple of thoughts I agree with.

I think it was cinda's mom that was saying about the imagine.

Or I don't know if it's imagine, but sometimes it's the different waivers. I get my
tickets through my imagine waaver 'cause I have.
Intellectual and.

Developmental. I don't know.
I think developmental.

I don't know what I have, but I have something.

I'm autistic and then I also have a vision impairment.

So I do get my tickets from imagine which helps a lot and so I'm worried about the
cost of like if access on demand were to cost something more than like 3 or 4 you
know dollars. I'm a little concerned about that 'cause. I also feel like I.
Need a tip and so my tips are also.
You know at least three or $4.

So that's a little expensive when you're going short distances.
And then I had a couple of other thoughts.
I had one about I do.

I use it as a complimentary service 'cause I use accessoride a lot of the time for

longer trips like from Longmont to Boulder, I use accessoride and I haven't had a ton
of problems with it.

Attachment: Attachment E - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.16.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

changes. I really want to make some meaningful changes.

Packet Pg. 416

1.E.4.e

For I did ride for 2 1/2 hours the other day to go 20 miles.
Maybe 15?

So that was a little a little long and then they do sometimes drop me off late. And so
that can be frustrating.

The drivers are really, really kind and I really have had good experiences with them.
But yeah, if there's a way that imagine could subsidized access on demand or
something similar, or a grant or something could help, that would be good.
And then also sometimes.

Access on demand is not accessible even now. For some people that like wheelchair
accessible vehicles, some people have not been able to use it at all.
I have not successfully.

I've been able to use Z Trip or Metro Taxi and I know that some of those are are
good options but.

On the in the long run, I completely feel the same as as everyone else that it's really
been a huge blessing to me in my life and.

I love it a lot. Despite the drawbacks, there are always gonna be drawbacks in life.
It's it's very normal.

But yeah, access on demand is not always super accessible.
Sometimes Uber drivers don't have disability training.

They'll strand me. My friend Don doesn't use it at all because they stranded her and

left her in the middle of the street, and she's totally blind. So she didn't know where
to go.

So that's really important. And then?
Yeah, I think.

Probably nothing describes it more than being able to see somebody who is slowly
retreating back into the house. Having that independence to go to doctor's

questions posted in the chat. If we're not able to.

Packet Pg. 418

1.E.4.e

With that independence.
That said.

I recently watched the September 24th meeting that you guys had.
And notice there's a lot of things as far as the the.

Response and the reaction. How positive the the program is. Somebody made a

comment in that meeting that, you know, if you're selling something and you sell
more than you expected, you just want to grow it. And that's that's my hope for.
Rtd. In this program, the access on demand specifically.
I'd love to see it go statewide.

I'd love to see the state back it in a way that it could become bigger than just what it
is in the metro area.

That said, one question that is that that I've come up with is with access on demand
specifically.

And partnering with Uber and Lyft and Z CAB and and Metro.
Is there the availability to approach these companies?

And have a rebate program or some kind of discount. Obviously their ridership has
gone through the roof if we're talking about 62,000 riders in a month, if that's all

going directly to them, subsidized by RTD, is there the availability to get a kickback
to get a?
Date.

For a discount from those services.
Fred Worthen 1:00:28
That's a great idea.

I don't an answer for that question because that is really a legal question for a legal
and procurement team, but it's a great idea that we can put on the list to explore.
Jennifer Paradis 1:00:40

Awesome and thank you guys. This is having the accessibility to make this available
to the Community is real. Stand up move.

Thank you.

Fred Worthen 1:00:54
Thank you.

Stuart Summers 1:00:55

Next in the queue, Cindy, I believe I am pronouncing that correctly.
Cindy, you are recognized.
Cynde 1:01:03

To Cindy, can you hear me?

Alright. And I apologize in advance for her baby because I have a four month old. I'm
taking care of.

But anyway, so there's a couple comments that I want to make.

I'm a person who has combined vision and hearing loss, otherwise known as deaf,
Blind, and I also do a lot of advocacy work like I'm on the Advisory Board for the
paratransit services at this time.

And I want to first comment on the fact that.
The.

You know this this on demand program was first presented as a particular a way of
cost savings for access ride because the TRIPS and these big trucks is it was I think
Sara Lee called them or someone they are they were supposed to save us money
essentially.

It was supposed to save us money because those were projected an average of $58 a
trip, whereas you know the demand program would be a savings and plus be more
efficient. And so people were encouraged to increase their use of it.
And I'm just concerned.

That now that essentially the user just gone through the roof, not only because of

current riders, but since it's such a better, honestly a better predictable service, more
people have signed up who previously haven't. And I'm concerned that we have not
seen anything to show us well what?

Is the savings actually for those who are users of Accessor ride and we're no longer

1.E.4.e

Packet Pg. 420

1.E.4.e

And my second point is.

There was something mentioned in the very beginning of this by Linda, which had to
do with the fact that.

Her accessorite is tied to existing routes and having been a person who was a home
owner, I went and looked for a new home myself back in 2012 and I very carefully
researched things and bus routes and stuff and I I was between three homes and
two.

In Highlands Ranch and then one was right near the Zero and I thought, well, if they
ever canceled the zero, we're all in big trouble, you know?
So I went ahead and went into the house.
It was by the 0 and.

Within six months of my having bought my house, two of those rounds in Highlands

Ranch are the homes that I was looking at actually were cancelled because you know,
that comes up every four months.

So one of the things that the on demand service has helped with significantly is that
anxiety.

Oh, my God. What happens if the Roth is tied to my accessor? Ride Trip is cancelled.
Change something which could impact my ability to even use accessor ride.
And and just a final comment, when I first used.
On demand.

I you know, I had worked for the state of Colorado and I was using Accessoride and

I'd get off sometimes at 3:30 and not get picked up till five and get home at 7, which
really made for a long day. But the first time I used it.

Was like at a New Year's Eve party, and I could actually, you know, things started

getting weird. And I said, you know what? I want to go home and I could go home
and I could depend on a ride that would give me home within 15 minutes. So.
There's a lot to be said for this on demand.

I don't know why we're not paying for 50 at least, like we do for access.
But there is a lot to be said for having that option.
Fred Worthen 1:04:26
Thanks, Cindy.

Great to hear from you again. And I'm sure that we will be talking more.
I'll see you at future advisory committee meetings.

Attachment: Attachment E - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.16.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

spending that $58 per trip? So that's that's my first point.

Packet Pg. 421

Stuart Summers 1:04:35
Thank you.

Next in the queue phone number ending in 6263, you are recognized.
Fred Worthen 1:04:57
Phone number 6263.

Stuart Summers 1:05:04

We will come back to you. Looks like I'm not able to do so.

It's on your end, but 6263 will come back to you next in the queue is anaheet.
Anahit Labarre 1:05:20
Hey there.

Sorry, I was just writing to see if I could speak.
Thank you for giving me the opportunity.

So I am actually going to talk, as you know, for myself, but also for my students.

I am a blind individual with hearing loss which, as Cindy mentioned, is called deaf
blind so.

I can use buses until it comes to transfer, so when it is transferring from 1 bus to

another and crossing streets, that's when it gets complicated because with hearing.
Being lost.

You can't quite identify traffic as easily as if you did not have hearing loss, and I'm

sure what you are going to be hearing over and over again is how great the service is
and the service is great because it works. Somebody already said it, but you know.

During the pandemic, so many of our routes, our local route, only runs once an hour.
I one of the schools I work at is a 9 minute drive. For me it would take me.

An hour and a half on buses and I drill if everything goes on time and then as we
know, that doesn't happen nowadays due to late rail issues and all of that so.

I was very excited when I read the report about the accessor ride performance
improvement and now it is running 90% of the time on time.
Two of my students actually took access a ride in May.

To an event that we organized and it took them 2 1/2 hours to get to from Thomas
Jefferson High School to the Central Park and.

Needless to say, the restriction of accessorized drivers needing to drop you off at a

1.E.4.e

Packet Pg. 422

1.E.4.e

the park. We had to go find them, and I think one thing that is really important to
consider.

Is the kind of anxiety effect that these things cause. Yesterday I was very excited
when I read the statistics and I thought I'm gonna try it with my student.

So we requested accessorize to go to an event with my student yesterday.

The window was from 9:00 to 9:30 and 1:00 improvement that could be made. We
can only call after the window closes.

So which is great, we called at 9:31 because it was not there yet and they said
potentially.

If everything goes well, they can get a bus to us at 10:05.

Well, the ride was half hour ride and we were supposed to meet the rest of our
students at 10:15, so that wouldn't work. As you can tell now.

Here's what's important the IT was disappointing, honestly, because I am trying to
encourage the student as part of gaining more independence.
So when I talk about things I see.

Access on demand is a door to door or one location to the other.

Service when you talk about, you know, even accessor ride that doesn't go well or
bus transfers. We talk about real life problem solving skills and quite often in our
population, in the population that I work with.

That is where we run into trouble, because once the anxiety kicks in, the problem
solving skills that are there under normal circumstances.

Are no longer there and so this individual might as well, like if I wasn't there
yesterday, I don't know how this individual would have problem solved.

So we had to scramble and find another ride to get to the location where we had to
get and we had to cancel the access ride.

So those are the things that I really would love to keep in mind is that while we talk
about.

Improvement of Access ride performance.
The 10%.

Of things that still run late are real people in real situations and real anxiety so.

Just just a little feedback here in in those terms. And when you go to different cities
and you see my son is in Pittsburgh in college and the buses run every 15 minutes,
you don't even need a schedule. You just stand at the bus stop. They come so.
The more we cut buses, the fewer people who use it.

Attachment: Attachment E - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.16.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

particular place location, so they were dropped off at a completely opposite side of

Packet Pg. 423

1.E.4.e

So I guess what I'm saying is when we're looking at cost savings and all of that, all of
these things are to keep in mind, right?

Can we improve our public transportation?
That actually works.

And if the answer is no, then how can we make these resources more available?

Jobs that the population that we're talking about.

Have these are absolutely essential not only for financial purposes but for mental

health for well-being, because these people rely on the sense of purpose. I rely on
that sense of purpose. When I wake up in the morning, I want to be able to.

Be a productive contributor to the society, and honestly, if I didn't have this sort of.
I don't know if I could financially truly financially.

So anyway I I know I've said a lot, but all those points to consider and I do thank you
for the service.

There's tremendous and you know, the more brainstorming we can do. But I do want
us to consider all these aspects of, you know, mental health independence.
Human's well-being.

As well as problem solving skills.

The access rate doesn't show up when things don't go the way they were supposed
to, whereas you have a door to door service that works.
Fred Worthen 1:11:38
I think it's.
I.

I'm smiling a bit and I'm sure Gretchen is because.

The things that you've said, it sounds like you were listening to the conversation we
had earlier today.

Particularly with regard to some of the challenges and issues with the anxiety and
some of the things that stemmed from service delivery issues.

So appreciate those comments and I know we're running short on time, but I
appreciate the feedback.

Stuart, who's next in the question?
Stuart Summers 1:12:12

Yeah, we are running short on time.

Attachment: Attachment E - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.16.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

that those that aren't able to leave comments or or provide feedback during this
meeting. The different ways that you can provide that feedback following this
evening, next in the Qu.

I'm going to go back to 62631 more time and see if you are able to unmute yourself
and provide feedback.
OK.

Let's go to Kathy.

Kathy, you are recognized.
Katherine 1:13:04

Hi, my name is Catherine.

And I guess I just had a more logistical question about.

How feedback is actually integrated into the decision making process. It's been

wonderful to hear everyone's stories on this smaller scale, but I was wondering how
that transfers over and decisions that are made on a larger scale.
Fred Worthen 1:13:30

That's a a great question. You know, part of the feedback that we're doing is

customer surveys. And one of the things that we did is we asked a number of
different scenarios to try and help understand what's important to our riders.

So for example, you know there are many, many different things that could be of
importance to the customer.

Cost could be one time on board. A vehicle could be one.
Subsidy could be one.
There are whole.

A slew of things that could be important.

So when we start talking about trying to figure out what's important, the customers,
things like the feedback and the surveys would really come into play. I would not
want to recommend a $10 base fare when somebody, when the majority of the
customers are saying fair is very.

Important to me, I would rather have less trips or lower subsidy.
Than a $10 base fare.

So those types of the feedback that you're talking about is really going to help me
understand the priorities of our customers.

We have a little bit less than 15 minutes. I just put in the chat a few different ways

process, but they're also going to our final recommendations themselves.

And it's not just about access on demand. You know, I use that as an example, but
just like the previous.

Anaheim I believe it was said, you know, things about improving our services

themselves. We have a lot of opportunities you know to try and reduce the amount
of time that people spend on a vehicle.

I don't want anybody to be on a vehicle any longer than they have to.

So as we're developing new software right now, we start looking at the priorities of
our customers.

You know, with regard to scheduling an event and can we make adjustments to our
scheduling parameters to better meet those needs?

So it's a complex process, but it is something that we share all of our feedback with
our board.

We're making decisions based a lot on the feedback we're hearing, but ultimately,
even though I make recommendations, the Board of Directors will make policy
decisions.

I still have operational decisions.

In my control, but anything that is policy related, the board is going to hear.
Not only for me, but from you.
Katherine 1:15:49
Thank you.

So I will encourage these of those comments and feedback forms online.
Stuart Summers 1:15:50
Thanks Catherine.

Fred Worthen 1:15:54

entirety to the Board of Directors.

Today was actually our first day, so I just wanted to listen in and see what was
happening.

And it wasn't the best experience the driver showed up and.

Said if he would have known where we were located, he would have never took the
job because now he's only getting paid $29.00.
And he has to go clear across town again.
So I think it's a great service too.

I think it will be a great service accessor. I has caused my son a lot of stress. I guess
with that being said, I don't know how.
How do they train or how do they?

How do they let these drivers know?

Or how do they know what to do with certain people with disabilities?
Fred Worthen 1:17:35

Which one would you like to talk a little bit about? The Uber and Lyft train?
Gretchen Vidergar 1:17:38

Yeah, yeah, all of the training and and I would encourage everyone if you have

questions about this, to go to the Uber or Lyft websites to look at their training
profiles.

They are not trained to the same degree that an excessive ride driver would be.
But they are trained in how to work with people with disabilities.
You know globally.

So it is not a specific training.

They do not know that our, you know, they are not trained here in Denver for
specifically our customers that use access on demand.
It is the generalized Uber training that's provided.
And you know we.

That's. Yeah. It's not as extensive as what training they receive as an accessor ride
driver.

Mary Younger 1:18:33
OK.

I was just wondering what that was 'cause he's had problems with taxi drivers too, so
I was just wondering about that.

Just because today was our birthday.

But it's gonna relieve a lot of his stress from the the we did move out of the area.

And so I have been taking him places to get A to get picked up and sometimes it
takes him two hours more than two hours to get to where he.
Going so.

Works out. I I like hearing everybody's positive feedback on it, so I hope it does
workout.

Fred Worthen 1:19:12
Thank you, Mary.

Just a quick comment.
Mary Younger 1:19:13
Yeah.

Fred Worthen 1:19:15

I believe there are a lot of opportunities to improve service delivery.

We always work with our vendors and if you have suggestions on training

improvements, please use the form that Stuart has actually posted online and send
us your thoughts. And as we start moving forward, these things will definitely
explode. What we can do to help in those areas.
Mary Younger 1:19:37

OK, I always make sure I walk into the bus or to whatever just to make sure I can see
who the person is and everything 'cause. He's a little timid still about getting into
different cars so.

I'm an occupational therapist and I'm also visually impaired. And over the last year
I've been losing more of my vision.

Presently I'm not working full time, but you know I do PRN, which is as needed.

So I'd like to focus on the fact I think it's really important as a lot of people said in

terms of enhancing independence, it has been wonderful for me in 2007 when the
light rail came in, some of the routes and we live on a.

Route too, for the last 29 years that had a bus route on the next street, and now that
that was taken away when all the light rail.
S.

You know, they were filtering into, say, Alameda station.

Broadway station. So you know that changed things. I do want to mention some

safety things regarding this on demand service, which has been life saving due to the
fact that I've been losing more of my vision and I don't really have much vision at
night and I have.

Been followed and in terms of walking and so I have felt a lot safer being able to.
Get a ride from one place to another.
Whether it's work or something else.

And that the fact it really has made a difference in enhancing safety as well as just.

The other thing I just want to say about it is I realize that this is inexpensive

something that I can count on that I feel safe and comfort.

I honestly, I I know work off things money, but I saved a lot of money having the
ability to go get my groceries and ask for help when I get to the grocery store.

And being able to pick up my own groceries and do the simple life things have made
such a difference.

I mean, I lived in Arizona prior to this.

They also have paratransit, so I don't know if there's an opportunity to like how well

with a bunch of other paratransits I actually paid $4.00 at first, and then it graduated
to $6 and it was also via Uber ride as well.

And they actually held held similar meetings and when it went to six dollars, it was

$6 to me also seems affordable.

In a final report, we have one minute left.

Fred, are there any final comments that you would like to provide?
Fred Worthen 1:25:00

So I'll be very short and brief.

First and foremost, I appreciate everybody's comments and I apologize that we didn't
have time to get to everyone.

The feedback form though, is still open and I do encourage individuals who didn't
get a chance to speak, to provide feedback and service suggestions.

You know, we definitely want to hear them, but we also enjoy hearing your stories as
well because to me.

I became part of public transit because I grew up as a transit dependent individual.
My mom didn't drive.

My dad wasn't over the road truck driver, and I know what it's like to be relying on
trans transportation.

I started my career as a coach operator and worked my way through the ranks.

I'm Fred Wortham, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations.
0:48
I'm joined by Gretchen Vidigard, who is part of our ever faithful paratransit crew and our acting
manager of Paratransit Operations.
0:58
And we have Paul Hamilton, who was also our Senior Manager of Paratransit Operations.
1:04
I do ask that everyone keep their mic muted through the presentation or when you're not speaking.
1:11
When mics are unmuted we do hear feedback and sometimes it's distracting for others, so please do
keep your mics muted.

Stewart will talk about some rules when we go through the public question and answer session, but I
do ask that questions be held till we reach the end of the presentation itself.
1:35
With that being said, and we're also joined by Stuart Summers will help me with the presentation.
1:41
He's our Chief Communications and Engagement Officer.
1:44
Stuart will talk a little bit about customer outreach and engagement towards the end of the
presentation and then he'll moderate the Q&A for us at the end.
1:53
With that being said, Stuart, would you advance the slides please?
1:57
So today I'll briefly go over the Access right and Access on Demand program and I will talk a bit about
the peer review that was conducted by some industry panel experts.
2:10
We'll talk about some of their observations and recommendations and what that means for our
paratransit programs.
2:18
And then Stuart will talk about public outreach, next steps and our timeline moving forward.
2:24
Next slide please, one more.
2:28
So our paratransit program is really divided into two separate programs which we are really going to
talk about trying to integrate these programs more effectively later on.
2:41
But our Accessor Ride program is our ADA complementary paratransit service that is required
underneath of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
2:51
It supplements our fixed route services.
2:54
Customers who utilize Accessor Ride do pay a fare upfront when they board our vehicles and those
who use the service must meet criteria set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act.

3:08
I would also mention at this time, as you can see in the photo for those of you who can see the photo
that all of our RTD Accessoride vehicles are branded.
3:18
They are larger vehicles and they are 100% accessible.
3:23
We also have an access on demand program, which is a supplemental premium paratransit service.
3:29
It subsidizes our curb to curb taxi, it subsidizes our Accessoride program and it is a curb to curb taxi
and rideshare option.
3:39
It's available to current Accessoride customers.
3:43
RTD pays the 1st $25.00 of the trip and the remaining portion of the is paid by the customer.
3:49
Unlike the Accessoride program though, customers do not pay a fare upfront.
3:54
They only pay if the subsidy is exceeded and customers have the ability to take up to 60 trips per
month.
4:02
Next slide please.
4:05
So as a little bit of a background, Access on Demand actually began as a pilot project back in
December of 2020.
4:12
It was originally launched with four ZIP codes and limited times of day.
4:19
In April of 2021, wheelchair accessible vehicles were added and in mid-july of 2021, we also added
additional ZIP codes adjustments, more weight to the pilot program where we actually moved it to an
expansion of the full RTD service area in March of 2022.
4:43
And we also saw a boom in ridership in the access on demand during both of our Zero Fare for Better
Air initiatives in August of 2022 and July and August of 2023.

4:57
By January of 23, we launched the full program with two providers, Metro Taxi and Uber.
5:05
And later in the year, in March of 2023, we added two additional providers, Lyft and Z Trip.
5:14
Unfortunately later in the year we did find out that some individuals were utilizing a option on Uber
that was only allowed through Uber apps that allowed multi stops.
5:30
This was Gretchen can you check the mic muting please?
5:36
The the multi stop option was only available through Uber and unfortunately the multi stop option
was never intended to be used as part of the Access on Demand program.
5:51
Unfortunately, again, because the program was only available to a limited number of users, it created
a disparate treatment issue and an equal access issue as those who did not use Uber and used other
services could not access the multi stop option.
6:15
So a notice was sent to Uber issue to customers that multi stop was never intended to be an option
and it was not allowed.
6:26
And we have been monitoring to ensure that customers are not using that option at this point.
6:34
Next slide, and I did just talk about this one.
6:38
I'm sorry, I forgot that we had the slide in there.
6:41
Next slide, please.
6:45
So in February of 2024, our CEO announced his retirement and at that time, our CEO and General
Manager, Deborah Johnson asked that I assume leadership over our paratransit operations and our
service development.
7:05
I have an extensive background in the transit industry.

Attachment: Attachment F - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.18.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

1.E.4.f

Packet Pg. 438

7:08
I have managed 4 different paratransit and and on demand service services at four different properties
in the USI have been in the public transit space nearly 40 years now.
7:24
Deborah took a look at my background and the gap that we had and she asked me to lean into the
moment and assume leadership role in our paratransit operations.
7:35
As I began looking at our operations, it became aware pretty quickly that we had a lot of
opportunities to improve our accessorite and access on demand programs.
7:48
Our CEO and General Manager, Deborah Johnson commissioned the peer review through the
American Public Transit Association to come in and take a good look at our operations.
7:59
I think there are a lot of misconceptions about what a peer review are, so I will explain a little more
about what the peer review consisted of as we go through the next couple of slides.
8:11
In a nutshell though, after the American Public Transportation Association put together a a panel of
subject matter experts who are experts in paratransit operations to come in and take a look at our
operations and our services.
8:30
We put together a scope of work and compiled a panel and we began the the peer review in April of
2024.
8:43
The scope of work put together really was set on looking at the strengths, opportunities and potential
areas of improvement for our paratransit operations.
8:53
We did a lot of work in the background before our panelists actually came on site to our agency.
9:02
We sat down with the panel, they asked a lot of questions, asked for a lot of data and information,
information such as our standard operating procedures, things like eligibility, how our customer call
center works, and they went through hundreds of pages of documentation before they arrived on site.
9:24
In May of 2024, the panelists actually came on site.
9:28
They spent a full week here.

Attachment: Attachment F - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.18.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

1.E.4.f

Packet Pg. 439

9:30
They interviewed staff, contractors, paratransit customers and community stakeholders.
9:36
Next slide.
9:38
So as I mentioned, we put together a scope of work and there were three major areas of interest that
we asked the panel to focus on.
9:48
One was basically looking at other transit agencies and and looking at their demand response
programs and seeing just how efficient and effective they are and to recommend best practices that
would help with their own operations.
10:03
We also asked them to look at program parameters and look at responsible cost controls and sound
facing customer processes.
10:14
And we also asked him to review our software, hardware and other tools to ensure that optimal
service performance and program effectiveness is next slide please.
10:28
One more.
10:30
So the panel spent quite a bit of time front between May and August or July of 2024 looking at our
operations very holistically.
10:42
And basically they came back with recommendations that fit into three different buckets.
10:49
One of the major recommendations they had was to develop a clearly stated vision for paratransit to
to guide priorities and access a ride and access on demand services.
11:00
Although when Access on demand program was put together, it was meant to be a supplemental
program to our accessoride services.
11:09
What has happened is the two programs have become pretty much standalone programs.
11:15

Attachment: Attachment F - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.18.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

1.E.4.f

Packet Pg. 440

We have had a completely new market that has developed out of access on demand, which was not
the intention of the original program creation.
11:26
The panel also recommended that we refresh the access on demand program structure.
11:31
They definitely saw the growth.
11:36
Growth in the program is really not sustainable both fiscally and operationally.
11:43
And they recommended that we take a good look at a lot of the program parameters to create a
financially and operationally sustainable model.
11:52
And their final bucket was to leverage technology and process improvements to streamline daily work.
11:58
This is to help improve staff efficiency, reallocate staff to more impactful work, deliver better service
and reduce cost.
12:06
Next slide.
12:10
So one thing I would like to say is we we will talk a little more about the report recommendations and
we will give you a link where you can download the actual report.
12:22
But I would like to say that the panel of experts came in, they took a look at our operations and they
provided recommendations based upon what they believe are best practices.
12:33
However, there are always differences in how transit agencies operate.
12:40
So one of the things that we have to do is go through the recommendations and determinate what
works for us and what doesn't work for us.
12:48
There may be some recommendations that we take as is.
12:53
There may be some recommendations that we decide to modify based upon our local operating
environment and our fiscal constraints.

1.E.4.f

Packet Pg. 441

13:01
There may be some recommendations that we choose not to implement.
13:06
So I would say as the attorneys say, this is not fair to complete the report is not a done deal.
13:12
Part of the reason why we have outreach efforts going on right now is to try to determine what is the
best, best path forward based upon what the recommendations are and what our customer needs are.
13:26
The last thing I would say is that although operational control is completely within my purview, major
policy decisions need to go to our Board of directors for consideration.
13:38
So for example, if we decide to begin charging for access on demand upfront, that is a fair change
policy that would need to go to our Board of directors for consideration.
13:53
Next slide.
13:56
So as I mentioned, the final report was provided in August of 2024.
14:03
I've talked a little bit about some of the observations and recommendations.
14:07
The report can be found on rtd-denver.com/paris Paratransit dash peer dash review.
14:17
That's RTD Dash, denver.com/paratransit Dash, Peer Dash Review.
14:25
Sorry, it's a Friday.
14:27
I'm tired and it's been a long week.
14:30
Next slide, please.
14:31
So Stuart will talk about our next steps and our timelines and then after that we will open up the floor
for questions, comments, etcetera.

14:41
Go ahead, Stuart.
14:43
Thanks, Fred.
14:43
As introduced, I'm Stuart Summers, the Chief Communications and Engagement Officer, and I'll just
briefly touch on how we are engaging customers and soliciting feedback from our partner
organizations.
14:55
So we've put together a robust communication and outreach strategy that launched about six weeks
ago, and we're really wanting to hear from all of you and all of our paratransit customers.
15:05
And so in addition to today's meeting, we also have an online feedback form that is available on that
same web link that Fred mentioned.
15:14
And I also put a link to it in the chat and you can go on there and you can provide feedback using the
online feedback form.
15:21
All of the feedback that we received through that website will be compiled and shared with the board
of directors as they start to consider any of the recommendations and policy changes in the future.
15:33
So As for customers, this is the best way to provide feedback.
15:37
In addition, all of the feedback that's shared during today's meeting will be transcribed and shared
with the Board of directors as well.
15:44
Additionally, we're providing e-mail updates and so for all of our active customers, we've been
providing regular emails.
15:52
An additional e-mail will go out next week as well with some additional follow up.
15:56
And then the best way to stay up to date is to visit that web page that Fred mentioned and also the
link is in the chat.

16:02
We're providing updates.
16:04
We have answers to frequently asked questions on that web page and we'll continue to put a put out
some of the recommendations and information that we collect on that web page.
16:16
I mentioned the feedback form over the last month, we've had more than 400 individual submissions
on there.
16:22
We know there's a lot more customers that want to provide feedback.
16:25
And so as I mentioned, that is the best way to go and and provide feedback.
16:29
And once again, that web address is rtdhyphendenver.com/paratransit-, peer- review, and we'll put
that in the chat as well.
16:45
Now we're going to pivot to the feedback portion of today's meeting.
16:50
We have approximately 80 minutes left.
16:53
We have a hard stop at 10:00 AM.
16:56
And so for the next little more than an hour, staff will be able to take note of the feedback provided.
17:04
Fred and and his staff will also be available to answer questions that we may be able to provide a
response to, questions that we may not have an immediate answer to.
17:13
We'll take note and provide answers via the web page.
17:17
If you are calling into this morning's meeting, you can press *5 to raise your virtual hand.
17:23
We ask to make sure this is orderly, that people raise their virtual hands so that we can put you into
our line up into the queue.

Attachment: Attachment F - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.18.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

17:30
And then I will call on individuals and ask you to unmute yourself by pressing *6.
17:35
Or, if you're on a computer, you can simply unmute yourself using the space bar or clicking the
microphone icon.
17:42
In addition to today's meeting, I mentioned that you can provide feedback using the online form.
17:47
Customers are also always invited to call 303 299-6000.
17:54
That's RT DS customer Care line and our call center agents are available to take your feedback over
the phone.
18:01
They will transcribe that feedback and then provide it to staff to compile to the report that we're
providing to our RTD board of directors.
18:09
So if you are not able to provide feedback, you don't feel comfortable providing feedback during this
public forum, you're always welcome to call Customer Care at 29 at 303-299-6000.
18:21
We will be limiting feedback today to two minutes per customer just so we can get through
everybody that's in the lineup.
18:28
And I see a number of people are starting to raise their virtual hands.
18:31
So we will be limiting feedback to two minutes.
18:34
And I will be reminding people that throughout the comments.
18:38
And without further ado, yes, Fred, Stuart, if if I could say one other thing too.
18:43
We have had a number of public meetings to engage our customers.
18:50

Unfortunately, we have run out of time for a few of those meetings and not everyone was given an
opportunity to speak.
18:58
So I do have a favor to ask of those who have previously spoken.
19:05
If you have previously spoken, I would ask that you give others an opportunity to speak and hold your
feedback and request to speak to later on in the meeting to make sure that everybody has a time to
actually speak.
19:22
And I apologize, but we do have a hard stop at 10:00.
19:26
I have other back, back commitments, so I can't extend the meeting.
19:32
So if you would out of courtesy for others, if you have spoken, please allow others to speak first.
19:38
With that, I'll turn it back over to Stuart to moderate the floor.
19:43
All right, first in the queue, we have a phone number ending in 50305030.
19:50
You are recognized.
19:51
You can unmute yourself and you have two minutes.
20:06
5030, are you able to mute yourself?
20:13
It looks like you'll need to do it on your end.
20:15
There we go.
20:15
I see you've unmuted.
20:18
Can you hear me?

20:19
Yes, we can.
20:21
OK, sorry.
20:24
In the last public meeting, you guys had been asked what was the saving between those who are
using Assessor Ride on Demand versus those who are using Assessor Ride.
20:35
And then also I have comments based upon some things.
20:38
Recently I had a friend who was trying to get on the other day and wasn't able to talk, but we're
having issues with Accessoride.
20:48
Sorry I was outside and them not being on time.
20:53
Some of us work on government facilities and your drivers refuse a good majority of them if you can,
if they speak English, refuse to know how to follow instructions on how to get onto a petrol property
or state property for those of us who work on this.
21:08
And also assessor right doesn't always get there in time for us to provide the the services needed, you
know, like a 5 or 6:00 in the morning, get there on a time or whatever.
21:20
So assessor right on demand is a must for some of us or we run 24/7 locations we have to be able to
get to and from.
21:28
I am also one who lives really close to the end of one of the lines.
21:32
If you go a little bit farther, you you know you're not going to get to certain places.
21:37
My parents live in an area just on the outside of the 3/4 of a mile and my brother and my dad is all
disabled also.
21:48
So there are some major issues we see with Assassin Ride and I don't feel like your guys is forms have
actually really accomplished in seeing what we're doing now.

Packet Pg. 447

22:01
You guys can say that you guys want our feedback on the website and all that different stuff, but
some of us have tried to, some people have tried to speak up, but I don't feel like we're being really
heard, especially in the blind community just because our disability is not the same as someone else
who is in a wheelchair.
22:19
Assess a demand is better for us because we are able to actually have the option of sending where we
are to a friend or family member through the Uber or Lyft app.
22:31
Also, the other thing is, I'm sorry, but we've reached the the two-minute mark on this and we do need
to to give others an opportunity to speak.
22:42
With regard though to the accessor right issues that you are speaking to.
22:47
I will say that one of the issues that we had with past software was that we could only no, this is
correct.
22:54
The current software I understand, I understand.
22:59
And if you would please allow me to explain.
23:03
We are actually working on changing the existing software, the program parameters to be able to
handle the reservations differently.
23:18
So we're right now an individual is the on time performance is based strictly on pickup.
23:26
It's not based on drop off.
23:28
So if an individual is picked up at 9:00, if they have to be at work at 9:30, even if they're picked up at
9:00, they may not necessarily be dropped off on time.
23:39
We're modifying the software and the programs to be able to do an either an on time pickup window
or an on time drop off window, one or the other.
23:49

Unfortunately, we can't do both because of scheduling challenges and parameters, but being able to
to have options on what's important to a customer is something that we're working on itself.
24:07
Those are things though that will take some time.
24:11
And I would also say that even if we are receiving feedback right now, we can't always fix problems
immediately.
24:19
It does take some time to work on these things.
24:22
The other comment though is even though I do realize that individuals who have different disabilities
have different challenges, we are required under law to have equal access to our services.
24:35
So we do have to ensure that any services that we provide are of equal access to all of our customers.
24:43
With that, Stuart, next probably posting the 6:15 shall.
24:48
All right, next in the queue we have Sarah Lee book the ticket.
24:54
Hi, I have represented myself the last meeting and I'm representing Boulder County now because I
work in Boulder County.
25:04
I wanted to share that for unbanked and underbanked individuals, this is really difficult to provide a
payment upfront because by requiring a payment at the beginning, it's not making it accessible to
people without a credit card or people who are unbanked or underbanked.
25:29
It is creating additional barriers for those who are not strong in tech skills or are not as high
functioning.
25:37
With Accessoride, there's always an option to pay in cash, so access on demand should be the same
way.
25:43
As an idea, perhaps the 1st 10 rides are paid for up to $25, then the next 10 riders might cover a small
fee at the beginning.

25:53
The lack of reliability of accessoride makes it really hard for people who work and have appointments.
25:59
Having a small or limited number of trips available for access on Demand helps supplement that a
little bit.
26:08
Access on Demand also covers priority pickup with Lyft, which is an extra cost and a little bit
unnecessary.
26:15
Metro Taxi and Z Trip are almost entirely unusable, especially because of people for people in
wheelchairs because of the limited number of vehicles they have on the road.
26:24
I don't know anybody who's successfully been picked up by 1.
26:29
Thank you for your time and for listening, and I'm gonna stop now so other people have the chance.
26:35
Thanks, Sarah.
26:35
Appreciate the comments.
26:37
With regards to fair payments, I do realize the comments about the wheelchairs and those are some
of the things that we're working on.
26:45
Those who do who are able to pay with cash, Metro and Z Ride do take cash themselves.
26:56
However, you would have to call, I believe you would have to call through our call center to book a
ride that way.
27:03
That is one option, but we are looking at if a fair is implemented other ways that a fair payment could
be supplemented.
27:11
So thank you for your comments and good to see you again.

Thank you, Sarah.
27:18
Next in the queue we have phone number ending in 11921192.
27:24
You are recognized I'm the one with 1192 number, correct?
27:35
Yeah, I First off, the couple of comments, one is the accessoride would be really, I haven't used it a lot,
but I have used it all Accessoride I use all the time.
27:48
But the excess on the man, I haven't used that much because I I had to get recertified so that I had to
redo all that.
27:56
But but my other comment is, and this one I think is screwy when you guys move the flex ride deal
from the drivers being able to schedule to RTD there.
28:09
And all you people can do is look at your computer and there's no way you can manipulate rides or
anything.
28:15
But was it when the drivers had it?
28:17
They could go, yeah, well we can get you now.
28:19
It might be a little bit of a wait, but we will get you in and map this way.
28:24
I had one where I I started to get in and I know it was going to be 3 hours before they could even get
me.
28:31
And then what time I made-up my mind that that one had went away.
28:35
So, so that that's one of the biggest things I think you guys need to do is give it back to the individual
companies as you're, you know, is doing the flex ride that, but also I like the access on demand
because that gives me another option.

28:55
And like the other day.
28:56
The other thing is I think your dispatch people access a ride need to use a little more common sense
because I was an hour late getting to my place Wednesday because a driver had not showed up.
29:07
So they were adding extra runs to the driver I was with and for that reason it put me in an hour late.
29:16
OK.
29:17
I'm not sure I have to talk with staff about some of your concerns because we have not changed our
dispatch center operations for some time.
29:30
They are contract operated.
29:32
The dispatch center is not operated by RTD.
29:35
So but I've heard your concerns and staff is on and we'll look into that one.

30:05
Yes, we can hear you.
30:06
Yes, yes, I'm both the accessory right and accessory demand on demand customer.
30:12
And I can echo some of the feedback of the first woman who spoke that my workplace is just outside
of the area.
30:20
So I have to take the access on demand to get to and from my workplace.
30:26
I personally, I, I could pay a few bucks for excess on demand.
30:31
I remember when I first started, it was a $2.00 minimum that we paid and I was using it.
30:38
If you start charging more than that, it might add up to, to, to a lot more.
30:42
Like I saw 650 on the survey.
30:44
That's a lot.
30:45
Another aspect that I don't think anyone's mentioned is that we, most people, I mean, tip the drivers.
30:50
So I always tip the driver because if we don't tip the Uber driver, I don't know if they're going to
continue to want to drive and that's going to drop away.
31:00
So it's always more for the customer, at least for me, because I always tip them.
31:06
The excess Arai I sometimes take, but I've also experienced the long waits.
31:11
I also can't like use it easily to go to a doctor's appointment where the doctor's appointment is only
an hour.

31:17
But if I take access to ride, like they give me a window where I have to get there really early and I
could be picked up really late and then I could be riding on it.
31:25
One time I was riding on it for like 2 hours when it could have just taken me home.
31:30
I know there's other customers and other things they're doing that make it long, but that's prohibitive.
31:37
I mean it it also I could have back pain if I have to sit for two hours on the bus without moving.
31:43
So that makes me want to use the excess on demand more frequently.
31:49
So that's that's my feedback.
31:51
Thank you.
31:52
Thank you.
31:52
I appreciate that.

32:13
Yeah, this is 1470.
32:15
Thank you.
32:16
I've been using the service since about 09, I think it is and have really appreciated it.
32:23
I've had all the same problems with the, you know, the excessive bus and so on and being late and so
on.
32:29
But I've really appreciated the access on demand.
32:32
I haven't used it, you know, extensively extensively because I'm not working now and I could certainly
afford to pay more.
32:40
And I think one of the problems, if I understand it right, is that people are trying to do stops when
they use that on demand.
32:47
Is that right?
32:49
The multi stop was one of the challenges that we had.
32:52
Yes, yes.
32:54
So isn't that something we can just, can we just eliminate that and, or, or how does that work?
33:03
I mean, if that could be eliminated, would that help you financially?
33:06
Because this is a financial problem, right?
33:10
It, it is.

33:10
And unfortunately, because it is a, a option that is offered by Uber, we cannot force them to disable
the option.
33:19
It is something that they offer to other clienteles outside of access on demand.
33:26
So it something that's outside of our control.
33:29
We have to manage those things.
33:32
We have to track everything manually to make sure individuals are not use using that.
33:38
OK, but how can we help financially?
33:41
I mean, what can we do to make this?
33:43
Are we in danger of losing this all together?
33:46
No.
33:48
OK, so if we if we can pay more, what if we can pay more and and we do, is that help?
33:56
I also always tip.
33:57
I know some people feel they can't afford to, but I always make sure that I tip and of course you don't
tip the access bus, but I mean the on demand people I always tip and but is there what, what can we
do as clients to help you?
34:12
Well, I appreciate the call and our time has ended on your particular comments.
34:17
But I will say that what individuals are giving us feedback right now on is what is helping us
understand what our riders priorities are.

34:29
I as I've said in other meetings, we are going to have to make modifications to the access on demand
program to make it sustainable and operationally fiscal.
34:40
The program started out with about 7500 riders a month or 7500 trips per month.
34:48
Gretchen's running in the background.
34:52
The program has grown from 7500 trips a month to 65,000 trips per month.
34:58
It has grown from a monthly cost of about $75,000 a month to one point to about $1,000,000 a
month.
35:06
So if we don't do something to make the program sustainable, then we will be in danger of losing the
program.
35:14
The biggest thing that everybody can do right now is Share your story with me and tell me what's
important to you.
35:21
As I've said in past meetings, I am not going to put in a $10 fare as a upfront requirement if fare is the
most important thing to our customers.
35:33
Instead, we may look at other options like reducing the number of trips or possibly reducing the
subsidy cap or doing other things to help control some of the cost itself.
35:45
But helping me understand what's important to all of you is important for me when I start working on
recommendations for program changes.
35:55
Yeah, well, we just don't want to lose it.
35:57
We don't want to lose it, especially these people that are working, you know, so I, I appreciate it and I
don't want to lose it.
36:03
And thank you for this program.

36:48
So yeah, I've also used obviously I've used accessorized, you know, but I use access on demand fairly
often as well.
36:57
I just want to say I, I really do like the program.
36:59
I'm a couple of concerns that I have in regards to the survey really quickly.
37:04
R1, they said that there's a possibility that they would not service outside of the accessorized service
area anymore, which would still be in the RTD boundary, but they would no longer service outside of
the accessorized service area.
37:21
And a concern I have really quickly is I have doctors that are not in the accessorized service area, but
that are within the RTD boundaries.
37:29
And I can't always have my insurance company take me.
37:33
So it's really helpful to have access on demand for independence because I'm not willing to give them
up to see other doctors that are closer.
37:40
It's just not even a question or option.
37:43
So I really would appreciate if we would keep that within RTD boundary.
37:48
And I'm willing to pay a little bit extra outside of service area, but 10 to $12.00 would be unreasonable
for somebody that's on a fixed income.
37:56
So I do want to bring that up really quickly.
37:59
And also just to keep in mind for within the service area, if you do want to charge a, a fee, which is
understandable, please don't try to charge access the right service fees or or higher as they were
recommending.

I think it'd be better to lower the trip thresholds and try to charge higher charges for like what what
the survey was recommending for even within service boundaries.
38:23
But I just want to make that comment clear.
38:25
And thank you all so much for holding a space for us.
38:29
Thank you, appreciate the feedback.
38:31
And again, those are the types of things that are really valuable to me is to hear what's important to
you.

Thank you guys so much for putting this on and we do appreciate everybody that works at RTD and
Paratransits and everything that you guys do, at least on my behalf.
39:11
First thing is, yes, this program is extremely important because of the bus routes.
39:16
And like I only work 12 miles away, but because I work so far towards Parker, it takes me like 2 1/2
hours just each way to get there by bus.
39:29
And then if the bus is late, then I have to wait at downtown Tech Tech Center for an extra 30 minutes
for the next bus, then that puts me late.

39:39
And then it's very hard for a person with a disability to access.
39:44
On demand is so much more important because when we do have to travel 2-3 hours one way by
public transportation, there's not a public restroom easily readily available at stops for people to go
use.
39:59
And so as a blind individual.
40:01
Somebody may not be able to find their way to that bathroom or that closest bathroom.
40:06
And so excess on demand is also extremely important.
40:10
Also, I'd like to add, you know, maybe you guys could do 30 rides a month for free and then the other
30 rides could be 3 to $5 upfront pay.
40:23
So I, I didn't know if anybody had mentioned something like that because I did see how you guys did
the different prices for 30, 40 and 50 rides.
40:32
So maybe you guys could do that too or at or implement that in instead.
40:38
And thank you for your time.
40:40
Thank you 086.

40:52
I have used access to ride and excess on demand primarily.
40:59
Now I use access on demand because access to ride could take on average like 4 hours round trip.
41:06
For a 40 minute appointment I had at most 5 1/2 hours round trip for a 40 minute appointment and
that just takes my entire day.
41:16
With having access on demand, I've been able to start treatments that I otherwise would not be have
time to be able to do if I only had access a ride.
41:29
So being able to pursue other medical treatments has been really important to me.
41:35
I have on average about 7 doctor's appointments a week and so having a number of rides available is
important, but also it does need to be affordable.
41:49
The other issues that I would have with the accessor ride buses is that I have instability throughout my
entire spine and I would on multiple occasions have times where the drivers just aren't careful while
they're driving and I would catch air.
42:07
My entire body would be suspended in the seat by just going over a bump and that would put me
into a flare up for at least a week and cause me a lot of pain and make the appointment that I just
went to trying to put my body back together completely a waste of time.
42:27
So being able to have access to being able to get around in a timely manner has been really
important as well as the affordability of it.
42:40
I remember the $2.00 before that you had to pay upfront and something like that I think is totally fine.
42:47
But the six to 10 to $12.00 is a bit much.
42:54
But I have really appreciated having access on demand.
42:57
It's, it's been a huge change in quality of life for me.

Thank you, Roy, appreciate it.
43:04
As a little bit of feedback for you though, one of the recommendations from the peer review report
was to look at our fleet mix and fleet composition itself.
43:14
And I do realize that the, the challenges that you're talking about with your spinal challenges and the
pain, one of the, the issues that the peer review brought up was that we should look at, we do still
need to keep some of the, the larger paratransit type vehicles that we have, but look at more of a fleet
mix that has sedans, smaller vans and smaller wheelchair accessible vehicles itself.
43:48
That helps us with providing more comfort to our customers and it also helps reduce our operational
cost.
43:56
The the paratransit type vans are very expensive.
44:01
The cost has grown to close to $150,000 apiece now, whereas we can buy a sedan for a very nice
sedan for less than 1/3 of that cost.
44:13
But I appreciate again that type of feedback.

Beaver, you are recognized for two minutes.
44:34
OK, Thank you very much for having this program.
44:39
I had a recent experience just yesterday where my accessoride arrived, well, half hour out of the
window, but when when she got there, the door wouldn't open and so the van was unable to load me
on.
45:02
And so she called dispatch and tried to see if there was another van close by that could pick me up.
45:10
They told her no, that the only alternative that I had was to wait until they got a a van all the way from
Commerce City to go out to Wadsworth and Morrison Rd.
45:23
And so I it was like about 2:30 in the afternoon.
45:27
I figured that'd take at least an hour to get somebody over there.
45:31
So I my friend Jamie Lewis, who's the director, I called him and he advised me to give Gretchen a call
and see if we could get something done.
45:45
So I did.
45:46
I called Gretchen and I got to talk to her voicemail, but apparently she took action and there was a van
showed up 20 minutes later with the passenger and took me all the way home.
46:01
So I just learned today lesson to this program that the dispatch is a contracted business.
46:09
Well, I think dispatch is one of the weakest links in the whole chain with with RTD and an access ride.
46:18
So take a look at that.
46:19
And again, Gretchen, thank you very much for making that happen.

46:34
So I just wanted to let you know that.
46:37
And I checked with them to make sure you had gotten anywhere, but I was unfortunately out of the
office at one of these meetings when you called and dispatch took care of you.
46:49
But thanks for your thanks for your comments, Joe and I do apologize.
46:53
You know, our on time performance has improved a lot on Accessoride.
46:59
A little over a year ago, the on time pickup window, we had about a 7577% on time performance.
47:08
That's risen to 90% and above, which is a step in the right direction.
47:13
But unfortunately, when you're in that 10% where a vehicle doesn't show up or less, it still impacts

Access on demand programs.
48:22
I know that you guys are dealing with a lot of different types of situations to help make these
programs sustainable.
48:29

And I appreciate the the equity part behind everything that you guys are doing to provide transit
services for those who are most affected by the RTD program, specifically those who are blind,
disabled, use wheelchairs, those type of things.
48:50
So I want to let you know that I'm entirely grateful for a program such as the Access on Demand
program.
48:57
As I'm listening to other people speak this morning, one of the things that I was going to talk about
was, you know, how RTD can revamp or look at their fleet that was just mentioned a little while ago
and to how, you know, other types of vehicles can help make these programs more effective and more
efficient.
49:21
The other one is other types of of policies and guidance to help people that are doing with the same
day concerned people getting stranded because a vehicle isn't operating effectively or isn't operating
at all to where maybe RTD can have a standby personnel that isn't you know on route or anything like
that.
49:50
But when the situation comes up that there is a bus or vehicle ready to come and assist somebody
because of technical difficulties or maintenance or whatever the vehicle difficulty is.
50:05
Finally, my last bit of feedback is I just asked that RTD take into consideration on how to align their
costs and prices across all RTD transportation.
50:24
You know, everybody here, we all have different types of monthly pay.
50:31
You know, some of us are on fix some of us, you know, make decent money, but we shouldn't just
look at one person's situation that this should all be taken into consideration how this infects all of the
the population.
50:44
So just to make sure that those kind of align.
50:47
So it's not fair unfair to anybody else.
50:52
You know, making sure that we're sorry, am I at time?
50:56
We are at time.

51:08
We actually do that, what they're called loop extras.
51:11
I don't know why they're called that, but what we do is we station buses and high activity center areas.
51:20
So if a bus breaks down or something happens, we can dispatch a vehicle pretty quickly.
51:26
So I appreciate the ideas.
51:27
And again, these are, this is a big part of the reason why we're having these listening sessions is
because we're getting a lot of great ideas.

And so the top end of the number rides to 60 is less important to him.
52:33
And even for the 35 or so that he takes, I would say a small co-pay is acceptable.
52:40
I mean, given that he has intellectual challenges, he's not very good with money, but we help him.
52:46
And if there was a small co-pay like it's like there used to be, in our view, that would be OK because it

has dramatically changed his mobility, not just for his part time work, but for his socialization and his
sense of independence.
53:04
It's just shocking how much mobility he has gained by use of this Uber, Lyft.
53:10
It's, it's just, it's a, it's like night and day.
53:13
So I wouldn't want to lose that at all.
53:16
And I would emphasize not just work, but social outings, just the freedom.
53:20
And he lives in a host home.
53:22
So we're not and it's not real close to us, but not super far.
53:26
And not having access to those social opportunities would be a real, a real downer.
53:33
Also, he doesn't tip.
53:34
I heard some other comments about tipping and he tipped 400% one time.
53:39
So now he's no longer allowed to tip.
53:41
I'm sure the driver appreciated that, but he's no longer allowed to tip and he's no longer doubt
allowed to take Uber Black.
53:48
But if we've gotten through some of those things, and I would just, we, we tried Metro Taxi before he
enrolled in the excess on demand and it was an abject failure, left him stranded in the dark a handful
of times, not a lot, but three or four times.
54:05
And he's just not safe being in the dark by himself.

And so if Metro hasn't changed their stripes in the last couple of years, that's just not an option for us.
54:16
But thank you for thank you for your time.
54:18
Thank you.

My daughter rides currently the Assessor ride bus and has been the other service.
54:52
Assessor Assess on demand is not an option for her because of safety issues on her part.
54:59
But I want to thank you for what you're doing.
55:03
She's currently with Assessor ride and the subscription so that's been working better for her and what
she has to do with her work and her program.

Perfect.
55:17
Before the subscription the bus was late.
55:21
It just we weren't connecting at all.
55:24
So I appreciate having that service very much.
55:28
One thing that I'd like to ask is with the tickets, are you ever going to consider a tin ride the tickets like
they used to be instead of 6 tickets on in a book, rather you have 6 tickets in a book rather than I think
you had 10 before.
55:50
Is that ever going to come back or you know, I don't have the history on that, so I can't answer that
question at this point.
55:59
But I do hear that you're asking to go back to that.
56:04
Sorry, I'm taking notes while I'm trying to talk at the same time.
56:08
So I will make note and try to get a little more history on that.
56:13
OK, Thank you.
56:15
Yeah, that's what I want to say.
56:16
One other, one other thing is to be able to talk to a supervisor if we need, if we're having some issues
with a bus driver or what have you.
56:28
That has kind of been a problem.

I think you had Larry as the manager now.

There's someone there now, but it wasn't very professional person that I spoke with.
56:43
So, yeah.
56:45
OK.
56:46
Well, I appreciate the feedback and I'm glad that the subscription trips are working for working for
you and your family.
56:57
Sorry.
56:58
Taking notes.

Thank you so much for listening to us today.

I appreciate that.
57:18
My experience with excess ride on the van was just so frustrating because I would have to like plan to
have two to three hours on either side of what I was doing in a day, which meant that I was leaving my
house maybe a maximum of once a day to do things.

57:37
So then with effect on demand, I know I can leave my house at a certain time and arrive at a
destination at a certain time.
57:44
And it's opened up so much for me.
57:47
I can do, I can do more professionally, I can do more socially, I can just do so much more.
57:54
And I know the program is expensive, but like, I think there's like an untold benefit that wouldn't, we
wouldn't be able to measure exactly.
58:04
But like so many more disabled people are participating in communities and having jobs and being
able to go out with their friends.
58:14
And that's contributing to the local economy in ways that we can't exactly measure.
58:19
But I think that is really important.
58:22
Also, it's really great to hear that you're considering other types of vehicles.
58:27
I've used paratransit in other cities in the US and being able to ride in a sedan or a small wheelchair
accessible van is so much more comfortable than the access ride van.
58:42
So yes, those are my thoughts.
58:46
Thank you so much for listening to us today.
58:50
Thank you, Maggie.
58:51
On the newer vans that are larger, we are looking at a different suspension system to improve the
comfort on those particular vehicles.
59:02

Attachment: Attachment F - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.18.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

1.E.4.f

Packet Pg. 474

And those will never completely go away because we do have large groups that we do need to
transport.
59:08
But we are looking at passenger comfort across the board at ways that we can work on those things.
59:14
Appreciate the comments.
59:15
Thank you.
59:17
All right, Next, yeah, next in the queue we have phone number ending in 58075807.
59:24
You are recognized and can a mute yourself for two minutes.
59:29
We can we can hear you.
59:31
OK.
59:32
My question is, since the excess on demand was created to help ease the burden from Accessoride
and I see the ridership has gone way up for the excess on demand.
59:43
Have you seen like when you talk about the cost of the whole program, any savings or less demand or
need for access a ride because certain population is taking excess on demand?
59:57
Actually, no, it it's hard.
1:00:02
It's always hard to say you know who a new rider is versus who a.
1:00:08
Previous user is who has changed behaviors, but we do know that we have a whole new market of
riders who have never used Accessoride before, who are using access on demand.
1:00:21
We also know that our ridership on Accessoride has not changed dramatically.
1:00:28

Attachment: Attachment F - RTD Paratransit Public Meeting Transcript 10.18.24 (5030 : Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps)

1.E.4.f

Packet Pg. 475

So I can't say that it hasn't done anything to relieve the stress or relieve the cost, but I can say that a
whole new market has developed and that some of the goals of the original program aren't being
met, which is part of the reason why we are looking at some modifications to the program itself.
1:00:52
Was it different when you were charging like the $2.00 entrance fee for the excess on demand back
two years ago?
1:00:59
Was it their savings?
1:01:00
Then there's always, you know, some savings whenever we have individuals who shift their behavior.
1:01:11
But at the same point, we have to be careful that we don't allow a program to grow to the point
where it is not operationally or fiscally sustainable.
1:01:22
The excessive cab was not growing at that rate, but access on demand is growing to the point where it
isn't sustainable.
1:01:33
OK, Yeah, Well, I guess maybe it would be good to get a reason why.
1:01:37
I mean, is it all the new riders or is it people changing their behavior?
1:01:41
Because I still use accessoride sometimes.
1:01:45
But it's just like for everyone else who's saying that the length of the time waiting for it, the length of
the time riding on it, sometimes the unreliability it, it does make me want to take excessive demand
more.
1:01:58
And I was hoping that when excessive demand started, that all accessorised is going to be, becomes
so much more timely.
1:02:04
And when I do order it, it's going to work.
1:02:06
And I haven't seen that, unfortunately.

1:02:09
So I, I was wondering maybe go ahead.
1:02:12
No, I, I'm sorry, we're, we're, we've hit the two-minute mark.
1:02:16
But I I think that going back to your comments and to others too, and I have said this publicly at
several meetings now, the Americans with Disabilities Act was implemented in 19903534 years ago.
1:02:37
The program the Americans with Disabilities Act has.
1:02:42
There have been some court rulings that have changed some things, but reality is most paratransit
systems and services are still operating the same way as they were when the Americans with
Disabilities Act was implemented in 1990.
1:02:58
We haven't kept pace with the times.
1:03:01
And a lot of what we're looking at now, part of the reason why new programs like Access on Demand
are popping up is to help with some of those challenges.
1:03:10
But we have a lot of opportunities to improve or access a ride operations above and beyond what the
original requirements of the law were.
1:03:19
I guess what I'm saying is, is that ADA hasn't kept pace with the time and this is part of the reason why
we're looking at our programs.
1:03:27
Even though Access on demand has been a lot of the comments itself, I am not strictly focused on
access on demand.
1:03:36
I'm really working on improving a lot of the things that I'm hearing people talk about.
1:03:42
So I appreciate those comments.
1:03:43
I appreciate the feedback.

We have about a little less than 25 minutes left in the meeting.
1:03:53
Also, all of the feedback that is being provided via the chat feature in this meeting, we are collecting
all that feedback and we'll include it as well with the transcription from today's meeting.
1:04:03
So just want to make note of that.
1:04:04
If if somebody did not feel comfortable providing verbal comments, they can provide them via the
chat feature as well.
1:04:12
Next in the queue, we have phone number ending in 08810881.

1:04:32
I think people are making a lot of excellent points.
1:04:34
I hope you all are realizing the theme here that a lot of people are working and a lot of people are
going to doctor's offices.
1:04:42
In terms of working such as myself, I, I, I have such a small window to get to work between the
building opens and for, for me to start work.

1:04:51
And so there's no possible way that access to ride itself can meet my requirements.
1:04:58
I think that there are a large number of of disabled people in the different area because of CCB, which
does absolutely contribute to the economy.
1:05:07
People going tax paying, going to work, things that are are are are really important.
1:05:12
Like somebody mentioned earlier that aren't quite able to be measured, but I think we know that, you
know, we go out, we go.
1:05:18
So I took over here to the grocery store where I am to get groceries.
1:05:23
I think one thing, you know, when my time was that I really want to emphasize is that I believe it was
Deborah Johnson who said we need to make the the program equal because the general public can't
use it.
1:05:33
Well, the general public can easily look at a bus route and say, OK, where do I want to go?
1:05:37
The general public can stand at a busy bus stop where 456 different buses are coming and be able to
flag their bus down because they don't always stop.
1:05:45
The general public can look out the window and see where I am and they don't have to rely on the
bus announcements to know where they are.
1:05:52
Uber and active on demand is the thing that really changed the game that gave people independence
and the opportunity to go out.
1:05:59
And I know that you are not trying to take it away.
1:06:01
I don't want that.
1:06:02
Nobody wants that.

But in all this really, truly, like, listen to what everyone is saying because I'll be honest with you, I, I, I
don't feel like you are truly hearing what people are saying to say that I need to be able to get out of
my house.
1:06:14
I don't have six extra hours instead waiting on a bus.
1:06:19
We don't have it.
1:06:20
A lot of people cannot afford these co-pays.
1:06:23
I'll end on this.
1:06:25
A lot of disabled people truly cannot afford to be disabled when they are on a fixed income, when we
don't have the amount of employment options that other non disabled people do and in terms of
housing, food, all these things are happening.
1:06:37
Cannot truly afford our disability ourselves.

1:06:57
There are one there's a few things that I I do think everyone needs to understand.
1:07:03
Public transportation has limitations across the board, and even though an individual can go out and
stand on a bus stop, that doesn't necessarily mean they won't have to spend two or three hours on a
vehicle going from one end of the district to another.
1:07:20
Those are options that are not available to the general writing public.
1:07:25
I do understand the need.
1:07:26
I do understand the concern, but I look at this through multiple lenses because I have to look at all of
the clientele that I serve.
1:07:36
And my goal is to provide equal access to everyone, regardless of any factors themselves.
1:07:45
My goal is to provide equal access to everyone.
1:07:49
Stewart, who's next?
1:07:52

I also used to work for a transit company in Iowa.
1:08:07
I am a wheelchair user.
1:08:09
And personally, I would love to see low floor buses implemented.
1:08:16
I don't know if they're conducive to like highway travel, but I think it could really cut down with people
with vision impairments and just people in wheelchairs.
1:08:30
Because when the lift, you know, because there's no lift, then the ramp, you can easily manually
deploy a ramp.
1:08:39
And then that's just fewer steps for blind individuals.
1:08:45
And it's just easier if something breaks, then you don't have to wait for a whole nother lift bus.
1:08:53
But yeah, I think the fleet changing would be really helpful.
1:08:59
And then the other comments I have is that I can either with both access a ride and on demand, I can
almost never get a wheelchair accessible vehicle past five or 6:00 PM.
1:09:16
And I like to go out and do things until possibly like midnight.
1:09:22
I can take a regular Uber with a manual wheelchair, but if I want to use my power chair, I have to have
a wheelchair acceptable vehicle.
1:09:33
And I absolutely love the on demand and I wish there was possibly more vehicles that were wheelchair
accessible with on with the Uber on demand past a certain time at night.
1:09:50
Yeah, those are my comments.
1:09:52

1:10:13
We are working our current contracts and I won't say too much, but our current contracts, we have
about a year left with our providers.
1:10:24
One of the things though that we are looking at is ways to incentivize riders to make more wheelchair
vehicles available and I do understand the concerns and constraints around that.

I would like to suggest working with Uber and Lyft to provide access on demand by voice recognition.

access on demand.

Were you wanting to provide an additional comment?
1:11:32
Yes, it'd just take 30 seconds.
1:11:34
OK.
1:11:37
So one other thing I wanted to mention is like the routes, I don't, I don't know how the routes are
planned, but I did have an experience on the accessorized van where I went from downtown Denver
to Golden and I had an appointment in Lakewood, right?
1:11:53
So we drove past Lakewood and got a person and then drove back to downtown Denver, drove past
Lakewood again and dropped that person off and then dropped me off.
1:12:03
And I was like, why would they go past the thing twice?
1:12:09
It's another frustration with the with the time spent on the van.
1:12:13
So just that.
1:12:15

1:12:43
What are your guys's plans because you guys said that it's becoming like 65,000 rides a month and it
is so much more expensive.
1:12:52
What are your guys's plans to hire more drivers now create all the bus stops that used to be 1/2 hour
that are now an hour wait.
1:13:02
How do you guys plan on cutting or making that that much better and also access a ride to like let's
say cut down on 30,000 rides per month the chain are you are you asking about fixed route services
when you're talking about people power?

1:13:22
So like so so so that's a that's a great question.
1:13:25
The plans yeah.
1:13:27
So just if that was one of the plans you guys had, how do you guys plan on implementing that and
how do you plan on implementing that?
1:13:33
Excessive ride rides are faster and more thorough, just like us taking access on demand to get to and
from places.
1:13:45
So great questions and I appreciate them.
1:13:50
Since I am over all of the rubber tire services, I can actually speak to your questions pretty well.
1:13:58
With regard to Fig Trout services, we actually have 80 operators in training right now.
1:14:05
We made some adjustments to our recruitment efforts this year.
1:14:10
I've partnered with our HR individuals and in the past our human resource staff was very limited and
there were times where people were applying and their application wasn't getting attention for some
time.
1:14:26
And by the time HR was able to get to them, individuals that already found other jobs.
1:14:34
So this year I partnered with our HR department and I actually hired a recruitment specialist strictly for
bus operations and her job is to get to every application that comes through our queue within 72
hours for the most case.
1:14:52
Most cases she's actually calling people back within 24 hours and she is getting people scheduled in
interviews, getting tests and getting all the preliminary work done almost same day rather than
waiting weeks and losing individuals.

1:15:21
As a result, we're adding close to 100,000 hours worth of Revenue Service in January between our bus
and trains.
1:15:30
So we have a pretty aggressive growth plan to to start restoring our fixed route services based on our
comprehensive operational analysis.
1:15:43
With regard to Accessoride itself, as I've mentioned, we have a new software provider Q Ride.
1:15:51
One of the things that we're working on is optimizing the software and how it performs itself, trying to
get away from some of these challenges that individuals have talked about where they're having to
book two or three trips out and spend a lot of time on board a vehicle.
1:16:11
I've been personally meeting with the president of of Q Ride every other week, working on a lot of
enhancements.
1:16:19
We have a lot of things in the queue.
1:16:22
I will say though, that even though we have a lot of things on queue, those things take time.
1:16:29
Sorry, I'm getting feedback.
1:16:38
There we go.
1:16:39
We do have a lot of things in the queue for software enhancements, but as is the case with software
development, it will take some time to get those things in in queue.

1:16:51
But the other component is, is we're reshaping and rethinking how we look at Accessoride as a whole.
1:16:57
The comments that we're hearing right now are helpful to us to help reshape those visions, but we
want to bring the Accessoride more into modern day era, not continue to provide services that were
built 35 years ago.
1:17:16
Thank you for the comments, Shane.
1:17:19
I know we have a few more callers and we're down to about 10 minutes.
1:17:22
So Stuart, you want to.
1:17:25
Yeah.
1:17:25
Next in the queue we have phone number ending in 11921192.
1:17:31
You are recognized for two minutes.
1:17:39
My other thing is I and your training, you need to teach accessorize drivers how to drive a little better
because there's been more than once they hit speed bumps real fast or they hit potholes or, or the,
you know, the gutter ends and I've come out of the seat more at once.
1:17:56
Thank goodness I've got a seat belt on.
1:18:00
So I, when you, when you're training drivers and stuff, you need to teach them how to drive or to
recognize or, or drive better by recognizing things ahead of time.
1:18:13
So they're not, Oh well, putting people in danger by making them come up off the seats.
1:18:23
All right, Thank you, Sir.
1:18:24
My comment.

You are recognized.
1:18:52
OK, sorry, can you hear me?
1:18:55
Yeah, you can.
1:18:56
OK, perfect.
1:18:58
Well, yeah, like other people said, you know, I truly appreciate all you do.
1:19:04
Kind of freaking out now because I really hope that this service will continue the access on demand
service.
1:19:12
It's been a lifesaver for me.
1:19:14
Like, you know, I work everyday full time.
1:19:17
You know, I used to lie, rely on people to take me to my work and you know, like I feel like I'm, you

So as as Stuart had mentioned a little bit earlier, we're going through the customer feedback loop
right now to hear from our customers and writers who what they would like to see and what their
needs are.
1:19:56
I will be working with my team once we close the public feedback process to look at the surveys that
we've collected, the customer feedback.
1:20:08
And start compiling some recommendations and some programmatic changes.
1:20:13
We intend to go to the board of directors next month with the preview of of some of the the changes
that we are considering itself.
1:20:26
So we should have some recommendations public.
1:20:33
Well, I would say late October, early November, we'll start having some recommendations that we'll
be able to share with the public itself.
1:20:45
Brad, do you also want to emphasize that I, I know earlier in your presentation that this isn't a
complete, we're not trying to get rid of access on demand.
1:20:55
I think that may be one of the concerns that this is an effort to try and discontinue the program.
1:21:01
Do you want to reemphasize that again?
1:21:03
Yeah, no thank.
1:21:05
Thank you for that, Stuart.
1:21:07
My, my goal and staff's goal is to provide services that are equitable and accessible to everyone.
1:21:16
And I recognize that Access on demand can fill a need that our accessoride cannot.
1:21:22
Right now, I have no goals and neither is any of my staff to make Access on demand go away.

1:21:31
The reality is, is the reason we're going through this feedback right now is to preserve the program.
1:21:37
I will be 100% honest, we are a government agency.
1:21:41
We have limited funding and we have to make sure that programs that we have in place are
operationally and fiscally sustainable and at the rate that the program is growing right now, we will be
at risk if we do not make modifications.
1:21:59
That is not our goal to make these programs go away.
1:22:03
Our goal is to find some middle ground where we find a program that is operational and fiscally
sustainable, but still meets the majority of our customer needs.
1:22:14
So thanks for that reminder, Stuart.
1:22:17
And I know we're down to about 5 minutes and we still have some additional callers and individuals in
the queue.
1:22:25
So we'll try to get everybody in before we close out.
1:22:28
Yeah, it looks like we have 3 remaining.
1:22:30
So let's try and get through these three before the 10:00 AM heart stop.
1:22:33
So first Gabriel, you are recognized.
1:22:37
So that was gonna be my question.
1:22:39
When can access on demand customers expect changes to the current program?
1:22:45
Changes to the current program are on a little different timeline.

1:22:48
One of the things that we do recognize is that if I make a recommendation or a change, if I implement
it tomorrow, your life is going to be extremely disrupted.
1:23:03
So our goal is to actually work through the spring on changes, give everybody an opportunity to
adopt and adjust and plan for any programmatic changes that occurred.
1:23:18
Our goal right now and our timeline is to implement the changes in May of 2025.
1:23:24
That gives everybody, you know, roughly seven months from now to make adjustments to whatever
impacts there are from our, our programmatic explanation changes themselves.
1:23:39
So even though we'll be talking to the board about what our recommendations are next month,
whatever is adopted, we don't foresee coming into effect prior to our May service changes and they
will go into play in alignment with our bus and train service changes.
1:24:03
All right, next, next in the queue, 50305030, you are recognized.
1:24:09
Go ahead, my zero look 30, you're unmuted.
1:24:27
5030, we'll come back to you after Isaac.
1:24:31
Isaac, you are recognized for two minutes.
1:24:36
Yeah.
1:24:36
So thank you for taking the time to meet with us today and I did have several concerns.
1:24:44
So what would you say to say employees who, who a may live outside the may work outside of the
ADA service zone?
1:24:55
Because I know there are some and I heard that there might be a possibility of increase introducing
some sort of premium fee.

1:25:03
And my concern is that that might stifle innovation because whether you're blind or or have a
disability or not doing that might, might, might not be sustainable.
1:25:17
And if and it might be harder for a blind and low or otherwise disabled persons to look for
employment and especially with big companies who make their employees sign sign non compete
agreements and that which can be quite problematic for the individual.
1:25:35
And 2nd I have a suggestion.
1:25:37
I'm not sure what your what your reception might be to this, but for Uber customers at least there is if
you subscribe to the premium service, it can save either the customer or by extension RTD anywhere
from 5 to 20% on rides.
1:25:56
And not not to mention the 6% cash back that customers get.
1:26:01
So say if you take an 18 dollar ride with all of with all of these, depending on the amount of credits
you have on average I see it costing anywhere down from $18.00 to $11.00.
1:26:16
So my, my question would would be, would you be open to just requiring users to subscribe to their
premium service, but leave the other program parameters intact?
1:26:31
I appreciate the feedback, Isaac there.
1:26:35
You know, of course, there's always legal issues around requiring certain things.
1:26:40
That is something that I would have to discuss with our legal team.
1:26:44
But I do appreciate the idea and it is something that we will explore further.
1:26:50
Let's go back to one last caller.
1:26:53
Yeah, let's try and see if 5030 is able to mute themselves and speak.

1:26:58
OK, can you hear me?
1:27:00
We can.
1:27:01
OK, sorry about that.
1:27:03
I was muted on my phone and my screen wouldn't turn over.
1:27:07
So my additional comments would be is that you guys were mentioning the additional rides on Uber
and Lyft because Uber and Lyft both do those and that should be available to all of us.
1:27:19
In addition, because one, it saves RTDA ton of money because every time Uber and Lyft do a ride, you
have to pay all those additional fees to even start a ride.
1:27:31
So that would actually save RTD money by allowing for that.
1:27:34
If you guys want access a ride and assess a demand to look a little bit the same, then maybe we
should need to look at having assess a ride, be able to have rides the day of versus having to pre
schedule them.
1:27:47
But like everybody said, none of us want to be on the bus or have to be out for 10 hours.
1:27:53
We just want to be able to get to and from where we need to be safely.
1:27:57
Also, I am not going to go and drop off my ballot and then have to do a whole new Uber ride or go to
the post office because that makes absolutely no sense to stand in front of a mailbox or a ballot box
for 30 minutes or, you know, ten, 20-30 minutes just because you have to get a whole new ride
because you cannot have multiple stops.
1:28:19
That is allowed for the general public.
1:28:21
It should also be allowed for us.

1:28:23
Also in addition, Uber and Lyft do or Uber does allows for people to do shared rides.
1:28:30
If someone wanting to do a shared ride, there shouldn't be a problem with allowing for people to do
shared rides if it's more.
1:28:35
If it's cheaper, it'd be cheaper for SSM demand also be cheaper for the other.
1:28:39
The gentleman just mentioned about the whole Uber premium thing.
1:28:44
I think that there is an issue with that.
1:28:46
I think that those credits should be allowed, especially for those of us who pay 10 to $15 very much on
almost every single ride to get to and from where because we do not want to be on the bus for three
hours on the regular one or on a Sessa ride should be allowed to use our credits over and above and
then or for any additional rides that we need that month.
1:29:14
Because a lot of us are paying.
1:29:16
Some people pay into that.
1:29:18
They should be able to use those in a necessity necessary basis especially so many of us are very
limited on our income.
1:29:27
So those are a couple of my.
1:29:29
So we've reached the end of our time and I appreciate the comments itself.
1:29:35
I do want to say though, I do understand convenience, but I also understand that things like multi
stop are not available to other individuals.
1:29:48
We can't provide those through Metro taxi, we cannot provide those through Z ride and we cannot
provide those on access ride and a general customer cannot do that either.

When a bus comes to a stop, they drop you off, you have to wait for the next bus.
1:30:04
When a train comes, you have to wait for the next train.
1:30:07
I do understand convenience, but again, my job and my goal is equal access to everyone.
1:30:18
With that being said, I do appreciate everybody's comments.
1:30:22
I appreciate everybody's time.
1:30:24
Thank you, Stuart, for moderating the session.
1:30:27
I also do want to thank everyone for your for your courtesy that you've given to me.
1:30:34
I know that these are very passionate issues for all of you and I do understand that this touches your
life.
1:30:42
I started my life as a transit dependent person.
1:30:46
Growing up, my mom didn't drive a car and my dad was gone over the road and we were completely
dependent upon local bus services and we lived in a small town.
1:30:59
I had to ride Greyhound and Trailways into major towns whenever we wanted to go anywhere.
1:31:05
I understand that this impacts your lives and we're doing everything we can to minimize those impacts
and improve our services across the board, but I do appreciate all of the courtesy that you've
extended to me as well as we've gone through these meetings.
1:31:22
This is our last public meeting for this round, so we will be taking all of your feedback into
consideration as we move forward with looking at policy and program changes.
1:31:34
And again, as Stuart mentioned, we will also share all of your feedback with our Board of Directors.

Atlantis Community Meeting
Wednesday, October 17, 2024
201 S. Cherokee, Denver
1 – 2:30 p.m.
RTD staff in attendance included Fred Worthen, Paul Hamilton, Gretchen Vidergar, and Joni
Hardy. Stuart Summers moderated the Zoom meeting remotely. In total, there were 18
members from the public in attendance. Due to the in-person nature of the meeting and
intermittent internet connection issues, a full meeting transcript is not available.
Meeting Summary: Staff provided an overview of RTD’s paratransit services and outlined the
findings and recommendations from the Paratransit Peer Review. Additionally, staff emphasized
that no final decisions have been made and the purpose of the meeting was to solicit feedback
and answer questions. Approximately 60 minutes were spent answering multiple operationalrelated questions and listening to customer feedback about Access-a-Ride and Access-onDemand programs. Specifically, the following comments were noted by staff.
Debra: Expressed support for the services.
Courtney: Expressed concerns about the safety of the Uber and Lyft drivers and the
inappropriate behavior, questions, and general curiosity (albeit inappropriately requested) that
frequently makes her feel uncomfortable. She indicated that she does report these incidents to
the providers (typically Lyft). She was advised to look into the education that the drivers
participate in, and it was acknowledged that training as specific as that provided by Access-aRide was not possible on that scale. It was also offered that she could report to RTD, as well,
and the agency would investigate/promote investigation by provider.
Catherine: Expressed how important services are--not only to individuals who utilize them, but
to the greater community--in that they allow people to be employed who, without
transportation, would not be able to.
Curtis: Expressed support for the services.
Dominic: Expressed support for the services.
Catrice: Gretchen had been communicating with Catrice about specific individual questions.
Specifically, conversations have ensued related to a client that needed access to the customer
portal, as well as enrollment for Access-on-Demand.
