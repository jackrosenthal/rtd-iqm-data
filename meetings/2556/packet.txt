Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of sales tax
revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to retire certain
outstanding obligations; providing for other matters related to such bonds and the security therefor; and
approving the execution and delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.
BACKGROUND:
The Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) was established in 2008 to implement and
direct construction and improvements for the Denver Union Station Project. DUSPA is governed by a
Board of Directors comprised of appointed members from the Regional Transportation District, the
City of Denver, DRCOG, and CDOT.
In 2010, RTD entered a funding agreement with DUSPA as part of the plan of finance related to the
design, construction and renovation of the Denver Union Station project area. The funding
agreement was in the form of a bond payment from RTD to DUSPA in the amount of approximately
$12 million per year at an interest rate of 5.85% (RTD/DUSPA Bond). As a result, DUSPA was able
to use the RTD revenue along with other available revenue sources to obtain a Railroad Rehabilitation
& Improvement Financing (RRIF) loan and Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act
(TIFIA) loan from the US Department of Transportation.
In October 2016, the DUSPA Board issued a Request for Proposals for refinancing the outstanding
DUSPA loans. DUSPA received seven responses which were reviewed by the DUSPA Board, its
financial advisor, PFM and staff from RTD and the City and County of Denver. The best proposal
was deemed to have come from a collaboration between Piper Jaffray and BBVA Compass Bank.
The proposal offers financial benefit to RTD, the City and County of Denver as well as DUSPA.
This action item discusses the refinancing of the RTD/DUSPA bond to achieve a reduction in interest
payments for RTD.
DISSCUSSION:
With the current low interest rate environment the opportunity to refinance for interest savings is
available in relation to the RTD/DUSPA bond. RTD has the opportunity to refinance the 2010
RTD/DUSPA bond with RTD FasTracks bonds and realize a substantial savings in interest payments.

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

The Bond Resolution requires a minimum of 3% savings which allows some flexibility in regards to
changes in interest rates between now and the date the bonds are sold. The potential savings from
a refunding of the RTD/DUSPA Bond exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD.
Consequently, staff has assembled a financing team and prepared documentation to be in a position
to take advantage of the opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest expense.
Due to the unique nature of the RTD/DUSPA Bond and the fact that there are multiple stakeholders
including DUSPA and the City and County of Denver, the exact timing of this transaction will be
dependent on the ability of all involved parties to coordinate a simultaneous closing, as required by
the RRIF and TIFIA loans. It is expected that this will be achievable during the first half of 2017.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
bonds, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a preliminary
official statement, bond indenture, continuing disclosure agreement, bond purchase agreement and
the Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. The Board is being requested, through the Resolution to
authorize the issuance, to establish the terms and to approve agreements required in connection with
the issuance of the Bonds.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Bond Resolution including the Bond Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are
available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and
Butler Snow LLP as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Bonds will be underwritten by a team
including Piper Jaffray, Stifel Nicholaus, Harvestons Securities and DA Davidson.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding bonds are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out
of Bond proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and
printing fees.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2017, authorizing the issuance of sales tax revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional
Transportation District (Colorado) to retire certain outstanding obligations; providing for other
matters related to such bonds and the security therefor; and approving the execution and
delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series
of 2017, authorizing the issuance of sales tax revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the
Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to retire certain outstanding obligations; providing
for other matters related to such bonds and the security therefor; and approving the execution
and delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

Subject:

Refunding 2007A FT Bonds

CFO/AGM,

Date: December 8, 2016

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of sales tax
revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to refund certain
outstanding FasTrack Bonds; providing for other matters related to such Bonds and the security
therefor; and approving the execution and delivery of certain documents in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.
BACKGROUND:
In 2007, RTD issued its Series 2007A FasTracks bonds to refinance a portion of the Series 2006A
FasTracks bonds. The original proceeds from this financing were used to partially fund construction
of various FasTracks projects including, US36, West Line and EAGLE.
This action item discusses the refinancing of a portion of the currently outstanding Series 2007A
FasTracks bonds to achieve a reduction in interest payments.
DISSCUSSION:
RTD issued its $363.725 million Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project) Series 2007A (the
“2007 Bonds”) in 2007 for the purpose of refinancing a portion of the Series 2006A FasTracks
bonds for interest savings. In 2007, interest rates were such that the District refunded $363.725
million of the $600 million 2006A Bonds to capture $11.373 million in present value savings
(3.122% of principal of refunded bonds).
With the current low interest rate environment and the approaching November 1, 2017 call date on
the series 2007A bonds, the opportunity to refinance for interest savings is available. RTD has the
opportunity to advance refund a portion of the outstanding 2007A Bonds to realize, subject to
market movement, a savings of approximately $5.8 million (4.2% of principal of refunded bonds) on
a tax-exempt basis. The Bond Resolution requires a minimum of 3% savings which allows some
flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between now and the date the bonds are sold. The
2007A Bonds are callable November 1, 2017 at par.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that, such savings are net
of a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the refunding bonds at a return equal to
the interest rate on the new bonds, and (b) the length of time between the sale of the refunding
bonds and optional redemption date of the 2007 Bonds (“Negative Arbitrage”). Absent a change in
interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a reduction in time

Packet Pg. 20

1.B.2

proceeds of the refunding bonds must be invested prior to redeeming the 2007 Bonds. Despite the
cost associated with the Negative Arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the 2007
Bonds exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has assembled a
financing team and commenced documentation to be in a position to take advantage of the
opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest expense.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
bonds, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a preliminary
official statement, bond indenture, continuing disclosure agreement, bond purchase agreement and
the Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. The Board is being requested, through the Resolution to
authorize the issuance, to establish the terms and to approve agreements required in connection with
the issuance of the Bonds.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Bond Resolution including the Bond Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are
available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and
Butler Snow LLP as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Bonds will be underwritten by a team
including Morgan Stanley, US Bancorp, Loop Capital, Harvestons Securities and George K Baum.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding bonds are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out
of Bond proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and
printing fees.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2017, authorizing the issuance of sales tax revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional
Transportation District (Colorado) to refund certain outstanding FasTrack Bonds; providing for
other matters related to such Bonds and the security therefor; and approving the execution
and delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2017, authorizing the issuance of sales tax revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional
Transportation District (Colorado) to refund certain outstanding FasTrack Bonds; providing for
other matters related to such Bonds and the security therefor; and approving the execution and
delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. This is
not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the interest expense savings
currently available to the District.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather

Date:

December 7, 2016

Subject:

Refunding 2002A COP

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 8, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the execution and delivery
by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and related documents in connection with the refinancing
of the 2002A transit vehicle project.
BACKGROUND:
In 2002, RTD issued its Series 2002A certificates of participation (COPs) to finance 34 new Siemens
light rail vehicles and partially fund the Elati light rail maintenance facility. The amount financed in
2002 was $132,000,000. The COPs are callable at par on November 1, 2017 and final payment is
scheduled to occur in 2022.
The remaining outstanding balance of the COPs is currently $71,400,000 and the interest rate being
paid ranges from 4.5%-5.0%.
The approaching call date and current low interest rate environment have created an opportunity to
refinance the 2002A COPs to realize a reduction in interest payments.
DISSCUSSION:
RTD has the potential to advance-refund a portion of the remaining outstanding Series 2002A COPs
to realize, subject to market movement, a savings of approximately $4.86 million (6.81% of principal
of refunded COPs). RTD Board Policy and the Resolution require a minimum of 3% savings which
allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between now and the date the new
interest rate is locked.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that such savings are net
of a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the new financing at a return equal to
the interest expense of the new financing, and (b) the length of time between the execution of the
new financing and the November 1, 2017 call date of the 2002A COPs (negative arbitrage). Absent
a change in interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a reduction
in time proceeds of the new financing must be invested prior to redeeming the 2002A COPs.
Despite the cost associated with the negative arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the
2002A COPs exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has
assembled a financing team and commenced documentation to be in a position to take advantage of
the opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest expense.

Packet Pg. 37

1.B.3

RTD typically uses COPs to finance vehicles when the budget cannot accommodate the use of cash
to acquire the necessary vehicles, as was the case in 2002. In this case, staff received an attractive
proposal from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for the use of lease financing to refinance the Series
2002A Certificates of Participation. As a response to this proposal, staff solicited similar proposals
from the banks in RTD’s underwriter pool. Five responses were received and reviewed by staff and
RTD’s financial advisor. It was determined that the JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. proposal offered the
most value to RTD.
Benefits of the JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. proposal include interest rates competitive with a
refinancing of the 2002A COPs with new COPs, a call option for RTD after just 12 months and the
ability to avoid the cost of obtaining credit ratings.
The Board is being requested through the Resolution to authorize the refinancing of the Series 2002A
COPs through an annually appropriated capital lease through JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A.
Drafts of documents including the Lease Purchase Agreement, Escrow Agreement, Purchase and
Assignment Agreement are available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company as independent financial advisors and Butler
Snow LLP as Bond Counsel, in regard to the transaction. The lender in this transaction will be
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds. These costs include financial advisory, attorney and miscellaneous costs. The final
payment year of the new financing will not exceed the final payment year of the existing Series
2002A COPs.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2016, authorizing the execution and delivery by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and
related documents in connection with the refinancing of the 2002A transit vehicle project.
This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents; including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2016 authorizing the execution and delivery by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and
related documents in connection with the refinancing of the 2002A transit vehicle project. This
is not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the interest expense savings
currently available to the District.

is in the best interests of the inhabitants of the District and the Board hereby authorizes and
approves the same.

1.B.3.a

Section 7.
No General Obligation Debt. No provision of this Resolution, the
Lease or the Assignment Agreement shall be construed as creating or constituting a general
obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within
the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision, nor a mandatory charge or requirement
against the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year. The District
shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to the Assignment Agreement except
in connection with the payment of the Base Rentals (as defined in the Lease) and certain other
payments under the Lease, which payments may be terminated by the District in accordance with
the provisions of the Lease. Neither the Lease nor the Assignment Agreement shall constitute a
mandatory charge or requirement of the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then
current fiscal year or constitute or give rise to a general obligation or other indebtedness or
multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within the meaning of any constitutional
or statutory debt limitation and shall not constitute a multiple fiscal year direct or indirect
District debt or other financial obligation whatsoever. No provision of the Lease or the

Assignment Agreement shall directly or indirectly obligate the District to make any payments
beyond those budgeted and appropriated for the District’s then current fiscal year.

Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized
pursuant to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair rental value of the 2016A Leased Property and do
not exceed a reasonable amount so as to place the District under an economic compulsion to
renew the Lease or to exercise its option to purchase the 2016A Leased Property pursuant to the
Lease. The Board hereby determines and declares that the period during which the District has
an option to purchase the 2016A Leased Property (i.e., the entire maximum term of the Lease)
does not exceed the useful life of the 2016A Leased Property.
Section 9.
Exercise of Option; Direction to 2002A Trustee. In the event that
the General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer determines to proceed with the Refunding
Project and executes a Sale Certificate in accordance with the provisions set forth herein, the
Board hereby elects and hereby declares its intent to exercise on the behalf and in the name of
the District its option to purchase all of the 2002A Leased Property in accordance with the terms
and provisions of the 2002A Master Lease and to redeem all of the 2002A Certificates (the
“Refunded Certificates”), on December 1, 2017 at a redemption price equal to the principal
amount thereof plus accrued interest thereon to the redemption date or maturity date, without
premium, or as otherwise set forth in the Sale Certificate related to the Refunding Project. Upon
the execution of the Sale Certificate related to the Refunding Project, the District hereby
irrevocably instructs the 2002A Trustee to give notice of refunding and defeasance to the Owners
of the Refunded Certificates in accordance with the provisions of the Sale Certificate, the 2002A
Indenture and the Escrow Agreement.

Section 10.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 1157-209 of the Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District
acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of any amounts due under the Lease or the Assignment Agreement. Such recourse shall
not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or otherwise,
whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law, enforcement of penalty, or otherwise.
By the acceptance of the Assignment Agreement and as a part of the consideration of its sale or
purchase, any person purchasing or selling the Assignment Agreement specifically waives any
such recourse.
Section 11.
Repealer. All bylaws, orders and resolutions of the District, or
parts thereof, inconsistent with this Resolution or with any of the documents hereby approved are
hereby repealed to the extent only of such inconsistency. This repealer shall not be construed as

provision of this Resolution or the documents hereby authorized and approved (other than
provisions as to the payment of Base Rentals by the District during the Lease Term, provisions
for the quiet enjoyment of the 2016A Leased Property by the District during the Lease Term and
provisions for the conveyance of the 2016A Leased Property to the District under the conditions
provided in the Lease) shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity
or unenforceability of such section, subsection, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect
any of the remaining provisions of this Resolution or such documents, the intent being that the
same are severable.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather
Copp,
Administration

Date:

December 7, 2016

Subject:

Update to the 2017 Quarterly Performance
Report

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 8, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt updated 2017 Quarterly Performance Measures to include measures for ridership,
fare revenue, total operating revenue, and commuter rail.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
The year-to-date performance measures provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it
provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within its mission statement
objectives. In 2017, 41 performance measures will be tracked for the GM.
When the 2017 performance measures were adopted by the Board in April 2016, it was stated
the following measures would be established by the financial plans inherent in the 2017 Adopted
Budget. These measures are as follows:
Goal 3.1 – Increase Ridership
It is recommended that the overall ridership increase for 2017 be established at 6.8%. This
assumes all ridership growth will come from FasTracks as the Base System ridership estimate for
2017 is flat over 2016. This is an annual measure.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
It is recommended that the fare revenue increase for 2017 be established at 15.5%. This is the
percentage increase in total fare revenue in the 2017 Adopted Budget over the 2016 projection.
The increase is driven by increased ridership in FasTracks as Base System ridership and fare
revenue are kept flat in 2017. This is an annual measure.
It is recommended that the total operating revenue increase for 2017 be established at 15.9%.
This is the percentage increase in total operating revenue in the 2017 Adopted Budget over the
2016 projection, which takes into account minor items of operating revenue such as advertising,
joint venture, parking, and other miscellaneous revenue. This is an annual measure.
Goal 6.4 – Monitor Selected Internal Functions for Efficiency
The goal for annual audits is changed for 2017 from the number of audits to the percentage
completion of the Annual Audit Plan per Board approval on 11/29/16. The goal for percentage
completion is 100%.
Commuter Rail
It was noted when the 2017 Performance Measures were adopted by the Board in April 2016 that
a performance protocol was being developed for commuter rail linked to the concessionaire
agreement with DTP and that measures to be tracked in 2017 would be brought to the Board at a
later date for review. The following measurement criteria have been developed:

Packet Pg. 48

1.B.4

Goal 1.5 – Reduce the Number of Commuter Rail Accidents
It is recommended that a new goal be added to measure the number of reportable preventable
commuter rail accidents per 100,000 train miles. The measure is the same as for light rail in
preceding Goal 1.4.
Goal 3.1 – Maintain System-Wide On Time Performance
It is recommended that a goal for commuter rail be added of 90.0% which is the same as light rail
on-time service. The on-time definition for commuter rail is departure from a location no more
than 0 minutes early or 5 minutes after the scheduled departure time.
Goal 3.2 – Maintain System-Wide Service Availability
It is recommended that a goal for commuter rail be added of 97.0% which is lower than light rail
service available because of additional FRA requirements that must be followed to bring commuter rail
cars into service. The measure is calculated as actual car miles operated divided by total scheduled
car miles.

Subject:

Approval of Financial Advisor Selection

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 8, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to First
Southwest, a division of Hill Top Securities to act as financial advisor (and Municipal Advisor as
defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) not to exceed $600,000 over a maximum of 5
years.
BACKGROUND:
Financial advisor services are necessary to complete the issuance and refinancing of bonds and
certificates of participation. Their services help RTD achieve the lowest cost of capital available in
the market by providing guidance on appropriate pricing of bonds and certificates of participation and
assisting in the management of credit rating agency relations. Additionally, investment banks are no
longer allowed to discuss financing or refinancing ideas with local governments unless the local
government has retained a Municipal Advisor as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission.
DISSCUSSION:
In October 2016, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for financial advisory services. Proposals
were received from three firms and the proposals were reviewed by a review committee of 5 RTD
employees. The three firms that responded to RTD’s RFP included First Southwest, PFM and George
K. Baum.
Proposals were reviewed by the review committee and judged based on a best value to RTD basis.
It was determined that the First Southwest proposal offered the most value to RTD.
Benefits of the First Southwest proposal include an in depth understanding the existing RTD capital
structure, existing RTD debt and other financial obligations, constraints and priorities of RTD. The
Fees of all three proposals were judged to be competitive with each other.
The Board is being requested through the Resolution to authorize the General Manager to execute all
documents necessary to award a contract to First Southwest, a division of Hill Top Securities to act
as financial advisor (and Municipal Advisor as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) to
RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the contract will be paid for with local funds. The contract will be for three
years with two optional one-year extensions. The cost of the contract for a full five years would be

Packet Pg. 60

1.B.5

$600,000 ($120,000 per year). The funding for the contract was included in the 2017 adopted
budget, SBP and APE.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to
First Southwest, a division of Hill Top Securities to act as financial advisor (and Municipal
Advisor as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) to RTD.
This is the
recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a
contract to First Southwest, a division of Hill Top Securities to act as financial advisor (and
Municipal Advisor as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) to RTD. This is not the
recommended action as it would not allow RTD to continue to manage it take advantage of
the interest expense savings currently available to the District.

Subject:

Naming Rights Implementation

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 8, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
approve transferring $144,000 from the Board Appropriated Reserve to the Naming Rights
Implementation Project for signage and the 2016 commission to WME/ IMG.
BACKGROUND
On August 18, 2015, see attached, the Board of Director’s approved the sponsorship naming right
agreement with the University of Colorado for the sponsorship naming rights on the A line and an
exterior advertising position on the Flatiron Flyer for a five-year period with a mutually agreed upon right
to extend this agreement for an additional five years.
Over the initial five-year period, RTD would receive a gross amount of $5,000,696.
It was
recommended that the revenue from this contract be placed in the Board Appropriated Reserve. In the
first year of the agreement, a portion of the funds would be utilized for the implementation and
activation of the naming rights partner benefits including signage and updating of collateral materials. In
addition, the agent WME/IMG is entitled per contract to an annual payment of 12% of gross revenues.
DISCUSSION
The request will fund signs and the 2016 WME/ IMG commission. Attached as an addendum to this
report is the engineering diagram for the proposed signs. This design has been arrived at following
discussions with project engineers and facilities management staff about other options such as: signs on
railing, signs on windscreens and/or banners on light poles at each station platform; all of which resulted
in uncovering the fact that these other options did not meet engineering specifications for max wind
load [creating safety concerns] and being in conflict with RTD’s Art in Transit program.
These standalone signs are intended to be placed near the leading end of the platform in the direction of
travel. [e.g. western end of the west bound side and eastern end of the eastbound side]. There are to be
(2) signs per station [one per platform]. Content for these signs will be created by Univ. of Colorado.
RTD is responsible for the initial installation and maintenance. CU will responsible for subsequent
content changes; up to 4 changes per year per the rights and benefits associated with the naming rights
agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact as those funds were placed in the Board Appropriated Fund to pay for
implementation and activation of the naming right partner benefits including signage and updating of
collateral materials. The agent WME/IMG is entitled to an annual payment of 12% of gross revenue.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the staff’s recommendation and complete the installation of signage and pay the annual
commission.

Packet Pg. 62

1.B.6

2. Do not accept the staff’s recommendation. If we don’t complete our requirements under
the contract it will jeopardize the ability to receive the remaining funds estimated at
approximately $4.5 million.

Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

Subject:

Audit Charter

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Amended Audit Charter.
BACKGROUND
The Audit Charter is a formal document that defines the audit division’s activity, purpose, authority and
responsibility. It establishes Audit’s position within the organization, including reporting relationship
with the Board, authorizes access to records, personnel and physical properties relevant to performance
of engagements and defines the scope of audit activities. Final approval of the Audit Charter resides
with the Board.
DISCUSSION
The Audit function is engaged in Internal Audits and IT Audits, using either one of the function names
excludes the other so Audit will henceforth be referred to as RTD Audit, to be all inclusive.
The Scope of work has been expanded to include IT Audits and Investigations both of which Audit has
engaged in, but were not included in the previous Audit Charter.
The Independence and Accountability changes include adding the governing body for IT Auditing Information Systems Audit and Control Association, ISACA and eliminating the administrative reporting
requirement in line with the change of reporting responsibility to the General Manager and CEO, effective
January 2017.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
None.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors approves the attached amended Audit Charter.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the amended Audit Charter. This action
is not recommended. RTD Audit is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity
designed to add value and improve RTD's operations. The Audit Charter provides the foundation
upon which the Audit Activity is based; without which Audit could be deprived of independence
and objectivity.

Subject:

Annual Audit Plan 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Annual Audit Plan for 2017.
BACKGROUND
The Annual Audit Plan has historically been approved by the General Manager and CEO and the Board of
Directors.
DISCUSSION
The Annual Audit Plan for 2017 includes several IT Audits and Internal Audits. The plan also includes
Follow-up Audits and a section containing Audit Requests that have not been prioritized for 2017.
The Annual Audit Plan is based on estimates of the time to complete the audits. As in past years it
utilizes every available business day. If time becomes available during the year Audit will refer to the
Board for approval of audits to be included as replacements.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
None.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the Annual Audit Plan as presented. This is the recommended action. This will allow
Audit to complete the audit process in a timely manner.
2. Do not approve the Annual Audit Plan. This is not recommended. This Audit Plan was developed
after carefully selecting audits according to their potential to improve RTD’s policies and
procedures and contribute to the Goals and Objectives of the District. Delaying approval could
limit the days available for auditing and thereby reduce overall audit presence in the District.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT
AUDIT REPORT # 16-03-02

The Communications Department is comprised of the three following Divisions as
described in RTD documents:
 Marketing - develops, designs, and implements proactive marketing, digital
communications and special event strategies for internal and external audiences that
create and enhance widespread positive awareness of RTD and its image; and
educates, informs, and promotes the use of RTD products, services, and programs.


Public Information/Public Relations (PI/PR) - communicates the progress and benefits
of the multi-billion dollar FasTracks transit expansion program. Also keeps RTD’s
internal and external audiences informed and engaged about the agency’s services,
programs and projects.



Customer Care - fosters public trust by providing comprehensive and accurate
information, while enhancing and developing innovative platforms for customer
engagement.

As a result of the significant expansion of rail lines over the past several years, additional
‘temporary’ staff have been utilized in various RTD Divisions, including Marketing and
also Public Relations/Public Information (PR/PI). Such employees are either contracted
through an approved Staffing Agency, or may be hired directly into RTD as Project
Employees, with an agreed upon end date for their service.
RTD has a written manual which provides guidance for the acquisition, use, and
management review of P-Cards within the organization. P-Cards are intended to be a
more efficient and cost effective way to buy and pay for lower value company purchases.
Administration of P-Cards is through Citibank, with an agreement that is overseen by the
RTD Procurement Division.
Every employee with a P-Card, and their
reviewing/approving manager, are required to comply with the internal policies and
procedures which govern the use of these cards.
SCOPE
This audit concentrated on the use of P-Cards in Customer Care and PI/PR. Internal
Audit also reviewed staffing in the Marketing and PI/PR Divisions.
OBJECTIVES
PCards:
 Determine adherence to Purchasing Card policies and procedures.



Ensure the procurement of appropriate goods and services were for RTD business
purposes.
Validate that the monthly supervisory review and approval process was adequate and

CONCLUSION
Internal Audit’s testing identified routine PCard purchases of one division’s coffee and
break room supplies; and monthly employee birthday cakes, which have now been
discontinued.
Senior Management will continue to monitor staffing needs of the Communications
Department as construction of new rail lines are finished and become operational.
CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal
Audit follow-up review.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
PURCHASING CARDS – MARKETING DEPT.
AUDIT REPORT # 16-08-11

Purchasing Cards (PCards) are intended to be an easy to use, more efficient and costeffective way to buy and pay for lower value purchases. RTD participates in the State of
Colorado Master Contract for Credit Card Services that operates through Citibank. At the
current time, there are four Citibank ‘Corporate Cards’ assigned to RTD Marketing
employees. Approval limits for individual transactions are limited to $3,000 with monthly
card limits maintained between $20,000 and $30,000 for Marketing employees.
During our eight-month test period these four PCard holders spent a combined average
of just under $37,800 per month. The current PCard contract includes a periodic rebate
to RTD equal to 1.7% of purchases.
AUDIT SCOPE
We selected individual Marketing employee PCard statements from November 2015
through June 2016 for review of supporting documentation and compliance with RTD
policies and procedures including:




The procurement of appropriate goods and services for RTD business purposes are
within the employee’s assigned credit limits.
The monthly supervisory review and approval process was adequate and timely.
Individual transactions were not ‘split’ into two charges in order to qualify within the
employee’s credit limits.
CONCLUSION

Internal Audit’s testing indicated that most Marketing PCard transactions were properly
handled. However, we identified one situation of a perceived ‘split transaction’ and several
examples of food or drink purchases for meetings that were not supported with a
documented business purpose and a list of attendees.
Audit has recommended that a consistent approach be developed to attach appropriate
supporting documents for Business Meeting costs charged to PCards.
CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal
Audit follow-up review.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
SMART MEDIA TECHNOLOGY PROJECT
SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE REVIEW
2016 INTERIM AUDIT REPORT # 16-01-11

RTD has elected to implement the Smart Media Technology (SMT) system on its buses, and train
platforms using a ‘phased in’ approach. Affiliated Computer Services, a firm purchased by Xerox
with previous expertise in developing such systems, has been working with RTD since 2011 to
implement all aspects of this project. The RTD Board approved the most recent contract increase
with Xerox Transport Solutions in 2016, which raised the estimated external project cost to $20.5
million.
Since 2013, efforts have concentrated on developing a system that will allow passengers to
purchase credit as ‘stored value’ on their MyRide card, which will then be reduced when the card
holder ‘taps on’ to ride an RTD Bus or Rail vehicle. Security Officers will be utilized to periodically
test Rail riders’ cards to verify that they have ‘tapped on’ and have not exceeded their ‘paid-for’
trip length. Stored Value capability was initially planned for mid-2014, and was tested with a Public
Pilot during 2016. However, a concern regarding the security of customers’ credit card data when
reloading their MyRide cards via the Internet has been raised by RTD and a ‘Right to Cure’ notice
has been issued to Xerox. As a result, a firm date for system roll-out does not currently exist.
AUDIT SCOPE

Utilizing a System Development Life Cycle approach, our participation since project startup has continued to include a review of the development procedures being used to build
a system that will satisfy the needs of the District. Internal Audit has also monitored
activities to ensure new capabilities are adequately tested in advance of moving into a
live, full production environment.
CONCLUSION
During 2016, the RTD Project Team continued to work with Xerox in an effort to develop the
electronic fare media system that was originally anticipated. However, as noted above, problems
and setbacks have been experienced and the goal to ‘go live’ with Stored Value capability has
now been indefinitely postponed.
The original hardware used by Security Officers to test Rail patrons’ MyRide cards and ensure
accurate recording of their trip, required replacement during 2016 and new equipment is now in
use. However, LRT passengers who use an ECO or College Pass and who are identified as not
having ‘tapped on’ are not subject to any fines or ‘loss of use’ penalties at this time. In addition,
other issues including Platform Validator screens ‘going black’, creation of acceptable Fraud
Reports, testing of the designed Disaster Recovery Plan, and utilizing retail locations to sell stored
value for customer cards continue to be pursued.
CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal Audit followup as Internal Audit continues to be involved with the Project Team.

Board Meeting Date: December 13, 2016
Information

The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass and NeighborhoodPass customers on
January 1, 2013. There are approximately 475,000 active cards in circulation. During the month of
November, 2016, 1.45M taps were recorded.
The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public currently
enrolled in the public pilot program to pay for transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored
Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards. These cards can be loaded with certain dollar amounts and
used much like a gift card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar
amount on the card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card at RTD
sales outlets.
Starting the morning of Monday January 4th, cards were being dispersed to the public pilot program
participants at the RTD retail outlets. As of approximately December 1, 2016, a total of 1,920 cards
were issued of which 1,520 (79%) were full fare and 400 (21%) were discount cards. The average
initial stored value loading is $41.20 with a total value loaded including reloads of $316,800. There
have been 115,000 boardings using these MyRide cards with fare payment value of $253,900. Of these
boardings; 70% were local, 28% regional and 2% airport.
All bus installations were completed for operational service. Additional validators will be installed as
buses are purchased.
Additional platform validators were installed for the University of Colorado A Line and B line to
Westminster. More platform validators will be installed on the G Line to Wheat Ridge and the R line to
Aurora. All 191 Light and Commuter Rail platform validators have been installed and are operational.

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Third Quarter of 2016. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 37 performance
measures tracked for the GM, RTD met 33 in the third quarter. The following is a discussion of
the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District as a whole did not meet its goals for Local on-time service and Regional on-time
service in Q3.
In Local on-time service, overall performance was slightly weaker from Q2. First TransitLongmont was the only carrier that exceeded goal while the remaining carriers did not meet goal.
Regional on-time performance did not meet goal but was stable compared to Q2. Staff will
continue its targeted efforts in studying the worst performing routes and identifying the resources
needed to improve, such as service changes and operator training.
Light Rail performance exceeded goal for both on-time service and service availability.
Goal 5.1 – Improve ADA On-Time Performance
Staffing challenges continued to cause fluctuations in on-time performance in Q3.
Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
The ridership goal is established with the 2016 Amended Budget. Although the goal was not met
in Q3 on a year-to-date basis, this measure is more properly assessed annually. We will monitor
and look forward to more data post-FasTracks roll-out in 2016.

Please see the footnotes to the report for exceptions within overall performance measures 1.1 and
4.2.

three carriers had a high number of complaints related to missed service or late service (no show, bus late, discourtesy,
passed up passengers at stop). We also noted a decrease in ridership for all carriers (including RTD) compared to
each quarter in 2015. Transdev especially showed a large increase in “no show” complaints, most likely due to the
number of routes that were dropped or returned to RTD due to lack of operator availability.

Subject:

DRCOG Vanpool Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support for the
DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This agreement is for calendar year
2017 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $1,058,600.

BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, ongoing service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs
associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.

DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had
previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the DRCOG entered into a partnership in
April of 2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG
believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering
desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver
metropolitan area. Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement
of marginal bus routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary
marketing programs and increased commuter transportation alternatives.

Packet Pg. 117

2.B.1

RTD financial support is used to help underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers
and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the
advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans has grown from 11 to
122 active vans.
In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies operating vanpool services in other metropolitan
areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool program. VPSI took
over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Currently the vanpools carry an average of 5.4 riders
per van and the fleet is at 76% capacity.
DRCOG vanpool performance through October in 2016 (thru the 3rd Qtr) resulted in an RTD subsidy per
passenger seat used of approximately $4.52 and $2.94 for each seat sold. For comparison, the subsidy
per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2015 ranged from an average of $3.66 subsidy per
passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $7.18 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service
and an average of $5.17 subsidy per passenger for regional service.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the DRCOG Van pool program are budgeted in the approved 2017 budget.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the financial support of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool service in order to continue to
provide and expand this transportation option for residents of the Denver metropolitan area who
work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program which would
result in an increase in single occupant commuting.

5311 Agreements

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD
financial support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County,
Adams County and Jefferson County. These Agreements are for calendar year 2017 and for amounts
not to exceed $372,232.00 for Boulder County, $366.026.00 for Adams County and $113,411.00 for
Jefferson County.

BACKGROUND
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEALU), along with previous transit legislation, provides for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized,
or rural, areas. The section of the Act that addresses the provision of services in non-urbanized areas is
Section 5311 and thus these services are often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013, SAFETEA-LU
provisions moved under the new Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21).
Since 1991, RTD has provided funding to various private, non-profit agencies to assist with the
provision of transit services in non-urbanized areas of the District and to provide local match money for
federal grant funds to support the provision of 5311 services in the District. RTD has provided
financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Jefferson County since 1991 and has
provided financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Adams and Boulder Counties
since 1993.

DISCUSSION
RTD will contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services
in Boulder County in an amount not to exceed $372,232.00 in 2017. RTD shall also contribute
funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams County in
amount not to exceed $366,026.00 in 2017.
RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $113,411.00.00 in 2017.
These Agreements will be for a period of one year. 5311 performance will be assessed at the end of
the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of
the funding agreements is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service
standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and the affected
party(s) will confer on modifications needed to bring it into conformance. The provision of 5311
service in 2015 resulted in monthly performance that ranged from 1.6 to 2.2 passengers per hour

Packet Pg. 119

2.B.2

and an RTD subsidy per passenger boarding ranging from approximately $1.29 to approximately
$5.59 (subsidy reflects only the RTD contribution). As a comparison, RTD Call-n-Ride monthly
performance averaged 4.0 passengers per hour in 2015 while RTD Access-a-Ride service performs at
approximately 1.2 passengers per hour. Call-n-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger
boarding of $19.26 and Access-a-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger trip of
approximately $42.92 in 2015.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the 5311 services were included in the approved 2017 RTD budget. This
Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the 5311 cost sharing agreements with Via Mobility Services and Seniors’ Resource
Center so that these organizations can continue to provide transit services to individuals in the
non-urbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of
Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.

Hop Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a
Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the operation of
the HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of
Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year
2017 and is for an amount not to exceed $1,454,514.00.

BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City
of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of
the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to
provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.
The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM on
Saturdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. In addition, Night HOP service is
provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately
2,800 passenger trips per weekday.

DISCUSSION
RTD will contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount
not to exceed $1,454,514.00 in 2017. This Agreement will be for a period of one year. HOP
performance will be assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have
been met and to determine if continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will
be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance does not
warrant continuation, RTD and the City of Boulder will confer on modifications to the service in order
to bring it into conformance. The provision of HOP service through 3rd Quarter in 2016 resulted in 24.3
passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per HOP passenger trip of $1.77. For comparison, the
boardings for RTD local fixed route service in 2015 ranged from an average of 32.6 boardings per hour
for CBD local routes to an average of 17.7 boardings per hour for suburban local service.

Art Shuttle Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year 2017 and is for
an amount not to exceed $311,356.00.

BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circulator bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The art shuttle was implemented in 2004 as a free service. In
September 2007, with the expiration of the CMAQ grant, the RTD took over funding of the art shuttle
because the ridership exceeded RTD’s expectations. The City of Englewood continues the management
and marketing of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood covers all marketing and related expenses.
The art shuttle continues to be a free service that is sponsored by the City of Englewood. The City of
Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would have been paid if the art shuttle charged a RTD
fare.
The art shuttle currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service on
Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. The shuttle operates between the Englewood light rail station and
Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The art shuttle operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15)
minute frequency. Ridership has averaged 636.0 boardings per day or 25.5 passengers per hour.

DISCUSSION
RTD will contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the art shuttle in an
amount not to exceed $311,356 in 2017
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the art shuttle will be assessed at
the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if
continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of
RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and
the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance.
The provision of art shuttle service through the 3rd Quarter in 2015 resulted in 25.5 passengers per hour
and an RTD subsidy per art shuttle passenger trip of $1.29. For comparison, the boardings for RTD local
fixed route suburban service in 2015 was 17.7 boardings per hour with a subsidy of $7.18 per boarding.
The City of Englewood will continue to pay for all fares for the art shuttle.

service so that the City of Englewood can continue to provide this service to the residents,
visitors and businesses in the City of Englewood.

Authorization to enter into contract with
Nordco Mobile Railcar Movers (16DR004)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager or his designee to enter into a contract with Nordco Mobile Railcar
Movers for the purchase of a LRV Recovery Vehicle in the amount of $550,360.00.
BACKGROUND:
When RTD prepared to open the first Light Rail line in 1994, we purchased a 1984 Mercedes-Benz
Unimog to move single LRVs in rail yards and on rail lines that did not yet have overhead power. This
type of vehicle was the Industry standard for moving LRVs in rail yards across the country. RTD also
used this vehicle to tow LRVs on new lines for clearance and overhead wire position testing. RTD
learned that the Unimog was not large enough to efficiently and safely tow our 88,000 lb. LRV’s on 6%
percent grades and the tight curves that exist on our rail lines. Having a Brakeman on board the LRV is
the only way to tow safely and still doesn’t solve the lack of towing effort needed to go up steep
grades.
RTD initially issued a Request for Proposals on August 26, 2016. Evaluative criteria were cost- 50%,
conformance with specifications- 30%, supplier’s history and proven track record with this equipment10%, and quality of references- 10%. RTD’s evaluation committee consisted of Robbie Hunter, Senior
Equipment Engineer; Phil Eberl, General Superintendent, LRV Maintenance; Tim Walker, Manager, LRV
Maintenance; and Leo Fautsch, Senior Buyer.
RTD received two proposals; one from Nordco and one from Colmar. The evaluation committee
recommends Nordco, the proposer that met our specification and was the only one that met our
evaluation criteria.
DISCUSSION:
A larger rail car mover is the only feasible way to recover trains from the mainline and to tow LRVs. This
mover will also be used by our Maintenance of Way group to tow their ballast car as needed. The
proposed mover could retrieve two to four LRVs at a time.
It will have a 30,000lb winch installed to aid in derailment retrievals and couplers for LRV retrieval. Most
Light Rail properties in the U.S. have a larger LRV mover capable of towing multiple LRVs in the event of
a major accident or power failure on the line in order to recover their trains and return them to the rail
yard.
The existing Unimog is obsolete, undersized and almost impossible to purchase parts for due to its age.
A newer model of the same vehicle is not available in the U.S. due to EPA regulations. The proposed
vehicle exceeds the tractive effort (pulling power) of common Track Mobiles.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost of the Recovery Vehicle is in the Rail Operations capital budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager or his designee to enter into a contract with Nordco Mobile Railcar

Packet Pg. 125

2.B.5

Movers for the purchase of a LRV Recovery Vehicle in the amount of $550,360.00. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with Nordco for
purchase of a Railcar Mover. This action would result in RTD’s inability to efficiently and safely
retrieve LRVs on rail lines absent of overhead power and could not be shared by MOW for the
movement of their ballast car. This is not the recommended action as it would not allow us to
improve our ability to efficiently move or recover LRVs on dead track sections.

Code of Conduct for Persons on RTD Vehicles
and Property

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Code of Conduct for persons on RTD vehicles and property.
BACKGROUND:
Since its founding, RTD has not had a written code of conduct that describes acceptable behavior for
individuals on RTD vehicles and property. Many other transit agencies including Los Angeles, Atlanta,
Dallas, and New York City have such codes to promote public safety, health, and peace. Codes help
passengers and visitors understand acceptable behavior, and help transit agencies communicate and, if
necessary, enforce such behavior.
A 2016 RTD Leadership Academy group has been working on a campaign to educate RTD users on
courtesy to fellow passengers, to help make everyone’s ride more enjoyable. While working on this
project the Leadership Academy group identified the need for RTD to have a formal Code of Conduct.
RTD currently has a Facilities Use Policy posted on RTD’s website. However, that policy applies solely to
RTD real property, and focuses mainly on commercial activity and First Amendment issues concerning
non-commercial activity. RTD’s Trailblazer contains requirements for passenger conduct, but the
Trailblazer is an operator’s guide, not instructions to the public. Historically, verbal guidance and
directions from RTD security and staff have sufficed to maintain acceptable behavior, but recently RTD
Transit Police officers have been challenged to “show me the rule” when they ask patrons to refrain
from disruptive activities. The attached Code of Conduct will provide clear and consistent answers and
guidance to RTD Transit Police, other RTD staff, and RTD patrons.
The Code has been written to avoid infringing on the public’s First Amendment rights, and to respect the
rights of disabled persons under the Americans with Disabilities Act. For example, the Code restricts
disruptively loud noises or unsanitary practices, but does not try to regulate what people say or wear.
The Code also emphasizes that it is subject to reasonable modification if otherwise prohibited conduct is
due to a disability, and directs RTD staff to consult with RTD Dispatch or Security for advice in such
cases.
The Code reflects that RTD does not intend to use it to punish violations. Instead, RTD will continue to
enforce its standards of behavior in a compassionate and sensible manner, with an emphasis on
education and warnings whenever it is practicable to do so. If a patron violates the Code and refuses to
stop even after a warning, or in extreme cases where immediate action must be taken without a prior
warning, the Code will aid RTD Transit Police and other staff to direct the patron to leave the premises
or face trespassing charges.

Packet Pg. 127

2.B.6

The Code does not alter or replace existing applicable laws, such as criminal violations for “Endangering
Public Transportation,” “Hindering Public Transportation,” and assault.
RTD has developed the Code after review of similar codes by peer transit agencies including those
mentioned above, and with input from the Senior Leadership Team, RTD’s Civil Rights Division, and
other RTD staff. An initial draft of the Code was provided to the Operations Committee on November 1,
2016 for review and comment. The Code has also undergone substantial outreach with stakeholder
groups, including input sought from the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, the Colorado CrossDisability Coalition, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Downtown Denver Business Improvement
District, and other local entities. Numerous suggestions by these groups have been included in the final
draft.
Rollout, education and publicity on the Code is anticipated to be done in conjunction with the Leadership
Academy education program.
The Code will be posted on RTD’s website and made available in pamphlet form, and RTD security and
operations staff will be trained in its provisions and enforcement. RTD staff will also educate individuals
on the Code while performing ongoing security, operations and maintenance functions.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The cost to implement the Code of Conduct will be very minimal, and a Code will help protect RTD
against legal claims based on arbitrary RTD conduct.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Accept the Recommended Action and approve the attached Code of Conduct. This is
recommended, because RTD staff needs a comprehensive code of conduct to educate the public
and, if necessary, enforce appropriate behavior.
2. Reject the Recommended Action and do not approve the attached Code of Conduct. This is not
recommended, since RTD will continue to have no written, easy to find, and easy to apply rules
governing behavior of RTD passengers and others; and legal challenges may be filed against RTD
staff issuing directives not based on written policies.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: December 8, 2016

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: December 13, 2016

Subject:

2016 3rd Quarter Contracted Fixed Route
Report

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the third quarter of 2016 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 3rd quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to utilize bus
operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators. The
contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety meetings, through
periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles in
the 3rd quarter. First Transit Longmont continues to make progress in this performance measure
by decreasing their passenger accident ratio from 0.28 during the 2nd quarter to 0.19 during the
3rd quarter. All five passenger accidents that occurred in the 3rd quarter were classified as nonpreventable. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness of passenger safety through
campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 3rd quarter. RTD and the contractor organizations
place a high emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as
such, the local operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.

Packet Pg. 150

2.C.5



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
First Transit Longmont met the target of 88% Local On-Time Service with 89.2% on-time
performance in the 3rd quarter. First Transit Denver (87.4%), Transdev (87.2%), First Transit
Commerce City (83.3%) did not meet the goal due in part to the high number of new operators.
RTD and the private contractors continue to campaign routes and operators with low on time
performance with a strong focus on first time point departures. On a monthly basis contractors
review the OTP report and meet with operators of low performing routes to discuss factors that
are impacting their ability to reach 88% on time performance. Running time issues are forwarded
to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 28,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 3rd quarter. The contractors continue to improve in this
area by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely
manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
First Transit Longmont met the target of .0004 Complaints per Boarding with .0003 complaints
per boarding in the 3rd quarter. First Transit Denver (.0005), First Transit Commerce City
(.0006) and Transdev (.0007) did not meet the goal. Complaints per boarding continue to reflect
the difficulties experienced in the earlier part of the year due to operator shortages which resulted
in a high number of bus late and bus no show complaints. Since the later part of 2015 and
continuing into 2016, the contractors have taken a variety of actions over and above contract
requirements to address their operator hiring/retention challenges which include hiring bonuses,
wage increases, incentives to take on additional work, employing a full-time recruiter, and
mentoring programs
The contractors continue to investigate and address customer complaints with operators. The
contractors utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist operators in improving
customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted above regarding on-time performance should
help address some customer complaints. The contractors also continue to address complaint
trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.

Access-a-Ride/Cab 3rd Quarter Performance
Report

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership levels remained essentially unchanged through the 3rd quarter of 2016 compared
to the same period of 2015. Productivity increased from 1.20 to 1.25 passengers per hour. During the
same period, Access-a-Cab ridership decreased by 10%. Combined Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab
ridership decreased by 2% compared to 2015. Total boardings decreased from 687,225 total boardings
thru Q3 of 2015 to 674,894 total boardings thru Q3 of 2016.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride decreased by 3% during the 3rd
quarter of 2016
as compared to the same period of 2015. Access-a-Ride is approximately 6% under budgeted revenue
hours through the third quarter of 2016.
On-Time Performance
Carrier on-time performance through the 3rd quarter of 2016 was 95.56% a slight decrease as compared
to the same period of 2015 (95.59%).
Passenger on-time performance through the 3rd quarter of 2016 was 84.31% a slight decrease as
compared to the same period in 2015 (84.4%).
On time performance continues to be impacted by operator shortages and the continuing trend of traffic,
construction, and other delays. Our private contractors continue to try to address the operator shortages
by continuing their job fair efforts and implementing/continuing a variety of other recruiting
methodologies in an attempt to attract potential operators and by improving wages in an attempt to
attract and retain operators.
Customer Complaints
Complaints increased through the 3rd quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Staff
continues to work with our carriers and passengers to try to improve overall system performance. The
major obstacle to improved system performance continues to be the shortage of operators which results
in dropped runs, degraded on-time performance and increased on-board ride times. We continue to work
with our contractor partners to address these issues.

** 2015 numbers were not adjusted to report only the at fault complaints.

Preventable Accidents:
3rd Qtr 2016 – 3 Accidents
3rd Qtr 2015 – 4 Accidents

Call-n-Ride Comments:
Ridership continues to be down. Changes to how we are scheduling trips for the school children,
low gas prices and the new fare increases have affected ridership in the Call-n-Ride areas.
Broomfield – The City of Broomfield applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality
grant to expand the current Broomfield Call-n-Ride. The Call-n-Ride has been expanded in size and
now has two vehicles serving the Broomfield community. The expanded service began operations on
August 1, 2016.
Highlands Ranch - This CnR opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Highlands
Ranch CnR replaced the poorly performing Route 426 Ranch Rider. Over the years RTD has tried
numerous adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be
discontinued twice. Highlands Ranch has carried a high percentage of Access-a-Ride qualified users.
While the subsidy is high for the CnR, if CnR were to be discontinued, this ridership would move to

Packet Pg. 168

2.C.7

Access-a-Ride where the subsidy would be much higher. Douglas County has contributed financially
to the CnR in the past. In 2015 Douglas County and Highlands Ranch provided a cost share with the
RTD for 50% of the subsidy. A Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC) was formed to reevaluate service and develop marketing to increase ridership. The TAC came up with some ideas
that were implemented in the August 2015 runboard. The school trippers have increased ridership
slightly, but this requires a great deal of staff time. Ridership continues to be a challenge.
Recommendation to discontinue the Call-n-Ride was placed in the Winter 2016 Service
Recommendation. A proposed 50% cost share with Douglas County was offered to the County.
The County turned this offer down. The Call-n-Ride’s last day will be Friday, January 13, 2017.
Superior – The Town of Superior applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality grant
to start a new Call-n-Ride. The new service began operations on August 1, 2016.
Parker – This CnR opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Over the years RTD has
made adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be discontinued
twice. In 2015 Douglas County and the Town of Parker provided a cost share with the RTD for 50%
of the subsidy. A TAC was formed to re-evaluate service and develop marketing to increase
ridership. The TAC came up with some ideas that were implemented in the August 2015 runboard.
In August 2016, a school trip was set up that is showing positive results. The Parker Call-n-Ride is
showing positive ridership results.
Lone Tree and Thornton call-n-rides are being monitored.

Subject:

2016 3rd Quarter Drug & Alcohol Compliance
Monitoring

In compliance with the Recommendation included in the Performance Audit of the RTD conducted in
2015 on behalf of the State of Colorado, the following is a summary of the monitoring activities
completed by RTD Drug & Alcohol compliance personnel through the 3rd Quarter of 2016. These

Analysis

Quarter

Customer

Complaint

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 3rd Quarter of 2016. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2015.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding. The goal for 2014 was again adjusted to account for the static higher level of complaints due
to the securement area/priority seating issues, the fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability,
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line service. The 2015 goal remained at .0004
complaints per passenger boarding. The 2016 goal was again set at .0004 complaints per passenger
boarding.
For the 3rd Quarter of 2016, RTD and First Transit Longmont met the goal of .0004 complaints per
passenger boarding. First Transit Denver had .0005 complaints per passenger boarding. First Transit
Commerce City has .0006 complaints per passenger boarding. Transdev (formerly Veolia) had .0007
complaints per passenger boarding. The combined performance for all of the private contractors was
.0005 complaints per passenger boarding. The combined performance for RTD and the private
contractors was .0004 complaints per passenger boarding.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the complaint

2.C.9

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
 Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
 Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices and produce a quarterly newsletter which is
shared with operations personnel.
 RTD is conducting refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
 RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
 RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis,
DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for
passengers with disabilities.
 Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
Historically, and in 2016, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 3rd Quarter 2016: the complaints in this category increased 29.3% compared to
the same period in 2015. Due to on-going operator shortages at both RTD and the private contractors,
a high number of trips were either dropped or ran late. Consequently, a number of passengers
experienced times when their bus did not show. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 6.74
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 5.21 complaints per day.
Bus Early – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 5.4% compared to the same period
in 2015. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible

Packet Pg. 175

2.C.9

passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The
YTD average in this category for 2016 is 5.16 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015
was 5.46 complaints per day.
Bus Late – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 12.1% compared to the same
period in 2015. This category was also impacted by the operator shortages. Additionally, improving ontime performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time issues. The YTD average in
this category for 2016 is 10.78 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 12.26
complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 18.5% compared
to the same period in 2015. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride
checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In
addition, RTD and the private contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam,
Smart Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators
continue to be counseled and retrained as needed to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety
campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is
4.21 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 5.16 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 9.9% compared to the
same period in 2015. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 10.69 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2015 was 11.86 complaints per day.
Discrimination – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 25.0% compared to the same
period in 2015. Investigation into discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at
fault. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 0.24 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2015 was 0.32 complaints per day.
Fare Dispute – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 30.8% compared to the same
period in 2015. The implementation of the new fares and fare equipment resulted in an increase in
complaints. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The
YTD average in this category for 2016 is 1.31 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015
was 1.00 complaint per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 6.2% compared
to the same period in 2015. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel meet on a
regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In addition, the
on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held at the
private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of RTD
passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not

Packet Pg. 176

2.C.9

following proper procedures, appropriate action is taken. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is
8.71 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 8.21 complaints per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 29.8% compared to
the same period in 2015. The recent high turnover of operators has resulted in an increase in new
operators on routes. This in turn has contributed to the higher numbers in this category. The combined
efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, the Bus Operator Training teams, Street
Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to provide operators with up-to-date information to answer
customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average in the category for 2016 is 0.54
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 0.42 complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 5.7% compared
to the same period in 2015. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm buses are on
route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the stop when
the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop as the bus
passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting
directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (146 of the total 3,331 = 4.4%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources
will allow. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 12.20 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2015 was 11.55 complaints per day.

Customer Satisfaction Survey
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops

Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station and Commuter Rail Platform Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail and commuter rail 11platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons
contacted during the quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area
and conduct an on-board enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the
estimated fare evasion rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests
made by police officers. Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations
other than fare evasion. This is an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection
program as peace officers have the authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law
enforcement action. This quarter the bus routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Security Officer Use of Force Incidents
Use of Force is defined as any hands on touching of a suspect by a security officer to detain a suspect
or make a citizen’s arrest. The majority of these issues are minor in nature. No injuries to any suspect
or officer occurred in this reporting quarter. The following table summarizes the use of force incidents
