#### 1. DRCOG Vanpool Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support for the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This agreement is for calendar year 2017 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $1,058,600.

BACKGROUND

Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, on-going service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.

As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute distances.

DISCUSSION

RTD has supported the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program since 2001.  The vanpool program had previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the DRCOG entered into a partnership in April of 2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver metropolitan area. Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement of marginal bus routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary marketing programs and increased commuter transportation alternatives.

RTD financial support is used to help underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans has grown from 11 to 122 active vans.

In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.  DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies operating vanpool services in other metropolitan areas.  After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool program.  VPSI took over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Currently the vanpools carry an average of 5.4 riders per van and the fleet is at 76% capacity.

DRCOG vanpool performance through October in 2016 (thru the 3rd Qtr) resulted in an RTD subsidy per passenger seat used of approximately $4.52 and $2.94 for each seat sold.  For comparison, the subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2015 ranged from an average of $3.66 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $7.18 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service and an average of $5.17 subsidy per passenger for regional service.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Funds for RTD support of the DRCOG Van pool program are budgeted in the approved 2017 budget.  Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES

1.                Approve the financial support of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool service in order to continue to provide and expand this transportation option for residents of the Denver metropolitan area who work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area.

2.              Do not approve the cost sharing agreement.  This course of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program which would result in an increase in single occupant commuting.

#### 2. 5311 Agreements

RECOMMENDED ACTION

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD financial support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County, Adams County and Jefferson County.  These Agreements are for calendar year 2017 and for amounts not to exceed $372,232.00 for Boulder County, $366.026.00 for Adams County and $113,411.00 for Jefferson County.

BACKGROUND

The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), along with previous transit legislation, provides for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized, or rural, areas. The section of the Act that addresses the provision of services in non-urbanized areas is Section 5311 and thus these services are often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013, SAFETEA-LU provisions moved under the new Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21).

Since 1991, RTD has provided funding to various private, non-profit agencies to assist with the provision of transit services in non-urbanized areas of the District and to provide local match money for federal grant funds to support the provision of 5311 services in the District.  RTD has provided financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Jefferson County since 1991 and has provided financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Adams and Boulder Counties since 1993.

DISCUSSION

RTD will contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Boulder County in an amount not to exceed $372,232.00 in 2017.  RTD shall also contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams County in amount not to exceed $366,026.00 in 2017.

RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $113,411.00.00 in 2017.

These Agreements will be for a period of one year.  5311 performance will be assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the funding agreements is warranted.  Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards.  If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and the affected party(s) will confer on modifications needed to bring it into conformance.  The provision of 5311 service in 2015  resulted in monthly performance that ranged from 1.6 to 2.2 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per passenger boarding ranging from approximately $1.29 to approximately $5.59 (subsidy reflects only the RTD contribution). As a comparison, RTD Call-n-Ride monthly performance averaged 4.0 passengers per hour in 2015 while RTD Access-a-Ride service performs at approximately 1.2 passengers per hour. Call-n-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger boarding of $19.26 and Access-a-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger trip of approximately $42.92 in 2015.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Funds for RTD support of the 5311 services were included in the approved 2017 RTD budget. This Agreement will be for a period of one year.  Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES

1.                Approve the 5311 cost sharing agreements with Via Mobility Services and Seniors’ Resource Center so that these organizations can continue to provide transit services to individuals in the non-urbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.

2.              Do not approve the cost sharing agreement.  This course of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.

#### 3. Hop Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTIONIt is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year 2017 and is for an amount not to exceed $1,454,514.00.

BACKGROUND

The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.

RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.

The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM on Saturdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Sundays and holidays.  In addition, Night HOP service is provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately 2,800 passenger trips per weekday.

DISCUSSION

RTD will contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount not to exceed $1,454,514.00 in 2017. This Agreement will be for a period of one year.  HOP performance will be assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance does not warrant continuation, RTD and the City of Boulder will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance. The provision of HOP service through 3rd Quarter in 2016 resulted in 24.3 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per HOP passenger trip of $1.77. For comparison, the boardings for RTD local fixed route service in 2015 ranged from an average of 32.6 boardings per hour for CBD local routes to an average of 17.7 boardings per hour for suburban local service.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Funds for RTD support of the HOP service were included in the approved 2017 RTD budget. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES

1.                Approve the cost sharing agreement with the City of Boulder for the HOP circulator bus service so that the City of Boulder can continue to provide this service to the residents, students and businesses in the City of Boulder.

2.              Do not approve the cost sharing agreement.  This course of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of the heavily-used HOP circulator service.

#### 4. Art Shuttle Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year 2017 and is for an amount not to exceed $311,356.00.

BACKGROUND

In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) Grant for a circulator bus service.  This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007.  CMAQ funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the City of Englewood contributed 10%.  The art shuttle was implemented in 2004 as a free service.  In September 2007, with the expiration of the CMAQ grant, the RTD took over funding of the art shuttle because the ridership exceeded RTD’s expectations.  The City of Englewood continues the management and marketing of the art shuttle.  The City of Englewood covers all marketing and related expenses.   The art shuttle continues to be a free service that is sponsored by the City of Englewood. The City of Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would have been paid if the art shuttle charged a RTD fare.

The art shuttle currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays.  There is no service on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays.  The shuttle operates between the Englewood light rail station and Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The art shuttle operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15) minute frequency.  Ridership has averaged 636.0 boardings per day or 25.5 passengers per hour.

DISCUSSION

RTD will contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the art shuttle in an amount not to exceed $311,356 in 2017

This Agreement will be for a period of one year.  The performance of the art shuttle will be assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted.  Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance.  The provision of art shuttle service through the 3rd Quarter in 2015 resulted in 25.5 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per art shuttle passenger trip of $1.29.  For comparison, the boardings for RTD local fixed route suburban service in 2015 was 17.7 boardings per hour with a subsidy of $7.18 per boarding. The City of Englewood will continue to pay for all fares for the art shuttle.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Funds for RTD support of the art shuttle were included in the approved 2017 RTD budget.  Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES

1.                Approve the cost sharing agreement with the City of Englewood for the art shuttle circulator bus service so that the City of Englewood can continue to provide this service to the residents, visitors and businesses in the City of Englewood.

2.              Do not approve the cost sharing agreement.  This course of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of the art shuttle circulator service.
