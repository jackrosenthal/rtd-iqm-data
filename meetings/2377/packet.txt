DISCUSSION
The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2016 Recommended Budget (combined
Base and FasTracks) is $2,537.0 million. This includes an operating expense budget of $635.4
million, interest expense of $117.3 million, capitalized interest of $33.0 million, new capital
expenditures of $484.9 million, debt payments of $61.7 million, FasTracks contingency reserve
of $15.9 million, FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $23.5 million, Board appropriated fund
of $35.0 million, capital replacement fund of $27.3 million, and estimated unrestricted fund
balance of $15.8 million. The previously approved capital (capital carry forward) is $1,087.2
million. The sum of the budget appropriation and capital carry forward is $2,537.0 million.
Overview of the 2016 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $1,121.7 million on a combined basis are expected to increase $141.1 million
(14.4%) in 2016 from the 2015 Amended Budget. The increase is due to 1) an increase in fare
revenue of $34.7 million, 2) an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $39.1 million, and 3) an
increase in grant revenue of $69.6 million, and 4) an increase in other income of $0.7 million,
offset by a decrease in investment income of $3.1 million.







Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenues of $158.1 million are budgeted
to increase 28.1% over the 2015 Amended Budget. On the Base System, fare revenue is
budgeted to increase 10% in alignment with the new fare structure in 2016; however,
ridership growth is expected to be flat to minimal. For FasTracks, farebox revenue is
budgeted to increase $22.8 million over the 2015 Amended Budget to $26.8 million due
to the opening of five new service lines (I-225, US36 BRT, East, Gold, and Northwest Rail
electrified segment). The FasTracks estimate is per the Annual Program Evaluation.
Sales and use tax revenues of $590.5 million in 2015 are expected to increase 8.0% over
the 2015 projected level according to the most recent September quarterly forecast by
the CU-Leeds School of Business.
Total Base System grants are projected to increase $8.5 million over the 2015 Amended
Budget, including new and carry forward amounts. Base System grants are estimated to
total $115.2 million in 2016; of that amount, $87.2 million is new grants while projected
carryforward grant funding is $28.0 million. FasTracks grants are budgeted to increase
$61.1 million from the 2015 Amended Budget due primarily to an estimated $58.2 million
New Starts grant for the Southeast Rail extension, as well as increases in CMAQ-Eagle
and US36 FASTER grants.
Investment income is budgeted to decrease $3.1 million from continued low short term
interest rates coupled with deployment of invested funds. Other income will remain
largely flat, increasing at the CPI or as identified.

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $635.4 million on a combined basis in 2016 (excluding
depreciation), which is $79.9 million higher compared to the 2015 Amended Budget. The
increase is due to: 1) budgeting for the DTO service payment of $57.1 million for the first time in
2016, 2) one-time costs of approximately $4.3 million for the Grand Opening activities for the
new FasTracks service lines, 3) cost allocation for the new service lines in 2016, 4) increased
contributions totaling $2.5 million to the salaried and union pension and benefit plans, 5)
additional operator shift differential pay and pay for split shifts totaling approximately $3.3
million, and 6) the expense project carryforward totaling $51.7 million. The expense project
carryforward to 2016 is $15.9 million for Base System operations and $35.9 million for

Packet Pg. 14

2.12.A

FasTracks. It should be noted that substantial reductions were made to departmental operating
budgets to align them with the SBP target, which offset the above increases over 2015.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at the lock price of $2.23 per gallon, compared to a price of $2.95 per
gallon in the 2015 Amended Budget, for savings of $7.5 million. Gasoline is budgeted at
$3.00/gallon, down from the 2015 per gallon budget price of $3.40, for savings of $630,000.
The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to the posted
Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the Requested
Budget consist of the expense projects carry-forward.
Interest expense in 2016 is budgeted at $117.3 million on a combined basis, an increase of
$21.9 million over the 2015 Amended Budget. The increase is due to the issuance of COP debt
in 2015 and anticipated debt issuances in 2016. Of total interest expense, $27.3 million is
budgeted for Base System and $90.0 million is budgeted for FasTracks. Capitalized interest
(combined) is budgeted at $33.0 million, the majority of which will occur in FasTracks Project.
Capitalized interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for interest payments in 2016.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $61.7 million on a combined basis, which is $2.8
million higher than the 2015 Amended Budget. Base System principal payments of $51.9 million
are $1.9 million higher due to scheduled amortization of the COPs issued for fleet purchases (bus
and rail). FasTracks principal payments of $9.8 million are $0.8 million higher due to issuance of
COPs and scheduled principal amortization on current debt. Financing proceeds from the
issuance of new debt is budgeted at $150.0 million in new bond funds for capital program
construction for FasTracks (mainly the Southeast Rail extension). No debt issuances are planned
for the Base System. Such financing proceeds are budgeted to be $179.1 million lower from the
2015 Amended Budget because both entities will supplement debt issuance by drawing from
previously issued debt to fund major capital purchases and construction in 2016.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2015 (previously
approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2016. The
capital carry-forward will be $1,087.2 million made up of $178.0 million on the Base System
and $909.2 million on FasTracks.
New capital spending on a combined basis of $484.9 million will decrease $169.9 million from
the 2015 Amended Budget due mainly to project completion in FasTracks. New capital spending
for FasTracks will decrease $174.3 million to $373.3 million in 2016 due to on-going project
completion on the East Line, US36 BRT, and Northwest Rail, offset by increases to the
Southeast Extension and I-225. For the Base System, new capital spending will increase $4.4
million to $111.6 million. Of this amount, the Base system will spend $0.1 million more on Parkn-Rides, and $39.4 million more on fleet modernization/expansion (bus and rail). These increases
will be offset by $4.1 million less on facilities construction and maintenance (primarily Civic
Center), $0.5 million less on bus infrastructure (local government requests), $16.5 million less in
capital support projects (primarily IT support for the District), and $13.8 million less on Rail
transit (project completion). The Base System new capital was approved as part of the Strategic
Budget Plan in August 2015.
New capital expenditures for 2016 and the change in new capital in the 2016 Recommended
Budget over the previous 2015 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget Plan are shown in
Attachment B. The capital carry-forward expenditures for 2016 and the change in the capital

Packet Pg. 15

2.12.A

carry-forward in the 2016 Recommended Budget over the 2015 Amended Budget are shown in
Attachment C.
Notable designated fund balance changes include a decrease of $3.5 million in the Base System
year-end unrestricted fund balance from the 2015 Amended Budget to $6.5 million. This
projected fund balance is still $1.3 million higher than the SBP target of $5.2 million after
incorporating all revenue and expense adjustments. The actual amount realized, however, may
be lower than the projected $6.5 million due to possible slippage in fare revenue and sales tax
revenue in 2015 (this will become evident in the 2016 amended budget). Also on the Base
System, the Board-appropriated fund is projected to increase by $3.0 million to $25.2 million,
and the capital replacement fund is projected to increase by $3.0 million to $18.0 million.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to decrease $0.2 million from
the 2015 Amended Budget to $15.8 million. The $3.5 million decrease in the Base System’s
unrestricted fund balance is offset by an increase of $3.3 million on FasTracks. On a Districtwide basis, the Board-appropriated fund and the capital replacement fund are projected to
increase by $13.1 million in total. These increases are in minimum accordance with fiscal
policies for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks Projects, and FasTracks
Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.
The FasTracks Construction Reserve at $81.3 million is split between the Construction Reserve
at $56.3 million and a Start-up Operations Reserve at $25.0 million. The Start-up Operations
Reserve was established in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation for the years 2015-2016 in
order to meet the 1.2x debt service coverage if needed. These balances reflect draws totaling
$18.7 million for FasTracks continuing construction.
The FasTracks Contingency Reserve will be maintained at a balance of $15.9 million in the 2016
Budget, net of a drawdown of $14.1 million for North Metro construction.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2016 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado
General Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA
farebox revenues divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures
and expenditures incurred for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure)
exceeds the annual target of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.
Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2016 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated
fund, a capital replacement fund, and an undesignated working capital fund (the remaining
unrestricted year-end fund balance) for both the Base System and FasTracks. The objective is
for the total of these three funds to equal approximately three months of operating expenses
excluding depreciation for the Base System and two months of same for FasTracks. The 2016
budget reflects continued maintenance of the FasTracks contingency reserve at a level deemed
sufficient to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule.
The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2016 on a District-wide basis is projected at
$78.1 million, comprised of 1) the Board appropriated fund of $35.0 million, 2) the capital
replacement fund of $27.3 million, and 3) an undesignated working capital fund or remaining

Packet Pg. 16

2.12.A

fund balance of $15.8 million. The Base System portion of the three fund balances for 2016 is
projected to total $49.7 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two
exceptions:





Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.
Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.
Attachments

As noted above, please refer to the attached Fiscal Year 2016 Recommended Budget and Fiscal
Year 2016 Recommended Budget-Fund Balance (Exhibit I) which shows the operating/nonoperating sources, debt and reserves, and capital sources as well as operating uses, capital
expenditures, and fund balances of the District, and a reconciliation of net assets. Also attached
is the Program Capital Summary including previously approved capital, an Operating Budget
Changes Since Posted Budget summary (Attachment A), a New Capital Projects summary
(Attachment B), and Capital Carryforward Expenditures (Attachment C).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2016 Recommended Budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Revise the 2016 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed revisions.
3. Do not adopt the 2016 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended since the District
will not be in compliance with State regulations that require the District to adopt a budget by
December 31, 2015. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2015, State
statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations and
maintenance purposes and objects is deemed reappropriated."

Subject:

Local Government Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
Interim General Manager and CEO or his designee to enter into an agreement for Local Government
Liaison services with CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) to exercise the fourth option year (January 1, 2016
through December 31, 2016) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a cost of $122,496. Funding for
this contract is included in the annual FasTracks budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Local Government Liaison services was issued on October 20, 2011.
Eight responsive proposals were received for evaluation. Three of the teams were interviewed by a
procurement panel, and a recommendation was subsequently referred to the Executive Committee on
December 15, 2011. The Executive Committee unanimously approved the recommendation that CRL
Associates, Inc. be offered a contract which provided for a one-year base price with four (4) one-year
option periods. The referenced extension covers the fourth and final option period from January 1,
2016 to December 31, 2016. CRL will continue to provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison
services.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the elected officials and
staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and
economic development organizations. This team has a broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns,
as well as an extensive network of relationships with local governments, elected officials, and
stakeholders along the Front Range.
As part of the Local Government Liaison services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and the
Chairman of the Board to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and
county levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular
outreach to the business community and economic development organizations in the Metro area to
develop partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues of concern.
CRL will represent RTD at meetings at the local level of government and provide professional advice,
counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local government activities as they relate to RTD. CRL will also
provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the fourth option year ($122,496) are included in the annual budget for the FasTracks
program.

Packet Pg. 40

2.13.B

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to exercise the fourth option
year (January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a
cost of $122,496.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager to
enter into an agreement to exercise the fourth option year on the contract for the Local
Government Liaison services. A new Request for Proposals could be sent to interested
parties, and a new Local Government Liaison firm could be retained. This action is not
recommended because CRL Associates, Inc. has been very effective in assisting RTD with
local government matters in the past, and this group is very familiar with RTD’s issues and
policies.

University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus
and Rail 2016 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plan package as summarized
in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $16,948,000, exclusive of University
of Colorado A Line Operating and Maintenance costs, and further, to authorize the Interim General
Manager and CEO or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators
whose service is impacted by these changes.
BACKGROUND
As part of the overall FasTracks program to enhance rail service in the Denver region, the upcoming East
and I-225 rail lines also known as the University of Colorado A Line and R Line respectively will
represent significant milestones in achieving improved connectivity and travel times for RTD customers.
The University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plan (East and I-225 Corridor Service
Plan) contains recommendations for developing a restructured bus network capable of meeting the
demand and mobility needs generated by the expansion of commuter rail and light rail services.
Recommendations in this proposal were formulated based on a comprehensive assessment of existing
conditions, service area demographics, transit market research, route performance and analysis, and
stakeholder input.
The study area of this proposal is defined by 104th Avenue to the north, Tower Road and DIA to the
east, Hampden Avenue to the south, and downtown Denver to the west. The study area includes the
cities of Aurora and Denver.
The University of Colorado A Line is a new 22.8-mile electrified commuter rail line that will operate
between Denver Union Station (DUS) and Denver International Airport (DIA) with connections to
adjacent employment centers, neighborhoods, and development areas in the City of Denver and Aurora.
The University of Colorado A Line will serve seven stations, including Denver Union Station, 38th/Blake,
40th/Colorado, Central Park, Peoria, 40th Ave & Airport Blvd/Gateway Park, 62nd/Pena Boulevard, and
DIA. Total travel time between Denver Union Station and DIA is projected to be approximately 37
minutes. The University of Colorado A Line, by the nature of its alignment and planned services will
replace SkyRide Routes AF, AS and the downtown Express Route 47X.
The R Line is a new 10.5-mile light rail line extension within the City of Aurora that will provide key
regional connections to the existing East and Southeast Rail Lines with stops serving major activity
centers including the Aurora City Center, Anschutz/Fitzsimons Medical Center and DIA, the latter
through a transfer at Peoria to the University of Colorado A Line. The R Line extension will serve nine
new stations along the I-225 corridor, including Peoria, Fitzsimons, Colfax, 13th Avenue, 2nd & Abilene,
Aurora City Center, Florida, and Iliff Avenue, along with current stations at Nine Mile, Dayton, Bellview,
Orchard, Arapahoe, Dry Creek, County Line and Lincoln. Total travel time between Nine Mile and Peoria

Packet Pg. 42

2.13.C

is projected to be 32 minutes, while the travel time of the entire R-Line from Peoria to Lincoln is
projected to be 57 minutes. The R-Line light rail alignment will connect the existing Nine Mile Station
with the new Peoria Station and University of Colorado A Line commuter rail service. Existing light rail
service in the I-225 Corridor is currently provided on the H Line from Nine Mile Station to the
18th/California Station in downtown Denver operating on a 15 minute all-day frequency. Under the
proposed operating scenario, the H Line would be extended beyond the Nine Mile Station to serve the
two future R Line stations at Iliff and Florida. Service on the R Line in its entirety will operate between
Peoria Station and Lincoln Station on the Southeast Corridor. The new R Line is 22 miles long in its
entirety (Lincoln to Peoria) and travel time from Peoria to Lincoln is estimated to be 57 minutes.
DISCUSSION
The critical goal for the University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is to build a
simple, easy-to-use network that is comprised of a family of bus and rail services, all focusing on
delivering the overall network experience desired by existing and potential customers.
Significant investments have been made in new rail alignments to improve regional mobility. The East
Corridor offers new fast regional train service between downtown Denver and Denver International
Airport (DIA) and provides new network opportunities. The I-225 Corridor Rail completes the connection
between the East and the Southeast Corridors and also opens new network opportunities for both rail
and bus transit. As a result, the adjacent or intersecting bus routes have been considered for
realignment to serve the new rail stations, resources of duplicative bus service reallocated, and bus route
alignment changes made to refocus network coverage. Through these actions, an integrated transit
network is proposed that will attract riders, reduce operating costs, and strengthen regional and
community mobility.
The following route design strategies were used in the development of this proposal, which focus not
only maintaining high operating efficiency, but providing an improved customer experience that will
attract more riders and operating revenue:
Route Streamlining
The East and I-225 Corridor Service Plan calls for limiting deviations to areas that can justify the
additional travel time and costs by high ridership on the deviation – areas such as rail stations,
transit hubs, and major destinations in order make individual routes, as well as the transit
network, more productive and attractive to riders. In cases where the deviation was providing
needed lifeline coverage, alternative service was proposed while also proposing streamlined
corridor bus transit.
Short-Lining
Routes often vary in terms of ridership and performance along the length of their alignments.
Generally, areas with higher population and employment densities generate more ridership than
areas with lower densities. Providing higher levels of service along segments of the route, short
of the entire length of the route efficiently directs resources to areas with higher demand along a
route.
Corridor Segment Consolidation
In some instances where multiple routes serve the same corridor at different points, it is more
intuitive for the customer to have one streamlined route that serves the corridor continuously. If
general travel patterns on the corridor show a higher degree of through travel relative to local
mobility, routes that link complimentary origins and destinations together were consolidated to

Packet Pg. 43

2.13.C

increase rider convenience by eliminating or reducing transfers required to complete their trip
along a natural transit corridor.
Route Segmentation
In contrast to the segment consolidation strategy, where routes exhibited a very high proportion
of rider transfer activity at a single point, the benefits of separating those routes into two distinct
routes at that point to improve schedule adherence or scheduling efficiency was evaluated. This
was primarily due to the low number of riders remaining on the bus and traveling through the
point in question. These actions also results in routes with more balanced service levels on either
side of this midpoint based on demand.
Low Performing Service Replacement
If a route or route segment performed poorly and the potential to improve performance appeared
to be limited within the existing configuration, then alternatives to fixed route service were
considered.
The University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is slated to be implemented with
the beginning of the April 24, 2016 run-board, after the opening of the University of Colorado A Line on
April 22, 2016. The R-Line is currently expected to open later in the Fall-Winter of 2016. The East and I225 Rail Corridors Preliminary Service Plan was completed on July 1, 2015. Stakeholder meetings to
review the preliminary plan were held between July 8 and August 10, 2015. A review of the preliminary
plan was presented in the August 11, 2015 RTD Board Operations and Customer Services Committee
meeting, resulting in revisions to the preliminary plan prior to the public meeting process. Public
comments were taken up to October 9, 2015, along with subsequent meetings with municipal and
community organizations leading to an update to the RTD Operations Committee, provided on October
20, 2015.
The Final University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is proposed herein is as
result of an extensive study of the area conducted by RTD Staff and consultants; ongoing interactions
within RTD (Board Members and staff), and with community and municipal organizations and individuals.
This proposal can be viewed as a starting point for a continued effort to improve overall transportation
mobility and increase transit market share in the Eastern Metro area, through a multi-modal integrated
transit network.
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Eight public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended between September
21st and October 9th of this year. There were over 100 in attendance at the public meetings and more
than 81 comments heard through RTD’s service change website. Letters from the municipal, civic and
community organizations were also received both in support and showing concern for the proposal.
Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment B of this
report. Letters received are contained in Attachment C.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the
University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail service change:

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The base system cost impact of the University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus Service Plan is
estimated to be $348,000 annualized exclusive of the University of Colorado A Line Operating and
Maintenance (O&M) costs and the R-Line O&M costs. The operating and maintenance costs of the
University of Colorado A Line are a part of the Eagle P3 availability payments funded by FasTracks and
are difficult to disaggregate. The cost impact of the R Line (and H Line extension) are also FasTrack
budget items and are projected to cost an estimated $16.6M annualized.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed University of Colorado A Line and R
Line Bus and Rail Service Plan service changes do not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by
minority or low-income populations.
A LOOK AHEAD – Fall 2016
The following items are service concepts currently under consideration or are planned events that impact
operations in the next service change period:

Route 6 routing will otherwise remain unchanged.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
 It is proposed to discontinue Route 10 service east of the Community College of
Aurora to Buckley Air Force Base. Route 10 service to Buckley will be replaced by

Public Meeting Comments
Monday, September 21, 2015
Aurora Municipal Building
The meeting began at 6:00pm with 28 public attendees, Director Tom Tobiassen, Director
Claudia Folksa and 2 RTD staff persons present. A description of the proposed changes
was presented prior to public comment being heard. General questions concerning the
upcoming fare change were asked first Comments made included the following:
-Concerns about the Route 130H being eliminated from Heather Gardens.
-Concerns about Heather Ridge access to the new Iliff Station.
-Adams County Workforce Center access was mentioned and has been addressed in
adjustment to the planned service on the new Route 37.
-Request for service along Arapahoe Road east of Arapahoe Crossing as far as Grandview
H.S.
-The elimination of the Route 169L and the change in fare to DIA were also concerns
voiced by attendee.
Wednesday, September 23, 2015
Blake Administration Downtown Denver
12:00 noon
The meeting began at 12:00pm with12 members of the public present and 6 RTD staff
members. After a description of the purpose of the meeting, comments concerning the
service change were heard. Most of the comments were in the nature of questions going
after specifics on the service changes as follows:
- a current customer who often takes very early flights from DIA – often around 6:00 am
and was concerned whether the new rail would be operating early enough to get him to
these flights on time.
-concerns about how the changes to Route 10 would affect service on routes 10, 40, 43
& 73
-a person who works as a transportation coordinator for the Aurora Public Schools is
concerned about the accessibility for students to many of their education facilities if the
Route 10 is cut back. The additional service proposed for routes 157 and 169 were
explained to her, but we will be in further contact to work out as many details as need be
and resources can provide.
-a customer who lives in a Senior Citizens High Rise near 26th & Newton was concerned
that our proposed changes to the route 28 would cut her service on the west side.
-a customer who has recently moved to the Park Hill neighborhood, partly because of the
availability of bus service, is concerned about the discontinuance of this route in this
neighborhood. He lives in-between the route 20 and the route 43. He said that he could
use the route 20, but often has found that he’s had to wait past a “bus or two” because
these buses being overloaded with, what he presumed to be students going to East High
School. He wanted to know that RTD’s “philosophy” was regarding getting people from
their cars: whether RTD wants to provide bus service that would be accessed from their
homes or whether RTD wants them to drive to PnR locations.

RTD Director Ton Tobiassen
I am sending you my thoughts regarding the schedule change on the 130H. I am a
resident at Heather Gardens, visually handicapped, retired; and work part time
and like myself, there are others at HG who depend on public transportation on a
daily basis. In order to ride the 130 it would require a walk of up to one mile which
would be difficult for some seniors and riskyespecially during inclement weather.
I would also point out that cancelling route 130H will not add ridership, but will
drop those passengers using the service through heather Gardens on Marina Drive.
Putting the bus out on Yale for one mile to Peoria accomplishes nothing as this line
is already served by the 130 and 131. Please reconsider the proposed change.
Thank you for your consideration

The Stapleton Foundation for Sustainable Urban Communities, in partnership with residents, Denver
Health, and several local community organizations, as part of an Racial and Ethnic Approaches to
Community Health (REACH) grant award from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) hosted several
Community forums and Stakeholder meetings with community members from Northeast Park Hill,
Greater Park Hill, Stapleton, Northwest Aurora and Montbello neighborhoods in the Spring of 2015. The
most recent Stakeholder group (17 people) meeting brought together community residents and
members of RTD staff to discuss the proposed service plans for the new Commuter Rail line. During this
meeting the following was discussed:
Transportation Stakeholder Meeting

Transit users expressed concerns with the proposed discontinuation of the Route #28 East of
Downtown in the Northeast Park Hill neighborhood. Although the ridership may be low, there
are frequent users during peak times. Many students use the Route #28 to get to better schools
outside of their neighborhood and if it is discontinued it will place an undue burden on the
community. Also, one transit user rode the #28 to the meeting catching it from downtown at
5:30 pm and noted that the bus had 30 passengers on the trip. The majority of these riders are
commuters traveling home from work. Although there is a proposal to expand services along
MLK, Stakeholders expressed concern for the older demographic that utilize transit not being
able to walk the additional distance to access this route. Stakeholders would like to see the
route revisited to identify ways to maintain the route for students, seniors and weekday
commuters. Would like to connect RTD with DPS regarding concern about student transit users.
When RTD starts public meeting process a number will be provided for public comment.
Residents have also inquired about accessibility to bike paths and B-Cycle expansion to cover the
new A-line commuter rail stations.
Residents of Montbello expressed concern over the consolidation of routes in the Montbello
neighborhood. The proposed changes will have a large negative impact on the community and
greatly increase the walking distance between routes. Consider that while decisions are made
based on ridership. If only, 4% this low percent could impact 12,000 people.
Montbello Residents also needed clarity around the proposed closure and relocation of the 40th
and Albrook Park-n-Ride to the Commuter Rail station at Smith Road and Peoria. There is a lot
of confusion around the Park-n-Ride is closing. Be careful about how communicating. It is
important to communicate that the Park part is closing but there will still be bus ride service at
that location. Although the bus service will still service the 40th and Albrook location, residents
are concerned about the safety of moving all bus boarding to Albrook. An alternative put forth
is to maintain the off-street turn around for the busses while moving the parking to the
Commuter Rail station. Residents are also willing to discuss additional alternatives that will
make boarding the bus at 40th and Albrook safe for all.
Residents requested that information be communicated better to the public about fare zones.
Stapleton residents charged RTD to look for more affordable solutions for bus passes (i.e.
income based bus passes) so one would not have to go through Department of Human Services
or some community agency.

City/County of Denver Comments on RTD Preliminary Service Plans
East and I-225 Corridors, Gold and Northwest Corridors
1. Station Area Plans - In the Relevant Studies section, it would be helpful to add all CCD station
area plans. CCD stations with completed station area plans relevant to these service plans
include 41st and Fox (Gold), 38th and Blake, Elyria-Swansea Neighborhood, and 61st and Pena (all
East). Many of these plans include bus service other transit related recommendations. Has RTD
reviewed these documents and considered any of the recommendations?
2. The plan and associated maps do not clearly explain what is happening to existing services
within the plan area. It would help if all routes not affected by any proposed changes are
identified in the document. Two examples noted include:
a. Route 48 – This route serves Elyria-Swansea and the Brighton Blvd corridor and it’s
omitted from the service plan. This route currently serves a key portion of Swansea that
should maintain service. Map 9 may show the route, but it is not marked, and map 10
appears to omit the route and others identified on map 9 that are not identified as
discontinued on that map.
b. Route 38 – This route on 38th Avenue is not mentioned in the Gold/NW plan document.
3. Pena Blvd Station (61st and Pena):
a. Please include in all plan maps
b. As the A line begins operations, it might be useful for RTD to monitor utilization patterns
of commuters for both the Pena Blvd and 40th and Airport stations. Potential demand
from residents in Commerce City (Reunion) and Green Valley Ranch may justify service
to the Pena Blvd Station via Tower Road in the near future.
4. All figures showing access to stations do not include bicycles. Several stations, such as 38th and
Blake and 41st and Fox may have a significant amount of access by bike. If data is available,
please include bicycle access in these figures. If bicycle access was not modeled, the plan should
note that omission and discuss how RTD is currently planning to provide bicycle parking at the
stations and willingness to monitor the need to calibrate bicycle parking at stations moving
forward.
5. Are there plans for improved wayfinding for riders to access the rail stations? Example is Route
34 is approximately 2 blocks from the 38th and Blake station but turns south on Downing. Riders
wishing to access DUS from Route 34 could alight at the Bruce Randolph/Downing stop and walk
to the 38th and Blake station if given notice of that opportunity.
6. Call-n-ride service is mentioned multiple times as a way to close gaps in the service area. It
would be beneficial if the plan details RTD’s current and future ability to provide enough
shuttles to meet this service demand (either through RTD or third party providers)
7. The first/last mile connection topic is gaining momentum in regional conversations. While RTD
has policy and funding limits on what can be implemented for the first/last mile connections for
other modes of travel in station/stop areas, it would be helpful to add in a general statement to
the service plans, in addition to alternative transit for first/last mile section, about what RTD is
able to implement to contribute those connections for other modes (bicycle, pedestrian, etc.),

CEO

Date: November 4, 2015

John Tarbert, Acting AGM, Safety, Security
and Facilities

GM

Date:

November 4, 2015

Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2015

Subject:

Authorization to purchase additional software
maintenance and new software licenses for
eFORCE

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO or his designee to amend an existing contract with
IntelliChoice (Contract 10DH020) exercise up to two additional option years for software
maintenance and to purchase new software licenses for the eFORCE Transit Fare Enforcement
Software and Records Management Software. The software maintenance is essential to maintain
the existing software. The new software licenses are needed to operate the software on a new
hardware device. This will increase the authorized amount by $600,000 from the current contract
value of $884,300 to a total authorized amount of $1,484,300.
BACKGROUND:
eFORCE is the current Citation and Records Management Software (RMS) for the Transit Police in the
Security Command Center (SCC). It is a webhosted solution that does not have central software or
records management at RTD facilities. This software has been successfully in use for the past four
years and contains RTD’s associated historic citation records. The eFORCE mobile (handheld) software
integrates with the eFORCE hosted software. The mobile handhelds provide the officers with immediate
access to a rider’s prior citations and allows an automated mobile process for citation issuance. The
eFORCE hosted software provides data warehousing and reporting capabilities.
The software
maintenance contract for this software expires on December 6, 2015 and needs to be renewed. There
are two option years for software maintenance in the existing contract.
RTD currently uses Motorola MC75 handheld units as handheld smart media readers (HSMRs). The
MC75 units are loaded with Xerox fare validation software, which enables RTD personnel to validate
fares and eFORCE citation software provides for, issuing of citations, if passengers are traveling without
valid fare. These handheld units are obsolete and it is nearly impossible for RTD to get replacement
units or repair parts. Another consideration is these units frequently freeze in the field when RTD
personnel try to switch between the Xerox and eFORCE software.
DISSCUSSION:
RTD plans to procure new HSMR devices to replace the obsolete Motorola handheld units. Additional
HSMRs will be procured to address fare enforcement for FasTrack expansion. Windows CE Embedded is
the operating system for the current software. It is no longer fully supported. Therefore, updated fare
validation and citation software will be needed for the new HSMR devices from both IntelliChoice and
Xerox.

Packet Pg. 80

2.13.D

Based on an assessment of RTD’s needs, peer agency review and a market review of potential devices,
RTD has identified Apple iOS based devices as the future corporate standard for HSMR devices. The
unit cost for each iPhone with peripherals is about $1000 less than the initial cost of the Motorola
handheld units. Because we plan to purchase 175 units, this is $175,000 in savings. For other
agencies the vendor, eFORCE has also developed an iOS based fare enforcement software application
and RTD is planning to procure and implement this on the new HSMR devices.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding of $290,640 for the two years of software maintenance options is included in the 2015 and
2016 expense budgets for Safety, Security and Facilities. Funding for the new eFORCE software
licenses is included in the 2016 SBP.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to amend the contract with
IntelliChoice (Contract 10DH020) to exercise up to additional two option years for eFORCE
software maintenance and purchase new software licenses for the eFORCE iOS Transit Fare
Enforcement Software. This action grants authority to amend the contract in an amount not
to exceed $1,484,300. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to amend the contract with
IntelliChoice (Contract 10DH020) to exercise up to additional two option years for eFORCE
software maintenance and purchase new software licenses for the eFORCE iOS Transit Fare
Enforcement Software. This is not recommended because RTD Transit Police would be
unable to provide automated fare violation citations or records management for fare violators.
RTD’s historical citation records with IntelliChoice would need to be obtained and archived for
records management.

2016 Salaried Benefit Plans

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the 2016 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the Interim General Manager and CEO
or his designee to enter into agreements with the Insurance Carriers.
BACKGROUND
Annually the staff brings the proposed Salaried Employee Benefits plan for approval to the Board of
Directors. Approval of the plan by the Board establishes the rates for Open Enrollment and provides
costs for the 2016 Budget. The Open Enrollment period for salaried staff begins November 15 through
November 29, 2015.
DISCUSSION
The goals for the 2016 plan year are: 1) Achieve the 2016 budget goals, 2) Continued focus on
containing cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism, 3) Maintain market
competitiveness, and 4) Insure compliance with PPACA – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Health Care Reform provisions as applicable to RTD).
Following is a summary of the modest changes for the 2016 plan year.
Medical
- Cigna administers two self-funded plans on behalf of RTD. Both the PPO Plan and the HDHP (High
Deductible Health Plan) Plan have a specific individual $150,000 stop-loss ceiling in 2016. The
administrative cost will increase by 7.7% in 2016. The Cigna Plans are estimated to have
approximately 506 employees enrolled. 2015 claims are running at expected claims YTD and 2016
claims are currently projected to be slightly higher than 2015 levels.
-

Kaiser provides 2 Plan Options: a DHMO (HMO Plan with deductibles), and a HDHP. The Kaiser
plans are estimated to have approximately 209 employees enrolled. This plan has proposed a 5%
blended increase over 2015.

-

The employee cost share for 2016 will be 10% for the Cigna PPO and Kaiser DHMO plans and 5%
for the Cigna HDHP and Kaiser HDHP plans.

-

Cigna has agreed to provide $15,000 to our wellness program in 2016.

Dental
- No carrier/plan changes and a 0% renewal rate increase, we are currently in an Administrative rate
guarantee through 2016. Claims have held steady this year so we anticipate this will continue in

Packet Pg. 82

2.13.E

2016.
Life & Disability
-

Basic Life Insurance/AD&D, Voluntary Life/AD&D, Long and Short Term Disability are under a multiyear rate guarantee; however we have anticipated a 3% increase in these plans based on increase in
salary dollars for 2016. Life Insurance and LTD premiums are salary based.

Vision/Business Travel Accident
- Vision Plan is currently a fully insured plan with Anthem Blue Cross – Blue Shield. A rate guarantee
is in effect through 2016 so there will be no increase in premium.
-

We are currently in the renewal stage for the organization’s Business Travel Accident insurance; I do
not expect an increase in premium as there have been no claims on the insurance in 2015.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2016 planned Salaried Employee Insured Benefit budget is projected to be a 5% increase over 2015
projected benefit costs. RTD’s current utilization and projections are below the medical trend of 8.6%.
With the additional costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, the overall benefit budget increase is
projected to be 5% over 2015.
The major cost impacts in 2016 are due to Cigna Plan increases of 7.7%. The net additional benefit
costs anticipated in 2016 are essentially flat. Reduction in the Transitional Reinsurance fees and rate
guarantees are responsible for results of an approximate overall 5% increase over last year. This is the
sixth year we have achieved strong cost containment as a result of our shift in carriers, plan offerings,
plan design and funding models.
The 2016 estimate of the Salaried Employee Insured Benefits is $10,783,499. The projected increase
of 5% results in an increase of a projected $547,768 in 2016. The increase meets the projected costs in
the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). Statewide, average healthcare insurance is expected to increase seven
percent in 2016.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the 2016 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorize the General Manager
or his designee to enter into agreements with the Insurance Carriers.
2. Further modify the salaried employee benefit plans to be offered in 2016. This is not
recommended since it would require additional negotiations with benefit providers and delay
the employee enrollment period.
3. Do not approve the recommended salaried employee benefit plans. This is not recommended, as
this will result in the Agency being unable to provide competitive and cost effective benefit
plans to the salaried employees.

2016 FasTracks Public Information Consultant
Contract Award

Discussion

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the Interim General Manager and CEO to approve the fourth one-year option to the Virtegic Group,
Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach Consultant,
extending the period of performance through 2016, the final year of the contract. The scope of work
is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD
Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment is for an amount not to exceed
$745,411.52 for the year 2016. Funds for the award are contained in the 2016 Recommended
Budget for the FasTracks program.
BACKGROUND
Utilizing a Public Information Consultant team to extend the staffing needs of the FasTracks Public
Information Program contributes to the agency’s Board adopted goal to Advance/Complete
FasTracks.
In October 2011, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for a Public Information , Communications and
Public Outreach Consultant to serve as an extension of staff in the implementation of the FasTracks
Public Information Program. Following a comprehensive evaluation process, Virtegic Group,
Incorporated, a certified SBE firm, was selected for this contract award, at a rate that was
approximately half that of the previous Public Information Consultant.
The procurement was set up as a one-year contract award with four one-year options, negotiated
annually by RTD and Consultant Staff and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors. This gives
RTD the opportunity to assess and address the public information and outreach needs of the
FasTracks program on an annual basis as the program evolves. The services needed through this
contract may be reduced or increased from year to year depending on the future financial situation
and changing needs of the FasTracks program.
Virtegic began its work in January 2012 and the RTD Board approved th ree previous option years
through 2015. In the three years of working as the FasTracks public information consultant so far,
the Virtegic team members have satisfactorily performed their work assignments and have remained
flexible in meeting the needs of the public information program during several key staff transitions.
They are also playing a key role in augmenting RTD Public Relations outreach, as FasTracks projects
begin transitioning into base system operational services.
DISCUSSION
The initial contract to Virtegic for 2012 was in the amount of $451,459.20. The first one-year
option for 2013 was $485,167.20. The second one-year option for 2014 was $487,308.80. The
third one-year option for 2015 was $686,009.60. The fourth one-year option for 2016 is not to
exceed $745,411.52 bringing the total on this contract to $2,855,356.32. The option to provide

Packet Pg. 86

2.14.F

additional staffing to assist with specific corridor public information project outreach as well as
preparation for the FasTracks project openings in 2016 is being exercised. It is crucial that proper
amounts of staff who have direct experience with RTD’s programs, procedures and policies be in
place to provide adequate resources for the unprecedented five rapid transit line openings in 2016,
something with which no other transit agency has ever been tasked.
The FasTracks Public Information Program is implemented through six functional areas: Internal
Relations, Government Relations, Media Relations, Public Involvement, Public Outreach, and Crisis
Communications. The 2016 PIC scope of work is divided into the PI Program’s functional areas.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for this fourth and final one-year option are included in the 2016 Recommended Budget for
the FasTracks program.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the fourth and final

Packet Pg. 88

2.14.F

one-year option to the Virtegic Group, Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information,
Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period of performance through
2016. The scope of work is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant staff, and
awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment
is for an amount not to exceed $745,411.52 for the year 2016, the final year of the contract.
Funds for the award are contained in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the Public Information Consultant approach.
This is not recommended as RTD doesn’t currently have the staff to provide a sufficient level of
resources to meet the public information, communications and public outreach needs of the
FasTracks program and specific FasTracks design and construction projects, especially given the
fact that RTD is opening an unprecedented five major transit lines in 2016. This alternative would
delay and negatively impact the effective implementation of the FasTracks Public Information
Program.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
fourth and final one-year option to Virtegic Group, Incorporated. Issue another Request for
Proposals for professional services for Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach
for the FasTracks Program and award a contract to another consulting team. This is not
recommended as the Virtegic team is satisfactorily performing its work and has been flexible in
meeting the changing communication needs of the FasTracks program. Also, this alternative will
delay and negatively impact the successful implementation of the various strategies and activities
associated with a comprehensive and multi-layered communications effort, especially given the
fact that RTD is opening an unprecedented five major transit lines in 2016.

Approval of Contract Amendment to Jacobs
Engineering for FasTracks Program Support
Consulting Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the Interim General Manager and CEO to approve a contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in an
amount not to exceed $22,579,180, for Program Support Services Consulting for FasTracks through
June 30, 2017. Funding in the amount of $16,934,180 for the 2016 work program is included in
the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where
PSC support would be utilized. Funding for the balance of the contract through June 30, 2017 is
included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation for 2017, and will be appropriated in the specific
projects in the 2017 capital budget.
BACKGROUND
On May 24, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to CarterBurgess (later purchased by Jacobs Engineering) for Program Support Consulting Services at an initial
2005 Contract amount of $2,360,000, and a Notice to Proceed of July 5, 2005. The RTD Board has
approved subsequent contract amendments that have brought the current Contract Not-to-Exceed price
up to $168,844,156.
The Contract Not-to-Exceed price through the end of 2016 with this contract amendment would be
$185,778,336. The total contract not-to-exceed value through June 30, 2017, which is the contract
end date, would be $191,423,336.
The PSC team provides program management support and specialized technical staff support to augment
RTD FasTracks Team staff. Key PSC staff members are co-located with RTD Staff at the RTD FasTracks
offices. The PSC functions as an extension of RTD staff. This approach adds value, cost-effectively, by
allowing RTD to tap the PSC’s specialized resources in planning, environmental, design, engineering,
construction management support, program control, and related disciplines on an as-needed, often parttime, basis.
Further, as the focus of the FasTracks program has shifted from planning and design to construction and
start up, the staff resources required for support of the program shift similarly. The PSC role has
changed, and will continue to change, to meet the evolving needs of the FasTracks program. This
flexibility allows RTD to retain the core staff required for implementation of the FasTracks program,
without having to continually (and inefficiently) staff up and then staff down in the planning, design, and
construction management disciplines.
Some of the key deliverables and assistance, in process or received, from the Jacobs/PSC team in 2015
included:

Packet Pg. 90

2.14.G



Participation in the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) that resulted in the revised financial plan that
was adopted by the Board in August 2015.



Supported day-to-day management of the Eagle P3 project, including preparing amendments to the
original contract, project coordination, construction audits, railroad coordination, and coordination
with outside agencies.



Supported the design review and coordination with stakeholders for the North Metro Project.



Provided design and construction management support of I-225 LRT Project.



Provided ongoing support in Planning, Engineering, Project Controls and DBE/SBE/WIN support.



Supported the New Starts submittal, helped prepare the Request for Proposal (RFP), and Full Funding
Agreement Grant Application for the Southeast Rail Extension.



Maintained the programwide project controls functions including cost, schedule, estimating, change
management, and document control.



Supported ROW design, survey, and property acquisition for all projects.

DISCUSSION
The Program Support Services Contract was specified for a term of six years with a six-year option, to
be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work tasks. The purpose of the annual re-negotiation of
the contract is to ensure that specific tasks and deliverables respond to the evolving needs of the
FasTracks Program.
The PSC serves as an extension of RTD staff. RTD staff provides overall management and control of
the FasTracks program and administration of this contract. The PSC provides key personnel to a number
of tasks. These assignments are based on focusing the PSC effort to:


Areas of specialized expertise or experience.



Part-time assignments.



Shorter duration efforts.



Positions that are difficult for RTD to fill.

Each position in the FasTracks organization is evaluated individually to determine whether that position
falls within the above criteria for using a consultant. In addition, before a consultant is actually brought

RTD expects the PSC effort to be reduced substantially in 2017. The Eagle and I-225 projects are
scheduled to open in 2016, leaving a reduced need for project support through closeout. In addition, the
contract term only extends through the first six months of the year. Therefore, the estimated maximum
contract cost for 2017 is approximately one-third of the cost for 2016. The specific work scope for
2017 would be established in late 2016.
RTD has established a 7% DBE goal for this Contract. The latest DBE report indicates that the PSC’s
actual cumulative DBE percentage has been 20.2%. For 2016, the PSC has committed to 19% DBE
participation, well in excess of the 7% goal. Additionally, while not in their contract, the PSC has
committed to continuing their participation in the WIN program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the PSC contract from 2005 through 2017, would be
$191,423,336 with this amendment. Funding in the amount of $16,934,180 for the 2016 work
program is included in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific
projects where PSC support would be utilized. Funding for the balance of the contract through June 30,
2017 is included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation for 2017, and will be appropriated in the
specific projects in the 2017 capital budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to
Jacobs Engineering, in an amount not to exceed $22,579,180, for Program Support Services
Consulting for FasTracks through June 30, 2017. Funding in the amount of $16,934,180 for the
2016 work program is included in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program
in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized. Funding for the balance of the contract
through June 30, 2017 is included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation for 2017, and will be
appropriated in the specific projects in the 2017 capital budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
eighth year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering. Rather, perform all the work in-house with
RTD staff. This is not recommended as RTD does not have the staff to provide a sufficient level of
expertise in a cost-effective approach to manage the FasTracks Program (As described in the
Background section, the PSC team can provide the technical specialties on an as needed basis).
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Re-solicit this work to another consulting team. This is not
recommended as the PSC is satisfactorily performing its work assignments and providing valuable
technical and project management assistance to the RTD team.
Selection of alternatives two or three would delay the implementation of the FasTracks Program as there
would be a major loss of continuity on the program.

Approval of 2016 – 2017 Contract
Amendment to Delcan for FasTracks Quality
Management Consultant Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the Interim General Manager and CEO to approve the 2016 – 2017 Contract Amendment for Delcan in
the amount of $2,669,575 for FasTracks Quality Management Consulting Services. The term of this
Contract Amendment covers the period of January 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017 when the Contract
ends. The cost breakdown for 2016 and 2017 are $1,662,900 and $1,006,675 respectively. Funds for
the amendment are contained in the 2016 RTD FasTracks Budget.
BACKGROUND
On June 28, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to Delcan for
Quality Management Consulting Services at an initial 2005 contract price of $418,539, and a Notice to
Proceed of August 1, 2005. This contract was set up to run for an initial six-year term, re-negotiated
and amended annually, based on the needs of the program. The contract also included provisions for a
six-year option.
On December 13, 2005, the RTD Board approved a second year contract amendment for 2006 in the
amount of $1,100,000.
On November 14, 2006, the RTD Board approved a third year contract amendment for 2007 in the
amount of $1,500,000.
On November 20, 2007, the RTD Board approved a fourth year contract amendment for 2008 in the
amount of $1,335,000.
On November 18, 2008, the RTD Board approved a fifth year contract amendment for 2009 in the
amount of $1,340,000.
On November 17, 2009, the RTD Board approved a sixth year contract amendment for 2010. The
actual cost proposal for the 2010 workscope was $1,400,000; but because of cumulative budget
underruns from previous years, the total Contract Not-to-Exceed price only needed to be increased by
$600,000 in order to deliver the 2010 work.
On November 23, 2010, the Board approved a seventh year contract amendment for 2011 in the
amount of $1,550,000, and authorized the six-year option included in the original contract.
On November 22, 2011, the Board approved an eighth year contract amendm ent for 2012 in the
amount of $1,645,422.
On November 20, 2012, the Board approved a ninth year contract amendment for 2013 in the
amount of $1,699,247.

For the time being, they continue to

Some of the key deliverables and assistance received from the Delcan/QMC team in 2015 include:


Establishment of a Quality Oversight Program for Contracted work
o Revised Quality Oversight Program procedures.
o Maintained RTD’s requirements database to incorporate changes as projects transitioned
from design to construction.
o Updated QMO Database applications to provide user-requested functionality, improved
reporting features, and improved planning tools.
o Provided QMO training for new team members, stakeholders, and contractors.
o Assisted in setting up design reviews, construction verification inspections, and process
audits for all projects.
o Performed management system audits of Contractor QA programs.

and project controls procedures.

DISCUSSION
The Quality Management Consultant contract was specified for an initial term of six years, with a sixyear option, to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work scope. The purpose of the annual
re-negotiation of the contract was to ensure that specific tasks and deliverables responded to the needs
of the FasTracks program. Because 2017 is only a partial year and the scope will be largely the same as
2016, the work is being incorporated into what is expected to be a final Contract Amendment. For 2016
- 2017, related RTD work includes design-build of the Eagle Project, I225 Corridor, North Metro Rail
Line, and Southeast Rail Extension. The following tasks/substasks highlight the assistance to be
provided by the Delcan/QMC Team in 2016 - 2017:
 Establishment of a Quality Management Oversight (QMO) Program for Contracted work
o Revise Quality Oversight Program manual and procedures as required.
o Maintain RTD’s requirements database to incorporate changes.
o Maintain/update QMO Database applications to incorporate program improvements.
o Provide QMO training for new team members, stakeholders, and contractors.

RTD has established a 5% DBE Goal for this Contract. Delcan’s actual cumulative DBE percentage to
date has been 8.5%. For the 2016 – 2017 term, Delcan has committed to 7.3% DBE participation,
exceeding the established goal as they have every year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for this contract amendment are included in the 2016 RTD FasTracks budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1.

Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the 2016 - 2017 contract
amendment to Delcan in the amount of $2,669,575. Funds for the award are contained in the
2016 FasTracks budget.

2.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
2016 - 2017 contract amendment to Delcan. Rather, perform all of the work in-house with RTD
staff. This is not recommended, as RTD doesn’t have certain skills required to fully develop the
Quality Management program.

3.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
2016 - 2017 contract amendment to Delcan. Rather, re-solicit and award this work to another
consulting team. This is not recommended, as Delcan is satisfactorily performing its work
assignments and providing valuable quality management assistance to the RTD team.

Station Names for Eagle P3 Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors accept and
approve the proposed station name for the Eagle P3 Project “Gateway Station” as follows.
East Corridor:
Peña & 61st
BACKGROUND:
Station names for the East Corridor were originally assigned during the East Corridor Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) completed in 2009. At the time the East Corridor EIS was completed, there were
no plans to include a station along Peña Boulevard between the 40th Ave. & Airport Blvd. • Gateway
Park Station and the Denver Airport Station. However, included in the Intergovernmental Agreement
between RTD and Denver International Airport is a provision that up to two “Gateway Stations” may be
added to the East Corridor along Peña Boulevard. At the time of IGA execution the potential station
locations were understood to be in the general vicinity of 72nd and Dunkirk and 62nd and Peña Boulevard.
In 2014, RTD and DIA concluded negotiations to include one of the potential stations to the East
Corridor at the 62nd and Peña Boulevard location. Since the station was added after the East Corridor
EIS was completed, there was no previous name associated with this station although “Peña Blvd” has
been shown on plans, fact sheets and the website. Through discussions with Denver Transit Partners,
the concessionaire on the Eagle P3 Project, it was determined that a deadline of Dec. 01, 2015 for the
official station name would allow sufficient time to integrate the name into the signage design package,
systems packages for LED and LCD monitor displays, and audio announcements; and operations
documents.
The Board previously approved the station names for the Eagle P3 Project in the December 17, 2013
Board Meeting. Since the negotiations for the addition of the “Gateway Station” were ongoing at the
time, an official station name for the “Gateway Station” was not included for approval in the December
17, 2013 Board Meeting.
After the incorporation of the “Gateway Station” into the Eagle P3 Project, Eagle Project staff and DIA
staff coordinated to develop the recommended station name included in this report. Following that
discussion, the staff recommended the following name: Peña Boulevard
In Mid-October 2015, the Eagle Design Team issued an official letter to Denver International Airport to
advise them of the proposed station name and provide them with the opportunity to request an alternate
station name, if deemed appropriate and conforming to all the requirements of the RTD Station Naming
Policy. Denver International Airport also would have to submit a completed RTD Station Naming Form.
The goal was to avoid a later request from the stakeholder after DTP’s incorporation of the name into
the Eagle P3 Project.

Packet Pg. 98

2.14.I

DISCUSSION:
After RTD notified Denver International Airport of the RTD recommended station name, RTD received
confirmation that the RTD staff proposed change was acceptable. Subsequently, at the November 3,
2015 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meeting, the RTD Board Committee considered and approved a
modified recommendation as depicted in this Board Report to name the station Peña & 61st. This name
is consistent with RTD’s Station Naming Policy that facilities “should usually be named for the nearest
street intersections, major cross streets, or the name of the geographic location of the area.” This
Station Naming Policy was established in November 2003 and reconfirmed in May 2011.
Staff Recommendation: Adopt Peña Boulevard
Staff recommends the acceptance of the name Peña Boulevard for the additional “Gateway Station”.
This name is consistent with current RTD policy and is identified with the geographic location of the
area. This proposed name has been discussed to some length between RTD and DIA staff and the
parties are in agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no negative financial impact to the project at this time. DTP is requiring RTD confirmation of the
official Station Name prior to Dec. 01, 2015, in order to avoid costs that would be incurred with
changing station name after DTP commences with station signage and systems packages. RTD sought
local government input now in order to avoid redesign costs later. Any station name changes after Dec.
01, 2015, could have cost implications to either RTD or stakeholders.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the Board of Directors accept and approve the proposed station name for the additional
“Gateway Station” as follows:
a. Peña & 61st
2. Do not accept the recommended action. Instead propose an alternative name that is consistent
with the current RTD policy for station names. This is not recommended as it would not be
responsive to previous discussions with a key stakeholder. In addition, it would potentially impact
DTP’ ability to incorporate the station name into the Eagle Project without additional costs to
RTD.

Approval of 2016 Contribution for the Salaried
Employee's Retirement Plans

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopt a 2016 contribution of $4.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust
(the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2016 contribution of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount
to the plan for each year of employment.
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9% of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION
DB Plan
In 2012, the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan
would be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a
result of the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the
DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a
“fully funded” status for the plan in the future.
The actuaries have updated the DB Plan projections to reflect the final 1/1/2015 valuation assumptions
for the DB Plan. The 2016 Actuary recommended contribution is $6 million. The $6 million contribution
would continue through 2020 decreasing to $5.1 million in 2021 and then $3.1 million thereafter until
100% funding is reached in 2034. This option has been deemed too costly to fund at this time.
The recommendation is to increase the annual fixed contribution by $1 million to $4.1 million. If this is
done for 2016 and beyond, it is projected that the plan would be 100% funded by 2036.
If the existing $3.1 million contribution is maintained, the plan is not expected to reach 100% funding
until long after 2036 which is outside of the 20 year goal to have the plan 100% funded.

Packet Pg. 100

2.14.J

DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2015.

The assumed contributions indicate the different amounts that would be required to fund the plan at

ALTERNATIVES

Directors adopts a 2016 contribution of $4.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined
Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is
also recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2016 contribution of 9% of each
participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC

amounts have been included in the 2016 Recommended Budget.
2. The RTD Board of Directors could certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust or the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution
Plan at amounts other than $4.1 million and 9%, respectively.
3. Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plans. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

Proposed 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves and adopts the 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement.
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the
proposed Policy for the upcoming fiscal year for approval to the Board of Directors as an initial step
in development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and Recommended Budget.
The most recent modification to the Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in October 2014
for the 2015 fiscal year. Those changes primarily related to clarifying that 1) the fund balance is
maintained to meet not only unanticipated expenditures and increases in costs, but also to mitigate
service disruptions as a result of economic downturns affecting revenue, and 2) the budget is
prepared using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles excluding the non-cash portion of long-term
unfunded pension accruals. The Policy Statement was also updated with the most recent rating
agency credit ratings at the time.
DISCUSSION
For 2016, the following major changes are proposed.
Revenue Policies #1 is amended to add the following in accordance with the objectives of the revised
fare schedule in 2016: “As part of this process, staff will review potential fare adjustments to
establish a fare structure to ensure that it: is understandable, is implementable, is equitable,
achieves revenue levels established in the Strategic Budget Plan, and facilitates the integration of the
2016 rail and BRT projects.” (amendment in italics)
Revenue Policies #7 is added as follows: “RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide
sales and use tax forecasting containing projections for the short-term (one year by quarter),
medium-term (six year SBP period) and long-term (30-year APE period). The purpose is to provide
RTD with expert economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using sophisticated financial
modeling techniques not available internally.”
Expenditure Policies #5 is amended to add the following: “RTD will invest in a safety outreach
programs and personnel to communicate safety messages.” (amendment in italics)

Packet Pg. 104

2.14.K

Capital Improvement Policies #1 last bullet point is amended to add the following: “RTD mission
statement elements, Board strategic goals, and other relevant criteria.” (amendment in italics)
Debt Policies #2 is amended as follows: “Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds,
Certificates of Participation (COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to
exceed the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.” (amendment in italics)
Debt Policies #4 is amended as follows: “Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service
on total annual expenditures and the net revenue coverage ratio will be analyzed.” (amendment in
italics)
Budget Policies #2 is deleted; the relevance of budgeting on a program/project basis has diminished.
The Policy Statement is updated with the most recent rating agency credit ratings in effect at this
date.
All other proposed changes to the Policy Statement are primarily wording clarification and are
reflected in the attachment.
Please see the attachment for the full proposed document with changes indicated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Fiscal Policy Statement as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2016
Recommended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended changes to RTD’s 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement. Staff supports
this alternative because the Policy Statement documents the policies to be adhered to in 2016
and provides clarification of certain practices.
2. Board further modifies the recommended changes. Staff reviewed the fiscal policies and
welcomes any suggestions for modifications requested by the Board of Directors.
3. Do not adopt the RTD 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not recommended because
RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current language, would not adhere to
best practices, and would not best facilitate the needs of RTD’s financial operations.

annually at the time of the development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). As
part of this process, staff will review potential fare adjustments to establish a fare
structure with due consideration forto ensure that it:
 consistency and equity throughout RTD;is understandable
 ease of use and simplicity;is implementable
 maintaining or increasing ridership and fare revenues;is equitable
 acceptability and marketability of fare structure to customers and the general
public;achieves revenue levels established in the Strategic Budget Plan, and
 verification and enforceability of fare payment compliancefacilitates the
integration of the 2016 rail and BRT projects.
2. Fare policies will take into account the special needs of all transit dependent,
elderly, youth, student, handicapped, and commuter patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.
6. On an annual basis, Sstaff will identify on an annual basis excessunder- or unutilized property and equipment, and will make an ongoing attempt to sell such
excess property and equipment to enhance cash flow.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT POLICIES
1. On an annual basis, RTD will prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital construction and improvements,
service levels, and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating
programs. Capital projects to be included in the SBP will be evaluated using the
following criteria:
 total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
 source of funding;
 operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the SBP period;
 benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited
to the effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and
ridership;
 consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); consequences of not
funding; and
 RTD mission statement elements, Board strategic goals, and other relevant
criteria..
2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks financial plan (see #7 below.).
3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted SBP as the basis for
the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If
the cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be
brought to the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future
technological changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the
public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance
with the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks financial plan incorporating the
actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital
improvement costs, service levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the
FasTracks capital and operating programs.

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective November 17, 2015

1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and in the FasTracks
operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring
nature, to meet unexpected increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as
a result of economic downturns affecting revenue. This unrestricted fund balance
will be comprised of a Board appropriated fund, a capital replacement fund and an
undesignated working capital fund as described below. For the Base System, the
total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount approximately equal
to three months of Base System operating expenses excluding depreciation. For
FasTracks, the total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount
approximately equal to two months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding
depreciation. RTD will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund
balance replenishment. For example, RTD may define the revenue sources that
would typically be looked to for replenishment of fund balance to include nonrecurring revenues and budget surpluses. Year-end surpluses are an especially
appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as severe economic downturns. With
Board approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce
the need for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade
bond rating. The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for
scheduled major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases. The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and will take place in a prompt manner.
4. RTD will designate excess and undesignated working capital that may accrue at
each year-end to be placed in an unrestricted fund to be used to respond to
unanticipated events.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado
Constitution.
6. The Board shall establish three reserves for future construction under the
FasTracks plan:

The FasTracks Contingency Reserve will be appropriated at a sufficient level of
$30 million each year. These funds will be available to fund adjustments to the
FasTracks construction schedule, relating to logistics or cost savings
opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is adopted, and will not
be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System capital or operating activity.
The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding
for future FasTracks projects that are currently unfunded. Expenditures from
the FISA will be subject to Board approval with the staff recommended project
goals identified in the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Funding of the FISA will be
provided from the sources identified in the Board approved RAM and other
sources approved by the Board.
All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a
reserve for future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be
used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System expenditures.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO, or his designee, to execute a contract with IQBG for
ECM Owners Representative Services. The initial contract period will extend through February 28,
2017, with two additional one-year options, and the initial contract amount will be $653,230. Funding
for the initial contract period is included in the 2015 Amended Budget and the 2016 Recommended
Budget.
BACKGROUND
In July 2014, RTD engaged Ciber to conduct an assessment of enterprise content management (ECM) at
RTD. This assessment, which was completed in November 2014, assessed the current state of ECM at
RTD, identified the top needs for ECM at RTD, and presented RTD with a path forward to meet those
needs. The Ciber assessment identified 65 different systems that were being used for content
management at RTD, which led to a lack of consistency in content management across the different
areas of the District. The top four needs identified by Ciber were:





Integrated ECM platforms
Organization wide uniform taxonomy (data classification and naming conventions)
Easy and robust search
Single source of “truth”

Ciber also recommended an information governance structure for RTD and proposed an implementation
plan to reach a coordinated ECM solution. RTD implemented the recommended governance structure by
the start of 2015. Through this structure, it was determined that RTD did not have the in-house
resources and technical expertise to implement an ECM solution. Therefore, staff decided to bring on an
owners representative to provide this specialized expertise in order to implement a successful ECM
program at RTD.
DISCUSSION
RTD issued a Request for Proposals for ECM Owners Representative Services on July 1, 2015. The RFP
was a best value procurement based on the following six evaluation criteria:






Understanding of technical, institutional, logistical, operational issues and solutions
Cost
Experience and commitment of project manager
Experience of the firms
Experience and commitment of key staff



Project plan

On August 4, 2015 RTD received proposals from three firms:




IQBG
Ciber
Triunity Engineering and Management

An evaluation committee consisting of representatives from different departments evaluated the
proposals, and determined that the IQBG proposal represented the best value to RTD. The IQBG team,
including the project manager and key staff, presented the strongest technical expertise in the areas of
content and records management. IQBG has extensive prior experience with similar projects in the
public sector, and staff received favorable references from previous clients. IQBG’s proposal also
showed the best understanding of the issues, and the most comprehensive project plan. Finally, the
IQBG proposal was the lowest cost of the three proposals received. IQBG also met the SBE goal of 8%
established by the Small Business Opportunity Office.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the initial contract amount of $653,230 is included in the 2015 Amended Budget and the
2016 Recommended Budget. Funding for potential option years is programmed in the 2016-2021
Strategic Budget Plan as a part of the ECM implementation project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute
a contract with IQBG for ECM Owners Representative Services. The initial contract period will
extend through February 28, 2017, with two additional one-year options, and the initial contract
amount will be $653,230. Funding for the initial contract period is included in the 2015
Amended Budget and the 2016 Recommended Budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead, use in-house staff to perform all necessary
work to implement an ECM solution. This is not recommended because RTD staff does not have
the specialized technical expertise to perform this work to the level needed to ensure successful
implementation of an ECM solution.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not proceed with implementation of a District-wide
ECM solution.
Instead, continue with the current piecemeal implementation of content
management at the District. This is not recommended because the current implementations are
inefficient, and ultimately will cost the District more funds and staff time than a comprehensive
ECM solution.
