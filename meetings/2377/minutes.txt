November Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Sisk moved briskly through the agenda. He noted that Michael Gil will be retiring.
IGM Genova commented that Mike has served this agency well and will be coming back
on an adjunct basis to help out during the transition. Gina Callahan will be acting. They
are trying to encourage Mike to come to the Board meeting to receive his plaque. Chair
Sisk asked what do we normally give to retirees. IGM Genova indicated that depending on
the number of service years, they get a plaque and a retirement gift (watch) plus a going
away party if desired. Director Hoy noted that Mike Gil was the first RTD employee he
had met since he has worked the Bronco Ride for years and Mike Gil would be hustling
during these events. Mike Gil was his face for the agency
Chair Sisk noted there will be an update on the General Manager Executive Search
process. Director Bagley will also be providing an update for the General Manager
Oversight and Performance Management Committee.
Motion:

Director Menten made the motion to approve moving
the November Board meeting agenda before the full
Board on November 17.
Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Chair Sisk reviewed the items on the agenda and stated
that Heather Copp is a breath of fresh air in how she
delivers information to the Board.
There were no questions under unanimous consent so
the committee discussed some of the recommended
action items. On item F, 2016 FasTracks Public
Information Consultant Contract, Chair Sisk noted how
appalling it was how the Board treated staff on this
issue. He stated he went out to apologize to Virtegic
and noted some of the team members were in tears.
These are really good people and he believes we can
vote on an item without taking people to task in a
public setting. Director Bagley commented that our
public decorum is atrocious and this is why he wants
our meetings to be televised. Director Walker
concurred and stated he did not understand the
discussion. The discussion did not appear to be on
failure in the scope of work but more personal in
nature. It is really up to the Board members to convince
other Board members to vote a certain way and it is out
of line for the Board to speak to staff and our
contractors in such a manner. Director Tobiassen
stated that he agrees and had personally apologized as
well.
Item I, Station Name for Eagle P3 Project—Director Hoy
asked Director Folska about her comments and if she
had an intention of bringing an amendment on this item
in the meeting. Director Folska stated she did not at
this time but did note that from a policy consistency
perspective as well as way finding, and navigation, this
should be consistent. Director Walker indicated he
plans to talk to Anthony Graves with the city to better
understand the city’s position on the order of the name.
IGM Genova indicated that staff had reviewed this and
discovered that most have the number to appear first;
Director Hoy stated that some do and some do not.
Director Bagley stated that in his district, neither the
Littleton/Downtown or the Mineral Station have a
number in the station naming.

Director Tobiassen stated his preference is that this
does not play out in the meeting but discussed offline.
If changes are made, the item can be pulled from the
agenda. Director Hoy shared that timing is important
and the station signs need to be ordered.
Item L, Electronic Content Management Contract –
Director Menten noted she has not received the copy of
the RFP that she had requested. IGM Genova indicated
that he has that and will send out today.
Vote on
Motion:

The Motion Passed with the Committee in favor.
Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED.

Other Matters

IGM Genova indicated they had a good and productive meeting with the North
Metro elected officials today. They shared the information on the cost to extend
the option for 2016. There were candid conversations and they got into a lot of
details. He believes the stakeholders appreciated the candor. He noted newly
elected Longmont council member, Joan Peck was in attendance. Director Hoy
indicated he thought it was good conversation and the stakeholders are beginning
to talk around “what can we do” to make this a more financially feasible option.
They appear willing to take a look at a number of demands such as improved roads,
etc. to see how that impacts this discussion. Director Hoy expressed he thinks the
tenor of the conversation is changing. Chair Sisk added he is happy that the staff
informed the Board prior to the meeting.
IGM Genova shared we had received invitations to the Alameda Station ribbon
cutting for Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. He will forward the invitation to the full Board.
Chair Sisk stated the invitation to speak had been forwarded to him and in keeping
with our protocols for the District, he has asked Director James to speak at this
event. This is one of our pilot events.
Chair Sisk indicated that the Grand Illumination at DUS will be this Thanksgiving
holiday and Director Archuleta will be lighting the lights.
Director Bagley had several comments:
o He, Directors Walker and James attended the Rail~Volution. He will have
more to talk about in the December meeting.
o He participated in the Boulder Junction ULI-this was an outstanding event.
o On November 2, staff and the Chair attended a meeting with the SW
corridor where they discussed the $125M expenditure needed and the $25M
already expended. This group is looking for ways to come up with the
money but do not have it yet. There were representatives from Douglas
County Commissioners and Highlands Ranch present for this meeting.
o They are looking at station master plans for downtown Littleton. He will be
participating in these meetings.
o He has met with Street Blog and will continue to push for increased
transparency for Board meetings using some form of video technology. It
may be the Chevrolet model initially but he believes we should come up to
par with all other city agencies on videotaping of their meetings. Chair Sisk
stated his regrets that he was not at the meeting to help promote a positive
vote for this service.



IV.

Chair Sisk referenced the win by Joan Peck for the Longmont City Council. She ran
on a platform that Longmont was not getting what they have been promised in
FasTracks. He expects this to be a strong message from Longmont and the
community. He noted the Longmont City Council had taken on RTD around the
building of the $17M station and noted there are not bathroom facilities. It is all
about communications and having open and continuous conversation with our
communities and stakeholders.
