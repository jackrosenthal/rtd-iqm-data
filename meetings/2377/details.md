## II. November Board Meeting Agenda Review

Chair Sisk moved briskly through the agenda.  He noted that Michael Gil will be retiring.  IGM Genova commented that Mike has served this agency well and will be coming back on an adjunct basis to help out during the transition.  Gina Callahan will be acting.  They are trying to encourage Mike to come to the Board meeting to receive his plaque.  Chair Sisk asked what do we normally give to retirees.  IGM Genova indicated that depending on the number  of service years , they get a plaque and a retirement gift (watch) plus a going away party if desired.   Director Hoy noted that Mike Gil was the first RTD employee he had met since he has worked the Bronco Ride for years and Mike Gil would be hustling during these events. Mike Gil was his face for the agency

Chair Sisk noted there will be an update on the General Manager Executive Search process.  Director bagley will also be providing an update for the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee.

Motion :              Director Menten made the motion to approve moving the November                                           Board meeting agenda before the full Board on November 17.

Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Chair Sisk reviewed the items on the agenda and                                                                       stated that Heather Copp is a breath of fresh air in how she delivers                                           information to the Board.  There were no questions under unanimous                                           consent so the committee discussed some of the recommended                                           action items.  On item F, 2016 FasTracks Public Information                                                         Consultant Contract. Chair Sisk noted how appalling it was how the                                           Board treated staff on this issue.  He stated he went out to apologize                                           to Virtegic and noted some of the teams were in tears.  These are                                           really good people and he believes we can vote on an item without                                           taking people to task in a public setting.  Director Bagley commented                                           that our public decorum is atrocious and this is why he wants our                                           meetings to be televised.  Director Walker concurred and stated he                                           did not understand the discussion.  The discussion did not appear to                                           be on failure in the scope of work but more personal in nature. It is                                           really up to the Board members to convince other Board members to                                           vote a certain way and it is out of line for the Board to speak to staff                                           and our contractors in such a manner.  Director Tobiassen stated that                             he agrees and had personally apologized as well.

Item I, Station Name for Eagle P3 Project—Director Hoy asked                                                         Director Folska about her comments and if she had an intention of                                           bringing an amendment on this item in the meeting.  Director Folska                                           stated she did not at this time but did note that from a policy                                                         consistency perspective as well as wayfinding, and navigation, this                                           should be consistent.  Director Walker indicated he plans to talk to                                           Anthony graves with the city to better understand the city’s position                                           on the order of the name.  IGM Genova indicated that staff had                                           reviewed this and discovered that most have the number to appear first; Director Hoy stated that some do and some do not.  Director Bagley stated that in his district, neither the Littleton downtown or the Mineral Station have a number in the station naming.

Director Tobiassen stated his preference is this does not play out in the meeting but discussed offline.  If changes are made, the item can be pulled from the agenda.  Director Hoy shared that timing is important and the station signs need to be ordered.

Item L, Electronic Content Management Contract, Director Menten noted she has not received the copy of the RFP that she had requested.  IGM Genova indicated that he has that and will send out today.

Vote on Motion:  The Motion Passed with the Committee in favor.

Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED.

## VI. Other Matters

- IGM Genova indicated they had a good and productive meeting with the North Metro elected officials today.  They shared the information on the cost to extend the option for 2016.  There were candid conversations and they got into a lot of details.  He believes the stakeholders appreciated the candor. He note newly elected Longmont council member, Jean Peck was in attendance.  Director Hoy indicated he thought it was good conversation and the stakeholders are beginning to talk around “what can we do” to make this a more financially feasible option.  They appear willing to take a look at a number of demands such as improved roads, etc to see how that impacts this discussion.  Director Hoy expressed he thinks the tenor of the conversation is changing.  Chair Sisk added he is happy that the staff informed the Board prior to the meeting.

- IGM Genova shared we had received invitations to the Alameda Station ribbon cutting for Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. He will forward the invitation to the full Board.  Chair Sisk stated the invitation to speak had been forwarded to him and in keeping with our protocols for the District, he has asked Director James to speak at this event.  This is one of our pilot events.

- Chair Sisk indicated that the Grand Illumination at DUS will be this Thanksgiving holiday and Director Archuleta will be lighting the lights.

- Director Bagley had several comments:

o        He, Directors Walker and James attended the RailVolution.  He will have more to talk about in the December meeting.

o        He participated in the Boulder Junction ULI-this was an outstanding event.

o        On November 2, staff and the Chair attended a meeting with the SW corridor where they discussed the $125M expenditure needed and the $25M already expended.  This group is looking for ways to come up with the money but do not have it yet.  There were representatives from Douglas County Commissioners  and Highlands Ranch present for this meeting.

o        They are looking at station master plans for downtown Littleton.  He will be participating in these meetings.

o        He has met with Street Blog and will continue to push for increased transparency for Board meeting using some form of video technology.  It may be the Chevrolet model initially but he believes we should come up to par with all other city agencies on videotaping of their meetings.  Chair Sisk stated his regrets that he was not at the meeting to help promote a positive vote for this service.

- Chair Sisk referenced the win by Joan Peck for the Longmont City Council.  She ran on a platform that Longmont was not getting what they have been promised in FasTracks.  He expects this to be a strong message from Longmont and the community.  He noted the Longmont City Council had taken on RTD around the building of the $17M station and noted there are not bathroom facilities. It is all about communications and having open and continuous conversation with our communities and stakeholders.
