Board Meeting Date:

Subject:

Approval of General Manager's 2020 Core &
Task Goals

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approves the General Manager’s goals for 2020 as defined in the attached General
Manager’s Performance Evaluation document.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee works with the General
Manager to enhance its oversight responsibilities for the General Manager’s performance and to develop
processes that are approved by the full Board and are transparent to the public.
On July 20, 2010, the Board formalized and approved the goal setting process for the General Manager.
That process defines the steps the Board will follow in establishing the annual goals for the General
Manager. Beginning in 2011, these goals include core and task goals. Core goals are based on the
General Manager’s job description and are generally considered part of the ongoing responsibilities of the
General Manager. The task goals are a compilation of the priorities from the annual Joint Board and
Staff Advance Planning Session that occurs in the first quarter of the year.
One of the steps in the process is to formalize the General Manager’s annual goals consistent with the
RTD employee evaluation process as well as elements of the approved GM contract approved in 2018.
This action item formalizes that process.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair and the full committee
have reviewed the 2020 core and task goals with the General Manager and approved the goals as
amended at the June 4, 2019 GMOC committee. This approval will move to the June 11, 2019 Finance,
Administration & Audit Committee and then to the full Board for final approval on June 18, 2019.
DISCUSSION
Please refer to the attached General Manager Performance Evaluation memo which identifies the five
core goals for 2020 and the 5 task goals for 2020. The attached General Manager Tactical Plan for
2020 is submitted as a supplement to this document.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact in approving the 2020 Goals.

1.B.1

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept this recommended action for approval of the General Manager’s 2020 goals. This
approval completes the formalized process as approved by the Board members for goal setting.
2. Do not accept this recommended action. Work with the General Manager Oversight and
Performance Management Committee and the General Manager to amend the 2020 goals. This
will significantly delay the schedule established for the approval of the goals.
3. Do nothing. Accept the risk and consequences of not complying with the State Auditor’s
recommendation for a clear, documented and timely process.
Related Board Policies: Board Policy on Goal Setting for the General Manager (approved 7/20/10)
Approval of 2010 General Manager’s Goals (approved 10/26/10)

1.B.1.a

This memo presents the proposed 2020 GM core and task goals in a memo, bullet point
format. For each core and task goal, the overall goal is listed followed by the criteria for
needs improvement, achieved goal, and exceeded expectations. The task goals are based
on the five strategic priorities from the 2019 Board/Senior Leadership Team retreat in
March 2019, the subsequent 2020 tactical plan, and the Board input/comments received
from the Board at the April 23 Tactical Plan Study Session presentation. Fiscal
sustainability applies to all goals. A common theme regarding the Board comments were
around the Address Transit Equity strategic priority including service coverage and
demographics. There are a number of specific goals to address these comments under
the strategic priorities of Address Transit Equity, Enhance Current and Future
Transportation Methods, and Increase Ridership. The proposed core and task goals will
be discussed at the May 14, 2019 GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee
meeting. This memo includes agreed upon changes as discussed at the May 14, 2019 GM
Oversight and Performance Management Committee meeting.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to move the phasing of the price increase due to the
2019 fare changes for CollegePass, EcoPass, and Neighborhood EcoPass from a 3 year phase-in period
to a 5 year phase-in period. This would extend the 20% cap on price increases to not only year 2019
and 2020 but also years 2021 and 2022 with the full implementation of the fare increase in 2023.
GM Goals
 GM Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
When the Board passed the new fare structure and pricing in September 2018, they requested that staff
continue to work with stakeholders on implementation issues particularly in the area of the CollegePass
program. Based on the Board’s direction, RTD staff has had many meetings with stakeholders over the
last 6 months and have looked into the many requests that we received. For example: Could we allow
CollegePass and EcoPass holders at the age of 19 and under to be priced at the 70% Youth discount?
Would we be open to having the tap data that is used for pricing to be audited? Would we be willing to
phase the price increases for CollegePass over 5 years instead of 3 years?
Staff has researched various options and has agreed to have the tap data audited by our financial
auditing firm on a three (3) year basis. In addition, we looked at the option of applying the youth
discount to the CollegePass program and phasing the price increases for the CollegePass over 5 years
instead of 3 years. Although we will not be pursuing the youth discount for CollegePass at this time,
there is merit in looking at expanding the phase-in period for CollegePass. The results are below. We
looked at applying the 5 year phase-in period to the CollegePass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and EcoPass as
these pass programs have similar program attributes and financial impacts to the customer and RTD.
DISCUSSION
Staff has spent the last several months working with our consultants to model the impacts of spreading
the implementation of the EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass pricing changes over 5
years instead of 3 years. Currently the increase for EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass
increases are capped at 20% in years 2019 and 2020 with the entire increase implemented in year
2021. This was a proposal from the Pass Working Group and was adopted by the Board.

Packet Pg. 28

1.B.2

The new proposal would move the phasing of the price increase from a 3 year phase-in period to a 5
year phase-in period. This would extend the 20% cap on price increases to not only year 2019 and
2020 but also years 2021 and 2022 with the full implementation of the fare increase in 2023.

** 100% utilization price including price increase due to assumed fare increase in 2022
The Modeling Assumptions Were as Follows:
 The revenue & ridership impact of extending the phasing are based on the model assumptions,
namely the degree of retention of organziations given price increases
 Modeling assumptions regarding retention were used to provide conservative revenue estimates
for price increases for pass program organizations
 Modeling assumed that all Colleges, Large Employers, and Master EcoPass contracts would remain
in RTD’s pass programs in both phasing scenarios.

Title VI Impacts:
 Phasing over 5 vs 3 years would not be considered a fare change
 To understand how the phasing would impact the overall average fare increase of riders in 2021, a
comparision of the increase in average fare for minority and low-income riders were compared to
all riders
 The percentage point change in the average fare between protected riders and all riders is within
RTD’s +/- 5% threshold under either phasing timeframe

Packet Pg. 29

1.B.2

FINANCIAL IMPACT
 Extending phasing would result in identical ridership but a loss in revenue in 2021 and 2022
 Estimated Revenue Loss
o 2021 - $1.5 million to $2.5 million
o 2022 - $1.5 million to $2.0 million
o 2023 - $0 to $500,000
o Total 2021-2023 is between $3 million and $5 million
 These estimated revenue changes will be incorporated in the upcoming 2020-2025 Mid-Term
Financial Plan, if this change is approved by the Board.
ALTERNATIVES
 Recommended Alternative: It is recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to move the phasing
of the price increase due to the 2019 fare changes for CollegePass, EcoPass, and Neighborhood
EcoPass from a 3 year phase-in period to a 5 year phase-in period. This would extend the 20%
cap on price increases to not only year 2019 and 2020 but also years 2021 and 2022 with the
full implementation of the fare increase in 2023.
 Other Alternative: Do not approve this action. The structure for phasing in the pass program
fare increase would stay the same.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to negotiate and execute contracts, including contract
amendments, to engage, or continue to engage, outside legal counsel to represent RTD for an additional
$4 million for a total amount not to exceed $12.5 million.
This recommendation satisfies GM Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management and GM Task Goal #1
Fiscal Sustainability.
BACKGROUND
RTD has received certain claims from its contractors for both the Eagle P3 and NMRL Projects that have
led to alternative dispute resolution and litigation in Denver District Court. RTD has engaged certain law
firms to assist RTD’s General Counsel and the RTD Legal Services Division (RTD Law) in providing legal
representation concerning these various claims. The approved budgets for 2018 and 2019 included
funding designated and available for these litigation costs. In May 2018, this Board approved a
recommended action for contract authority up to a total of $8.5 million in litigation costs. At that time,
the requested amount was RTD Law’s best estimate of funding required for 2018. However, RTD Law
advised that if the litigation matters became more complex or otherwise continued into 2019, RTD Law
expected that further contract authority would be necessary.
DISCUSSION
For the NMRL Project, this Board approved a resolution of the delay claim pending at the time this Board
approved the prior contract authority. Since that time, RTD’s contractor has given notice of other delay
claims that may proceed to arbitration. In 2019, RTD is likely to incur litigation costs in order to defend
those claims.
For the EAGLE Project, RTD’s Concessionaire Denver Transit Partners (DTP) has filed a complaint against
RTD in Denver District Court. That litigation is ongoing; the court has set a trial to begin in May 2020.
RTD is likely to incur litigation costs in preparation for that trial.
RTD will continue to use in-house legal resources and pursue alternative dispute resolution (settlement
discussions) to try to limit expenses. Contracts for outside services are procured competitively in
accordance with RTD procurement standards.

Packet Pg. 31

1.B.3

FINANCIAL IMPACT (If any)
This recommendation will be completed primarily with funding from the Board-approved 2019 FasTracks
project budgets.
ALTERNATIVES (if any)
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Finance and Administration
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
negotiate and execute contracts, including contract amendments, to engage, or continue to
engage, outside legal counsel to represent RTD for an additional $4 million for a total amount not
to exceed $12.5 million.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. If the Recommended Action is not approved, the
General Counsel would use the current contract authority available and then seek to obtain Board
approval for individual contracts or amendments. While RTD Law intends to represent RTD on
certain disputes or to partner with outside counsel to reduce costs, the primary litigation matters
require a large law firm with more resources and depth of expertise beyond the capacity of RTD
Law. The Board’s failure to provide the requested contractual authority could impair RTD’s ability
to satisfy its legal obligations and act in its own best interest in defending pending claims, as well
as delay completion of FasTracks projects.

Information

BACKGROUND
A Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (Task Force) was formed in 2010 for the purpose of making
recommendations detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the
Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members
with 12 of those members being external to RTD.
The Task Force presented its written
recommendations to the Board of Directors in 2011. The Board of Directors subsequently approved
those recommendations and directed Staff to pursue implementation of each recommendation. The
Task Force reconvened for a final meeting in 2012 to be briefed on the progress of their
recommendations and provide an opportunity for feedback.
DISCUSSION
The Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy recommendations to
the Board of Directors, which were approved for further consideration and/or implementation. The
majority of the recommendations made have been completed or their status has not changed since our
last report in November 2018. Per Board policy, we continue to report periodically on the status of the
Task Force recommendations below. Each recommendation is summarized below and expanded
comments are provided for those that have had a change in status since the last report.
Recommendations - Completed
Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
RTD contracted with the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business – Business Research Division
(Leeds) to provide sales and use tax forecasts beginning in 2011. These forecasts are updated semiannually by CU-Leeds.
Service Optimization
Service optimization was recommended by the Task Force and implemented with Board approval in order
to match services provided with available funding sources. Service modifications were brought forward
to accommodate new FasTracks lines opened since 2016 and further service modifications may come
forward with the opening of new lines or to meet budget restrictions. Certain service revisions are made
with each runboard period in response to public feedback, internal ridership and utilization data. The
Transportation Transformation (T2) Project will review Service Optimization as part of the project scope.

Due to the volatility of RTD’s largest single revenue source, sales and use taxes, the Task Force
recommended implementation of a more robust fiscal policy regarding fund balances. In response to this
recommendation, RTD implemented a fund balance policy with a target level of three months of
operating expenses among applicable funds for both the Base System and FasTracks Operations. While
FasTracks has met this objective, the Base System has not and is not expected to fully meet this goal
within the six-year term of the Mid-term Financial Plan.

Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
Exemption parity with the state of Colorado was identified by the Task Force as providing a benefit to
RTD during difficult economic conditions when the state implements exemption changes. In addition,
exemption parity removes the complexity to vendors of RTD having different taxable items than the
state. Through legislation introduced by RTD, exemption parity took effect in 2014.
Technology and Energy Innovation
In response to the Task Force recommendation, RTD conducted an energy review of the major operating
facilities and installed equipment and lighting upgrades where possible. RTD budgets for energy
upgrades throughout the District in each annual budget. We will continue to address energy efficiency
in building systems as on-going projects are completed.
Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
The Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) collects and audits sales and use taxes for RTD. The Task
Force identified an opportunity for revenue enhancement by performing additional sales and use tax
compliance reviews based on the favorable collection experiences of Colorado cities and municipalities
that implemented these reviews. While assessments from this effort exceeded the costs, it was not
clear to what extent those assessments would be collected. RTD staff decided not to extend the
contract for this work beyond 2015 due to the limited remaining opportunities for assessments outside
of the scope of work of the DOR.
Recommendations – Ongoing
Naming Rights
The first naming rights/corporate sponsorship agreement under the Board-adopted naming rights policy
was reached with the University of Colorado for naming the University of Colorado A Line and creating
an advertising presence on the Flatiron Flyer BRT line. Any additional proposed naming rights/corporate
sponsorship contracts will be brought to the RTD Board for approval.
Partnerships and Privatization
The Task Force described this recommendation as a broad area that could include items such as
privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce expenses. These have included
the lease of the DUS historic building, IGAs for improvements to US36 and the East (A) Line, partnering
with the City & County of Denver on Route 15L improvements, partnering with the City & County of
Denver on the 16th Street Mall to receive a grant and share in the O&M costs, as well as TOD activities.
RTD continues to look for partnership and privatization opportunities on an ongoing basis.
Recommendations – Low Priority
The status of recommendations made by the Task Force and categorized as having lower priority
follows:
Charge for Parking
RTD currently charges parking fees to out-of-District patrons, in-District patrons who park longer than
24 hours, and for reserved parking. In 2013, the state legislature prohibited the charging of daily
parking fees to in-District patrons at District facilities. In 2016, RTD staff presented a parking
management briefing at a study session that focused on a consultant-led pay-for-parking study. In
December 2016, the Board approved the Parking Guiding Principles, which clarify how future changes
to parking policy will be evaluated.

1.C.1

Tolling and Managed Lanes
The Task Force recommended investigating the possibility of RTD generating additional revenues
through charges for tolling and managed lanes.
Enacting this recommendation would require
coordination with CDOT and other agencies. The US36 BRT project is an example of how tolling and
managed lanes can enhance RTD operations and save costs.
Home Rule Initiative
The Task Force recommended that RTD consider becoming a “Home Rule” entity which would allow
RTD to collect and audit its sales and use taxes instead of the DOR. This initiative would require
legislation. The Colorado Municipal League and other entities recommended against it. It could only be
secured for RTD by statewide constitutional amendment. As noted earlier in this report, RTD has
effected simplification of state and RTD taxation through legislation that provides for uniformity on items
taxed.

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statement – Debt Policies
BACKGROUND
RTD has historically used various strategies to finance some of its capital needs. This has included the
use of bonds, certificates of participation, capital leases and loans. Although RTD’s current mid-term
financial plan does not anticipate much use of financing capital needs, approximately $4 billion worth of
obligations previously issued remain outstanding. Staff closely monitors the district’s ability to refund or
refinance these existing obligations at lower interest rates.
DISCUSSION
In an effort to qualify individual investment banking firms for participation in the District’s future
issuance and refunding of debt securities and the ongoing management of its financing program, staff
has issued a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to the investment banking community. Seventeen firms
responded to the RFQ and a review panel evaluated the responses based upon qualities:







25% Knowledge and experience of assigned personnel to RTD’s capital program
20% Experience in and commitment to underwriting Colorado municipal securities
15% Capital strength and willingness to underwrite securities
15% Marketing and distribution capabilities
15% Experience underwriting transit/transportation issues
10% Fees and expenses

As a result of this review, staff has included the following firms in no particular order, in the District’s
investment banking pool:



(1) Variance is due to lower parts and supplies and timing of invoices for purchased transportation and fuel
(2) Variance is due to lower labor, repair parts and purchased transportation mainly from timing of rail line openings.
(3) Variance is due to projects budgeted at beginning of year but now expected to start later.
(4) Variance is due to project invoices for contract maintenance budgeted earlier in the year than actual and lower compensation
(5) Variance is due to lower outside security services costs invoice timing
(6) Variance is due primarily to outside counsel costs related to litigation
(7) Variance is due to timing of outstide IT services costs for projects
(8) Variance is due to timing of outside printing costs for schedules and other outside services
(9) Variance due to purchasing card costs that initially get coded to this cost center until they can be coded to each cost center where they were incurred
(10) Variance due timing of travel costs and costs for MinuteTraq.

Information

BACKGROUND
RTD commits to reviewing its Fare Structure and Fare Programs every three years to determine if any
additions or changes are required to provide the best options for RTD ridership and meet RTD’s revenue
targets. Over 20 months ending in mid-2018, the Pass Working Group and RTD staff reviewed all fares
and fare programs to define potential fare changes and improvements. RTD staff presented a
recommendation to the RTD Board of Directors and received approval mid-September 2018. The goal of
this project is to implement changes to the RTD Fares, Fare Structure, and changes and additions to the
Fare Programs as approved by the RTD Board of Directors.
DISCUSSION
The January 2019 fare changes were implemented as scheduled and we are now focusing on the low
income fare program (now branded LiVE Program) development.
RTD is working with the State’s Office of Information Technology (OIT) to implement a program for
evaluating RTD riders’ eligibility for the LiVE Program using the State’s public benefits application
system, PEAK. RTD staff has been meeting with employees from various departments and OIT for
several months.
RTD is also working with Denver Human Services (DHS) to perform customer service and certain income
eligibility verification procedures for RTD.
The following has been completed:








The Business Requirements Document (BRD) with OIT has been finalized. The BRD provides the
requirements necessary for OIT to develop the RTD application within the PEAK system.
The MyRide LiVE card design and final proofs have gone to the smart card vendor for production.
The technical design document for the development of the LiVE Program application in PEAK has
been completed.
The Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between RTD and OIT has been finalized and signed by
both parties.
Several meetings have been held with DHS and a Scope of Work has been submitted to DHS for
legal review.
A request for quotes for a vendor to produce and mail LiVE ID cards has been issued by
Procurement.
The order for LiVE 10-ride ticketbooks for organizations currently in the Nonprofit Program has
been placed.

Packet Pg. 48




RTD contractors are prepared to make the necessary changes to ticket vending machines and bus
printers.
Eligibility card database is 80% complete.

Next Steps:






Finalize the contract between DHS and RTD for LiVE Program income validation and customer
service functions related to applications.
Issue the contract for the production of LiVE ID cards.
Continue evaluating options to provide customer service to LiVE participants regarding the
program and LiVE ID cards.
Continue developing an integrated marketing, communication and outreach plan for the
implementation of the LiVE Program and the related changes to the Nonprofit Program.
Develop informational materials.

2019 Approved Changes Summary:
 Cash Fare: $3 Local / $5.25 Regional / $10.50 Airport.
 3-Hour Pass: These fares allow riders to travel for three hours in any direction. This change
replaces the three-hour one-way transfer or ticket.
 Retain ticket book and MyRide discount with modifications (Riders purchasing a 10-ride ticket
book or paying with a MyRide smart card will receive a discount)
 The youth discount will increase from 50 percent to 70 percent and will be solely age-based
(ages 6-19).
 Utilization pricing for pass programs: Pricing for EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass
will now be priced based upon trips taken.
 EcoPass: Other updates to pricing based on changes in service levels and employer categories.
 FlexPass: Discontinue program discount. Employers and employees pay regular monthly pass
price.
 New Low-Income Program (Targeting Summer 2019)
