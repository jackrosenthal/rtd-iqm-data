• Approval Pass Program Phasing from 3 to 5 Years
It is recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee that the

move the phasing of the price increase due to the 2019 fare changes for
CollegePass, EcoPass, and Neighborhood EcoPass from a 3 year phase-in
period to a 5 year phase-in period. This would extend the 20% cap on price
increases to not only year 2019 and 2020 but also years 2021 and 2022
with the full implementation of the fare increase in 2023.
