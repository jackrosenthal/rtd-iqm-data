#### 2. Approval Pass Program Phasing from 3 to 5 Years

It is recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to move the phasing of the price increase due to the 2019 fare changes for CollegePass, EcoPass, and Neighborhood EcoPass from a 3 year phase-in period to a 5 year phase-in period. This would extend the 20% cap on price increases to not only year 2019 and 2020 but also years 2021 and 2022 with the full implementation of the fare increase in 2023.

GM Goals

- GM Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management
