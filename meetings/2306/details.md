## II. Strategic Planning Work Session (Brian Welch)

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, explained that the Strategic Plan Draft (Draft) Work Session was the result of months of work with the Directors.  He noted that Brian Welch, Manager for Planning Technical Services, documented the Strategic Plan Draft (Draft) included in the June 30, 2015 Study Session agenda packet.  The final version of the document will hopefully set RTD’s direction for the next five (5) years.

Brian Welch explained that his presentation will include how the Board and staff got to this point, what the Draft contains, and next steps.

Brian Welch reminded the Directors of the process so far:

- Staff initially met one-on-one with Directors

- P.E.S.T. Model Exercise (Political Influence, Economic Influence, Financial Influence, Sociocultural Influence, and Technological Influence)

- Joint Board – Staff Strategic Planning Advance

- Listening Sessions with employees

- Employee Survey

- Customer Panel

- Customer Satisfaction Survey

- Final staff one-on-one round of meetings with Directors

Brian Welch noted that this process helped inform and refine the Draft as it exists today.

The seven strategies outlined in the Draft are:

- Customer Service

- Safety

- Financial Sustainability

- Equity and Accessibility

- System Optimization

- Technological Innovation

- Workforce

Each strategy includes a goal statement, a brief explanation, and initiatives.

Brian Welch added that the next steps for the Draft include refining/additional info graphics and preparation of performance measures for each initiative if the Board approves the document.  The timeline is to present the Strategic Plan at the Planning and Development Committee Meeting of July 14th with a proposed Board adoption date of July 28th.

Director Lubow thanked staff for their effort. She believes that staff has done great work exploring what staff and Directors feel is important; however, she is not happy with the context.  She shared her thoughts on how the strategic plan is akin to the Joint Board – Staff Strategic Planning Advance; she would like to see a Board retreat be part of the process.  This way the Board could take this and any other pertinent information to discuss and flesh out what the Directors as elected officials would like RTD to look like in five (5) years.  She believes the Draft presented at the meeting is a great first step.  Director Lubow noted that affordability was not stressed enough in the document since this has been the main need the community has expressed in the past year.  She added that the Draft mentions its commitment to finish FasTracks but there are no concrete steps on how to do so.  Director Lubow was pleased that personnel retention was identified as a challenge since this was brought up throughout the General Manager Executive Search Employee Listening Sessions.

Director Bagley recognized that other Directors may think that the Draft does not go far enough; however, he sees it as a broad brush document that is not meant to be specific.  He noted that under the last bullet of the System Optimization initiatives, which reads, “Partner with other agencies to integrate transit services throughout the State of Colorado,” he believes RTD needs to be proactive in creating an environment where the agency convenes the conversation with others in the Front Range and throughout the state.  He added that RTD needs to be seen as a leader in order to have other entities discuss those types of issues with us.  He mentioned the study of rail transit from Ft. Collins to Denver Union Station as the kind of conversations RTD needs to have.  He added that these conversations need to be similar in importance to the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force conversations.

Relating to workforce, Director Bagley said he was very pleased to participate in two General Manager Executive Search Employee Listening Sessions: at the Platte Facility with Director Hoy and at the Elati Rail Facility with Director Walker.  He noted that these two-way conversations between the Board and employees need to happen more frequently throughout the year in order to create a culture where the employees feel that the Board is interested in them.  Director Bagley would like to see these conversations included in the Strategic Plan.

Director Walker thanked staff for the work. He said the Draft provides a good framework on issues to consider regarding what the agency has to be as opposed to what the Directors and staff want it to be.  He said the Draft is vague enough to allow for the strategies to be modified in the future without radically overhauling the plan.  Director Walker added that he would like to see a stronger emphasis on Equity, Accessibility, and working with jurisdictions on first and last mile issues.  He said that he was impressed with the Draft since it gives room for the concepts to be fleshed out.

Director Anderson agreed with much said by Director Bagley and Director Walker, but she believes the Draft is too detailed.  The fleshing out of the concepts could happen during the preparation of tactical plans.  She added that there are many things happening with MAP21 that may have a dramatic bearing on where RTD goes from here.  She noted that staff hit on the top items that the Directors need to look at, particularly as it relates to safety.  She appreciates staff for listening to all the details provided by the Directors.

Director James appreciated staff’s great effort in putting the Draft together and the attention to detail.  He noted that he looks forward to a few changes during the next couple of weeks.  He agreed with Director Walker about giving more emphasis to first and last mile issues.  He wondered if the Strategic Plan should go beyond five (5) years in order to truly be strategic.  He questioned how technological changes could affect the way we do business in the future. Director James said that it is a challenge to put such a document together with so much input.

Director Francone asked staff what the purpose of the Strategic Plan is.  Brian Welch replied that the purpose is to capture in one compact document what RTD does and why.  He noted that there is not a document detailing the Board’s vision about the uniqueness of RTD.  As the District grows it becomes important to prioritize what the agency does.  The simple seven (7) strategies and goal statements will help focus the prioritization process.  Brian Welch added that Chair Sisk described the document as “aspirational”.

Director Francone said she appreciated staff’s work, including distilling all the information after meeting with all the Board members twice.  She pointed out the tension of a five (5) year timeline for the agency and the very nature of the transit industry which works on 20 – 30 years timelines.  She added that this body of Directors needed to be careful to not bind future Boards yet anticipate the needs of future customers.  Director Francone said it is a fine first draft; however, she agrees with Director Lubow in that this type of document is a Board document.  This Board document does include public commentary and staff input, yet it is the Board’s responsibility to sit down and go through the document and use it as a springboard to set the agency’s direction.  She emphasized her appreciation of staff’s work on the Draft.

Director Archuleta noted that he has a background in media.  One of the strategies used in the business is to trade out advertising.  He pointed out that he has never heard about RTD in the media except when reporting a crash.  He added that this type of strategy was not included in the Draft.  Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, said that during the next Operations and Customer Service Committee meeting staff will give a presentation on the overarching process of marketing and branding.  He added that staff already trades advertising with radio stations and publications such as the Denver Post, Westword, and the Boulder Daily Camera, among others.  Scott Reed explained that RTD is limited by the amount of advertising space on buses and lightrail.  Director Archuleta asked if advertising trades included Spanish-language publications.  Scott Reed replied that RTD does have trade outs with Spanish-language publications.  He will provide to the Directors a list of the trades and programs the Communications Department does throughout the year.

Director James emphasized the importance of the Strategic Plan as a reference guide for making decisions.  Brian Welch added that future Board Reports from staff could use the Strategic Plan to reference which strategy the particular action is consistent with, similar to the current use of tactical goals.  He compared the Strategic Plan to a city’s Comprehensive Plan; the document would be used to identify strategic pieces of our mission.  Brian Welch added that staff recommends that the Board reviews the Strategic Plan on annual basis.  The top three strategies (Customer Service, Safety, and Financial Sustainability) may not change, but maybe the other four (4) will shift around. Director James agreed with Director Archuleta in that there was no mention of external and internal public communication.  He added that RTD being part of conversations on enhancing the livability of communities is important.  The Strategic Plan should provide a guide as to how much involvement and support RTD should seek in different conversations.

Director Walker asked if any initiatives were added or deleted based on Directors’ input.  Brian Welch replied that the Draft did change from the feedback received, such as adding technology and removing leadership from the seven (7) strategies.  He added that the Draft is meant to reflect the Board’s direction to staff.  For some topics, for example, Technology, staff went to the corresponding Department to get further details to better address the Directors’ desires.  Director Walker added that he feels the Draft is a Board document given the amount of interaction and input, even if the final “pen to paper” was done by staff.  He pointed out that this document will ultimately help RTD guide the budget, giving the Board of Directors an idea of what’s important and where the money should go to reach those goals.  He said that he was comfortable with the impetus of the Draft.

Director Anderson likes the idea of comparing the Strategic Plan to a city’s Comprehensive Plan.  Cities use Comprehensive Plans as a roadmap for the future.  She noted that the City of Arvada updates its Comprehensive Plan every five (5) years, keeping the issues broad and allowing for current leadership to flesh out the plans.  She added that RTD’s Strategic Plan could follow this example allowing the Board and Senior Leadership Team to flesh out any strategic or other plans.  Director Anderson likes staff’s work and the incorporation of people’s thoughts and feedback.  She still feels it is a little too wordy.

Director Deadwyler agrees with some of the statements made.  She thinks the Draft is very broad.  She said that the Draft presented has more of the same when it comes to generating new revenue.  She was hoping for an innovative approach, yet it seems that no one is thinking outside the box.  She added that RTD needs reliable funding and if we keep doing the same thing we will not get new results.

Director Bagley shared that, after reviewing a lot of documentation, he came up with half a dozen major topics to discuss during his two one-on-one meetings with staff.  Three of those topics are the top three strategies of the document: Customer Service, Safety, and Financial Sustainability.  Another one, Workforce, also made it to the document.  He recalled that he did not tell staff how to do Fiscal Sustainability; he simply said that is something to be looked at.  Director Bagley believes that the process for creating this Draft allowed for the Directors to give their opinion on critical aspects and for staff to further develop the ideas.  He called the Draft an outstanding first effort.

Chair Pro Term Tobiassen appreciated the City Comprehensive Plan comparison. He shared his involvement in the City of Aurora, who also reviews their Comprehensive Plan every five (5) years.  He said that his objective was to improve the city and quality of life in a fiscal way.  He envisions the Draft to grow more robust as programs are measured against it.  He noticed that the bullet points and headings included in the Draft came out of the Joint Board-Staff Advance in March.  Chair Pro Term Tobiassen noted that comments from Board members that were made throughout the process have been incorporated as well.  He added that during the General Manager Executive Search Employee Listening Sessions he heard many of the issues listed in the Draft, which means that the Board and Staff are hitting the nail on the head with this Draft.  He looks forward to the Strategic Plan growing more robust over time.

She noted that on Monday, July 20th, while the tours are occurring, the Board Office Staff will be presenting about Board Meeting Preparation in the RTD Board Office breakout followed by a DUS Walking Tour/Scavenger Hunt/Poker Run.  She acknowledged the work of Erin Klaas, Senior Board Office Assistant, as a member of the APTA Board Support Team planning and coordinating the Board Support Track in addition to her regular duties at RTD.  Paula Perdue highlighted the work of RTD Marketing, Graphics, and Event Planning who have worked behind the scenes for a year in preparation for the Seminar.  That team includes:

- Cheryl Holmes, Creative Services Manager

- Stephen Reilly, Marketing Communications Manager

- Adrian Mabry, Project and Contract Manager for Marketing

- Goergann Van Gemert, Account Executive

- Diane Borden, Senior Graphic Designer

Paula Perdue added that the marketing team created booklets for all three (3) tours in order to assist the participants with accessible information and reference as they go back to their respective agencies.  She passed around a sample of one of the booklets.

Director Deadwyler thanked Paula Perdue for all her hard work.  She told the Board Office Staff that they can count on her for 100% support in anything they need.

Director Walker said that he received a Seminar walkthrough from Paula Perdue and her team.  The team has worked very hard and he would like to make sure that Paula Perdue and her team get all the recognition they deserve.  Director Walker said he is really looking forward to the Seminar.  He encouraged the Directors to step up and participate as transit agency representatives from around the nation will come to Denver to see how RTD has handled all the recent work and partnerships.

Director Folska called Paula Perdue “priceless”.  She said that once again Paula Perdue has blown it out of the water as she extended her congratulations to the whole team.  Director Folska offered her support in anything that the team may need.  She related how at a recent conference she attended in Saratoga Springs participants received coupons to different local businesses as a means for sponsorships.  Paula Perdue acknowledged that was a great idea but explained that the local event planning had to conform to APTA’s criteria.

Director Bagley noted that he has participated in many APTA tours.  He said that the tour booklet created by the marketing department makes a tremendous difference and that APTA should step up their game for future tours.  He thanked Paula Perdue and her team for all their work.  Paula Perdue commented that marketing is truly the backbone of that booklet.  She said that she gave them a vision and the product they returned was unreal; she only had one change.

Chair Pro Term Tobiassen thanked Paula Perdue and her team for their efforts.  He said that she has his full participation.  Paula Perdue reminded the Directors to please contact Barbara McManus to sign up for specific assignments.

## IV. Other Matters

Director Anderson shared about her attendance at APTA’s Rail Conference in Salt Lake City, UT.  She noted that the last time she was in Salt Lake City their commuter rail consisted of travel to Sandy, a suburb of Salt Lake City.  Today, she explained, Salt Lake City has an absolutely exciting multimodal system that works very well.

Director Anderson reminded the Directors that even though MAP-21 will expire on July 31st, Congress is in the process of creating new rules.  This is due to the hope that it will be extended until December 31st, 2015, or even the possibility of extensions throughout the 2016 Presidential Campaign.  She added that State of Good Repair and shared Passenger and Freight Transit are items of discussion as new rules are being considered.  The recent AMTRAK accident has made an impression.  She noted that many agencies hoped that the deadline for Positive Train Control (PTC) installation would be extended, but that does not seem to be the case.  She said that the potential new rules on shared track will have an impact on how RTD does business.  Director Anderson added that another factor important to mention is how RTD will work with metropolitan planning organizations as it relates to asset management and how to plan for the future.  She concluded her remarks by reiterating that some events that will happen in the next six (6) months to a year will affect how RTD does business.

Director Deadwyler expressed her thanks to the Communications, Marketing, and Civil Rights departments for their participation during the Juneteenth Festival in Five Points, Denver.  She noted that the Departments came through on what was a short notice.  The RTD booth had 471 visitors and 11 people working in two hour shifts.  RTD partnered with Beverly Grant, a small business owner and participant in the I Am FasTracks Campaign, and shared the booth with her business, Mo’ Bettah Greens.  Director Deadwyler thanked Director Archuleta, Director Folska, Director Solano, and Chair Pro Term Tobiassen for attending the event.  Chair Pro Term Tobiassen said that he could tell from conversations that folks appreciated RTD’s participation at the event.

Director Bagley shared that he also attended the APTA Rail Conference.  He said that Director Anderson and he, along with RTD staff, accepted the APTA Rail Safety & Security Excellence Award.  He appreciated that both Director Anderson and he could accept the award, but this was really an award for Staff.  He thanked David Genova, Interim General Manager, because if it was not for his staff the Directors would not have an award to accept.  David Genova said that the team responsible for the award will be invited to the next Board Meeting to be recognized.

Director Bagley recommended that any Director interested in learning more about rail transit attend the APTA Rail Conference.  He highlighted the breakout titled Rebirth and Resurgence of Streetcars in North America as a great opportunity to learn streetcar history and see where it is headed.  Director Bagley shared information on the Opening General Session titled Where Public Transportation Goes, Community Grows.  This session was moderated by former RTD General Manager and APTA Chair Phil Washington.  Panel members talked about issues they saw when it comes to transit and community growth.  He noted that Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, participated along with Julie Skeen, Vice President – Denver Manager of Operations for Jacobs, in the breakout titled New Models for Public-Private Partnerships.  Director Bagley noted that the PTC deadline may not affect RTD much as it has been incorporated into all rail construction; however, many legacy systems will be hurting if Congress does not grant an extension because they have not been able to retrofit their systems.  Director Bagley also shared about the breakout titled Transit-Oriented Communities and Corridors and how it contained information that many Directors may not be familiar with.  He encouraged the Directors to attend next year’s APTA Rail Conference in Phoenix, AZ.

Director Bagley said that during his last day in Salt Lake City he spent about three and a half hours riding the system.  He observed how the stations work, the integration of light rail and commuter rail, and the experiment with the streetcar, which is essentially a modified light rail vehicle that travels for a mile.  He noted that it was very interesting to see how Salt Lake City had implemented their multi modal system for the Winter Olympics.

Director Bagley attended the dedication of the Elbra M. Wedgeworth Municipal Office Building at 2855 Tremont Place in Denver.  The art work on the building, including a mural of Elbra Wedgeworth, was dedicated on June 25th.  He noted that it has been a pleasure serving on the Denver Union Station Project Authority Board, which is chaired by Elbra Wedgeworth, as a representative of the RTD Board of Directors.

Director Lubow informed the Directors of a new organization in her District called Citizens for the Completion of FasTracks.  Their intent is to push RTD to finish the Northwest Rail.  She noted that this group is expressing something the community would like to see.  David Genova said that he gets an email notification every time Citizens for the Completion of FasTracks collects ten (10) new petitions.

## V. Adjourn

Chair Pro Term Tobiassen adjourned the meeting at 7:16 p.m.
