Strategic Planning Process Flow
The exhibit on this page provides the context for the Strategic Plan within RTD’s overall planning and budgeting process. As shown, the
Strategic Plan represents the District’s long-term strategy and vision, carefully integrated with the Board’s short-term goals established
during the annual Strategic Planning Advance.
The Plan is organized around seven overall strategies serving RTD’s mission. Each strategy is accompanied by a goal statement,
narrative describing the strategic theme in more detail, and a set of initiatives that articulate short-, medium-, and long-term
implementation. Most of these initiatives are ongoing in nature, and will be a continuous effort during the five-year plan time-frame.

FOREWORD
RTD Board Chair Chuck Sisk
On behalf of the RTD Board of Directors, we adopt the 2015 Strategic
Plan. This Plan reflects the Board’s collective vision for the District
– for both the next five years, and for decades to come as well. The
Board has identified seven strategies that help frame the District’s
big-picture goals, accompanied by initiatives to implement them. This
Plan clearly and simply articulates those goals for our employees,
stakeholders, and most of all, our passengers.
RTD is a complex organization, relying on hundreds of employees to serve nearly 3 million
people spread over 2,340 square miles across the Denver metro area. This complexity,
however, does not obscure the simple strategies and goals that are paramount to the District:
customer service, safety, and financial sustainability. To these we provide additional strategies
and goals that amplify and support our fundamental, basic mission. Included among these is
our commitment to implement the FasTracks program approved by the voters in 2004.
It is the Board’s hope that the Strategic Plan will be our guiding, aspirational document detailing
how we will move forward together. In my previous role as a city Mayor, we always turned to
our comprehensive plan to influence important land use decisions. The Strategic Plan should
serve a similar purpose, helping us make sound choices that direct and shape what RTD is,
what RTD does, and why we do it. This Plan focuses on the next five years, yet looks far into the
future, and we will revisit it periodically as circumstances warrant. The Board is committed to
making decisions based on sound public policy, and the Strategic Plan is a key tool in doing so.

RTD MISSION STATEMENT

RTD Interim General Manager Dave Genova
RTD was created in 1969 by the Colorado General Assembly to
develop, operate, and maintain a mass transportation system. Since
then, the District has made strategic decisions based upon careful
budget planning, attracting and retaining a talented workforce,
and never losing sight of our commitment to our customers and
safety. From our beginnings as a bus company, we have added light
rail, transformed Denver Union Station, and witnessed extensive
development around our transit stations. The FasTracks program,
which will add more light rail, new commuter rail, and new bus rapid transit, is carving an
unmistakable mark on the Denver metro area. It is now time to adopt a Strategic Plan to
move us into the next five years and beyond.
Between 2016 and 2020, RTD will undergo another period of transition as significant
portions of the FasTracks program begin revenue service, and the bulk of our current major
capital expansion program winds down. The Strategic Plan will be an important document
as we move through this transition, since it identifies seven key strategies to focus our
attention. We will build upon a solid foundation, particularly in the safety area, which the
overwhelming majority of RTD employees understand is RTD’s top priority. Additionally,
this plan details how we will enhance customer service, use technology to improve
the customer experience, optimize our growing system, continue to ensure financial
sustainability, and maintain a dynamic workforce. Join me as we maintain RTD’s position as
one of the top transit agencies in the country and continue our strong legacy of providing
safe, reliable transportation to the region.

To meet our constituents’ present and future public transportation needs by providing safe,
clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective service throughout the District.

Customer Service
RTD’s customer experience has to be safe and reliable for RTD
to continue to maintain and grow its customer base. On-time
performance and service reliability will allow RTD to build a
competitive edge within the regional transportation system
as vehicular travel becomes increasingly difficult in the future.
Having a seamless interface between all RTD services—whether
it be bus, Access-a-Ride, light rail or commuter rail—should be a
high priority to ensure RTD customer satisfaction. RTD customers
must feel comfortable and safe on any RTD service, whether it is
run by RTD or one of its contractors.
Responding to customer needs is important in the 21st century.
As rider expectations evolve, RTD must endeavor to meet their
needs with a growing emphasis on technology and immediate,
reliable information. It will be critical for RTD to proactively
engage our customers to seek ways to improve our service,
and to be transparent about the realities of how we operate
our services. Finding new and improved ways to engage
our customers will allow RTD to stay ahead of the curve and
anticipate rather than react to customer needs.

Attachment: RTD_Stategic_Plan_STUDY_SESSION_DRAFT_6-25-15 (2403 : Strategic Plan)

Safety
RTD recognizes that management and employee commitment is
the hallmark of a true safety culture, where safety is an integral
part of daily operations. To support safety’s priority in the agency,
RTD will strengthen accountability systems and promote a safety
culture. Safety accountability includes establishing safety goals,
measuring safety activity, eliminating hazards and unsafe work
behaviors, and proactively improving the safety environment.
In the recent employee survey more than 70% of employees
responded favorably to questions about RTD’s safety priorities
(72%), the safety of their work life (76%) and the ease with which
they can report safety concerns (84%). Still, maintaining safe
service requires constant vigilance and collaboration throughout
the agency. Through the Strategic Plan, RTD looks to improve
customer and employee safety by encouraging respectful
collaboration founded on mutual trust. RTD has an organizational
commitment to establish the core value of safety. RTD will
further promote a positive safety culture where values, attitudes,
competencies and patterns of behavior will improve the health
and safety of employees and customers. RTD will continue to
build on an already robust safety culture through enhanced
employee engagement. Ultimately, safety is each employee’s
responsibility.

Financial Sustainability
RTD has the responsibility to use taxpayer and passenger dollars
to provide the best possible public transit service. To consistently
deliver excellent services and projects, RTD must maintain
financial stability. Multi-year financial planning is vital to ensure
that capital and service visions become realities. The agency can
augment its finances by maximizing the revenues it generates
through operations and by exploring new sources of income.
Traditional funding sources alone will be insufficient to meet
the long-term needs of the future RTD system. RTD must also
continue to seek out non-traditional partnerships with public and
private sector partners to leverage outside funds.
Even as RTD employs asset management programs and
endeavors to keep the system in a state of good repair,
ongoing investment must be sustained to keep its vehicles and
infrastructure functioning and to maintain a robust system. These
assets often require more frequent maintenance to ensure
safety and ongoing functionality, which puts a growing burden
on the operating budget. Reliable and sustainable funding will
be absolutely necessary for RTD to make the critical investments
that the region needs. A long-term comprehensive funding
plan that takes into account both operating and capital needs is
essential to creating a robust, modern transit system.

A balanced approach to accessing RTD facilities will be important
in order to continue to expanding and increase RTD’s customer
base. Active transportation options such as walking, biking, car
share, and ride share should be embraced as viable alternatives
to access RTD facilities in addition to personal vehicles and buses.
Improved first and final mile connections through partnerships with
local jurisdictions, developers and other entities are essential to
expanding multi-modal access and growing ridership.
Continued improvement of access for people with disabilities is
important to preserve mobility for those with limited options.
Best efforts to adhere to the American with Disabilities Act
(ADA) Standards for Accessible Design at all RTD facilities,
and continued improvement of efficiency of RTD’s Access-a-

Ride service and ADA access to fixed route service, are key to
preserving mobility for the disabled community.
Promoting the creation of diverse transit oriented communities
around our facilities serves RTD well by improving accessibility
near stations and expanding RTD’s ridership base. Local
jurisdictions have prioritized development around RTD facilities
as means to direct future growth. RTD should proactively partner
with local jurisdictions and others to leverage this planning vision
and create vibrant, walkable areas around stations. In creating
these transit oriented communities, RTD needs to be sensitive to
community issues such as affordable housing and transportation,
and should work with local jurisdictions and others to find
solutions to promote neighborhood diversity.

System Optimization
Strategy:
Optimize Service
Delivery
Balance competing
mobility needs across
the District to provide
service in the most efficient
manner possible. Work with
partners to develop, fund
and complete FasTracks and
increase ridership.

RTD began as a bus company and has expanded with the Central,
Southwest, Southeast, Central Platte Valley, and West light rail
lines. The District has also added a variety of other transportation
options, including Call-n-Ride, Access-a-Ride, Limited stop bus
services, Express and Regional bus services, and an extensive
Park-n-Ride system.
The FasTracks program represents one of the most ambitious,
large-scale transit expansion programs ever undertaken in
the United States. The combination of light rail, commuter rail,
downtown circulation, and bus rapid transit capital investment
projects—as well as Denver Union Station and its integrated
transit oriented development—is destined to transform the
Denver metropolitan region. A key effort over the next five
years will be to carefully integrate the FasTracks projects into
our existing bus and rail system.

While most of FasTracks will be in service by 2020, key
components of the program will likely not be completed. During
the next five years, the District is committed to exploring financial
and implementation strategies to keep these unfinished projects
in the forefront to fully realize the voters’ 2004 vision.
It is unlikely that RTD can fully fund these projects from FasTracks
sales tax revenues in the near term, so partnerships with local
governments and private companies will become an integral
component of the funding strategy.
FasTracks, however, will not meet all the transit demands
expected during the longer time horizon of 15 to 25 years.
These 2040 transit needs, based on Denver Regional Council
of Governments jobs and housing growth projections, must
be planned for implementation a decade or more from now.
Addressing these needs may require improving the existing
system’s capacity. Other needs will likely be met by a thorough
exploration of bus rapid transit investments throughout the
District, both on arterial streets and on State highways. Finally,
RTD will need to explore visionary approaches to linking the
District’s light rail, commuter rail, and bus rapid transit systems
with other transit systems serving the rest of the Front Range.

Technological Innovation
Employing technology can help RTD not only increase ridership
but also better manage its business, assets, and operations.
Customer expectations are changing with a shift in rider
demographics, travel patterns and needs. Meeting customer
needs means providing access to information, ensuring
connectivity with devices throughout the system, and employing
the technological innovations that have become the norm. A
public transportation system that is easy to understand and use
is not only important in attracting and retaining riders but also in
increasing market share. Technology-based customer information
tools are essential to inform riders about transit services and help
them easily navigate the RTD system.
Just as technology can help customers make better decisions
about travel, new tools at the system level will help RTD make
and implement better strategic and investment decisions that
can save time and money. The challenge is to systematically
develop and introduce these new tools, for both customers and
RTD processes, while staying up to date in new technological
innovation.

Workforce
RTD recognizes that our employees are the single most important
asset in the organization. As the baby-boomer generation
nears retirement, the agency needs an ever-greater focus on
recruiting and training employees with competitive benefits while
providing the knowledge and skills for those employees to build
their careers in public transportation. Additionally, a coordinated
effort to capture the experience and knowledge from the current
workforce will pass knowledge to the next generation.
The upcoming completion of a large percentage of FasTracks will
also require that RTD examine the best use of resources to shift
focus from construction to maintaining existing and new assets.
