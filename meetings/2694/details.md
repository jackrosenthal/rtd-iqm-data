### B. General Manager's Mid-Year Assessment

Committee Chair Francone indicated that the General Manager had just been given his mid-year review from the committee. She said the committee wanted to discuss the review with the General Manager rather than giving him the document in advance. She noted the committee met the previous week to go over his mid-year summary, and the committee’s consensus was that the General Manager had exceeded expectations on five of his goals and achieved expectations in three areas. She said the results were consistent with the General Manager’s own self- assessment. She stated part of the purpose of the meeting was to help the General Manager understand, in the areas where he achieved expectations, the committee’s thoughts on ways he could improve.

Director Sisk commented that Directors Menten and Deadwyler attended the committee meeting the previous week.

Chair Hoy noted that only the committee members participated in the formal evaluation.

Committee Chair Francone noted that the committee’s meetings are open to the rest of the Board but only Directors Menten and Deadwyler provided their comments separately and in addition to the surveys. She said that the committee felt the General Manager had achieved expectations for Core Goal #1.

General Manager Genova said Core Goal #1 was the only goal for which the committee’s assessment and his did not align.

Committee Chair Francone said the committee’s discussion centered around the delivery of special services. She said the committee questioned how RTD alerts riders when services are delayed or are not provided.

General Manager Genova asked whether the committee was referring only to delays in special services.

Director Broom answered that a constituent had complained about being left at a stop because bus operators were being used to run other services.

General Manager Genova asked whether this incident took place on a Monday night.

Chair Hoy noted there were several events going on at one time, and the agency ran out of operators. He said there was an effort made to explain that the incident took place after the date the General Manager submitted his self-evaluation to the committee. He said the committee’s evaluation may have been influenced by the discussion of the incident.

Director Williams said that the conclusion was that the person who was left at the bus stop was not left because of other services being provided but rather because the operator had called off that day.

General Manager Genova said it was a missed run.

Director Anderson asked for clarification on the details of the incident.

Director Williams explained that there was a passenger left on a run late at night when the bus never came. She said the implication was that, at the same time, Broncos Rides were being run, but after much discussion it was determined that the Broncos Rides were operated by independently contracted operators and that the operator in question had called in sick.

Director Anderson said the discussion in the committee was similar but from a different person.

Director Williams noted that the issue of special services was separate from the of a lack of operators.

General Manager Genova said that specifics are always helpful and asked whether there were other instances other than the one in question so that he could follow up.

Director Broom said the committee had also discussed the agency’s policy on whether regular service takes precedence over special service. He said that committee members stated that some constituents only use special services, which to them are just as important as regular services. He said the committee did not reach a conclusion on that policy. He asked whether the agency provides special services to the extent possible only after the regular services are provided or whether special and regular services have equal pull on resources.

General Manager Genova said that his understanding is that the agency runs regular service and regularly scheduled special service to the best of its ability. He noted that contracted services are brought in to supplement special services, because there is no way the agency could provide both services. As to whether the agency prioritizes one service over another, he said the agency schedules and fills runs for both regular and special services and does not move services around. He said that, when the agency knows a missed run is inevitable, dispatchers attempt to schedule work based on the anticipated impact.

Director Broom said there is no way to notify a person standing on the corner.

General Manager Genova responded that the agency uses a variety of mechanisms to alert riders.

Director Williams said that customers can use RTD-created or third-party apps to receive alerts. She stated that not everyone uses a smart phone but there are ways to know that a bus is not coming.

Committee Chair Francone said that the discussion had circled around to the question of how RTD pushes out alerts to customers about likely service delays.

General Manager Genova said that the agency announces when those kinds of challenges are anticipated.

Director Anderson said that people need to be responsible for themselves.

Chair Hoy said that he knows that some people who return home from the Broncos Ride did not pay to go to the game via the Broncos Ride. He said that, on the day of the incident in question, both the Broncos and Rockies were playing and spectators started leaving the games in droves. He said that there should be enough capacity to return everyone home on the Broncos Ride if they used the service to reach the game.

General Manager Genova also noted that both games were affected by weather delays.

Chair Hoy said it was a perfect storm.

Director Walker said that commuters who work downtown also use the Broncos Ride to get home following a game. He said that all of the agency’s passengers are special regardless of their destination and the agency does its best to provide service to them regardless of how often they ride.

Director Anderson pointed out that several Directors spoke about the Women’s March and what a success it was. She said that the General Manager had exceeded expectations based on that event.

Director Sisk agreed with Director Anderson and said that the committee had gotten off track because the incident in question regarding the Broncos Ride did not happen mid-year. He noted the one Broncos game that would have been covered during the period of the General Manager’s mid-year self-assessment was a playoff game. He said that, to be fair, the Monday night game should not have been part of the evaluation.

Committee Chair Francone noted that part of the reason the committee evaluated the General Manager as having achieved expectations on Core Goal #1 was that the agency had met between 80% and 90% of performance measures.

Director Sisk said that measure was the benchmark and that the General Manager himself stated that he had hit 85%.

General Manager Genova said the delivery of special services was the reason he felt he had exceeded expectations.

Director Walker said the review criterion for special services included the phrase “in addition to providing normally scheduled service”. He noted the agency has had problems with dropped service hours.

Committee Chair Francone said that the General Manager had exceeded expectations on Core Goal #2.

General Manager Genova said that he and the committee were within alignment.

Committee Chair Francone said the committee commented that national recognition is important for consideration for federal funding and retention of employees. She stated there was some discussion as to why the agency sought national recognition as opposed focusing on local service. She said it is obvious that RTD is a national leader in a lot of areas and that recognition is important. For Core Goal #3 regarding strong financial management, she reported that the General Manager exceeded expectations. She said the committee agreed that he had done the best he could with what he had.

Director Broom questioned whether the agency had refunded everything that was eligible for refunding.

General Manager Genova said the agency is looking at one item that is tied to negotiations with Denver Transit Partners (DTP).

Director Broom noted that interest rates will probably rise.

General Manager Genova said there were three opportunities, including the $29 million refund from Denver Union Station (DUS).

Director Sisk stated that the agency had the strongest financial management he had seen at any point in his time on the Board. He said he liked the fact that Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance & Administration, and her staff are clear about their presentations and are responsive to questions. He said that RTD had previously been plagued by a lack of transparency. He stated that General Manager Genova should get a lot of the credit for the improvement in financial statements and the way that answers are being presented.

General Manager Genova said he thinks its valuable for stakeholders to know the agency’s condition. He credited the Finance Department team for pushing the envelope on their work.

Director Broom asked whether there was anything the Directors should be doing with respect to the October 2017 special legislative session on marijuana revenue.

General Manager Genova said he would get back to Director Broom on that question. He said he had spoken with the Governor three times and anticipated that the agency may provide testimony or responses. As far as reaching out beyond that, the General Manager said he would speak with Jenifer Brandeberry from Brandeberry McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK).

Director Broom asked which committee the bill would be assigned.

General Manager Genova said that there was some concern about the bill being assigned to the Senate Finance Committee. He said that the votes were there for the General Assembly to pass the bill if it could make it out of the Senate Finance Committee.

Director Broom asked whether the advantage to the legislature is that they can keep the revenue and use it for something else if the bill does not pass.

General Manager Genova said that the marijuana tax revenue is not being collected currently. He said there were questions about whether special districts would be willing to pay for the special session.

Committee Chair Francone said she had tried to stay as far away from the issue as possible because of the push to reopen Senate Bill 17-267. She stated the General Manager exceeded expectations on Core Goal #4. She said that the results of the federal triennial reviews are always stellar and are a lot of work for the agency.

General Manager Genova noted that the review also included enhanced review in certain areas. He said that RTD participated in a one-day collaboration conference with CDOT, the City and County of Denver, and Denver International Airport for small and disadvantaged businesses (SBEs and DBEs). He said that he reported during the conference that, of the $5.5 billion spent on the FasTracks project, $1 billion had been paid to SBEs and DBEs. He noted the agency has always been strong in this area.

Committee Chair Francone stated that the General Manager exceeded expectations on Core Goal #5, regarding communication. She said she was looking forward to the rollout of the district-wide plans. On Task Goal #1, she said that goal was achieved. She said that the committee agreed with the General Manager’s self-assessment and that it would be difficult to exceed expectations in that area. On Task Goal #2, she again reported that the General Manager had achieved expectations. She said the committee discussed what is being done about the union pension plan.

General Manager Genova said that the pension trust analyzed various actuarial models and came up with a solution that would be proposed to the union during the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) negotiations that would over time improve the plan. He said there was a funding pool programmed in the proposed 2018 budget. He said he would be happy to talk more about the proposal once he was in a position to do so.

Director Sisk said that there had been discussion about the “Driver’s Bill of Rights” the Board members received from the union. He said it was sent to the Directors with some intent.

General Manager Genova said that document was part of a larger initiative from Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) International that has been underway for some time. He said the agency has known about it for some time. He noted that employees’ quality of life issues would be addressed during negotiations, such as recovery time, split shifts, mandating, and other areas. He said the agency has acknowledged that wages are not the only issue and would make other improvements using the pool of resources available.

Director Sisk asked whether negotiators would pursue another five-year contract.

General Manager Genova said the agency had not gotten a sense on the contract duration from the union. He said RTD and the union would exchange proposals on October 6th, 2017. He said there are pros and cons for pursuing a three-year or five-year contract and noted that individuals within the agency have questioned whether a five-year contract would be in the agency’s best interests financially. He stated he would prefer a five-year contract, as long as it was workable, in order to provide certainty for the agency and the employees and to avoid the constant negotiation cycle. He noted the agency did not increase wages for three years, which worked for the agency financially but held wages behind the market.

Director Broom asked whether a five-year agreement would contain provisions to reopen the contract in the event of hard financial times.

General Manager Genova said that both parties could agree such provisions but noted that such a provision could also allow the union to reopen the contract in prosperous financial times as well.

Director Broom said that he was not used to seeing five-year contracts.

Director Anderson said that the economy was down during the last renegotiation and thought that it would be a good thing to have another five years of labor peace.

General Manager Genova said there are other five-year deals in the market and noted that the agency has access to the provisions of other existing labor contracts.

Director Broom noted that RTD had to compete in the local market rather than the national market.

Committee Chair Francone said part of the challenge was that the agency had to work with a union that has certain requirements, particularly with respect to its pension plan. She said the agency’s hands were tied in some respects.

General Manager Genova said that attorneys representing RTD say the union pension trust is responsible for the pension plan, not RTD, while the union’s attorneys say the pension is RTD’s liability. He indicated there is not a lot of case law on similar pension issues.

Director Broom asked whether the union pension plan would fall under federal guarantees in the event of a failure.

General Manager Genova said he did not think that there was a fallback or that the union would go back into any other plan. He said there was room for the trust to make changes if the plan were in serious trouble.

Director Broom said that he was the most vocal about the plan and that it needed to be fixed. He said it would be bad for everyone if a person drove a bus for 35 years and then retired, only to learn that the plan is out of money.

General Manager Genova said that he and key leaders on staff feel that RTD has a moral obligation to create a proposal to keep the plan going in the long term. He said the question at the bargaining table would be whether the union can agree. He said there are other tools in the pension trust, such as demanding arbitration. He said the contribution to the pension is negotiated as part of the CBA but the plan itself is managed by the trust.

Regarding the final goal, Task Goal #3 regarding state of good repair, Committee Chair Francone reported that the General Manager had exceeded expectations. She said she personally appreciated the safety culture within RTD, which made her feel more secure. She stated that others have mentioned to her that seeing transit security officers (TSOs) gave them a feeling of safety. She said there are two feelings someone can get from seeing TSOs, either fear that something bad is happening or the feeling that they are patrolling and keeping everyone safe. She said she felt a lot safer knowing there were people she could talk to. She noted that the committee had discussed RTD’s policy regarding evacuations of persons with mobility devices.

General Manager Genova said that a person would be reunited with his or her mobility device as quickly as possible following an evacuation.

Director Williams said that Denver Transit Partners (DTP), RTD’s Advisory Committee for Persons with Disabilities (ACPD), and the Denver Fire Department (DFD) would practice evacuations on the University of Colorado A Line the following week.

Director Anderson asked whether multiple fire departments would be involved.

Director Williams said no, this was intended to be a pilot project to write procedure and only DFD would be involved.

Director Anderson said the fire departments would be handling the evacuations, rather than the train operators.

General Manager Genova said that was an important distinction, because the fire department protocols would be in effect for an evacuation of that level.

Director Williams said the policies that are decided upon through the pilot project would go back to Ed Neuberg, ADA Manager, for review and dissemination to all of the fire departments involved in the train lines.

Director Walker said that staff was exceptional in the way they helped out after receiving a phone call from the principal of Denver’s South High School about students being harassed. He said the principal and the parents are very appreciative. He mentioned that he served on a nominating committee for the governing board of the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), and during their discussions, no one had anything but praise for General Manager Genova.

### C. Review Timeline

Ms. McManus said that the General Manager’s end-of year survey was due October 18th and that document, along with the survey, would be sent out to the Directors on October 19th and would be due on October 31st. She stated the results would be sent out on November 3rd, and the next committee meeting would be held on November 7th.

Committee Chair Francone said the survey would have 100% participation this time.

### D. Questions

Chair Hoy stated that he anticipated a lot of public comment at the Board Meeting that night. He said he would group individuals but would not stifle comment.

Director Anderson suggested asking for a spokesperson from the group and asking individuals to refrain from repeating topics that have already been covered by others.

Director Sisk said that he felt that going through the goals was valuable but noted that the overriding issue is getting the University of Colorado A Line operating without limitations. He stated that the committee noted its frustration with the delays opening the G Line. He said that the flaggers are a constant reminder that the agency has not done its job. He said that the General Manager could exceed expectations on all of his goals when the committee reviewed his performance at the end of the year but the operation of the University of Colorado A Line could still have an impact.

Director Anderson agreed.

### E. Next Meeting Date - November 7, 2017, 3:30 - 5:00 p.m.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Francone adjourned the meeting at 4:29 p.m.
