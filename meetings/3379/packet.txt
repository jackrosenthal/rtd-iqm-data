BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Government Relations Report – October 2022

Committee Meeting Date:
October 20, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2022 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections.
It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and federal elected
officials. To achieve these goals, RTD must be proactive in educating and informing the District’s elected
officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared goals.
In furtherance of the program, the agency’s Government Relations Officer coordinates and develops
strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve as a point of contact
for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable Government Relations highlights at the federal, state and local levels since
the last Executive Committee meeting held on September 22, 2022. This report was prepared on
October 10, 2022 and will be updated verbally as needed during the Executive Committee meeting
scheduled for Thursday, October 20, 2022.
Federal
Prior to the end of the federal Fiscal Year 2022 on September 30, 2022, Congress passed, and the
President signed, a Continuing Resolution to fund federal programs through December 16, 2022.
Congress is not conducting any business currently, and members are back in their districts campaigning
through the November 2022 General Election. Negotiations on a federal spending package will resume
after the general election and will likely be the primary focus before recessing for the holidays.

1.4.1.1

State
At the state level, RTD continues to work with the Colorado Energy Office to prepare a final report on
Zero Fare for Better Air Initiative, which concluded on August 31, 2022. As outlined in the grant terms,
the final report is due no later than December 1, 2022. Included in the report will be a comparison of
ridership from July, August, and September 2022. Additionally, the report will also cover a comparison
of security incidents, customer surveys, employee surveys, and lessons learned.
Local
At the local level, RTD is working to set up the initial meetings of the Subregional Service Councils
(SSCs). These kick-off meetings are scheduled during the first few weeks of November 2022. In the
meantime, RTD staff continues to communicate with cities, counties, and other stakeholders to confirm
participation on the SSCs.
Lastly on the local level, Acting Assistant General Manager of Planning, Brian Welch, presented a
summary of Reimagine RTD to the Denver City Council Land Use, Transportation, and Infrastructure
Committee on Tuesday, October 11, 2022.

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Barbara McManus, Executive Manager, Board Office
Tai-Shrae Parish, Board Operations Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Each year, the Executive Committee reviews and informally approves the Board’s meeting calendar for
the following year.
DISCUSSION
Except as described herein, pursuant to the meeting schedule outlined in the Board Bylaws adopted
December 7, 2021, standing committee meetings will be held the second Tuesday and Wednesday of
each month, regular Board Meetings will be held on the fourth Tuesday of each month, and no standing
committee or Board meetings will be scheduled for August or December of a given year.
Exceptions to the standard meeting cadence are as follows:
In January 2023, the first meeting of the year, a Special Board Meeting, will be held on Tuesday,
January 10; the Finance and Planning Committee and Operations and Safety Committee will meet
the following week, on Tuesday, January 17 and Wednesday, January 18, respectively
In June 2023, due to a potential conflict with the APTA Rail Conference, scheduled to be held
from June 11 through June 15, the Finance and Planning Committee and Operations and Safety
Committee will meet the first week of the month, on Tuesday, June 6 and Wednesday, June 7,
respectively
In October 2023, due to a potential conflict with the APTA TRANSform Conference, scheduled to
be held from October 8 through October 11, the Finance and Planning Committee and Operations
and Safety Committee will meet the first week of the month, on Tuesday, October 3 and
Wednesday, October 4, respectively
While other potential scheduling conflicts exist between the Board’s meeting calendar and the proposed
scheduling of large-scale transit industry conferences, such as the APTA Mobility Conference, the timing
of such events is anticipated to allow for full Director and agency leadership participation in most
instances.

The calendar, once finalized, will demonstrate the agency’s commitment to meet the RTD Strategic
Priorities of Community Value and Employee Ownership.

Board meeting calendar.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Internal Audit Function Charter

Committee Meeting Date:
October 11, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
October 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the amended Internal Audit Function Charter.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In December 2020, the Colorado Office of the State Auditor (OSA) completed a performance audit of
RTD and in April 2021, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) completed a peer review
of RTD’s internal audit function both of which included recommendations for improving RTD’s internal
audit function. RTD entered an engagement with RubinBrown, LLP for professional assistance in
implementing those recommendations according to standards promulgated by the Institute of Internal
Auditors (IIA) as well as to provide guidance regarding the proper staffing of RTD’s internal audit
function.
In January 2022, RubinBrown recommended that RTD outsource its internal audit function in order to
leverage the professional expertise of subject matter experts while also benefitting from the efficiencies
to be gained by contracting for hourly services as opposed to full-time employees.
In February 2022, RTD issued a request for proposals to outsource the internal audit function.
In June 2022, the RTD Board of Directors authorized RTD to enter a contract with RubinBrown, LLP to
provide internal audit services for three base years and two option years.
In July 2022, the RTD Board Chair appointed Directors Catlin, Davidson and Dishell to an Audit Ad Hoc
Committee to coordinate with RubinBrown on recommendations to the Board to implement the
outsourced internal audit function and form an RTD Audit Committee.
DISCUSSION
At the September 13, 2022 Finance and Planning Committee meeting as well as the September 28,
2022 Board meeting, a Discussion item was presented to garner feedback regarding an amended Internal
Audit Function Charter. The Board last approved this Charter in July 2021. The proposed amendments
to the Charter ensure adherence to IIA standards and incorporate Board input.

INTRODUCTION:
The Internal Audit Function is an independent and objective assurance and consulting function that is guided
by a philosophy of adding value to improve the operations of the Regional Transportation District (RTD). The
Internal Audit Function assists RTD in accomplishing its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined
approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of RTD's governance, risk management, and internal
control.
ROLE:
The Internal Audit Function is established by the Board of Directors’ Audit Committee. The Internal Audit
Function’s responsibilities are defined by the Board as part of its oversight role.
PROFESSIONALISM:
The Internal Audit Function adheres to the Institute of Internal Auditors' mandatory guidance including the
Definition of Internal Auditing, the Code of Ethics, and the International Standards for the Professional Practice
of Internal Auditing (Standards). This mandatory guidance constitutes principles of the fundamental
requirements for the professional practice of internal auditing and for evaluating the effectiveness of the Internal
Audit Function’s performance.
The Internal Audit Function adheres to the Institute of Internal Auditors' Practice Advisories, Practice Guides,
and Position Papers as applicable to guide operations. In addition, the Internal Audit Function also adheres to
relevant RTD policies and procedures and the Internal Audit Function’s Standard Operating Procedures Manual.
The Chief Audit Executive (CAE) periodically reports to Executive Leadership and the Audit Committee regarding
the Internal Audit Function’s conformance to the Code of Ethics and the Standards.
AUTHORITY:
The Internal Audit Function, with strict accountability for confidentiality and safeguarding records and
information, is authorized full, free, and unrestricted access to any and all RTD records, physical properties, and
personnel pertinent to carrying out any engagement. All employees must assist the Internal Audit Function in
fulfilling its roles and responsibilities. The Internal Audit Function has direct access to the Audit Committee and
the Board.
ORGANIZATION:
The CAE reports functionally to the Audit Committee of the Board and administratively (i.e. day-to-day
operations) to the General Manager and Chief Executive Officer (GM/CEO).

to reasonably fulfill the Internal Audit Function’s objectives during the calendar year
Evaluate the performance of the CAE with input from the GM/CEO

The CAE communicates and interacts directly with the Audit Committee.
INDEPENDENCE AND OBJECTIVITY:
The Internal Audit Function must remain free from interference by any party in RTD regarding matters of audit
selection, scope, procedures, frequency, timing, or report content to permit maintenance of a necessary
independent and objective mental attitude.
Internal auditors must not have direct operational responsibility or authority over any of the activities audited.
Accordingly, internal auditors must not implement internal controls, develop procedures, install systems, prepare
records, or engage in any other activity that may impair the internal auditors’ judgment.
Internal auditors must exhibit the highest level of professional objectivity in gathering, evaluating, and
communicating information about the activity or process being examined. Internal auditors must make a
balanced assessment of all the relevant circumstances and not be unduly influenced by their own interests or
by others in forming judgments.
The CAE must confirm to the Audit Committee, at least annually, the organizational independence of the Internal
Audit Function.
RESPONSIBILITY:
The scope of the Internal Auditing Function encompasses, but is not limited to, the examination and evaluation
of the adequacy and effectiveness of RTD's governance, risk management, and internal controls, as well as the
quality of performance in carrying out assigned responsibilities to achieve RTD’s stated goals and objectives.
This includes:
•
•
•

Evaluating risk exposure relating to achievement of RTD’s strategic objectives
Evaluating the reliability and integrity of information and the means used to identify, measure, classify,
and report such information
Evaluating the systems established to ensure compliance with those policies, plans, procedures, laws,
and regulations that could have a significant impact on RTD

INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN:
At least annually, the CAE must submit to Executive Leadership and the Audit Committee an internal audit plan
for review and approval. The internal audit plan consists of a work schedule as well as budget and resource
requirements for the next fiscal/calendar year. The CAE communicates the impact of resource limitations and
significant interim changes to Executive Leadership and the Audit Committee. The internal audit plan is
developed based on a prioritization of the audit universe using a risk-based methodology, including input of
Executive Leadership and the Board. The CAE reviews and adjusts the plan, as necessary, in response to changes
in RTD’s business, risks, operations, programs, systems, and controls. Any significant deviation from the
approved internal audit plan must be communicated to Executive Leadership and the Board through periodic
activity reports.
REPORTING AND MONITORING:
The CAE prepares and distributes written report upon the conclusion of each internal audit engagement at least
quarterly. Internal audit results must also be communicated to the Audit Committee at least quarterly.
The internal audit report may include responses from Executive Leadership and corrective action taken or to be
taken regarding the specific findings and recommendations. Responses from Executive Leadership, whether
included within the original audit report or provided thereafter (i.e. within thirty days) by management of the
audited area, should include a timetable for anticipated completion of action to be taken and an explanation for
any corrective action that will not be implemented.
The Internal Audit Function is responsible for appropriate follow-up on engagement findings and
recommendations. All significant findings remain in an open issues file until cleared.
The CAE periodically reports to Executive Leadership and the Audit Committee on the Internal Audit Function’s
purpose, authority, and responsibility, as well as performance relative to its plan. Reporting must also include

The Internal Audit Function maintains a quality assurance and improvement program that covers all aspects of
the internal audit function. The program includes an evaluation of the Internal Audit Function’s conformance
with the Definition of Internal Auditing and the Standards and an evaluation of whether internal auditors apply
the Code of Ethics. The program also assesses the efficiency and effectiveness of the Internal Audit Function
and identifies opportunities for improvement.
The CAE communicates to Executive Leadership and the Audit Committee on the Internal Audit Function’s quality
assurance and improvement program, including results of ongoing internal assessments and external
assessments conducted at least every five years.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Second Amendment to the RTD Salaried Defined
Contribution Plan

Committee Meeting Date:
October 11, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
October 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve an amendment to the salaried employee defined contribution
retirement plan to retain $200,000 in annual forfeitures for administrative expenses.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD provides a Defined Contribution (DC) retirement plan for all non-represented employees hired on
January 1, 2008, and thereafter. RTD currently contributes 9.0% of wages with no employee
contribution.
This DC Plan requires employees to be employed with RTD for five years before any vesting occurs. At
the employee’s five-year anniversary, the employee becomes 100% vested in these contributions. Any
employees that leave prior to their five-year anniversary forfeit all contributions.
DISCUSSION
The current DC Plan documents allow the DC Plan Trust (Trust) to retain $100,000 of annual forfeitures
within the plan to pay administrative expenses. These expenses include costs for attorneys,
administrators, bank fees, investment consulting, insurance, postage, and recordkeeping. Forfeitures in
excess of $100,000 are returned to RTD. This process is in place to allow the Trust administrator to
easily process invoices as opposed to seeking reimbursement from RTD for each expenditure.
The existing limit of retaining $100,000 of forfeitures within the DC Plan have been insufficient to pay
ongoing expenses. In 2021, expenses were $131,735 for which RTD provided additional funding to the
DC Trust. Through June 2022, expenses are $95,779.
The attached DC Plan amendment seeks Board approval to retain $200,000 of forfeitures in the DC Plan
annually to provide funding for ongoing expenses.
The DC Plan Trustees have approved this request to the RTD Board to amend the DC Plan and concur
that $200,000 is sufficient at this time. The Trustees will continue to monitor expenses and return any
significant excess funds to RTD if they grow beyond a reasonable amount.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no material impact from this recommended action, because RTD has been providing the funding
of DC Plan expenses, regardless of the amount of forfeitures retained in the Trust.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2023 Investment Policy

Committee Meeting Date:
October 11, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
October 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2023 Investment Policy.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Each year staff presents the proposed Investment Policy for approval for the upcoming fiscal year. The
Investment Policy may be amended by the Board at any time.
The most recent modification to the Investment Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in
November 2021 for the 2022 fiscal year. Staff is requesting changes to page 9 regarding reporting
requirements. These changes reflect current reporting in which quarterly investment reports are provided
in Board Briefings and removes the annual reporting requirement due to redundancy. In addition, changes
are being requested regarding the maturity reporting in that average annual maturities of investments
would be reported rather than by specific investment since a large proportion of investments are placed
in investment pools. Average portfolio maturity is more meaningful to assess overall portfolio exposure
to interest rate risk.
Directors Lewis and Dishell had requested in July 2022 that staff review RTD’s Investment Policy in
relation to provisions for Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). In reviewing those provisions and
considering other local government agency investment policies, it was determined that language
modification to RTD’s Investment Policy would not be necessary due to statutory requirements limiting
RTD’s ability to invest only in certain types of highly rated, low duration investment instruments.
Essentially, RTD primarily invests in federal government and agency debt such as Treasury Bills, rather
than private entity securities, which virtually eliminates exposure to investments that do not meet typical
ESG qualifications.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of the Investment Policy is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment of RTD’s operating funds, debt proceeds and reserve funds.
The primary objectives of RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2)
sufficient liquidity to meet known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield to achieve a market rate of
return. Although RTD must legally follow the investment parameters dictated by § 24-75-601.1,
Colorado Revised Statutes, this Investment Policy is more conservative in order to achieve the Strategic
Priority of Financial Success.

The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District (RTD).
2. SCOPE
This investment policy (Policy) applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the Portfolio).
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or indentures
of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated for
investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value
of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD, thereby
reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open market prior
to maturity.

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification and
purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard to
insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of
the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual investments
as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses are
inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market
price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will
hereinafter be referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation
by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(NRSROs) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating category
(AA) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2
and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is downgraded
below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio, the CFO will
review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to sell such
holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates of
indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 100%
of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum maturity for
investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities: Obligations, participations or other
instruments of any Federal agency, instrumentality or United States government-sponsored
enterprise as described in CRS 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an Agency or Agencies). Such securities
shall be rated in one of the two highest rating categories (as described above in the Credit
Criteria section) by at least two NRSROs. No more than 75% of the Portfolio may be
invested in Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities, with no more than 25% being

and investment officials shall disclose to the GM/CEO any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment precludes
pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices. However,
fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where securities
may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to reinvest
proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,

Packet Pg. 44

Attachment: RTD 2023 Investment Policy.doc (4705 : 2023 Investment Policy)

No more than 50% of the Portfolio may be invested in repurchase agreements and no more
than 10% may be invested with a single counterparty. The maximum maturity for a
repurchase agreement shall be limited to 90 days.

2.16.D.a

Subject: 2023 Investment Policy
Page 8

the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in
the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.

The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized
to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from
those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary
dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody
With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.

Subject: 2023 Investment Policy
Page 9

7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Staff will include an annual listing of investments held and investment returns within the Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report.
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the average maturity of the investment
portfolio.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return, commensurate
with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the composition of the
Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various indices may be used to
monitor investment performance.
The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash equivalents)
is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the
designated performance benchmark is the ICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns which
may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this Policy
“bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of participation or
other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy, denoting
any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

2023 INVESTMENT POLICY

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or indentures
of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated for
investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Page 2

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value
of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD, thereby
reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open market prior
to maturity.

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification and
purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard to
insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of
the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual investments
as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses are
inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will
hereinafter be referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation
by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment

Attachment: RTD 2023 Investment Policy Red Line (4705 : 2023 Investment Policy)

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating
category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and
Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is
downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio,
the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to
sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates of
indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 100%
of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum maturity for
investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities: Obligations, participations or other
instruments of any Federal agency, instrumentality or United States government-sponsored
enterprise as described in CRS 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an “Agency” or “Agencies”). Such
securities shall be rated in one of the two highest rating categories (as described above in
the Credit Criteria section) by at least two NRSROs. No more than 75% of the Portfolio
may be invested in Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities, with no more than 25%

provisions subordinating it from being a senior debt obligation of the issuer. No more than
20% of the Portfolio may be invested in corporate and bank securities and no more than

more than 50% of the Portfolio.
6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment precludes
pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices. However,
fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where securities
may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to reinvest
proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,

rtd-denver.com

Packet Pg. 56

Attachment: RTD 2023 Investment Policy Red Line (4705 : 2023 Investment Policy)

No more than 50% of the Portfolio may be invested in repurchase agreements and no more
than 10% may be invested with a single counterparty. The maximum maturity for a
repurchase agreement shall be limited to 90 days.

2.16.D.b

Subject: 2023 Investment Policy
Page 8

the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in
the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.

The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized
to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from
those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary
dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody
With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.

7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Staff will include an annual listing of investments held and investment returns within the Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report.Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive
report on RTD’s investment program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of
Directors. The annual report shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may
suggest improvements that might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall
include any other item of significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment
program. Each investment advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the
respective terms of each contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the averagemaximum maturity of the
investment portfolio.liability to RTD (the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each
callable security held.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return, commensurate
with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the composition of the
Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various indices may be used to
monitor investment performance.
The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash equivalents)
is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the
designated performance benchmark is the ICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns which
may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this Policy

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
January 2023 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

Committee Meeting Date:
October 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
October 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for January 2023 service
changes to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 as well as to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community Value.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Interim Director, Civil Rights
Jessie Carter II, Senior Manager, Service Planning and Scheduling
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 26 service changes proposed for January 2023 provides opportunities for bus and rail operators to
vote new work assignments and for the Service Development Division to adjust the overall operations
plan for the transit network. Additionally, with the Board-adopted Reimagine RTD System Optimization
Plan (SOP), several of the service change proposals reflect the first phases of SOP implementation to
provide the best possible customer value.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard
to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Service Equity Analysis Requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The January 2023 service
change proposal includes four major service changes out of 26 total changes. Thus, an analysis is
required to be brought before the Board for approval. The complete Title VI Service Equity Analysis
report is included in Attachment A.

Packet Pg. 63

2.16.E

Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major
service changes will be subject to an equity analysis.
Title VI Policies:
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
DISCUSSION
Staff proposes changes to 18 bus routes and eight rail lines in the forthcoming January 2023 runboard.
Of these 26 changes, four services have proposed additions or reductions to service 25% greater than
that of baseline service and thus meet established thresholds for a major service change. Those routes
are shown in bold in the following table.

Modified Services (23 services)
(Additional trips, expanded service spans)

11, 12, 15, 15L, 21, 24, 30, 42, 44, 76, 83D/83L,
88, 93L, 130, AT, 228, BOLT
D Line, E Line, H Line, L Line, R Line, W Line

Reduced Services (one service)

120L

Discontinued Services (two services)

C Line, F Line

Methodology
Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line level, route/line
block group and network level to identify any potential disparities in service changes based on
race/ethnicity or income.
Summary of Findings
• Of the over 63,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes
(both bus and rail), minority and low-income populations represented a higher share of population
than district averages. Of this cumulative figure, 33,000 would receive service improvements for
equity populations

Packet Pg. 64

2.16.E

•

The one bus route with major service changes serves above-average minority or low-income
populations

•

For major service changes to rail service, minority populations are not disproportionately impacted
by the elimination of service to the C and F lines; however, the burden on low-income populations
relative to higher income populations slightly exceeds the threshold

•

Although staff is proposing that the C and F lines be permanently discontinued, all stations
currently served by the C and F lines will continue to be served by rail service at 15-minute peak
headways. More specifically:

•

o

The stations served prior to the discontinuation of the C Line will continue to be served by
the D Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the W or E line required to
continue to Denver Union Station

o

The stations served prior to the discontinuation of the F Line will continue to be served by
the E Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the D or H Line required to
continue to 18th•Stout Station

o

These service changes signify the agency’s commitment to ensure an equitable distribution
of service improvements and to minimize impacts with the permanent discontinuance of
these light rail lines

When considering the demographics within the service areas of lines/routes with major service
changes and as a proportion to the District overall, both minority and low-income equity
populations received a greater increase in service (i.e., were more positively impacted) compared
to non-equity populations; minority areas had a +1.84% benefit above non-minority areas, and
low-income areas received a +1.67% compared to higher income areas

Conclusions
Although two of the major service changes resulted in a disproportionate burden at the line level, Title VI
concerns are minimal at the network level when comparing the service changes between the August
2022 and January 2023 runboards. In aggregate, a review of all routes/lines found no adverse impacts
between equity and non-equity routes/lines. Overall, the system-wide service increases have positively
impacted equity populations slightly more compared to non-equity populations. Therefore, no systemlevel disparate impact or disproportionate burden is found related to the proposed major service changes
in the January 2023 service change proposal.
In adopting this report, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community
Value while maintaining compliance with Title VI federal regulations. RTD will continue to assess the
equity implications for all subsequent service change proposals and will propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Service Equity Analysis: January 2023
Executive Summary
This document summarizes the analysis of the service changes between the August 2022 and January 2023
runboards to ensure changes have not inequitably impacted minority and low-income populations.

Methodology
RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts, and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group levels to identify
any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes
RTD proposes changes to 18 bus route/patterns and eight rail lines of RTD’s forthcoming January 2023 runboard.
Of these 26 changes, three services meet established thresholds for a major service change. The routes/lines
listed below have proposed adjustments to service that were greater than 25% of baseline service or services
being eliminated.

Service Adjustments (one service)

Service Eliminations (two services)

Route 30 – South Federal: extend span of service weekdays
and Sundays in bi-directional pattern
C Line: regular service on the C Line is discontinued
F Line: regular service on the F Line is discontinued

Findings

Alterations to the initial proposed January 2023 service changes include adding improvements to Route 30,
which serves high concentrations of equity populations. Further, though staff is proposing that the C and F Lines
be permanently discontinued, all stations currently served by the C and F Lines will continue to be served by rail
service at 15-minute peak headways. The stations served prior to the discontinuation of the C Line will continue
to be served by the D Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the W or E Line required to continue
to Denver Union Station. Moreover, the stations served prior to the discontinuation of the F Line will continue to
be served by the E Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the D or H Line required to continue
to 18th•Stout Station. These service changes signify the agency’s commitment to ensure an equitable distribution
of service improvements and to minimize impacts with the permanent discontinuance of these rail lines.
When considering the demographics within the service areas of routes/lines with major service changes and as
a proportion to the District overall, both minority and low-income equity populations received a greater increase
in service (i.e., were more positively impacted) compared to non-equity populations. Minority areas had a
+1.84% benefit above non-minority areas, and low-income areas received a +1.67% compared to higher income
areas. For major service changes to rail service, minority populations are not disproportionately impacted by the
elimination of service to the C and F Lines; however, the burden on low-income populations relative to higher
income populations slightly exceeds the threshold.
Finally, though there were no cumulative adverse impacts at the network level, potential disparate impacts and
disproportionate burdens were identified at the individual route-level: of the three routes/lines that had major
service changes, two lines had a disproportionate burden finding.

Service Equity Analysis: January 2023
Introduction
Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver region.
An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit service without
regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact
on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that are proposed to occur between the
August 2022 and January 2023 runboards. Routes with major service changes include one major increase and
two major service decreases (eliminations) of formerly suspended routes. These changes and all others have
been reviewed individually at the route/line level and in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential
impacts to the communities RTD serves.

Service Change Philosophy
An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD. These
changes include the addition of new routes/lines, the elimination of existing routes/lines and changes to the
alignment and trip frequency within existing routes/lines. RTD has established principles to identify the service
changes needed to meet the diverse travel needs of those within the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system.

•

Service performance evaluation based on service standards
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without
regard to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority
populations
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes depending on service type, route alignment and frequency.
Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all routes within each class.
RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in ridership and operational
performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify services that are
underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. In keeping
with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish performance metrics used to
identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses these metrics to identify a series
of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of the proposed major service changes on minority
populations and low-income households at or below 150 percent of the Department of Health and Human
Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

Colorado Revised Statutes 32-9-119.7 Farebox Recovery Ratios – Plans

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact
Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating service change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25%addition or reduction in the service
hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service changes will be
subject
to
an
equity
analysis
that
includes
an
analysis
of
adverse
effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes,
but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects
and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.

Service Equity Analysis: January 2023
2. Disparate Impact Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10 percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than higher income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150%
of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and
RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources and Methodology
Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5Year Estimates for years 2014 to 2018 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level. Other data
related to the analysis includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into
a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with changes in service at a
geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts to district equity communities.
The equity analysis for the January 2023 runboard looked at whether an individual route’s major service changes
impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the proportional difference in changes
made to equity populations within a route’s/line’s quarter-mile service area. These proportional differences were
compared against district population proportions of equity populations and route/line proportions of equity
populations.
Low-income status for population within the District is derived from the Census Bureau and is based on 150%
of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services guidelines), based on local
context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of three. Minority status was based on the non-white
and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area was based on the collection of block groups
within district boundaries.
Route/line service area population was determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area was then used to calculate the percentage overlap of census blockbased population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contained 100% of the underlying block group,
100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block group
was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
RTD calculated the net change in service hours for each route/line modification to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change at or above 25% from baseline was flagged as a major service change
for further review.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden
Analysis
Proposed service changes for the January 2023 runboard that resulted in a 25% or greater change in service
were categorized by equity population (minority or non-minority, low-income or higher income) for comparison.
Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their identification within the prior network
using 2018 ACS five-year demographic data.
A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to review the routes/lines individually. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the District. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of Disparate Impact (for minority populations) or Disproportionate Burden (for low-income populations) and was
flagged for a finding of potential impact.

Changes by Transit Mode
As RTD continues to adapt to changes affected by the pandemic, nearly 19 bus routes will undergo service
changes. Of these, five routes will see an increase of bus service by 56 daily revenue service hours (56
weekday, 28 Saturday, 37 Sunday). One of the routes, Route 30, exceeded the major service change
threshold and account for 16 of the additional daily revenue service hours. The suspended C and F Lines will be
permanently removed from service.

Major Service Change Review

A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups, and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions or Eliminations (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases/Restructuring (service increases of 25% or more related to new or
restructured service)

Major Service Change Reductions/Eliminations

Two rail lines were previously suspended during the COVID-19 service reductions. The Board of Directors
approved these suspensions during the April 2021 monthly meeting. The January 2023 service proposal includes
the permanent discontinuance or elimination of these lines.

Major Service Change Increases
One bus route had major service changes, which includes service increases of 25% or greater. This includes one
modification to span of service (Route 30).

Route- and Line-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route/line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (DI) and/or
Disproportionate Burdens (DB). Both service reductions and service increases are analyzed. For service
increases, the analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority
and low-income populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse
effects of the reductions are disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.

Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the District’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were reviewed
for potential DI or DB findings. In summary, the review of these adverse impacts determined the following:
•

Two lines met the threshold for a potential Disproportionate Burden

A complete listing of all potential DI and DB findings can be found in Appendix B.

Network Analysis

In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program update, a network analysis is required in addition to route- and
line-level analysis. A network level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for Title
VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring
further review. Once average district thresholds for low-income and minority populations were established,
subsequent equity analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service
changes of 25% or greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major
service changes experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes
with major service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group
levels (block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•
•

Systemwide, bus service was increased by over 56 daily revenue hours
Of the over 63,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes (both bus
and rail), minority and low-income populations represented a higher share of population than district
averages. Of this cumulative figure, 33,000 would receive service improvements for equity populations.
At the route level, equity routes and non-equity routes1 were compared only for those with major service
changes. The one bus route with major service changes serves above-average minority or low-income
populations

In review of Route 30, there are no adverse impacts. In review of all rail Lines (C Line and F Line),
there were no adverse impacts for minority populations at the network level. However, there is a
potential disproportionate burden for low-income populations when aggregating the proposed
changes to all rail lines.
An analysis of all district block groups and their service levels was conducted to establish the baseline equity
thresholds for low-income and minority populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of

the August 2022 to January 2023 service change. Block groups with low-income and minority populations at or
above the district average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas higher income and
non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (16.8%) and
minority population (35.4%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in annual trips for
equity versus non-equity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for
potential adverse impacts.

There are 1,916 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District2. Using the 2018 5Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the total
minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the District-wide lowincome and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average.
While the percent minority figure of 35.4% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.019
million) the low-income population percentage of 16.8% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure. This
is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine3. The thresholds
summarized in Error! Reference source not found.4 yielded 751 (39% of all) block groups above the district
average for low-income population, and 715 (37%) block groups above the district average for minority
population.

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate to determine overall impacts to underlying
population. Table 4 summarizes the change in service for block group population within one quarter mile of bus
or rail stops with proposed major service changes proportionally compared to population in the District. This
comparison reviews the equity composition of those who may be impacted by proposed service changes
compared to the overall equity composition of the District overall. Table 5 summarizes the change in rail service
using the same methodology.

Some block groups are not completely contained within district boundaries due to differences in boundaries between the
District and Census-defined geographies.

The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total population and

populations benefitting 1.84% more than non-minority population and low-income populations benefitting

not disproportionately impacted by the elimination of service to the C and F Lines; however, the burden on lowincome populations relative to higher income populations slightly exceeds the threshold.

Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether there is an alternative
that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or disproportionate burden on
low-income customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals.
Alterations to the initial proposed January 2023 service changes4 include adding improvements to Route 30,
which serves high concentrations of equity populations. Although the C and F Lines are proposed to be
permanently discontinued, stations currently served by the C and F Lines will continue to be served by rail service
at 15-minute peak headways. The stations served prior to the discontinuation of the C Line will continue to be
served by the D Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the W or E Line required to continue to
Denver Union Station. The stations served prior to the discontinuation of the F Line will continue to be served
by the E Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the D or H Line required to continue to 18th•Stout
Station. These service changes signify the agency’s commitment to ensure an equitable distribution of service
improvements and to minimize impacts with the permanent discontinuance of these rail lines.
In addition to the systemwide-level findings below, RTD’s on-going pandemic response, the substantial ridership
decline, personnel impacts, resource allocation (human and capital) and recovery uncertainty serves as
justification for maintaining the January 2023 service changes proposal.

Service Equity Analysis: January 2023
•

Of the more than 36,000 people with access to bus stops within the service area of the bus route with
a major service improvement, minority and low-income groups represented a higher share of the
population than district averages, indicating targeted services to equity populations

•

When considering the demographics within the service areas of the bus route with a major service
change and as a proportion to the District overall, both minority and low-income populations
received a greater increase in service (were positively impacted more) compared to nonequity populations. Minority areas had +1.84% benefit above non-minority areas and low-income
areas received +1.67% compared to higher-income areas

•

Of the over 27,000 people with access to rail stations with major service decreases, low-income
populations were impacted at a lower rate than the higher-income district average, whereas minority
populations represented a higher share of the population than non-minority populations.

Description
Split Route 12 into the former Routes 7 (see page 14) and 12, with the
northern portion operating as Route 7 between 38th/Blake Station and
Northglenn at 112th Station, and the southern portion continuing operating
between Englewood Station and 38th/Blake Station as the Route 12. This
proposal is aimed at improving on-time performance, by creating two
shorter route alignments with separate operating schedules and greater
opportunities for schedule recovery.
Schedule adjustments resulting from running time analysis, aimed at
improving on-time performance are proposed.
Schedule adjustments are proposed to coordinate the anticipated changes
to the Route 15 operating schedule.

Extend the weekday span of service. The route currently operates from 9
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. northbound, and 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. southbound. This
extends service to cover from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. both directions. Sunday, add
southbound service over the alignment. Due to a previous configuration that
is no longer in use, route 30 only runs northbound on Sundays from 8 a.m.
to 5 p.m.
Schedule adjustments to allow for better connections between services.
Schedule adjustments resulting from running time analysis, aimed at
improving on-time performance are proposed.
Reroute route 76 in the area between I-70 and Olde Town Arvada Station to
enhance operational safety. New northbound routing will be R – 52nd Ave, L
– Vance St, C – 53rd Ave, to regular routing. New southbound routing will
be C – Vance St, R – 52nd Ave, L – Wadsworth Blvd, to regular routing. This
will add service to stops #21428 and 22763, without losing service to any
current stops.
Schedule adjustments resulting from running time analysis, aimed at
improving on-time performance are proposed.
Adjust the meet times at Colorado at 72nd Ave Station with the N Line for
better connections, weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays.
Adjust the meet times at Colorado at 72nd Ave Station with the N Line for

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
January 2023 Service Change

Committee Meeting Date:
October 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
October 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the January 2023 Service Change package as revised and
summarized in Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute
contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager of Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
As is customary with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargain
Agreement shared between RTD and ATU 1001, the January 2023 Service Change Proposal facilitates
both an opportunity for RTD bus and rail operators to vote new work assignments and the opportunity
for Service Development staff to make adjustments to the operations plan for RTD’s transit network.
With the Board’s adoption of the Reimagine RTD System Optimization Plan (SOP) in July 2022, several
of the proposals herein initiate the first phases of implementation of the SOP. The January 2023
proposals related to the SOP were selected, modified and based on RTD’s current capacity to provide
service. Workforce availability challenges persist, tying the sequencing of SOP-related route proposals
more directly to specific operating division’s capacity for additional work assignments. It should be noted
that efforts to increase operator availability through intensified recruitment and increased employee
outreach continue.
DISCUSSION
Following the guidelines contained in the Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Community Value and
Customer Excellence and recognizing the RTD’s workforce challenges, the proposals herein are directed
at improving on-time performance, maintaining Collective Bargaining Agreement compliance and
implementing the first phase of the SOP.
The Board adopted guidance for proposed service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders;

Attachment A
January 2023 Service Change Proposal

Routes 7 – North Washington
12 – Downing/North Washington
Current on-time performance 26.8% late, 71.5% on-time
As outlined in the RTD Board-approved System Optimization Plan, it is proposed to split
Route 12 into the former Routes 7 and 12, with the northern portion operating as Route 7
between 38th/Blake Station and Northglenn at 112th Station, and the southern portion
continuing operating between Englewood Station and 38th/Blake Station as the Route 12.
This proposal is aimed at improving the on-time performance, by creating two shorter
route alignments with separate operating schedules and greater opportunities for schedule
recovery. This proposal is the first phase of implementing the Route 12 as described in the
Reimagine RTD System Optimization Plan (SOP) and does not contain the separate
branches and increased headway frequency. Further changes are necessary to realize the
full SOP proposal and will be proposed as resources become available. Anticipated cost
impact 16 hours 1 vehicle and 1.5 FTE.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue proposal withdrawn for further adjustments relating to CBA
compliance and service suitability.
Responding to frequent customer requests, this proposal expands service east, to Aurora
Plaza (Del Mar Circle) at 60-minute frequencies as outlined in the RTD Board-approved
System Optimization Plan. This proposal is the first phase of implementing the Route 10
as described in the Reimagine RTD SOP and does not contain the increased headway
frequency. Further changes are necessary to realize the full SOP proposal and will be
proposed as resources become available. Anticipated cost impacts are estimated to be 40
hours, 3 vehicles, 5 FTE
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue
Current on-time performance 25.3% late, 70.6% on-time
It is proposed to perform a running time analysis to improve on-time performance of the
route. Anticipated cost estimated to be one all-day vehicle and 1.5 FTE.
Route 15 – East Colfax Avenue
Current on-time performance 28.1% late, 67.9% on-time
Schedule adjustments resulting from running time analysis, aimed at improving on-time
performance are proposed. Anticipated cost impacts are estimated to be 12 hours ,one
vehicle and 1.5 FTE for all service days.

Consistent with the SOP, it is proposed to extend the weekday span of service. The route
currently operates from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. northbound, and 10:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
southbound. It is proposed to extend service to cover from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. both
directions. Sunday it is proposed to add southbound service over the alignment. Due to a
previous configuration that is no longer in use, route 30 only runs northbound on Sundays
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. As proposed in the SOP, it is necessary to give the area bidirectional service. This proposal is the first phase of implementing the Route 30 as
described in the SOP and does not contain the reassignment of branches and increased

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Fourth Amendment to CEO and GM Employment
Agreement

Committee Meeting Date:
October 13, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
October 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt a Fourth Amendment to the CEO and GM Employment Agreement to
adjust the appraisal criteria for the January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 performance period for
General Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson as set forth in the proposed amendment.
Added to Committee Agenda by the Performance Committee Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws
Article VI., Section 1(b). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
REPRESENTATIVE
Director Shontel Lewis, Performance Committee Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board and Ms. Johnson entered into an employment agreement, dated September 29, 2020, which
provides that the Board, in consultation with Ms. Johnson, will adopt a program by which the Board will
annually evaluate Ms. Johnson’s performance. The deadline for the Board to adopt the performance
evaluation program was originally March 9, 2021. Consistent with the anticipated RTD Strategic Plan
development timeline, in February 23, 2021, the Board approved a First Amendment to the Agreement,
extending the deadline to no later than June 30, 2021. On June 29, 2021, the Board approved a
Second Amendment further extending the deadline to July 30, 2021. On July 20, 2021, the Board
approved a Third Amendment establishing the annual performance appraisal and incentive compensation
program for Ms. Johnson incorporating the Board-adopted Strategic Plan values, strategic priorities,
success outcomes, and metrics.
Surveys were conducted to establish a baseline to measure the strategic priorities of Community Value,
Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership. On February 17, 2022, the Performance Committee
received a presentation on the results of the Customer Excellence survey (conducted in October 2021)
and the Community Value survey (conducted in November 2021). On September 14, 2022, the
Performance Committee received a presentation on the results of the Employee Ownership survey
(conducted in May 2022, which was held at that time to coincide with represented employees’ bidding
on their shifts prior to the service change implemented later that month).
The follow up Community and Customer surveys were conducted by BBC Research in September. The
follow up Employee survey will not be conducted until spring 2023.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 121

2.16.G

It is recommended that the Board adopt a fourth amendment to the Employment Agreement to adjust
the appraisal criteria for the January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 performance period to
account for the timing of the anticipated follow up Employee Ownership survey given that only a
baseline was established in 2022. The proposed amendment eliminates the Success Outcome of
Employee Ownership and provides that Ms. Johnson will only be evaluated upon Community Value,
Customer Excellence, and Financial Success, with equal weight being given to each for a total of 50%
of the appraisal score for this performance period. The other 50% of the appraisal score will remain
based upon an evaluation of the organizational values (Passion, Respect, Diversity, Trustworthiness,
Collaboration, and Ownership).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact for this recommended action is reflected in the attached agreement and proposed
amendment.

BACKGROUND
In accordance with its Bylaws and the RTD Act, the Board of Directors previously delegated certain
purchasing and contracting authority to the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) in Resolution No. 7,
Series of 1990, adopted August 14, 1990; and Resolution No. 19, Series of 2007, adopted November

The Board additionally delegated budget-transfer authority to the GM/CEO in a Budget Transfer Policy,
adopted February 26, 1985, and Resolution No. 19, Series of 2007, adopted November 20, 2007.
DISCUSSION
In adopting Resolution ____, Series of 2022, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the
strategic priority of Financial Success.
The resolution defines the term “contract” as including any legally binding agreement or purchase orders

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Audit Committee Charter

Committee Meeting Date:
October 11, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
October 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Audit Committee Charter.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In December 2020, the Colorado Office of the State Auditor (OSA) completed a performance audit of
RTD and in April 2021, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) completed a peer review
of RTD’s internal audit function both of which included recommendations for improving RTD’s internal
audit function. RTD entered an engagement with RubinBrown, LLP for professional assistance in
implementing those recommendations according to standards promulgated by the Institute of Internal
Auditors (IIA) as well as to provide guidance regarding the proper staffing of RTD’s internal audit
function.
In January 2022, RubinBrown recommended that RTD outsource its internal audit function in order to
leverage the professional expertise of subject matter experts while also benefitting from the efficiencies
to be gained by contracting for hourly services as opposed to full-time employees.
In February 2022, RTD issued a request for proposals to outsource the internal audit function.
In June 2022, the RTD Board of Directors authorized RTD to enter a contract with RubinBrown, LLP to
provide internal audit services for three base years and two option years.
In July 2022, the RTD Board Chair appointed Directors Catlin, Davidson and Dishell to an Audit Ad Hoc
Committee to coordinate with RubinBrown on recommendations to the Board to implement the
outsourced internal audit function and form an RTD Audit Committee.
DISCUSSION
At the September 13, 2022 Finance and Planning Committee meeting as well as the September 28,
2022 Board meeting, a Discussion item was presented to garner feedback regarding the draft Audit
Committee Charter.
Those changes have been incorporated into the attached document for consideration for final approval.

2.17.I.a

Subject: Audit Committee Charter
Page 2

The Audit Committee will consist of at least three and no more than five members, all of whom, in the judgment
of the Board of Directors, shall be independent in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. To qualify
as independent, an audit committee member may not be employed by, or provide any services to, the
organization beyond their duties as a committee member or Board Member. The members should collectively
possess sufficient knowledge of audit, finance, specific industry knowledge, IT, law, governance, risk, and
control. Because the responsibilities of the Audit Committee evolves in response to regulatory, economic, and
reporting developments, it is important to periodically re-evaluate members’ competencies and the overall
balance of skills on the committee in response to emerging needs. At least one member shall be designated as
the "financial expert," as defined by applicable legislation and regulation.
The Board of Directors shall have three members of the Audit Committee, of whom shall have served on the
Board of Directors for at least one year. Should a Director cease to maintain a position on the Board of Directors,
such a Director can, with the approval of the Board of Directors, continue to serve on the Audit Committee for
a period of up to one year.
The Board or its executive committee will appoint committee members and the committee chair. Provided the
Board does not designate a chair, the members of the Audit Committee, by a majority vote, may designate a
chair.
The term of office for an Audit Committee member is two years for the Board of Directors, except for two initial
one year terms upon initial formation of the Audit Committee. Board Members will have a two-year term,
staggered with at least two Board members’ terms overlapping an election year. External members of the Audit
Committee will have two or three-year terms, staggered to overlap election years. Continuance of Audit
Committee members will be reviewed annually. To ensure continuity within the Audit Committee, the
appointment of members should be staggered to avoid full turnover in the Audit Committee.
Each member of the Audit Committee shall serve for such term or terms as the Board may determine or until
his or her earlier resignation, removal or death. Any vacancy on the Committee shall be filled by the Board. No
member of the Audit Committee shall be removed as a member, except by the Board.
MEETINGS

Attachment: Audit Committee Charter (4710 : Audit Committee Charter)

COMPOSITION

circumstances require. All committee members are expected to attend each meeting, in person or virtually, and
are obligated to prepare for and participate in meetings. The quorum for the Audit Committee will be a majority
of its members.
The Chief Audit Executive (as defined in the internal audit charter) and Chief Financial Officer are required to
attend all Audit Committee meetings. The Chief Audit Executive or designee will facilitate and coordinate
meetings as well as provide ancillary support to the committee, as time and resources permit.
Meeting agendas will be prepared in consultation with Audit Committee members, management, and its
auditors, to be provided in advance to members, along with appropriate briefing materials. Minutes will be
prepared and all documentation related to the Audit Committee and its dealings may be subject to the Colorado

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) Program
Participation Consideration

Committee Meeting Date:
October 11, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
October 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to opt-out of the Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) program.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Leah Riley, Chief Administrative Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In November 2020, Colorado voters approved Proposition 118, the Family and Medical Leave Insurance
Program (FAMLI), which created a statewide paid family and medical leave insurance program. Employee
benefits under FAMLI are funded by a 0.9% premium on employee wages, split between the employee
and the employer. Premium collections for participating entities begin January 2023, and benefits begin
January 2024.
For local government entities that opt to participate in FAMLI, the program supplements the provisions
of the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which provides eligible employees up to 12 weeks
of unpaid job-protected leave per year for specified reasons, by providing eligible employees access to
12 weeks of paid medical and family leave. FMLA also provides military leave entitlements for those on
active duty or on call to active duty.
FAMLI provides 12 weeks of paid leave per year for the same reasons as FMLA but goes beyond by:
• Covering a percentage of an employee’s salary during the leave
• Extending the definition of family member beyond immediate family to grandparents,
grandchildren, siblings and any other individual with whom the employee has a significant
personal bond
• Providing safe leaves for the employee if they or a family member are the victim of domestic
violence, stalking, sexual assault or abuse
• Providing an additional four weeks of leave for complications due to pregnancy or childbirth
Eligibility for FAMLI is based on earnings, whereas FMLA is based on length of employment. An
employee becomes eligible for FAMLI after earning at least $2,500 in wages within the previous four
quarters, whereas the person would need to be employed by the same employer for at least 12 months
and would need to have worked a minimum of 1,250 hours to be eligible for FMLA. Leave for any
qualifying reason under FAMLI that also qualifies under FMLA runs concurrently.

Paid benefits under FAMLI equate to 90 percent of the State Average Weekly Wage (SAWW) plus 50
percent of the employee’s wage above SAWW, up to a $1,100 weekly max. As of May 2022, the
SAWW annual salary equivalent is $63,024.
FAMLI is designed to run concurrently with FMLA. Employees will be able to use FAMLI and FMLA
leaves for circumstances covered by both laws; however, eligible employees may take FAMLI related
leave for circumstances not covered by FMLA followed by an additional 12 weeks of FMLA. Employers
cannot require that an employee first use their accrued paid time off (PTO) or sick/vacation leave to be
paid during FAMLI.
A local government entity, meaning any county, city and county, town, school district, special district,
authority, or other political subdivision of the state, has three options under the FAMLI provisions:
1. Participate fully
2. Decline participation fully
3. Decline employer participation and provide an alternative
A local government entity that elects to fully participate in FAMLI must remain in the program and agree
to pay premiums for a minimum of three years.
The governing body of a local government that elects to decline participation, whether fully or for the
employer only, must take testimony and provide notice to employees and the opportunity to submit
comments through a public process prior to final action. In addition, notice of the final action must be
provided to employees and the FAMLI Division of the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment
must be notified of the outcome by January 1, 2023.
As of the submission date of this recommended action, the Colorado municipalities that have opted-out
of FAMLI include:
•
•

DISCUSSION

2.17.J

RTD currently provides employees access to paid leave to take care of themselves or their family during
life circumstances that pull them away from their jobs. However, in recognizing the leaves under the
FAMLI program build upon these benefits in certain instances, staff recommends the Board vote to optout of mandatory participation in FAMLI to enable employees to decide what is best for their own
situation. Doing so will excuse compulsory premiums on all employees regardless of their participation.
No employee will receive a reduction in benefits regardless of their decision to participate in FAMLI or
not.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the strategic priorities of Employee
Ownership and Financial Success.
The table below provides an overview of current leave benefits offered:

In addition, the table below provides a description of the benefits offered through the FAMLI program:

On Monday, September 26, 2022, the General Manager and CEO, provided a memorandum to all
employees with information regarding the FAMLI program’s premiums and benefits. The Chief
Administrative Officer facilitated a virtual Lunch-n-Learn session on Wednesday, September 29, 2022, to
further educate and inform employees regarding the FAMLI program and to provide notification of this
recommended action. In addition, informational posters outlining all benefits available to employees,

including those that will be available from the FAMLI program, have been placed in all breakrooms in
RTD facilities. This advance notification exceeds FAMLI requirements and will allow ample time for
employees to prepare written comments or public testimony at the October 11, 2022 Finance and
Planning Committee meeting and the October 25, 2022 Board of Directors meeting when FAMLI
participation will be considered by the Board for final action.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated financial impact of opting in to FAMLI is $2,022,683 for the initial program year, split
equally between the agency and employees.
