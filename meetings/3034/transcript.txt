ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: 301. I'd like to do a roll call, Miss McManus, to see who's on the
call please.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK. I see Director Cook, Director Buzek, Director Catlin, Director
Tisdale, Director Whitmore, John McKay.
0635.
JOHN MURRAY: John Murray.
BARBARA MCMANUS: John Murray. And then we also from staff have Paul Ballard, Melanie
Schneider, Greg Moser, myself- Barbara McManus, and John McKay.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you so much. So I would like to call the Executive
Committee to order for 9/24 at 3:02 PM. I would like to start this meeting by asking both
Director-- First Vice Chair Catlin and Mr. Moser to just kind of do an overview of the GMES
process. Just a very short, if you don't mind.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Go ahead, Greg.
GREG MOSER: Thank you very much. Would you, Chair Rivera-Malpiede, would you like me
to start from the very beginning or from the last few weeks and why we're here today, or what
would you like?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes. Why we are here today would be great. Thank you.
GREG MOSER: OK. So everybody is aware that Deborah Johnson was selected as the candidate
to move forward as the next General Manager CEO of the RTD. And so the last several weeks
since that decision and that vote took place, we have been going back and forth and having
conversations with Miss Johnson about contract details and contract terms.
So I have been talking to her on a daily basis, multiple times a day, throughout the last couple of
weeks on various items. I've been discussing with her some of the upcoming decisions and
decisions that the Board has made recently made with regards to cuts in salary reductions, things
like that, recommendations, and where the budget is going to be headed in terms of putting
together the budget in-- that's going to be recommended to the Board in October.
And we've had a variety, the GMES committee, has had a variety of meetings in executive
session where I've been able to share feedback from Miss Johnson as to her comfort level with
some of the terms and what her desires and requests were with regards to salaries, vacation,
retirement, contract length, and details like that. The GMES has provided me with their own
feedback and requests and I have gone back to Miss Johnson as well and shared some of that.
And we've worked in tandem to come to something that I think everybody is amenable to and
agreeable to, and both sides had to give a little and take a little. And so I believe that the reason

we're meeting today is that the GMES has made a recommendation of a contract to-- for the
Board to consider and to take action on.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Thank you. Thank you so much. I would now like to
call an executive session pursuant to 24-6-402(4)(f)(l) crs for the consideration of personnel
matters regarding General Manager and Chief Executive Officer candidate, Deborah A. Johnson.
24-6-402(4)(e)(l) crs for determining positions relative to the matters that are subject to
negotiations and instructing negotiations regarding new General Manager and Chief Executive
Officer contract. And 24-6-402(4)(b) C.R.S. to receive legal advice regarding the same. So all of
you have received another calendar invite within a separate call, so I'm going to ask that we get
off this call-- this meeting and go on to the next one.
MELANIE SNYDER: Madam Chair, can you-- did you call for a vote?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, I'm sorry.
PEGGY CATLIN: We need to make the motion.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Is there a motion?
PEGGY CATLIN: I move that we go into executive session.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
MELANIE SNYDER: Second?
SHELLEY COOK: Second, Shelley Cook.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All in favor. Is there any against? Hearing none, we will now go
into executive session and then we will come back out of executive session when we are
complete. Thank you.
Secretary Buzek, Mr. MOSER, Mr. McKay, Miss McManus, First Vice Chair Catlin, General
Managers Snyder, Director Tisdale, Director Whitmore. Who is 0958?
JOHN MURRAY: That's John McKay.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thanks, John. 0635?
JOHN MURRAY: John from the post.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thanks, John. And 0184?
NATALIE MENTEN: Menten.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And then I have Miss Aragon-- or no, Mr. Ballard. I think that's
it. Am I missing anybody? Oh, Director Williams, are you on the line?
BARBARA MCMANUS: I don't see her.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. What about Mr. Walker-- Director Walker?
BARBARA MCMANUS: I don't see him.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. All right. Well, let's go ahead and come back to order. This
is the Executive Committee for 9/24/2020 and this is for to move forward the approval of the
board agenda for 9/25-- for 9/26. Do I have a motion?
VINCE BUZEK: Madam Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
VINCE BUZEK: Yeah, it's for 9/29, I believe, the agenda. So I would move that the draft agenda
that has been presented to us be moved forward as the agenda for September 29 with one
addition that an executive session with the same-- pursuant to the same terms as today's
executive session be inserted immediately prior to the consideration of the recommended action.
And with that, that's my motion.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Do I hear?
SHELLEY COOK: Second, Shelley Cook.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Oh. I think what I'd like to do is any opposed?
VINCE BUZEK: Nope. There's four of us.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yup. OK. We're good to go. And it's been amended to add an
executive session.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I'd like to add for the record that Director Walker has joined.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Welcome, Director Walker. That is all we have on
the agenda. There other matters. Director-- Chair-- Second Vice Chair Cook, do you have
anything under other matters on the leading format?
SHELLEY COOK: Well, thank you. So is this the item that we're looking at the pilot project for
reduce fail?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Correct.

SHELLEY COOK: Is that what we're? OK. I don't have a lot to report. I've been discussing the
practice in the past with former board members and trying to get a sense for what prompted the
change, so that if we do try it out again, we can hopefully avoid the problems that led to
committees of the whole, or otherwise enlighten things.
And I've talked to Director Tisdale who has graciously agreed to help in this effort. So beyond
that, I need to work with Barbara McManus on a calendar for this to figure out when it comes
forward. So that's all I have at this moment. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Director Cook, excuse me, if you already mentioned this multitasking,
but the ad hoc committee will be yourself and Director Tisdale, correct?
SHELLEY COOK: Whoops. Mute. That's correct. Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you.
I do-- if I could just take advantage of this to ask? If there is a way to find the bylaws or the
motion that made the change with the backup for that in that 2008 to 2010 time-frame, and we
can track that down pretty readily, I'd love to see that, Barbara, if we have that in our archives.
We can't search beyond to 2010 online so I can't get it myself. But if we found that someplace, it
would be hugely helpful.
I will look at that. I do-- I have asked Lisa Trujillo if she and I could have a phone conversation,
if she could recall some of the dates. Some of our repository from back then is stored in a very
different way. And the process, as well as the documentation back then, was nothing like it looks
like today. So searching for that would take some time, so I am going to work with her for some- with some reference and see if we can't bring forward a short synopsis of what that path looked
like.
OK. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
Are there any other matters to come before the Executive Committee? OK. Seeing none, we are
adjourned at 3:32. Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: Have a good weekend.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Everybody have a good weekend. Thank you.
GREG MOSER: See you next week. Thanks.
