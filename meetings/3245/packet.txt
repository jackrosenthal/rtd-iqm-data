BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
State Performance Audit Recommendation Implementation
Status

Committee Meeting Date:
September 14, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2020, the Colorado Office of the State Auditor (OSA) conducted a performance audit regarding
several aspects of RTD’s operations. In January 2021, OSA released its audit report, which included the
following overarching recommendations:
• Improve supervision through regular performance feedback and recognition for operators, and
supervisory training
• Ensure bus operators receive adequate rest breaks in line with the collective bargaining agreement
• Improve processes for assigning schedules to operators, and provide training on managing and
mitigating fatigue
• Improve the internal audit function’s effectiveness and compliance with Internal Audit Standards
• Establish procedures and expectations for how the internal audit function will be utilized,
supervised, and evaluated
• Identify a meaningful performance metric to replace the statutory farebox recovery ratio and work
with the General Assembly to amend statute accordingly
DISCUSSION
Staff began to implement measures to address OSA’s recommendations beginning in January 2021,
which measures include but are not limited to:
• Conducting peer agency surveys to garner industry best practices regarding employee retention
and recognition, performance feedback, and exit interviews
• Leveraging training modules created by the National Transit Institute at Rutgers University
• Engaging with a peer review panel convened by the American Public Transportation Association
to review and recommend enhancements to the agency’s Internal Audit Function
• Contracting with a consultant to implement the peer review panel’s recommendations
• Implementing internal process enhancements
• Implementing transit service levels commensurate with current workforce availability
The timeline for the agency’s response is as follows:
▪ Early October 2021:
OSA to request draft status report
▪ Late November 2021: Status report and supporting documentation due
▪ Mid December 2021:
OSA to review report, submit follow-up questions

measures as it becomes available.
