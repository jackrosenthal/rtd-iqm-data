Why RTD Issued Debt in the Past
▪ Funded transit assets that revenue alone cannot cover
▪ Financial constraints of revenue received vs. operating and capital needs
▪ Spread cost of asset across useful life of asset in terms of cash flow
▪ Ongoing capital needs include:
• Vehicles, equipment, and facilities
• Infrastructure construction and state of good repair

▪ FasTracks project build-out and 2004 election
• Voters authorized debt issuance
• Within certain parameters

Can RTD Issue Debt Today?
▪ Colorado Constitution Article X, § 20 (Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights or “TABOR”) requires voter
approval for increases in government debt, which includes RTD

▪ In 2004, voters authorized RTD to issue FasTracks debt up to the following parameters:

FasTacks Revenue Bonds
▪ FasTracks Revenue Bonds were the main type of debt issued by RTD to finance FasTracks
project construction

▪ FasTracks Revenue Bonds, at the time of issuance, pledged the use of future sales and use
tax revenue to the future scheduled repayment of principal and interest

▪ Repayment of the debt does not require appropriation in the annual budget, because
investors were given a first lien on the future sales and use tax revenue

▪ Investors are paid before the tax revenue comes to RTD

October 22, 2025

Packet Pg. 24

Certificates of Participation
▪ COPs are secured by a lease of an essential asset
▪ RTD historically used COPs as a financing tool to fund various essential Base and FasTracks
capital assets, but mainly buses and light rail vehicles

▪ COPs can be used to finance any capital assets that are essential to RTD
▪ If RTD does not make the scheduled principal and interest payments, the leased assets
(usually buses and light rail vehicles) will be forfeited by RTD

▪ COPs will not be repaid unless the annual principal and interest payments are appropriated in
RTD’s annual budget

▪ The requirement for annual appropriation is why COPs are not limited by TABOR

How Much Can RTD Borrow with COPs?
▪ RTD’s ability to finance capital assets with COPs is limited by its ability to repay the obligation
▪ The Fiscal Policy requires that RTD maintain a Net Revenue Coverage Ratio of 1.2x or higher
▪ If RTD borrows too much, some consequences could be:
• Difficulty maintaining operating expense, service levels, and state of good repair while paying related
principal and interest payments

• Credit ratings may decrease
• Cost of future borrowings may increase
• Risk of forfeiting leased assets may rise
• Investors may not participate in future COPs issuances

Requested by Director Benker

▪

Question: How much are we applying for state grants? The SB 230 grant and the retail delivery fee grant (if DRCOG has control of this grant, please list what we are
requesting).

▪

Answer:

•

Pending requests: $9 million for 2026 and $40 million for 2027 in SB24-230 Local Transit Operations Funds
Notice of Funding Availability issued by CTE stipulates that funds must be used for transit operations, not for capital projects or planning.
On September 17, RTD staff submitted a request for $9 million in 2026 and $40 million in 2027. These amounts are estimates by CTE and
could change depending on revenues collected as part of the fee. CTE leadership is currently reviewing the application.

•

Future opportunities that are being monitored:

SB24-230 Rail Program: $18 million per year (statewide), 20% of program total
Guidance has not been issued by CTE on distribution of funds, and staff is tracking closely to pursue as appropriate.
SB24-230 Competitive Grant Program: $9 million per year (statewide), 10% of program total
Guidance has not been issued by CTE on distribution of funds, and staff is tracking closely to pursue as appropriate.

SB21-260 Retail Delivery Fee:
Distribution Method 1 (MMOF): $30 million in the Denver Region (total between 2030-2032)
Distribution Method 2 (CTE Grant Programs): $20 million per grant cycle (still on the first cycle, but staff expects it to be approx. every 2 years)

SB24-184 Car Rental Fee: $70 million (statewide)
There has been no funding made available from this fee yet, but RTD is tracking this program and will explore alignment with
our needs when it is made available.

Question: Prioritize capital asset request of $226 million.

▪

Answer: It is required that RTD has a singular list of prioritized assets. Sharing the ranking without the context of the full working group parameters
does a disservice. In the Transit Asset Management Plan, staff describes the process by which assets investment are prioritized. The ranking is the
result of that process and is relative rank order only. Additional context is EUL and other FTA-required variables. Cost, risk, performance, equity, and
subject-matter expertise across the departments are all variables. These include software as an asset in the TAM Plan, which is generally not capital.

Question: Stated purpose per the Board fiscal rules for the description/use of Unrestricted Reserve.

▪

Answer: There are currently no funds available in the Unrestricted Reserve, as it is a negative balance of -$131 million as of August 31, 2025,
versus prior year at +$45 million. Staff expects to receive federal grant funding before year end to improve this balance.

Unrestricted Reserve

The RTD Fiscal Policy does not address the Unrestricted Reserve, as it serves as a balance of funds available for RTD financial needs within Board
auspices beyond three months of operating expense, the capital replacement fund that is currently underfunded, and the FasTracks Internal Savings

Question: In the 5 year Forecast, why do we increase COPs and let Capital Replacement Reserve increase? What is the federal grant request for
purchasing vehicles in future years?

▪

Answer:

•

At least $428 million in capital needs is expected in 2031 based on the AMP, mostly for rail infrastructure.

•

The 2030 ending capital replacement fund balance in the July 2025 Five-Year Financial Forecast is $383 million, which is insufficient to cover.

•

Financing with COPs was included in the July 2025 Five-Year Financial Forecast for state of good repair capital needs based on the AMP and
where revenue and reserve forecasts are insufficient to cover these needs through 2030.

•

RTD uses Section 5339 Bus and Bus Facilities formula funds to request buses. RTD cannot use these funds until at least 2027 when the spare
ratio reaches 20% or below.

•

RTD has received CDOT funding totaling $3 million and is currently using those funds to purchase five buses.

▪

Question: Why would be borrow funds to purchase $20 million when we have healthy capital reserves?

▪

Answer: The Capital Replacement Fund is insufficient for 2026 and 2027 state-of-good-repair requirements, so it is not considered healthy. Debt
financing in the 2026 Proposed Budget is $20 million for cutaway vehicles (i.e., paratransit or FlexRide). In 2026, staff will bring an action item to the
Finance and Planning Committee to recommend approval of the 2026 Certificates of Participation (COPs) issuance. Reserves are insufficient to fund
capital requirements over the next five years. Reserves are currently as follows as of August 31, 2025:

•

$192 million FasTracks Internal Savings Account

•

$261 million Capital Replacement Fund – Insufficient for 2026 and 2027 capital expenditures projected at approximately $568 million

•

$301 million Operating Reserve – Three months of operating expense

•

($131) million Unrestricted Reserve – Federal funds typically drawn down later in the year

Borrowing from the FasTracks Internal Savings Account
▪

Question: Instead of borrowing from the markets, could we just borrow from FISA and make a commitment as a board to put it back next year?
There’s a lot of people who think that our revenue forecasts are low and if that’s the case, then we’ll absolutely have the money to put the money
back into FISA. And if Karen is wrong, then we can have that conversation next year. Is there any reason that that would not be preferable to taking
on short term debt?

▪

Answer: There is no short-term debt in the 2026 Proposed Budget. The Board could choose to borrow $20 million from the FISA in 2026 only for
FasTracks capital requirements instead of financing cutaway vehicles; however, that is not very beneficial, would not support requirements over the
period of 2026-2030, and is not recommended. Over the course of the next two years, staff forecasts that RTD will need to borrow funds for capital
requirements. Additionally, with the Unrestricted Reserve at -$131 million as of August 31, 2025, that amount is essentially already currently borrowed
from the other reserves:

•

$192 million FasTracks Internal Savings Account

•

$261 million Capital Replacement Fund – Insufficient for 2026 and 2027 capital expenditures projected at approximately $568 million

•

$301 million Operating Reserve – Three months of operating expense

2026 Transit Asset Management Plan
▪

Question: Why is the 2026 capital plan so different from the one outlined in last year’s budget for 2026? Last year, the 2026 TAM was $48 million. It is now $226 million.

▪

Answer: As noted in RTD’s 2024 Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan, the Asset Management Division has been working with asset stewards to improve asset information maturity, which
improves ability to generate accurate plans. By focusing on asset management fundamentals under the auspices of the Back to Basics Strategic Initiative, the improvement in available information
is reflected in the change in communicated renewal needs. As stated in the TAM Plan, this work will continue until such point as plans place an accurate budget (within +/-10% of actual costs) in
the correct year to enable delivery on RTD’s mission. Last year’s 2026 AMP total of $48 million reflected a narrow view of needs. Since then, staff applied the Asset Maturity Improvement full
treatment to light rail track and corrected the track inventory, inspection method, and renewal strategy. That work surfaced approximately $307 million over the 2026-2030 planning horizon not
fully visible before. Of the approximately $307M million, an estimated $128M was for 2026. The TAM Plan documents the track strategy shift, the improved inventory granularity, and the use of
condition information to plan full-depth age-minus renewals for safe, reliable service.

•

Downtown rail renewals: In 2024, the large light rail downtown track renewal effort was authorized, approximately $150 million beginning in 2025. That decision clarified the magnitude of required work and
made it consistent with what now appears in the 2026 AMP.

•

Governance and scope integration: Scope that was previously outside or bypassing the AMP process, particularly IT, cyber, and light rail has now been folded into the single pipeline as governance tightens. The
2024 TAM Plan outlines this development process, the bypass mechanism used for unplanned or emergency needs, and the effort to maintain one prioritized list to stay compliant with FTA requirements.

▪

The increase between 2026 and 2027 reflects planning maturity. Historically, staff refined the near year the most, so out-year figures in the plan change as information matures. The TAM Plan is
explicit that the AMP feeds the Five-Year Financial Forecast and that staff updates and reprioritizes annually; only the adopted budget year is truly funded, and out years are planning views. As
asset information improves, the plan becomes more accurate, and the amounts change with progress.

▪

The increase from $48 million to $226 million in 2026 is mostly the newly validated track renewals uncovered by the full depth-replacement, approximately $150 million, plus additional scope now
routed through the AMP. The TAM Plan accurately describes this as intentional improvement in maturity with the same approach expanding next to public facilities and other asset classes, so the
Board should expect further updates as visibility improves.

▪

Accountability and next steps:

▪

•

Staff keeps one list, governed through Asset Management Accountability Leadership Team (AMALT) and GM/CEO, and routes capital asset-related investments through the AMP gates. Emergency bypasses are
the exception and follow a rigorous process, which is documented.

•

As staff continues applying the Asset Maturity Improvement efforts beyond track, future adjustments will be driven by decisions that are prioritized using the finance process where cost, risk, performance, and
equity are the criteria.

Efforts to improve asset information maturity are necessarily thoughtful, deliberate, and take time to develop. The 2026 change reflects better information and stronger discipline.

Transit Utilization and Cost Growth
▪

Question: Why have we not been able to restore service at 100% of pre-Covid levels when some other transit agencies around the country have been able to. We know that on one level it’s simply
because revenue growth has not kept up with expense growth, but what is different about other agencies that enabled them to avoid this situation?
Have they been able to increase revenues at a greater rate somehow, either via directly increasing the number of dollars per person they get from their service population via fares or taxes, or by enjoying
a faster growing economy?
Have they been able to somehow achieve a slower level of cost growth? If so, in what areas are they doing this, and how are they able to do it (and we are not)? Is it because we are only recently
investing a higher proportion of revenues into maintenance?

▪

Answer: Transit utilization and demand varies within specific metropolitan areas for a wide variety of reasons. A Federal Transit Administration study released in August 2024 highlights the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic on transit ridership and accessibility. The report concludes:
“Extended stay-at-home orders and reduced overall travel decimated transit ridership during the peak of the pandemic and altered transit operations. In response to decreased ridership, operator
shortages, and other factors, agencies reduced operating hours to provide only base levels of service for essential workers and transit-dependent riders. Some agencies tried to mitigate service
cuts in neighborhoods with higher percentages of transit-dependent riders and essential workers. Nonetheless, as the primary riders during the pandemic, these populations were disproportionally
impacted by cuts to service and lost access to needed transit services at a higher rate than others.’
Many transit agencies are realigning service based on changed travel behaviors that may never return to pre-pandemic patterns. Although ridership is slowly recovering, many agencies face
ongoing fiscal challenges due to decreased fare revenues and dwindling Federal relief funding. Larger agencies that have historically relied heavily on fare revenue and cannot use Federal grant
funding for general operations are particularly at risk of facing significant funding shortfalls in the next three to five years. In addition, the industry continues to face workforce and supply chain
issues that are driving cost increases for agencies. Federal, State, and local governments will need to revisit historic approaches to transit funding. The economic, environmental, and societal
benefits of public transportation are extensive and important. Without additional sustained support, transit agencies may have to take actions that could negatively affect riders and communities
across the country.”

▪

The Denver Metro region experiences a higher degree of remote work, commercial space vacancy downtown, and micromobility utilization than other metropolitan areas in general, which
results in less demand for public transit. The system is at a point where it requires state-of-good repair investments and services have been increased over the past several years.

Question: One of the most significant changes between the July and September presentations is the addition of more than half a billion dollars in new
borrowing. This was not included in July, and its appearance in September without a detailed explanation of repayment, debt capacity, or project-level
allocations warrants substantial additional explanation and consideration. The board needs a clear understanding of the debt’s impact on our future
operations. Adoption of the forecast under these circumstances would put the Board in the position of endorsing a major borrowing plan without full
clarity on its long-term consequences.

▪

Answer: Though prior FYFFs did not include a line for financing proceeds, staff determined it should be added for the Finance and Planning
Committee to review for the meeting on September 9, 2025. The 2026-2030 forecasted revenue, expenditures, and capital are projected to require
debt financing due to insufficient projected revenue and reserves in that time period. The 2026 portion of debt financing in the 2026 Proposed Budget
is $20 million for cutaway vehicles (i.e., paratransit or FlexRide). In 2026, staff will bring an action item to the Finance and Planning Committee to
recommend approval of the 2026 Certificates of Participation (COPs) issuance. The 2027 portion of proposed debt financing in the 2027 Budget is
expected to be brought to the Board of Directors for decision in Q4 2026, the 2028 portion in Q4 2027, the 2029 portion in Q4 2028, and the 2030
portion in Q4 2029. Typically, staff issues COPs for vehicle purchases over the life of the vehicle with buses typically 14 years and cutaway vehicles
typically ten years. Debt will not exceed the useful life of the underlying assets. Ability to issue COPs generally has two constraints: 1) fiscal policy
indirectly through net revenue coverage and 2) what investors are willing to buy. RTD COPs currently carry a very highly AA+ rating from S&P. There is
a degree of credit rating risk in issuing additional debt; however, reserves are insufficient to fund capital requirements over the next five years. Buses
and cutaway vehicles are not project-specific but part ongoing fleet replacement. The impact of debt issuance is expected to be in the range of $20M$55M per year in maximum annual debt service, assuming the debt issuance is needed and approved by the Board in future years. Interest rates will
likely change, and decisions would be made in future years on how the debt would be structured and exactly when it would be issued.

Question: The connection between the forecast, the Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan, and the successful delivery of RTD’s electrification goals is left
unclear in the documents provided to the Board. The forecast also relies on significant assumptions about our capacity to carry out the transition plan
given changing market conditions and vehicle availability. The forecast does not delineate the impact of this new borrowing on the funding
opportunities for new facilities.

▪

Answer: Staff plans to acquire clean diesel vehicles until lower emission vehicles are available for purchase due to the impact of tariffs on the supply
chain, scarcity of original equipment manufacturers, Buy America/Build America restrictions, and lack of availability of low- or zero-emission vehicles.
Staff remains committed to the acquisition of low- and zero-emission vehicles, predicated on funding availability, Board approval, vehicle availability,
adequate workforce, provision of modified and new facilities that accommodate those vehicles, FTA fleet replacement policies, current spare ratios, and
fleet replacement schedules. Revenue vehicles are routinely replaced based on useful life and condition, as well as proven technology in place at the
time. Buses need to be replaced under those circumstances, and that process cannot be delayed when zero- or low-emission vehicle acquisition is
impractical or infeasible. The Chair of the RTD Board of Directors, along with the General Manager and CEO and Government Relations Officer,
presented to the Colorado General Assembly Town Hall on December 9, 2024, a long-range plan with looming challenges between projected revenues
compared to expenses for future mobility and sustainability goals. This was also presented to the Colorado General Assembly’s Transportation
Legislative Review Committee on September 8, 2025. An updated long-range financial plan is scheduled to be presented to the RTD Finance and
Planning Committee on October 14, 2025.

Question: There are also important questions about whether the forecast fully aligns with the FISA and with the Board’s adopted fiscal and
investment policies. Revenue projections rely heavily on conservative assumptions about sales tax growth, grants, and federal support, while not fully
accounting for potential risks. The forecast contains major policy implications that will significantly affect RTD’s long-term financial position.

▪

Answer: Staff reviewed the FYFF during its development to ensure alignment with the fiscal and investment policies. Staff determined that funds can
currently be borrowed at a lower interest rate than is achievable in the market with investments; this could change in the future. The FISA is
structured by policy that the Board can change. Conservative revenue projections are part of the fiscal policy, and potential risks are embedded in the
conservative assumption. The purpose of the FYFF is to inform 2026 Budget planning, and the FYFF is not an appropriation of funds. The 2026 Budget
will be presented to the Finance and Planning Committee as a discussion item on October 14, 2025.

Question: Allowing for additional discussion at the next Finance and Planning Committee meeting and the budget study session would give the Board
the opportunity to review the July and September forecasts side by side, understand the projects tied to borrowing, test assumptions under different
conditions, confirm alignment with our fiscal policy and the Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan, and ensure that electrification goals remain achievable.
This is not intended to delay progress, but to make certain the Board has given proper consideration before making this important policy decision.

▪

Answer: Staff presented, as a courtesy, a second scenario in the July 15, 2025, Finance and Planning Committee, and it was suggested during the
meeting that the second scenario should be excluded from the FYFF presentation materials in the September 9, 2025, Finance and Planning
Committee. Scenario planning is best completed as a separate exercise from FYFF development. Rather than testing scenarios in a study session, staff
recommends that additional scenario requests be submitted through the Board office to allow sufficient time and cross-functional collaboration for
proper analysis and reporting. Implementation of the Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan would add approximately $1.4B in capital costs to maintain
current assets and level of service over the long term. The Board may review and approve funding for future electrification goals in futures years when
those budgets are developed. Timing of implementing the Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan is part of the long-range planning process rather than the
FYFF.

FISA Contributions
▪

Question: Will no money go into the FISA?

▪

Answer: Historically, staff contributed approximately $20M annually to the FISA from the FasTracks system and paid for a portion of the Paratransit service.
FasTracks does not have sufficient revenue to continue that practice on an ongoing basis without a subsidy. For 2030, there was forecasted only $0.8M unrestricted
reserve remaining. If staff were to contribute to FISA on an annual basis in 2028-2030, then the Base System would need to subsidize FasTracks to maintain an
unrestricted reserve above $0. This would result in lower reserves in the Base System and potentially additional debt issuance.
The FYFF that was presented to the Finance and Planning Committee on September 9, 2025, followed the Board-adopted fiscal policy, which states: "Funding of the
FISA will be approved by the Board with FISA funding sources including the following:
a. Limit annual growth in FasTracks funding for Base System bus feeder service and Paratransit service to the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Denver-Aurora-Lakewood
b. Sale and lease opportunities for all RTD properties
c. Request local financial participation in projects above the current 2.5%
d. Excess FasTracks sales and use tax contributions as determined by the Board“
FasTracks funding to the Base System for bus feeder service and Paratransit service at a 3% Consumer Price Index for Denver-Aurora-Lakewood totaling $119M
was included in the total expenditures of FasTracks for 2026-2030 in the FYFF. Staff is currently not forecasting sale and lease opportunities, local financial
participation, or excess FasTracks sales and use tax contributions.
