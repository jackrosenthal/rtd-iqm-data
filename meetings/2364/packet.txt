Integrity of Model Forecasts
Forecasts are updated quarterly to reflect the most current economic
situation.
Forecasts may be too high or too low, reflecting uncertainty in the
economy.
Forecasts are generated from theoretically sound economic relations,
modeled with state-of-the-art methods of modern econometric time
series analysis.
BRD forecasts do not incorporate “add factors” or other subjective
adjustments of model forecasts.
BRD is independent from RTD with no political or financial stake in the
forecast numbers.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Subject:

2016 Budget Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: October 20, 2015
Information

BACKGROUND
The State of Colorado requires that a requested budget be presented to the Board and be made
available for public inspection after giving public notice in newspapers of major distribution by
October 15th of each year. RTD’s 2016 Requested Budget was presented at the Board Study
Session on September 29, 2015. Public notice was given in the October 10-11, 2015 weekend
editions of The Denver Post and The Boulder Daily Camera. Copies of the 2016 Requested Budget
were made available at that time in the Board office for public inspection.
The purpose of this Board report is to update the Board with proposed changes and new information
that has become available since the presentation of the 2016 Requested Budget at the Board Study
Session. The 2016 Recommended Budget (final budget) will then be presented at the November 10th
Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting with a request to forward the budget to the
Board for adoption on November 17th.
DISCUSSION
The attached power point presentation summarizes the revised assumptions incorporated into the
2016 Requested Budget and the resulting changes from the first draft of the 2016 Requested Budget
previously presented at the Board Study Session. Major revisions and areas of focus follow:


Sales/use taxes are not revised from the first draft Requested Budget previously presented.
Both the first draft budget and this update incorporate the CU-Leeds School September
forecast. The Recommended Budget will not be revised further for sales/use tax because
the CU-Leeds School December forecast will not be received before final budget adoption.
For 2016, sales/use tax is budgeted to increase 8.0% over the 2015 projection. The
2015 projection is forecast to increase 6.2% over 2014 actuals.



Total District-wide operating expenses (excluding depreciation) of $581.1 million are
$17.5 million higher compared to the first draft Requested Budget. The District-wide
Appropriation of $1.541 million is $20.6 million higher than the first draft Requested
Budget. These increases are due to an upward revision to the DTO service payment in
FasTracks Operations, inclusion of costs for the Grand Opening activities for the new
FasTracks service lines, and other revisions to the overall budget, offset by further
expense reductions made to certain departmental budgets to bring them in line with their
SBP target amounts.



Diesel fuel is locked at $2.23/gallon for 2016, down from the 2015 per gallon lock price
of $2.95. The favorable impact year-over-year is $7.4 million. The lock provides budget
certainty for planning purposes.

Packet Pg. 30

1.C.2



Gasoline remains budgeted at $3.40/gallon, down from the 2015 per gallon budget price
of $3.54. The favorable impact year-over-year is $0.6 million.



The capital carryforward (previously approved capital) is not estimated at this time but will
be included in the Recommended Budget.



The cost allocation to FastTracks Operations includes an incremental cost for US36 BRT of
$1.359M as a negotiated cost with the stakeholders.



The Base System unrestricted fund balance is budgeted at $5.2 million, which is the fund
balance estimated in the SBP. The SBP target remains viable after adjusting for
unanticipated expenses and other necessary items.

The 2016 Requested Budget and Fund Balance Report showing the operating and capital sources and
expenditures of the District for the Base System and FasTracks are included as Exhibit I. The
following tables are a summary of the attached Exhibit I. The 2016 Requested Budget column below
includes the revisions noted above (in thousands).

Board Meeting Date: October 20, 2015
Task

Force

BACKGROUND
A Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (Task Force) was formed in November 2010 for the purpose of making
recommendations detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the
Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members
with 12 of those members being external to RTD.
The Task Force presented its written
recommendations to the Board of Directors in June 2011. The Board of Directors subsequently
approved those recommendations and directed Staff to pursue implementation of each recommendation.
The Task Force reconvened for a final meeting in July 2012 to be briefed on the progress of their
recommendations and provide an opportunity for feedback.
DISCUSSION
The Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy recommendations to
the Board of Directors which were approved for further consideration and/or implementation. The
majority of the recommendations made have been completed or their status has not changed since our
last report in March 2015. We continue to report on the status of the Task Force recommendations as
follows:
Recommendations - Completed
Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
RTD contracted with the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business – Business Research Division
(Leeds) to provide sales and use tax forecasts beginning in March 2011. Each quarter, Leeds provides a
forecast containing short-term (one year by quarter), medium-term (six year SBP period) and long-term
(30 year APE period) sales and use tax projections. This was implemented to provide RTD with expert
economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using sophisticated financial modeling techniques not
available internally. These forecasts are intended to provide a better analysis of RTD’s expected sales
and use tax collections which comprise approximately 2/3 of RTD’s recurring revenues.
Service Optimization
In 2012, RTD implemented modifications and reductions in service representing approximately $10.7
million or an 8% net reduction in service. Service optimization was recommended by the Task Force and
implemented with Board approval in order to match services provided with available funding sources.
Since that time, service has been gradually restored as needed within budgetary constraints. We will
assess service optimization in context of the new FasTracks lines opening in 2016.
Fund Balance Policy

Packet Pg. 61

1.C.3

Due to the volatility of RTD’s largest single revenue source, sales and use taxes, the Task Force
recommended implementation of a more robust fiscal policy regarding fund balances. Fund balances
represent financial assets that are available to RTD after allowing for obligations that have been incurred.
Fund balances increase when fund sources exceed fund uses and vice versa. Fund balances, therefore,
exist as a form of savings account to be used for specific purposes when needed and replenished when
economic circumstances allow. In response to this recommendation, RTD implemented a fund balance
policy with a target level of $90 million for the Base System, which is approximately three months of
operating expenses. The target fund balance for FasTracks is two months of operating expenses (with
the third month contributed to FISA). These targets were established based on levels recommended by
the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) best practices. The Fund Balance Policy further
categorizes the available fund balances into the categories of a Board Restricted Fund, a Capital
Replacement Fund and an Unrestricted Fund. At FYE 12/31/14, combined fund balances (including
FasTracks) totaled $29.9 million.
Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
In Colorado, legislation establishes products and services that are subject to sales and use taxation and
those that are exempt from taxation. The state, cities, municipalities and special districts in Colorado
each have different sales and use tax rates and often have differing items subject to taxation due to
legislation establishing exemptions. Exemption parity was identified by the Task Force as providing a
benefit to RTD during difficult economic conditions when the state implements exemption changes and
vice versa. In addition, exemption parity removes the complexity to vendors of RTD having different
taxable items than the state. RTD introduced legislation that was passed in May 2013 to establish
parity with the state regarding items subject to sales and use taxation. Exemption parity took effect
1/1/14. RTD estimates that parity generated a net increase of $2.7 million in 2014 based on 2012
figures, however, this will be difficult to track due to the way vendors report sales tax components.
Technology and Energy Innovation
RTD conducted a comprehensive energy audit of the oldest and largest operating division (the Platte
facility) to determine the potential scope of savings that may be available through equipment and lighting
upgrades. The audit identified that facility lighting upgrades could result in potentially significant energy
savings. Areas for minor energy savings were identified for other building systems; however, these have
a very significant capital investment and long pay-back periods. RTD budgets for energy upgrades
throughout the District in the Strategic Budget Plan, and we will continue to address energy efficiency in
building systems as on-going projects are completed. Facilities Maintenance has done lighting upgrades
replacing older metal-halide fixtures with energy-efficient fluorescent fixtures at the East Metro, Boulder,
and District Shops operating facilities and installed solar panels at East Metro. We are realizing average
savings of approximately $3,000/month at East Metro due to the combination of solar and lighting
upgrades; Boulder is showing approximately $500/month in savings with a lighting upgrade, and to date
District Shops is even. Since our previous report, the following have also been constructed with energy
saving features: 1) Platte: lighting upgrades with the addition of LED lighting in the employee parking
lot, 2) Blake: cooling system/ice builder replacement and copy center ventilation upgrade, 3) District
Shops: HRU replacement, 4) Boulder: lighting upgrades, 5) Boulder Transit Center: replacement of air
cooled condensing unit and coil.
Recommendations – Ongoing
Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
The Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) collects and audits sales and use taxes for RTD. The Task
Force identified an opportunity for revenue enhancement by performing additional sales and use tax
compliance reviews based on the favorable collection experiences of Colorado cities and municipalities

Packet Pg. 62

1.C.3

that implemented these reviews. Compliance reviews consist of RTD providing additional resources
from a contracted provider to supplement the DOR’s audit function and is intended to provide the DOR
with the additional resources necessary to ensure complete and timely tax compliance by vendors. RTD
contracted with Revenue Recovery Group (RRG), an audit firm with substantial experience providing
compliance review services to several Colorado municipalities, and the program began in April 2014. To
date, 80 compliance reviews have been approved to be undertaken by RRG. Additional compliance
reviews were terminated during discovery due to a determination of collection potential. Of the 80
undertaken, 60 are ongoing and 20 are complete. While the 20 completed compliance reviews must still
undergo a review and approval process by DOR, assessments total $646,743 vs. costs of $529,058.
Naming Rights
In August, the RTD Board approved the first naming rights/corporate sponsorship agreement under the
Board-adopted naming rights policy with the University of Colorado for naming the commuter rail A Line
and creating an advertising presence on the Flatiron Flyer bus rapid transit line. In return, RTD will
receive from the University of Colorado total gross payments of $5 million over the next five years, less
implementation costs and commission, with a possible five year extension if both parties agree. By way
of background, RTD’s naming rights consultant WME/IMG presented to the Board in 2013 an inventory
and financial analysis of RTD facilities, services, and assets that could lend themselves to
naming/sponsorship value-added contracts. WME/IMG completed the valuation of RTD assets and was
given the green light to begin pursuing potential clients, resulting in the public launch of the program in
the third quarter of 2014. Any additional proposed naming rights/corporate sponsorship contracts will
continue to be brought to the RTD Board for approval.
Partnerships and Privatization
The Task Force described this recommendation as a broad area that could include items such as
privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce expenses. RTD has undertaken
some actions under this recommendation such as the lease of the DUS historic building, IGAs for
improvements to US36 and the East Line, as well as TOD activities. RTD continues to look for
partnership and privatization opportunities on an ongoing basis. RTD has received an unsolicited
proposal regarding its parking facilities that may present further opportunities for working with the
private sector.
Recommendations – Low Priority
Recommendations made by the Task Force and categorized at the 2012 Board Retreat as having lower
priority and their status follows:
Charge for Parking
RTD currently charges out-of-District patrons parking fees to use parking facilities as well as fees
charged to in-District patrons parking for longer than 24 hours. The Task Force identified charging
parking fees to all patrons as a possible revenue enhancement source. This recommendation could be
perceived as a fare increase. In 2013, the state legislation regarding RTD charging for parking was
amended to allow a third party to charge in-District patrons as long as RTD receives no revenue.
Tolling and Managed Lanes
The Task Force recommended investigating the possibility of RTD generating additional revenues
through charges for tolling and managed lanes.
Enacting this recommendation would require
coordination with CDOT and other agencies. The US36 BRT project is an example of how tolling and
managed lanes can enhance RTD operations and save costs. The agreement guarantees running times,
allows for bus on shoulder operations to facilitate schedule adherence on local service, and provides for

Packet Pg. 63

1.C.3

maintenance of managed lanes with no contribution from RTD. Prior to entering into agreements with
CDOT for managed lanes, RTD contributed to maintenance and snow removal on the I-25 HOV lanes.
Home Rule Initiative
The Task Force recommended that RTD consider becoming a “Home Rule” entity which would allow
RTD to collect and audit its sales and use taxes instead of the DOR. This initiative would require
legislation. RTD met several times with the DOR to discuss this initiative as well as sales and use tax
compliance reviews. Although the DOR did not object to RTD performing these services itself, the
Colorado Municipal League and other entities recommended against it. “Home Rule” is a state
constitutional authorization for creating municipalities. It could only be secured for RTD by statewide
constitutional amendment. As discussed earlier in this report, RTD has entered into an agreement with
DOR to facilitate better tax compliance and monitoring, which has been coupled with simplification of
state and RTD taxation through legislation that provides for uniformity on items taxed.

FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA)
Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: October 20, 2015

BACKGROUND:
In 2012, staff presented an initiative to the Board of Directors to identify opportunities to provide
additional funding for FasTracks projects with a goal of $300 million by 2017. The highest value
opportunities were recommended and summarized in a Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). As those
opportunities were realized, they would be accounted for and tracked through a FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA). The status of those opportunities is discussed below and shown on the
attached chart.
The goals for the use of the FISA funds were:
-

Completion of the US36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project
Construction of North Metro to at least 72nd Avenue
Any remaining funds above the $300 million goal could leverage potential grants or private
sector contributions for FasTracks partially-funded projects (at the RTD Board’s discretion)

DISCUSSION:
The following discusses each component of the RAM opportunities and their funding status in the FISA:
Evaluate FasTracks Funding for Base System Operations: 2017 Goal of $24 million
In the voter-authorized FasTracks Plan, a provision was made whereby FasTracks would provide funding
each year to the Base System for additional bus service that would be necessary as feeder service to
new rail corridors and also to meet ADA requirements to provide paratransit services in proximity to the
new fixed routes. The FasTracks Plan assumed that bus service levels would increase 1% per year
between 2006 and 2020 and 1.5% between 2021 and 2025. Staff recommended that the growth in
this funding to the Base System be limited to the growth in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) with the
projected savings of $24 million through 2017 put into the FISA.
FISA Status: $7.8 million with the remainder to be realized through 2017

Reduce FasTracks Minimum Unrestricted Fund Balance: 2017 Goal of $72 million
The RAM assumed that as FasTracks corridors were completed, the need to maintain $150 million of
unrestricted fund balances to address unforeseen construction expenditures would diminish. By 2017, it

Packet Pg. 65

1.C.4

was assumed that $72 million of this fund balance could be available for the FISA. Since the time of the
original assumption, additional FasTracks project elements have been approved for US36 BRT and the
North Metro Line through 124th Avenue which has committed those funds.
FISA Status: Funds will not be available

Reduce FasTracks O&M Fund Balance from 3 to 2 Months: 2017 Goal of $10 million
The RTD Fiscal Policy sets a target for the Base System unrestricted reserves of 3 months of operating
expenses (excluding depreciation) to be available to mitigate service disruptions in the event of an
economic downturn. The Fiscal Policy was modified for FasTracks operations to set a goal of 2 months
of operating expenses (excluding depreciation) with the 3rd month, estimated at $10 million by 2017,
being set aside in the FISA. It is currently assumed that this 3rd month of FasTracks reserves will be
replenished in 2030 when many FasTracks assets will reach a 20-30 year lifespan and operating
expenses will increase as a result.
FISA Status: $4.5 million – 2017 estimate is $11.5 million

Defer Southwest Corridor Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) Relocation: 2017 Goal of $9 million
The FasTracks Financial Plan included a 2014 expenditure of $9 million to relocate a portion of the
Union Pacific Railroad to accommodate the construction of the Southwest Corridor extension.
Because funding to complete the entire extension has not been identified, the relocation expenditure
was deferred to later years with the 2014 funding redirected to the FISA.
FISA Status: $9 million - completed

Achieve Cost Underruns on FasTracks Projects: 2017 Goal of $15 million
The RAM assumed that as FasTracks corridors were completed, up to $15 million could be saved
through cost savings by spending less than the amounts budgeted for projects. Since the time of the
original assumption, additional FasTracks project elements have been approved for the North Metro Line
through 124th Avenue which has committed those funds.
FISA Status: Funds will not be available
Sales/Lease Opportunities for all RTD Properties: 2017 Goal of $20 million
In 2012, a goal was set to identify properties to sell or lease that could generate $20 million by 2017.
While staff continues to market excess properties and pursue leasing opportunities, to date funds
identified for the FISA resulted from an $8.1 million sale of the Base System Civic Center air rights of
which $2.5 million was used for the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) leaving $5.6 million in the
FISA.
FISA Status: $5.6 million with remainder to be determined (TBD)

1.C.4

Request Increase in Local Participation Above Current 2.5%: 2017 Goal TBD
The RAM identified an opportunity to generate additional funds from local entities through their financial
participation at a level greater than the current 2.5% of cost. In 2012, the goal amount had not been
established and was to be determined at a later time. RTD has been successful in generating financial
participation above the 2.5% level for the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) and it is designated in the
FISA specifically for that purpose.
FISA Status: TBD

Sales Tax Audit/Parity: 2017 Goal of $127 million
As a result of the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force recommendations in 2011, it was assumed that RTD
could enhance sales and use tax revenues through a combination of self-collection and establishing
exemption simplification through parity with the state. Subsequently, it was determined that selfcollection was not a viable alternative and the recommendation was modified to coordinate with the
Department of Revenue to contract for supplemental tax auditing services. Legislation was also enacted
to establish exemption parity with the state. The supplemental auditing services which began in March
2014 have resulted in assessments of approximately $650,000 and costs of $500,000.
FISA Status: Funds will not be available

SUMMARY
The RAM that was presented to the Board of Directors in 2012 identified funding opportunities totaling
$277 million by 2017. It is now estimated that by 2017, those opportunities will result in funds of
$86.7 million. Of this amount, in May 2014 the Board approved the use of $16.2 million combined with
a FASTER grant to complete additional US36 BRT project elements. These additional BRT items resulted
from stakeholder discussions following the NAMS process.
The remaining estimated $34.3 million 2017 FISA balance is programmed in the FasTracks financial plan
for debt service and operations and will not be available for other projects.

(3) December 2014 was high due to the year-end accrual of expenses which were paid in 2015
(4) Increase due to drawing funds from the TIFIA loan (TIFIA loan of $280m has been fully drawn) and issuance of 2015 COPs.
(5) Increase is due to funds being set aside for semi-annual debt service payments
(6) Variance is due to a timing difference between construction expenditures and bond and COP draws. Bond and COP draws will replenish this by year-end.
(7) Increase is due to the increase to fund balances per the 2015 amended budget
(8) Decrease will be replenished with draws on Bond and COP project funds at year-end

DISCUSSION
Stored Value is a product that can be purchased by the general public to pay for transit fares on fixed
route buses and rail platforms. Stored Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards encoded with chips.
These cards can be loaded with certain dollar amounts and used much like a debit card. Once the card is
loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar amount on the card is less than the fare
needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card.
We are targeting January 1, 2016 for the Stored Value public pilot go-live which will include:
 5000 customers will be selected to participate
 Stored Value available for purchase at RTD sales outlets
 Changes to the web portal that focus on Customer Care functionality
 Changes to the SMT System to accommodate the new fare structure
 Day Pass Printers installed and functioning on RTD fixed route buses
There are a considerable number of related efforts underway for the January 1 public pilot launch of
Stored Value. The accomplishments since last reporting period include:


Day Pass Printers
o Pre-installation of wiring is underway, expectations are that over 100 buses a week will be
pre-wired.
o A set of 91 printers have been received remainder will arrive in November and December
 Smart Card Hosting
o Agreement executed
o Migration Kick-off Meeting held October 9th
 Second Staff Pilot with RTD employees will start mid-October
o Over 160 RTD employees and Board Members have volunteered
 Independent readiness assessment
o Scheduled as a monthly activity
 Developing an early signup campaign / program to start in December.
 Approval from King Soopers to begin Site Assessments for Retail Sales installations prior to
contract signature.
Until such time we have a sufficiently robust smart card distribution network in place, we will continue
selling ten ride ticket books, accepting one ride tickets, and continue issuing and accepting paper
transfers. Paper transfers will be printed on the Day Pass Printer to improve readability and compliance.
Additional phases of the SMT project will go live in 2016 including:
