### B. Recommended Actions

There were no recommended actions.

#### 1. Denver Union Station Update

Bill Mosher with the Denver Union Station Project Authority addressed the questions that had been presented by different Directors at the prior meeting.  The pedestrian bridge is 260 ft long from 18th Street to Wewatta.  The cost of the bridge is $5.2 million including the elevators; the elevator itself is worth $1.2 million.

Director Bagley had requested a tour and Bill stated he would work with the Board Office to coordinate.  Director Deadwyler had asked about affordable housing and he is still waiting for an answer as the staff person that had the information is out of town.

He stated that as of February 28, they have spent $387 million and are 81% completed.  On the light rail the final acceptance was obtained on December 22, 2011 and the LRT Plaza opened on May 18, 2012.   On the regional Bus facilities, the critical path for the entire project goes through the bus box structure.  On Phases I & II West of Wewatta, they have completed the Chestnut Pavilion elevator and escalator installation as well as the fire damper installation in Plenum.  The Chestnut pavilion exterior is nearing completion.  The storefront framing and glazing; the concourse metal panel columns wraps; lighting fixtures installation as well as the smoke/exhaust evacuation fan installation are all underway.   In Phase III East of Wewatta (behind DUS), they have completed several components including the train bridge caissons and caps; the precast beams and planks installation; backfilling the bus box wall and waterproofing among others.  The Wewatta and DUS pavilions elevator and escalator installations are underway.  Finish work continues within the public restrooms as well as the sawtooth concrete Apron bus slips.

On the commuter rail, they have completed the steel fabrication for the CRT canopy and the CRT systems duct bank in the throat.  They are nearing completion for the OCS foundation pier drilling and the CRT train hall canopy structural steel erection among other aspects.  Platform No. 2 construction continues.  The EVA lane structure and the chiller enclosure near platform 5 are underway.

Streets and Plazas completed include the LRT Plaza, 17th Street Gardens Plaza and 16th Street (Chestnut to Wewatta).  16th Street (Wewatta to Wynkoop) is expected to be completed in April.  Wewatta Street is expected to be completed during the summer and the Wynkoop Plaza by November.  The two way Mall Shuttle traffic is open on 16th Street with a minor detour.

Bill Mosher also provided an update on the DUS renovation project.  He will work with team USA to get some pictures as they will be taking a tour in the next couple of days.  Public involvement is still being solicited.  They are coordinating all the private projects and the interpretive display is underway.

Director Daly asked if chiller is what they call the air conditioner.  Bill stated that it is and it is only for cold air.

Director Folska asked if he is aware of any condominiums in the DUS area.  Bill stated that due to the FHA increasing the requirements, it is hard to get financing for condominiums.  Also, the construction defect laws in Colorado are too onerous and expensive.  Insurance companies do not want to cover that.  It is hard to get insurance and financing and is a big liability for a long period of time; all of this might prevent construction of condominiums for a while.

Director Bagley asked if they could do the tour on a Tuesday before the committee meetings or Board meeting.  He also asked if the tour could hopefully be done before the 18th of April.  Bill stated that he will coordinate with Paula and the Staff.

Director Solano asked what would happen to the tracks over the bus box in a storm situation.  Bill Mosher clarified that below grade does not mean below ground.  The tracks are on a channel over the top of the bus box; there are water proofing and drainage provisions for the tracks.  Rick Clarke also stated that the trains will clear the snow as long as they are run frequently.  General Manager (GM) Phil Washington stated that the light rail has never stopped.  Bill Mosher stated that they are not concerned about water sitting in the tracks as they have planned for it.

Director James asked if they are still under budget.  Bill stated that they are spending the money allocated and are trying to keep costs down.  They are trying to use funds efficiently as they are on a fixed dollar amount.  He stated they are also on schedule.  They are focusing on getting the office space for Amtrak done to be able to move them back.  The contractors have done remarkably well in the area of safety with close to 600 days without incidents.  Contractually they are scheduled to finish by 2014 and they expect to have it done on time.

Director James thanked him for all they have done.  Bill thanked the Board for the opportunity to present and their support.
