#### 1. Proposed Winter 2016/2017 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the Winter 2016/2017 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost savings of approximately $1,337,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

DISCUSSION

To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance, sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different classes of service have different expectations of performance.  We will continue adjusting services in response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service adjustments and reductions. Based upon current and past ridership performance Route 116 Limited is proposed to be discontinued. Also related to its ridership performance, the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride is proposed to be continued contingent upon discovery of alternative funding from sources outside RTD. Additionally, service reductions on the W Line (light rail) are proposed in an effort to match the level of service and expense to current ridership demands. We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.

The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:

- Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;

- The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;

- The availability of alternative services to affected riders;

- Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to enhance service when possible;

- Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and

- Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS

Eight public hearings were held in Aurora, Brighton, Denver, Highlands Ranch, Ken Caryl, Lakewood, and Stapleton Denver at the Blake Administration building. Comments and further details from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment B of this report.

CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS

Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose modifications to these initial recommendations. The following proposals have been significantly modified:

Route 89 – Stapleton/Anschutz Campus: the proposal to discontinue this route has been rescinded.

Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride: the proposal to discontinue the Call-n-Ride, has been modified and is contingent upon funding alternatives.

SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service reductions:

Route 40 – Colorado Boulevard: discontinue the 6:32pm northbound trip from Colorado Center

Route 89 – Stapleton/Anschutz Campus:  proposal to discontinue service rescinded

Route 116L – Ken Caryl Limited:  discontinues service on the Route 116L, due to very low ridership.

Route 169L – Buckley Road/Denver Airport: discontinue 7:10pm southbound trip daily and 5:10pm southbound trip on Saturday and Sunday only.

Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride: continue the Call-n-Ride, contingent upon alternative funding

RockiesRide: discontinue all but two RockiesRide bus services

W Line (FasTracks): discontinue 16 Monday-Friday trips in the AM and PM peak periods

Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/service reductions:

Route 324 – Main Street Crosstown:  reroute of service currently on St. Vrain School District property

Route R/RC/RX – Brighton/ Denver; Brighton/Denver Express: renaming of route

Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments

Route 15 – East Colfax: running time analysis

Rail Lines proposed for routine schedule adjustments:

Minor running time adjustments are proposed for all light rail lines: C, D, E, F, H, and W Lines, on all service days.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a cost reduction of $962,000 from FasTracks and $375,000 cost saving from the base system, for a total savings of approximately $1,337,000 annualized.

EQUITY ANALYSIS

The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed Winter 2016/2017 service changes does not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.

A Look Ahead – May 2017

L – Line

A proposed solution to D Line on-time performance issues and consequentially, overall light rail system performance, this proposal introduces a modification to current D Line operations. The L  Line adds a new 30th& Downing to 14th Street Loop (Downtown) movement, replacing the D Line service between 30th & Downing Station and 19th Street. More extensive information regarding this proposal will be made available in a future update to the Board of Directors.
