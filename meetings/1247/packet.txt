Board Meeting Date: December 10, 2013

Subject:

Architectural / Engineering Contract with Short
Elliot Hendrickson (SEH), Contract 11 DO-025 Contract Amendment.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to amend contract 11 DO-025 with SEH to allow for additional
architectural / engineering design services in the amount of $1,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed
contract amount of $3,000,000. Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. The amended
amount is to be funded by various Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) approved future projects and existing
projects under contract.
BACKGROUND
Services rendered under this contract provide mechanical, civil, architectural, electrical, structural, and
landscaping, design and engineering services for the development of selected projects included in RTD's
SBP program and grant funded projects. The contract duration was specified for a three year term from
October 13, 2011 to October 13, 2014 with award being in the amount of $500,000. Allowable, are
two, one-year extensions to the contract. This board action is to increase the existing not-to-exceed limit
in the contract. All other terms and conditions of the contract remain unchanged. Consultant
responsibilities include preparation of drawings and specifications for construction in addition to
estimating and other construction related services such as change order documentation, preparation of
as-built drawings, and site inspections. The purpose of this contract is to assist the Facilities Engineering
Division with design services that cannot be completed with in-house staff.
DISCUSSION
The initial contract amount was $500,000. In May of 2012 the Board approved an additional
$1,500,000 that was based primarily on the Civic Center rehabilitation project. To date, including the
Civic Center project the contract has obligated $1,931,381 for nine projects leaving a contractual
balance of $68,619. Additional funding to the contract is required to accommodate approved 2014
through 2015 SBP projects.
SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT
This contract does not have a SBE/DBE goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This contract utilizes grant and local funds. The types of funds are dependent upon the funding source
of each individual project. Individual work orders will be funded as the project requirement is processed.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to amend contract 11 DO025 with SEH to allow for additional architectural / engineering design services in the amount of
$1,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed contract amount of $3,000,000. Work is administered on

1.B.1

an as-needed, work order basis. The amended amount is to be funded by various Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) approved future projects and existing projects under contract.
2. Do not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to amend
contract 11 DO-025 with SEH to allow for additional architectural / engineering design services in
the amount of $1,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed contract amount of $3,000,000. Work is
administered on an as-needed, work order basis. The amended amount is to be funded by various
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) approved future projects and existing projects under contract. Not
accepting the recommended action is not recommended because it would delay the schedule of
the approved 2014 SBP projects.
3. Do not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to amend
contract 11 DO-025 with SEH to allow for additional architectural / engineering design services in
the amount of $1,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed contract amount of $3,000,000. Work is
administered on an as-needed, work order basis. The amended amount is to be funded by various
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) approved future projects and existing projects under contract.
Instead, proceed with the implementation of a new Architectural / Engineering RFP for a contract
with a new consultant team. This is not recommended because of the delay it will cause on the
approved 2014 SBP projects.

Contract Award for the District Shops HRU
Project.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible
bidder, JCOR, in the not-to-exceed amount of $2,669,400 for the District Shops Heat Recovery Unit
(HRU) project. In addition, a transfer shall be made from the State of Good Repair federal grant to the
project budget in the amount of $322,103.
BACKGROUND
The scope of the District Shops HRU project is to replace 16 HRU’s that are beyond their useful life with
new units. The existing units were installed when the building was constructed in 1989. The 100%
outside air HRU’s provide gas heating, evaporative cooling, and energy recovery. The units exhaust
100% of the air supplied. The energy recovery section tempers incoming air to cool it in the summer and
warms it in the winter using energy absorbed from the exhaust air process.
DISCUSSION
The project was advertised on September 30, 2013. The pre-bid conference was held on October 15,
2013 and the bids were received on October 29, 2013 as follows:
1. JCOR - $2,669,400
2. Legacy - $2,733,500
DBE INVOLVEMENT
The DBE goal was advertised at 7% with JCOR meeting the goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the project is included in the 2013 approved budget. With the transfer the construction
budget will be $2,669,400: $1,877,837.20 from federal grant CO-04-0043 with $469,459.80 of local
match and $257,682.40 from the State of Good Repair (SOGR) grant with $64,420.60 of local match.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager,or his designee, to award a
contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder, JCOR, in the not-to-exceed amount of
$2,669,400 for the District Shops Heat Recovery Unit (HRU) project. In addition, a transfer shall be
made from the State of Good Repair federal grant to the project budget in the amount of $322,103.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder, JCOR, in the not-to-exceed amount of
$2,669,400 for the District Shops Heat Recovery Unit (HRU) project. Also, do not authorize a

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.2

transfer from the State of Good Repair federal grant to the project budget in the amount of
$322,103. Project shall be rebid. This is not recommended as the bids are considered competitive.
3. Do nothing. Cancel project and redirect funds. This is not recommended as the project has been fully
designed and the existing units are beyond their useful life and need replacement.

Board Meeting Date: December 10, 2013

Subject:

Increase the General Manager’s Signature
Authority for the Rio Court Maintenance-ofWay Renovation/Tenant Finish Project.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager’s contract amendment signature authority for the Rio Court Maintenanceof-Way Renovation/Tenant Finish Project be increased from $500,000 to $700,000.
BACKGROUND
The site/facility was acquired to accommodate the relocation of the Burnham Yard lead track due to
construction of the West Line project. The lead track that was relocated was aligned through the south
end of the property. The original plan was to raze the entire building that resided on the site. After
consideration, it was determined to remove only a portion of the building and utilize the rest for a new
light rail maintenance-of-way (MOW) facility needed to accommodate growth of the light rail system.
The renovated facility will house all light rail MOW requirements to maintain all track work, signal,
communication and power systems for all RTD light rail corridors including the West Line and I-225. All
functions will be relocated from the existing Mariposa MOW facility that no longer accommodates light
rail’s expanded needs.
DISCUSSION
The Board authorized award to Calahan Construction in March of 2013 in the amount of $3,472,630.
To date, two amendments have been processed for a total of $123,511. Some of these unforeseen
conditions were; a new fire hydrant, waste water utility upgrades for code compliance, communication
feed by Century Link, and fire sprinkler revisions to comply with Denver Fire Department codes. Pending
changes include; a second fire hydrant which includes a fire loop, RTD security equipment, suitable
backfill dirt for utility trenches, and the utility connection from the facility to the new fueling station.
SBE INVOLVEMENT
The SBE goal was advertised at 25%. Currently, Calahan Construction is performing at 47%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the project is included in the 2013 approved budget. The construction budget is
$4,905,403 with $495,452 being CDOT FASTER grant funding and $4,409,951 of local funding.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager’s contract amendment
signature authority for the Rio Court Maintenance-of-Way Renovation/Tenant Finish Project be
increased from $500,000 to $700,000.

Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager’s contract
amendment signature authority for the Rio Court Maintenance-of-Way Renovation/Tenant Finish
Project be increased from $500,000 to $700,000. This action would prevent the timely completion
of the project.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. It is not recommended by the Operations and Customer
Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager’s contract
amendment signature authority for the Rio Court Maintenance-of-Way Renovation/Tenant Finish
Project be increased from $500,000 to $700,000. Alternatively, complete the project as is and rebid
all remaining pending work. This alternative would delay the project and present several challenges in
regards to warranties, construction permits, and the certificate-of-occupancy.

Subject:

Approval of the Purchase of Four Electric
Multiple Units (EMU) Cars for the Eagle Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the purchase of four Electric Multiple Units
(EMU) cars for the Eagle Project through the Denver Transit Partners (DTP), for an amount not to
exceed $18 million.
It is further recommended by the Operations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to transfer $7.5 million from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve to the Eagle
Project budget to fund the purchase of the additional four EMU cars.
BACKGROUND
As part of the Eagle Project, RTD defined the minimum service requirements through year 2044 for
which DTP are responsible and DTP has demonstrated that the 50 EMU cars included in the
Concession are adequate to achieve those goals.
Subsequent analysis by staff has shown that some additional special event service to serve large
events in the region, as well as heavy travel days such as around Thanksgiving and others, would be
beneficial. In addition, while staff has conducted numerous and extensive planning analyses to
determine the anticipated operational requirements for the Eagle Project, these studies are not an
exact science and it is likely that operational needs over the years of operations will be somewhat
different from that anticipated. Having some additional EMU cars will provide the flexibility to allow
these revised needs to be met.
In order to achieve these goals for our customers, staff has determined that an additional four EMU
cars would be adequate to provide this additional capability, greatly enhancing the service RTD can
provide over the life of the EMU fleet.
DISCUSSION
As part of the North Metro project RTD is planning to purchase six additiona l EMU cars to facilitate
operation on the segment from DUS to 124 th Avenue as approved by the Board on November 26,
2013. During discussions with DTP, in order to purchase these EMU cars for the North Metro
project it has been established that the window of opportunity in the manufacturing process to
purchase any additional EMU cars technically consistent with the current fleet and at an acceptable
cost is rapidly closing. It has also become apparent during these discussions that increasing the
number of EMU cars that RTD purchases now will have a significant effect on the unit cost of each
of the EMU cars, resulting in a cost savings for the North Metro project.
We recommend purchasing four EMU cars through the Eagle Concession Agreement (CA) because
the price is reasonable, allows for interchangeable parts with the Eagle EMU fleet, and facilitates

Packet Pg. 11

1.B.4

improved special events service on the East Rail Line, the Gold Line, the Northwest Rail Line and the
North Metro Line.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the purchase of the four EMU cars would be provided through use of CMAQ monies
available to the Eagle Project and through the recommended transfer of $7.5 million from the
FasTracks Contingency Reserve. Staff will investigate additional funding sources to replenis h the
FasTracks Contingency Reserve at a future date.
Payment for each EMU car shall be made by RTD to the Concessionaire consistent with the payment
schedule provided in CA Section 31.1(i).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the
purchase of four Electric Multiple Units (EMU) cars for the Eagle Project through the Denver
Transit Partners (DTP), for an amount not to exceed $18 million.
It is further recommended by the Operations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to transfer $7.5 million from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve
to the Eagle Project budget to fund the purchase of the additional four EMU cars.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Remain with the current fleet and accept reduced
capacity to serve special events, reduced flexibility to meet needs that may develop in the future
and pay a premium for any future small order size for North Metro project.

DRCOG Vanpool Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support and
expansion of the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This agreement
is for calendar year 2014 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $700,000.00.
BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, ongoing service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs
associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.

DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had
previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the DRCOG entered into a partnership in
April of 2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG
believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering
desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver
metropolitan area. Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement
on marginal bus routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary
marketing programs and increased commuter transportation alternatives.

Packet Pg. 13

1.B.5

RTD financial support is used to help to underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers
and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the
advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans in service grew from 11
to 107 vans.
In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies currently operating vanpool services in other
metropolitan areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool
program. VPSI took over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Currently the vanpools carry an
average of 5.8 riders per van and the fleet is at 80% capacity.
DRCOG vanpool performance through the 3rd Quarter in 2013 resulted in an RTD subsidy per passenger
trip of approximately $2.21. For comparison, the subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route service in
2012 ranged from an average of $2.85 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an average of
$6.66 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service and an average of $5.23 subsidy per passenger
for regional service.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the DRCOG Van pool program are budgeted in the approved 2014 budget.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the financial support of the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool service in order to continue
to provide and expand this transportation option for residents of the Denver metropolitan area
who work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool program which would
result in an increase in single occupant commuting.

North Front Range Vanpool Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the North Front Range Metropolitan Planning Organization (NFRMPO) to provide RTD
support and continued expansion of the NFR VANGO vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area.
This agreement is for calendar year 2014 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $450,000.00.
BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, ongoing service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs
associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.

DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the NFRMPO VANGO vanpool program since 2003. The program targets long
distance commuters who live in Northern Colorado and who travel to the Denver metropolitan area. Of
the vans in operation, 75% provide service in the RTD district. The RTD subsidy is based on vanpool
travel within the RTD district. The vanpool program had been limited by perceived high fares, insufficient
funding for van acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary
marketing activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the NFRMPO entered into a
partnership in 2003 to expand vanpool service coming into the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so,
RTD and NFRMPO believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting
shared goals of offering desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality
in the Denver metropolitan area. RTD financial support is used to help to underwrite the vanpool pricing
structure in order to make vanpool fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By
subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived
as a more attractive alternative for area commuters. In addition, RTD’s support is used to provide
incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling
stock to provide vanpool services. In return for this funding NFRMPO provides RTD with National
Transportation Data. This data is included in the NTD numbers reported by RTD and used by the Federal
Government to determine the amount of federal funding allocated to RTD. Since the advent of RTD
support for the vanpool program in late 2003, the number of vans serving the Denver metropolitan area
has grown from 28 to 54 vans.

Packet Pg. 15

1.B.6

RTD shall contribute funding to NFRMPO to support the provision of the VANGO vanpool service in an
amount not to exceed $450,000.00 in 2013. NFRMPO vanpool performance through the 3 rd Quarter in
2013 resulted in an RTD subsidy of approximately $4.24 per passenger trip. For comparison, the subsidy
per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2012 ranged from an average of $2.85 subsidy per
passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $6.66 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service
and an average of $5.23 subsidy per passenger for regional service.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the NFRMPO VANGO vanpool program are included in the approved 2014 RTD
budget. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the financial support of the NFRMPO VANGO vanpool service in order to continue to
provide and expand this transportation option for residents of Northern Colorado who commute to
and work in the Denver metropolitan area.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the VANGO vanpool program which would result in an

Englewood Art Shuttle Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year 2014 and is for
an amount not to exceed $282,000.00.
BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circulator bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The art shuttle was a free service. In September 2007, with the
expiration of the CMAQ grant, the RTD took over funding of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood
continues the management and marketing of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood covers all marketing
and related expenses. The art shuttle continues to be a free service that is sponsored by the City of
Englewood. The City of Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would have been paid if the art
shuttle charged a RTD fare.
The art shuttle currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service on
Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. The shuttle operates between the Englewood light rail station and
Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The art shuttle operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15)
minute frequency. Ridership has averaged 828.3 boardings per day or 30.9 passengers per hour.

DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the art shuttle in an
amount not to exceed $282,000 in 2014.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the art shuttle will be assessed at
the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if
continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of
RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and
the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance.
The provision of art shuttle service through 3rd Quarter in 2013 resulted in 30.9 passengers per hour and
an RTD subsidy per art shuttle passenger trip of $1.30. For comparison, the subsidy per passenger for
RTD fixed route service in 2012 ranged from an average of $2.85 subsidy per passenger for CBD local
routes to an average of $6.66 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service and an average of $5.23
subsidy per passenger for regional service. The City of Englewood will continue to pay for all fares for the
art shuttle.

Packet Pg. 17

1.B.7

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the art shuttle were included in the approved 2014 RTD budget. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.

City of Boulder Hop Cost Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a
Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the operation of
the HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of
Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year
2014 and is for an amount not to exceed $1,484,378.00.
BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City
of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of
the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to
provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.
The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM on
Saturdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. In addition, Night HOP service is
provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately
2,800 passenger trips per weekday.

DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount
not to exceed $1,484,378.00 in 2014.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. HOP performance will be assessed at the end of the
year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the
cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service
standards. If it appears that service performance does not warrant continuation, RTD and the City of
Boulder will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance. The provision
of HOP service through 3rd Quarter in 2013 resulted in 27.5 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy
per HOP passenger trip of $1.61. For comparison, the subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route
service in 2012 ranged from an average of $2.85 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an
average of $6.66 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service and an average of $5.23 subsidy
per passenger for regional service.

1.B.8

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the HOP service were included in the approved 2014 RTD budget. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the cost sharing agreement with the City of Boulder for the HOP circulator bus service
so that the City of Boulder can continue to provide this service to the residents, students and
businesses in the City of Boulder.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the heavily-used HOP circulator service.

5311 Cost Share Agreements

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD
financial support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County,
Adams County and Jefferson County. These Agreements are for calendar year 2014 and for amounts
not to exceed $343,680.00 for Boulder County, $338,250.00 for Adams County and $104,804.00 for
Jefferson County.
BACKGROUND
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEALU), along with previous transit legislation, provided for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized,
or rural, areas. The section of the Act that addressed the provision of services in non-urbanized areas
was Section 5311 and thus these services were often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013,
SAFETEA-LU was replaced by new transportation authorizing legislation known as Moving Ahead for
Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). Since 1991, RTD has provided funding to various private,
non-profit agencies to assist with the provision of transit services in non-urbanized areas of the District
and to provide local match money for federal grant funds to support the provision of 5311 services in
the District. RTD has provided financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in
Jefferson County since 1991 and has provided financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized
service in Adams and Boulder Counties since 1993.

DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Boulder County in an amount not to exceed $343,680.00 in 2014. RTD shall also
contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams
County in amount not to exceed $338,250.00 in 2014.
RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $104,804.00 in 2014.
These Agreements will be for a period of one year. 5311 performance will be assessed at the end of
the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of
the funding agreements is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service
standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and the affected
party(s) will confer on modifications needed to bring it into conformance. The provision of 5311
service thus far in 2013 (current numbers available) has resulted in monthly performance that has
ranged from 1.8 to 2.2 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per passenger boarding ranging from
approximately $2.15 to approximately $4.66 (subsidy reflects only the RTD contribution). As a
comparison, RTD Call-n-Ride monthly performance averaged 4.4 passengers per hour in 2012 while

Packet Pg. 21

1.B.9

RTD Access-a-Ride service performs at approximately 1.2 passengers per hour.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the 5311 services were included in the approved 2014 RTD budget. This
Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the 5311 cost sharing agreements with Via Mobility Services and Seniors’ Resource
Center so that these organizations can continue to provide transit services to individuals in the
non-urbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of
Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 3rd
Quarter 2013

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the third quarter of 2013 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors individually and as a group met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 3rd quarter. First Transit and Veolia Transportation continue
to utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of
operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety
meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors individually and as a group met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per
100,000 miles in the 3rd quarter. All of the three passenger accidents during the 3rd quarter
were classified as non-preventable. First Transit and Veolia Transportation continue to conduct
proactive retraining to increase operator awareness of passenger mobility issues to reduce the
number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles. Increased passenger awareness training
continues to be a primary focus for all contractors in this area.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 3rd quarter. The contractor organizations place a high
emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local
operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 26,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 3rd quarter. The contractors continue to improve in this
area by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely
manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
The contractors, individually and as a group, did not meet the target of .0003 Complaints per
Boarding in the 3rd quarter. First Transit Commerce City, First Transit Denver, and Veolia
Transportation continue to investigate and address customer complaints with operators. The
contractors utilize onboard video surveillance and automatic vehicle location software to retrain
operators on the importance of good customer service and continue to address complaint trends
with all operators at monthly safety meetings.

Smart Card Project Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
Work to complete the new and improved network connectivity has begun at Sports Authority Field, and
additional validators are being installed at 30th and Downing. In 2014 platform validators will be installed
at Southmoor, 16th and Stout, Orchard and 27th and Welton.
The SMT Program Team continues to monitor Fare Inspection metrics based on card scans completed by
the Fare Inspectors using the Handheld Smart Media Reader (HSMR). We’ve seen a steady decrease in
riders failing to tap on platform validators since we began trending in August, 2013. The presence of
Fare Inspectors on trains is a contributing factor.
Xerox will be providing RTD with an estimated level of effort, schedule and cost for the following SMT
Web Portal Improvements:




Ticket Management changes that will help manage requests for assistance with SmartCard.
Increased search capabilities within the web portal
Inventory Management changes that will create a better audit train of SmartCard transfers from
one warehouse to another.

A successful test of the EcoPass 10 Year contract recharge was completed and EcoPass cards are now
receiving their new contracts simply by tapping on a platform validator. As of December 3, 2013
approximately 2500 EcoPass cards have been successfully recharged.

3rd Quarter Customer Complaint Analysis

Information

RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, address and monitor customer complaints on a daily basis.
Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 3rd Quarter of 2013. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2012.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were consistently
meeting the performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In
2009, RTD began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which
advised passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority
seating area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all
buses and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law
for operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding, and the goal for 2013 remains at .0003 complaints per passenger boarding.
For the 3rd quarter of 2013, only RTD met the goal of .0003 complaints per passenger boarding. First
Transit Longmont had .0004 complaints per passenger boarding and First Transit Commerce City, First
Transit Denver, and Veolia all had .0005 complaints per passenger boarding. The combined
performance for all of the private contractors was .0005 complaints per passenger boarding. The
combined performance for RTD and the private contractors was .0004 complaints per passenger
boarding.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL playbacks and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per playback
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to a snow day
There was no video evidence to support the complaint
RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.

Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices.
RTD is conducting refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Market Street Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis,
DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for
disabled passengers.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.

Historically, and in 2013, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – Year-to-date the complaints in this category are showing a 24% increase compared
to the same period in 2012. In many cases, CAD/AVL playbacks confirm that buses are on route, but
running late. However, from the passenger’s perspective, the bus did not show. The YTD average in
this category is 6.9 complaints per day.
Bus Early – Year-to-date complaints in this category are showing a 13.8% increase compared to the
same period in 2012. Playbacks for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The
YTD average in this category is 6.9 complaints per day.

Bus Late – Year-to-date complaints in this category are showing a 13.8% increase compared to the
same period in 2012. Improving on-time performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of
reasons including construction, traffic and heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the
same number of passengers on fewer trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address
running-time issues. The YTD average in this category is 12 complaints per day.

Careless Driving/Operator – Year-to-date complaints in this category are showing a 16.7% increase
compared to the same period in 2012. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed to determine if
operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In addition, all of the private contractors
have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam, Smart Drive) installed on their buses.
These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to be counseled and retrained as
needed to improve driving performance. The YTD average in this category is 4.1 complaints per day.

Discourtesy/Operator – Year-to-date complaints in this category are showing a 39.3% increase
compared to the same period in 2012. In the majority of cases, the investigation into these complaints
proves the operator not at fault. Video evidence usually confirms that the operator followed proper
procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown enforcing or
explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating area,
addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category is 11.1 complaints per day.

Discrimination – This category was created in 2009 to track complaints related to Title VI issues. Yearto-date complaints in this category are showing a 7.8% decrease compared to the same period in 2012.
Investigation into discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at fault. The total
number of discrimination-related complaints remains very small and the YTD average is 0.4 complaints
per day.

Fare Dispute – Year-to-date complaints in this category are showing a 5.5% decrease compared to the
same period in 2012. It appears passengers have come to accept the fact that operators are expecting
fares to be paid upon boarding. Investigation into “fare dispute” complaints often shows passengers
presented an improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare
policies. The total number of complaints remains low and the YTD average is 1.4 complaints per day.

Improper Procedure/Operator – Year-to-date complaints in this category are showing an 8.6% decrease
compared to the same period in 2012. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and accurate information. In
addition, the recently completed ADA refresher training provided information to help operators handle
the issues that arise when operators attempt to make room for disabled passengers and passengers
already occupying the priority seating area refuse to move. In most cases, video evidence shows
operators are following proper procedures. The YTD average in this category is 7.4 complaints per day.

1.C.3

Incorrect Info/Operator –Year-to-date complaints in this category are showing a 22.2% increase
compared to the same period in 2012. However, the total number of complaints in this category
remains small and the YTD average is 0.5 complaints per day.

Passed Up Passenger At Stop – Year-to-date complaints in this category are showing a 7.7% increase
compared to the same period in 2012. In many cases, playbacks for these complaints will confirm
buses are on route and on time. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the stop when the bus
arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop as the bus passed.
Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting directly at the
bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a passenger is passed
up due to the bus being full. Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to the Service
Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources will allow.
The YTD average in this category is 10 complaints per day.

Customer Satisfaction Survey
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops

3rd Quarter 2013 Security Statistics & Fare
Inspection Summary

DISCUSSION:
Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons contacted during the
quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area and conduct an onboard enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables summarize information for the months of July, August, and September. These
tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the estimated fare evasion
rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests made by police officers.
Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion.
This is an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have
the authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This quarter the
bus routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Security Officer Use of Force Incidents
Use of Force is defined as any hands on touching of a suspect by a security officer to detain a suspect
or make a citizen’s arrest. The majority of these issues are minor in nature. No injuries to any suspect
or officer occurred in this reporting quarter. The following table summarizes the use of force incidents
per month.

Subject:

A-Line Cost Agreement

BACKGROUND
In February of 2003, the RTD Board of Directors approved the discontinuation of service on the
skyRide Route AS beyond the Stapleton transfer station due to low ridership at the Olde Town
Arvada and Ward Road park-n-Rides. As a result of this action, interested parties in the City of
Arvada developed a business plan to implement scheduled shuttle van service to be operated
directly between the Olde Town Arvada park-n-ride and Denver International Airport (DIA). The
proposed business plan called for the provision of scheduled shuttle van service, the A-Line, to
be operated between Arvada and DIA. This service was implemented May 11, 2003 to coincide
with the elimination of AS service to Arvada.
DISCUSSION
The A-Line service, operated by Ride Provide, was specifically created to fill the void left by the
Route AS. Ride Provide has proved to be a reliable, consistent and efficient transportation
provider. The A-Line will operate until the Gold Line and East Line are in place and can provide
an airport service to the community.
FY2009 boardings – 35,350; passengers per hour – 3.1; subsidy per passenger - $4.64.
FY2010 boardings – 37,302; passengers per hour – 3.3; subsidy per passenger - $4.54.
FY2011 boardings – 40,028; passengers per hour – 3.5; subsidy per passenger - $4.22.
FY2012 boardings – 42,323; passengers per hour – 3.9; subsidy per passenger - $3.99.
FY2013 boardings – 34,274 (thru 3rd Qtr); passengers per hour – 4.0; subsidy per passenger $3.81.
RTD shall contribute funding to Ride Provide to support the provision of the A-Line service. For
comparison, the subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2012 ranged from an
average of $2.85 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $6.66 subsidy
per passenger for suburban local service and an average of $5.23 subsidy per passenger for
regional service.

Cost Agreements Under $250,000

BACKGROUND
These agreements are currently approved by the General Manager. This report has been generated for
informational purposes only.
DISCUSSION
Littleton Shopping Cart $28,519 for 2014. Since January 1992, the RTD has contributed to support
the Littleton Shopping Cart which was originated to serve portions of certain routes previously served by
RTD. The Shopping Cart is a free service available to the residents of Littleton. FY2013 (thru 3 rd Qtr)
boardings = 7,521; passengers per hour = 6.6; subsidy per passenger = $2.77.
Focus Points Family Resource Center (FPFRC) $49,200 for 2014. In January 2004, the RTD
discontinued the Route 47 and as an alternative the RTD entered into an agreement for a local non-profit
to provide a new community based service. FPFRC has long been an advocate and resource for
communities in Denver. FY2013 boardings (thru 3rd Qtr) = 4054; passengers per hour = 4.2; subsidy
per passenger = $9.46.
Longmont Coordination of Services $10,000 for 2014. In January 2010, Via Mobility, a nonprofit
organization, applied for and received a Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century New Freedom
grant to coordinate transportations services provided by Via Mobility and RTD in the city of Longmont.
Currently Via Mobility and RTD are now coordinating services between all Via and Call-n-Ride trips and
Access-a-Ride trips that can be operated on Via and Call-n-Ride services. Local matches of the grant will
be provided by Via Mobility, the City of Longmont and the RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of these agreements were included in the approved 2014 RTD budget. These
Agreements will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend these
Agreements.
