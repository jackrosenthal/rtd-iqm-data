Subject:

Request for Increase to SmartCard Contract
and Budget Transfer

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to increase the Xerox Transport Solutions contract not-toexceed amount by $1,300,000 to a new contract amount not-to-exceed $21,031,382 and to authorize
a budget transfer of up to $3,800,000 to fund activities under this contract.
DISCUSSION
Staff is seeking Board authorization to increase the Xerox SmartCard contract by $1,300,000 in order to
expand the scope of the contract to include work that was not originally anticipated at that stage of the
project.
Staff is also seeking authorization to provide funding through a budget transfer of up to
$3,800,000 to fund this additional $1,300,000 of work as well for those work items previously
approved by the Board in October 2014.
The following new activities are proposed to be added to the scope of work of the Xerox contract:
Bus validators for Call-n-Ride vehicles- SmartCard validators have been installed and are being used on
fixed route buses. RTD planned to install SmartCard validators on approximately 60 Call-n-Ride vehicles
in the future. With the proposed fare structure recommended for implementation in 2016, it will be
necessary to install SmartCard readers on Call-n-Ride vehicles sooner than initially planned as transfers
will be eliminated and SmartCards and day passes will become the primary sources of payment. Call-nRide vehicles must be equipped with SmartCard validators to accommodate the new fare structure.
Funding of $800,000 under the Xerox contract will be necessary.
SmartCard Hosting - RTD is working with Xerox to provide a hosting solution for its SmartCard
technology. Xerox provides hosting services for other agencies using SmartCard technology and has the
in-house expertise and systems to provide this service to RTD. In order to facilitate the transfer of
hosting RTD’s SmartCard technology, additional scope of work of $500,000 under the Xerox contract
may be necessary.
In addition to these new activities, in October 2014, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the
Xerox contract to include $2,349,912 of new work items. Board authorization is now being requested
to fund those items through a budget transfer as follows:
Additional web portal and process system changes are necessary to complete the SmartCard
functionality needed for the remaining project elements such as stored value, monthly passes and backend coding to accommodate the proposed fare structure. Funding necessary for this functionality is
$1,300,000.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Additional owner’s representative services are necessary to complete the remaining project elements for
the SmartCard project including business process development and additional guidance and oversight for
implementation. Funding necessary for these services is $1,200,000.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated unfunded cost of completing the above items is $3,800,000. Funding is available from
proceeds already received from the issuance of Certificates of Participation (COPs) in which certain of
those proceeds are not currently needed for their original intent such as the purchase of Mall Shuttles.
Therefore, there would be no budgetary impact; rather a transfer of funds would be completed from
other projects to the SmartCard project. This funding will be backfilled through the 2015 amended
budget process.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to increase the Xerox Transport Solutions contract
not-to-exceed amount by $1,300,000 to a new contract amount not to exceed $21,031,382 and
authorize a budget transfer of up to $3,800,000. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to increase the Xerox Transport Solutions
contract not-to-exceed amount by $1,300,000 to a new contract amount not to exceed
$21,031,382 and complete a budget transfer of $3,800,000. This is not the recommended
action because RTD would be unable to complete and implement the SmartCard system or the
new fare structure.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Board Meeting Date: March 24, 2015

Subject:

Authorization to execute a budget transfer to
purchase thermal printers

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer in an amount up to
$1,900,000 from the Mall Shuttle project in order to purchase and install the equipment necessary to
accommodate the sale of fare media under the proposed fare structure.
BACKGROUND
RTD has proposed a modified and simplified fare structure to the Board to be enacted in January 2016.
Under the new fare structure, it is proposed that transfers be eliminated and a day pass be offered to
customers for purchase on board RTD buses. The day pass is proposed to be priced at two times the
single fare and would allow a customer to have unlimited rides during a service day, thereby not
requiring a rider to purchase a fare at each transfer.

DISCUSSION
In order to make the day pass widely available to RTD’s patrons, the ability to purchase day passes is
needed at the location where a patron accesses RTD’s services either on buses or at rail platforms. RTD
currently has the ability to sell day passes at rail platforms through ticket vending machines (TVMs) and
at sales outlets but currently does not have the ability to offer day passes to patrons who purchase their
first fare upon entering a bus. In order to offer a day pass on buses, a thermal printer would be installed
in each bus whereby a customer would pay for the day pass through the farebox and the operator would
produce a day pass from the thermal printer. The day pass will be printed on watermarked paper and
would clearly indicate the service day for which it is valid.
Although the Board has not yet authorized RTD to implement the new fare structure, authority to enter a
contract for the purchase and installation of thermal printers is being sought at this time due to the lead
time necessary to complete this procurement to meet the January 2016 fare structure implementation. If
the final Board action approving changes to RTD’s 2016 fare policy does not include a day pass, thus
negating the need for thermal printers, this funding will not be used.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of installing thermal printers on each of the approximately 1,000 buses in the RTD
fleet is $1,900,000. This cost includes the equipment as well as the connections and installation
necessary to tie the printers into the RTD network.
The funding necessary for this procurement would come from a portion of the Certificate of Participation
(COP) proceeds that were authorized by the Board to be used for the replacement of Mall Shuttles.

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

Therefore, there would be no need to seek additional funding for this procurement and no budgetary
impact other than the transfer of funds from one project to another. These funds will be backfilled
through the 2015 amended budget process.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer in order to
purchase and install the equipment necessary to accommodate the sale of fare media under
the proposed 2016 fare structure. This action grants authority to execute a budget transfer in
an amount not to exceed $1,900,000 from the Mall Shuttle project. This is the recommended
action.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer. This action
would result in RTD’s inability to procure needed day pass fare media equipment in time to
provide the ability for patrons to purchase day passes on buses and avoid multiple fare payments
for transfers. This is not the recommended action.

SmartCard Project Update

Stored Value is a product that can be purchased by the general public to pay for transit fares on fixed
route buses and rail platforms. Stored Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards encoded with chips.
These cards can be loaded with certain dollar amounts and used much like a debit card. Once the card is
loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar amount on the card is less than the fare
needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card. The target date to provide stored value cards for
the current fare structure is November 1, 2015. These cards and services are planned to be available at
RTD and merchant sales locations. Through early 2016, this will be followed by: enabling the public
facing web portal allowing online registration of cards, purchasing and reloading cards; incorporating
new fare structure; and deploying period passes.

Fourth Quarter 2014 Performance Measures

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Fourth Quarter 2014. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and the
citizens of the District. Of the 23 performance measures tracked, RTD met 17 of the goals in their
entirety in the fourth quarter. The following are the exceptions to goals:
Goal 1.4 – Number of Light Rail Accidents
The average number of light rail accidents per month of 7.3 exceeded the goal of ≤ 6.0. An
unusually high number of low-dollar incidents occurred in Q4 which affected the measure for the full
year. In Q4, 21 incidents were reported, but only one was deemed preventable. The remainder
were non-preventable and the fault of others.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District did not meet its goals as a whole for on-time service in Q4 and performance acrossthe-board was generally flat from Q3. However, with the exception of First Transit-Commerce City
in Local Service, full year 2014 results show positive trends over 2013. Staff continues to study
the worst performing routes and identify the resources needed to improve.
Goal 4.2 – Level of Customer Complaints
The average time for final resolution of customer complaints weakened slightly in Q4 and reached
10.68 days for the year, above goal of ≤ 10 days. We found that final resolution time for the
private carriers was higher than for RTD and they made up 1/3 of the total number of contacts filed.
In two of our newly re-bid private contracts, the private carriers are now required to have a
dedicated customer service person to deal with complaint investigation and response. A staffing
increase at RTD recently took effect as well to assist the contracted carriers with their
responsiveness. Customer Care also changed some processes and procedures during February of
2015 and states that contractor response times were cut in half.
We have seen customer complaints increase across the entire system over the past 2-3 years due
to several factors including the fare enforcement campaign, the stroller policy, and heavy/longer
load time, but the level of complaints has been consistent. Staff continues to review CAD/AVL
playbacks to determine the validity of these complaints and to work with operators to address the
valid issues. In Q4, the three carriers RTD, First Transit-Commerce City and First Transit-Longmont
met or exceeded goal. Both Veolia and First Transit-Denver remained static and marginally outside
of goal. Staff provides an analysis of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer Services
report.

Packet Pg. 34

1.C.4

Goal 5.1 – ADA On-Time Performance
In Q4, the measure was weakened slightly and was below goal. The ADA carriers have found it
difficult to hire qualified operators.
Job fairs and advertisement efforts are proceeding.
Noteworthy is that on-time performance data collection is being generated on-line and is more
accurate.
Goal 6.3 – Fare Revenue, EcoPass Revenue, and Total Revenue
The District did not meet its goal for overall increase in operating revenue in 2014, largely due to
fare revenue. While fare revenue is ahead of 2013, fare revenue fell short of the budgeted goal for
2014. The effects of lower ridership than anticipated on the West Line and falling gas prices in Q4
accounted for this divergence from budget. The 2015 budget goal is adjusted downward for these
effects.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
RTD exceeded its vacancies goal in bus mechanics and the Q4 vacancy rate is higher than Q3. We
are experiencing a high level of vacancies in this category and recruitment efforts including job fairs
and college fairs are on-going. Vacancies are due to retirements, system growth, and the strong
local economy.

The goal was increased in 2013 due to the addition of the West Line which will add 30% to the overall system and 25 more
grade-crossings, coupled with no operating history on the new line.

Final resolution time for the private carriers is higher than for RTD and they make up 1/3 of the total number of contacts filed. A
staffing increase (1) at RTD recently took effect to assist the contracted carriers with their responsiveness. In two of our new
contracts, the private carriers are required to have a dedicated customer service person to deal with complaint investigation and
response.
3
Staff continues to review CAD/AVL playbacks to determine the validity of complaints and to work with operations to address
them. Staff provides an analysis of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer Services report. For Q4, carriers RTD, FirstTransit Commerce City and First Transit-Longmont met or exceeded goal. Veolia and First Transit-Denver were slightly outside of
goal.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: March 12, 2015

From:

Doug MacLeod, Controller

GM

Date:

March 12, 2015

Board Meeting Date: March 17, 2015

Subject:

Fiscal
Sustainability
Recommendations Update

Task

Force

BACKGROUND
A Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (Task Force) was formed in November 2010 for the purpose of making
recommendations detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the
Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members
with 12 of those members being external to RTD.
The Task Force presented its written
recommendations to the Board of Directors in June 2011. The Board of Directors subsequently
approved those recommendations and directed Staff to pursue implementation of each recommendation.
The Task Force reconvened for a final meeting in July 2012 to be briefed on the progress of their
recommendations and provide an opportunity for feedback.
DISCUSSION
The Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy recommendations to
the Board of Directors which were approved for further consideration and/or implementation. The status
of those Task Force recommendations is as follows:
Recommendations - Completed
Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
RTD contracted with the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business – Business Research Division
(Leeds) to provide sales and use tax forecasts beginning in March 2011. Each quarter, Leeds provides a
forecast containing short-term (one year by quarter), medium-term (six year SBP period) and long-term
(30 year APE period) sales and use tax projections. This was implemented to provide RTD with expert
economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using sophisticated financial modeling techniques not
available internally. These forecasts are intended to provide a better analysis of RTD’s expected sales
and use tax collections which comprise approximately 2/3 of RTD’s recurring revenues.
Service Optimization
In 2012, RTD implemented modifications and reductions in service representing approximately $10.7
million or an 8% net reduction in service. Service optimization was recommended by the Task Force and
implemented with Board approval in order to match services provided with available funding sources.
Since that time, some service has been gradually restored as needed within budgetary constraints.
Fund Balance Policy
Due to the volatility of RTD’s largest single revenue source, sales and use taxes, the Task Force
recommended implementation of a more robust fiscal policy regarding fund balances. Fund balances
represent financial assets that are available to RTD after allowing for obligations that have been incurred.
Fund balances increase when fund sources exceed fund uses and vice versa. Fund balances, therefore,
exist as a form of savings account to be used for specific purposes when needed and replenished when
economic circumstances allow. In response to this recommendation, RTD implemented a fund balance

Packet Pg. 49

1.C.6

policy with a target level of $90 million for the Base System, which is approximately three months of
operating expenses. This target was established based on levels recommended by the Government
Finance Officers Association (GFOA) best practices. The Fund Balance Policy further categorizes the
available fund balances into the categories of a Board Restricted Fund, a Capital Replacement Fund and
an Unrestricted Fund. At FYE 12/31/14, unaudited combined fund balances (including FasTracks)
totaled $35.8 million. This amount is preliminary for the year and further adjustments will be made.
Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
In Colorado, legislation establishes products and services that are subject to sales and use taxation and
those that are exempt from taxation. The state, cities, municipalities and special districts in Colorado
each have different sales and use tax rates and often have differing items subject to taxation due to
legislation establishing exemptions. Exemption parity was identified by the Task Force as providing a
benefit to RTD during difficult economic conditions when the state implements exemption changes and
vice versa. In addition, exemption parity removes the complexity to vendors of RTD having different
taxable items than the state. RTD introduced legislation that was passed in May 2013 to establish
parity with the state regarding items subject to sales and use taxation. Exemption parity took effect
1/1/14. RTD estimates that parity generated a net increase of $2.7 million in 2014 based on 2012
figures, however, this will be difficult to track due to the way vendors report sales tax components.
Technology and Energy Innovation
RTD conducted a comprehensive energy audit of the oldest and largest operating division (the Platte
facility) to determine the potential scope of savings that may be available through equipment and lighting
upgrades. The audit identified that facility lighting upgrades could result in potentially significant energy
savings. Areas for minor energy savings were identified for other building systems; however, these have
a very significant capital investment and long pay-back periods. RTD budgets for energy upgrades
throughout the District in the Strategic Budget Plan, and we will continue to address energy efficiency in
building systems as on-going projects are completed. RTD received a grant to install solar panels at East
Metro and this project is completed. Facilities Maintenance has also done lighting upgrades replacing
older metal-halide fixtures with energy-efficient fluorescent fixtures at the East Metro, Boulder, and
District Shops operating facilities. We are now able to quantify our savings and are realizing average
savings of approximately $3,000/month at East Metro due to the combination of solar and lighting
upgrades; Boulder is showing approximately $500/month in savings with a lighting upgrade, and to date
District Shops is even.
Recommendations – Ongoing
Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
The Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) collects and audits sales and use taxes for RTD. The Task
Force identified an opportunity for revenue enhancement by performing additional sales and use tax
compliance reviews based on the favorable collection experiences of Colorado cities and municipalities
that implemented these reviews. Compliance reviews consist of RTD providing additional resources
from a contracted provider to supplement the DOR’s audit function and is intended to provide the DOR
with the additional resources necessary to ensure complete and timely tax compliance by vendors. RTD
contracted with Revenue Recovery Group (RRG), an audit firm with substantial experience providing
compliance review services to several Colorado municipalities, and the program began in April 2014. To
date, 75 compliance reviews have been approved to be undertaken by RRG. Additional compliance
reviews were terminated during discovery due to a determination of collection potential. Of the 75
undertaken, 15 are being scheduled, 52 are ongoing and 8 are complete. While the 8 completed
compliance reviews must still undergo a review and approval process by DOR, assessments total
$433,961 vs. costs of $286,423. It should be noted that review completions and assessments, if any,

Packet Pg. 50

1.C.6

lag the costs incurred. We continue to work with RRG and DOR to identify additional compliance review
opportunities.
Naming Rights
The Board approved RTD securing the services of a corporate sponsorship and naming rights consultant,
and RTD entered into a contract with the internationally known firm IMG. IMG presented to the Board in
2013 an inventory and financial analysis of RTD facilities, services, and assets that may lend themselves
to naming/sponsorship value-added contracts. IMG completed the valuation of RTD assets for corporate
sponsorships and naming rights and was given the green light to begin pursuing potential clients.
Following the public launch of the program in the third quarter of last year, contractor IMG has been
actively meeting with potential partners. Any proposed naming rights/corporate sponsorship contract
will be brought to the RTD Board for approval.
Partnerships and Privatization
The Task Force described this recommendation as a broad area that could include items such as
privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce expenses. RTD has undertaken
some actions under this recommendation such as the lease of the DUS historic building, IGAs for
improvements to US36 and the East Line, as well as TOD activities. RTD continues to look for
partnership and privatization opportunities on an ongoing basis.
Recommendations – Low Near-Term Priority
Recommendations made by the Task Force and categorized at the 2012 Board Retreat as having lower
near-term priority and their status are as follows:
Charge for Parking
RTD currently charges out-of-District patrons parking fees to use parking facilities as well as fees
charged to in-District patrons parking for longer than 24 hours. The Task Force identified charging
parking fees to all patrons as a possible revenue enhancement source. This recommendation could be
perceived as a fare increase. In 2013, the state legislation regarding RTD charging for parking was
amended to allow a third party to charge in-District patrons as long as RTD receives no revenue.
Tolling and Managed Lanes
The Task Force recommended investigating the possibility of RTD generating additional revenues
through charges for tolling and managed lanes.
Enacting this recommendation would require
coordination with CDOT and other agencies. The US36 BRT project is an example of how tolling and
managed lanes can enhance RTD operations and save costs. The agreement guarantees running times,
allows for bus on shoulder operations to facilitate schedule adherence on local service, and provides for
maintenance of managed lanes with no contribution from RTD. Prior to entering into agreements with
CDOT for managed lanes, RTD contributed to maintenance and snow removal on the I-25 HOV lanes.
Home Rule Initiative
The Task Force recommended that RTD consider becoming a “Home Rule” entity which would allow
RTD to collect and audit its sales and use taxes instead of the DOR. This initiative would require
legislation. RTD met several times with the DOR to discuss this initiative as well as sales and use tax
compliance reviews. Although the DOR did not object to RTD performing these services itself, the
Colorado Municipal League and other entities recommended against it. “Home Rule” is a state
constitutional authorization for creating municipalities. It could only be secured for RTD by statewide
constitutional amendment. As discussed earlier in this report, RTD has entered into an agreement with
DOR to facilitate better tax compliance and monitoring, which has been coupled with simplification of
state and RTD taxation through legislation that provides for uniformity on items taxed.
