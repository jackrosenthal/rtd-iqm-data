#### 1. Request for Increase to SmartCard Contract and Budget Transfer

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to increase the Xerox Transport Solutions contract not-to-exceed amount by $1,300,000 to a new contract amount not-to-exceed $21,031,382 and to authorize  a budget transfer of up to $3,800,000 to fund activities under this contract.

Motion:                Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the March 24, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer (CFO), introduced Kim Heldman, Senior Manager of Information Technology (IT), and George Hovey, Manager of IT Program Management.

Doug MacLeod explained that the recommended action comprises two actions: expanding the scope of the SmartCard contract and a budget transfer to fund the contract.  Expanding the contract would include adding bus validators for Call-n-Ride vehicles and SmartCard hosting.  He reminded the Directors that in October, 2014, the Board approved an increase in the Xerox contract to include new work items.  Staff is now requesting authorization to fund those items through a budget transfer from the issuance of Certificates of Participation (COPs) which proceeds are not currently needed for their original intent, such as the purchase of Mall Shuttles.  These transfers would have no impact on the 2015 amended budget.

Director Folska asked if there were any legal implications in using COP funds.  She also wondered where the funds for mall shuttles would come from when needed.  Doug MacLeod replied that COP funds are allowed to be transferred to a similar lifespan item with bond counsel approval.  He noted that when a vendor could provide mall shuttles that funding piece would be rolled to the most current COP at that time.

Director Lasater asked if Xerox is Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard compliant.  Kim Heldman replied that an audit to review PCI and other security requirements will begin on Monday, March 23, 2015.  Director Lasater said that the security question needs to be in the forefront of the conversation.  He added that Xerox either is or is not PCI compliant.  He named General Electric as an example of not being able to handle security requirements.  Director Lasater expressed his concern on how a security breach would impact our customers.  George Hovey said that IT staff shares Director Lasater’s concern.  George Hovey named this concern as one of the reasons why RTD is still hosting the current SmartCards.    He noted that moving to a debit card system raises cyber security issues.  Staff has selected a third party to confirm RTD is doing its fiduciary responsibility.  George Hovey said that staff had more information during the SmartCard update later in the meeting.  Director Lasater wondered if there was a fall back plan.  George Hovey said that the three options are: continuing with the current SmartCard system, using Xerox for the SmartCards, or engaging another company in case of a problem with Xerox.

Director Solano noted that it does not make sense to address SmartCards when RTD does not have real time information yet.

Director Francone asked how long the audit would last.  George Hovey replied that the first audit round should be completed by the end of May.  By then his team would have a list of shortcomings, vulnerabilities, and checklists addressing issues as needed.  He added that cyber security is a continuing process.  Director Francone reiterated Director Lasater’s question: would RTD have to start anew with a new vendor if Xerox fails.  George Hovey replied that staff is moving ahead with all three options as the schedule is very aggressive.  Director Francone wondered how the cost of utilizing another company would compare to Xerox.  George Hovey replied that the cost would be less as RTD would then be doing more work in house.

Director Solano mentioned that he is partially deaf and that he does not comprehend the conversation.  He asked to meet with staff offline.

Chair Sisk said that the Directors want to move to a more comprehensive SmartCard system soon.  He pointed out that $500,000 is required for web hosting.  He wondered why we needed a web host and when did staff become aware of this information.  George Hovey replied that RTD hosts the current system.   Throughout the due diligence process it became apparent that RTD does not have the capacity to host a debit card system.  The web hosting piece has been in negotiations with Xerox for some time.  Chair Sisk clarified that it sounded like staff did not anticipate outside web hosting but it having Xerox host is a more secure way for our customers.  George Hovey agreed.

Committee Chair Tobiassen thanked Director Lasater for his cyber security concerns.  He commended RTD for hiring Sheri Le, Manager for Cyber Security.  He noted that she has been working on this project to ensure its security.

Director Deadwyler mentioned that the Directors have been approving additional adjustments at various time.  She asked if there was an implementation date in sight as it seemed that the plans were behind schedule.  Doug MacLeod reminded the Directors that the current SmartCards were introduced in 2013.  The plan is to implement stored value cards by the end of 2015 and passes by the beginning of 2016.  The items presented today are the final items for approval.  He said that there would be more information during the SmartCard update later in the meeting.

Committee Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED.

#### 2. Authorization to execute a budget transfer to purchase thermal printers

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer in an amount up to $1,900,000 from the Mall Shuttle project in order to purchase and install the equipment necessary to accommodate the sale of fare media under the proposed fare structure.

Motion:               Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the March 24, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Doug MacLeod, Acting CFO, noted that the thermal printers would add a convenience to the customers when buying daily passes.  Staff is seeking Board approval to initiate the Request for Proposal (RFP) process.  He noted that this item would not move forward if the new Fare Structure was not approved.  Staff is starting the request for authorization now in order to have time for implementation by 2016.

Director Folska said she would vote no as she did not understand why the budget transfer needed to happen today.  Committee Chair Tobiassen asked Doug MacLeod to comment on the timeline.  Doug MacLeod noted that public hearings are happening in the next few weeks.  The plan is to come back to the Board in April or May with the Fare Structure proposal.  Doug MacLeod noted that approval of the recommended action would mean an accounting transfer.  If the Fare Structure is not approved the money would be transferred back.  Director Folska wondered if there would be a test period before implementing on all buses.  Doug MacLeod replied that staff sent a team to study TriMet’s system in Portland, OR.  This team came back with great ideas.

Director Menten noted from the discussion on the previous recommended action that Certificate of Participation’s (COP) transfers must be for a similar lifespan item.  She asked staff if printers would last 12 years.  Doug MacLeod replied that TriMet installed their printers 2 years ago and they have not had any problems so far.  He noted that the lifespan should not be an issue as the printers would be replaced when buses are replaced.  Director Menten expressed her concerns about thermal receipts turning dark if left in the sun and getting smudged if crumpled.  George Hovey, Manager for IT Program Management, addressed those concerns noting that TriMet recommends not installing the printers near heating vents.  He noted that TriMet prints tickets valid for over 24 hours and ticket deterioration is not an issue.

Director Lasater said that he will be voting no.  He noted that if he was part of the bond counsel he would reject the request to use the funds for thermal printers as they do not have a 12 year life expectancy.  Doug MacLeod replied that the bond counsel was taken into consideration when these types of requests are made.  He added that RTD has paid a large amount of the principal.  The bond counsel would take the payment into consideration and not have collaterals be a great issue.

Director Walker said that he would vote yes since the purchase of the thermal printers would take place assuming fare structure approval.  He noted that he did not want to have a new fare structure and not be able to provide the services promised.  He mentioned that the bond counsel would decide if it is an appropriate use of funds.

Director Solano said he would vote no due to staff’s track record of putting the cart before the horse.

Committee Chair Tobiassen echoed Director Walker’s comments, noting the risk of not being able to provide a service that was promised.  He pointed out that there were not many alternatives to provide day passes to customers on buses.  He calculated that it would cost $6 a day for the life of the device in 1,000 buses to provide this service to customers.

Director Lasater said that the Mall Shuttle COPs are not the appropriate area to transfer funds for thermal printers.  He noted that staff could find $1.9 million from another sources.

Director Anderson noted that staff would present the transfer to the bond counsel before doing the transfer itself.  She mentioned that from staff’s report and presentation, RTD will not need Mall Shuttle funding until 2016.  She said that she will vote yes as this is a good way to serve our passengers and we will not need the funds for the buses until later next year.  She added that the manner in which the funds would be accessible is an acceptable accounting procedure in any organization.

Director Lubow mentioned that she had some concerns since moving forward with the thermal printers depended on the Board’s approval of the Fare Structure.  She asked if there was another way of funding the printers since some Directors felt the COP was an inappropriate source of funding.  Doug MacLeod replied that at the moment there is not $1.9 million available.  Not using the COP would mean taking the money from another project.  He said that the COP is RTD’s best financial option as the agency is paying interest on the COP funds.  Director Lubow asked why the bond counsel was not consulted before coming to the Board.  Doug MacLeod replied that staff wanted to have authorization from the Board before engaging in the cost of bond review.

Director Hoy noted that the Board seems enthusiastic about day passes.  If day passes are approved RTD will need a way to provide those passes.  He added that he likes that the thermal printers are working in other agencies.  He also noted his preference of the printed material not having a long life expectancy as it should only be valid for a day.

Director Solano said that we should get back to basics and fix the 16th Street Mall and its tiles, which are injury prone, before investing in thermal printers.

Director James noted how utilizing the COP funding may seem like endangering the financing of the 16th St. Mall.  He mentioned that he did not feel the need to speak but due to all the negative feedback he wanted to add his support of the recommended action.

Director Solano mentioned that he was talking about the tiles on the 16th Street Mall.  Director Anderson called for a point of order.  Committee Chair Tobiassen called for the vote.

Committee Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. SmartCard Project Update

Kim Heldman, Senior Manager for IT, reviewed the SmartCard Project Update included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting packet for March 17, 2015.  The update included the status, prior period activities, and next period activities for 14 elements of the process.   She highlighted the following elements:

- Stored Value Card – staff has been working with Xerox to coordinate activities and gain commitments to meet remaining activities through this year.  The target live date is November 1st, 2015.

- New Fare Structure – staff is moving forward with timely decisions in order to meet deadlines.  Target date is January 1st, 2016.

- Merchant Retail Point of Sales (POS) – This is the one element that has a yellow status due to the holiday season timeframe and Safeway in negotiations with Albertsons.  Target date is October 1st.

Director Bagley mentioned that what RTD has done with SmartCards in a controlled environment has been a great first step.  He said that he is aware that SmartCards have been in use in a lot of places; however, most of those experiences have proven that the technology was released too quickly.  Director Bagley expressed his excitement to see most elements green on the Board Report.  He agreed with staff that the company merger of Safeway and Albertsons is problematic.  He thanked staff for a job well done and not putting out a product that does not work.

Director Solano expressed his gratitude to staff for their work on this project.

Director Lasater wondered if staff had looked into integrating the RTD SmartCard program into existing POS retail locations.  He said that counter space is at a premium and companies may look favorably into using one POS for multiple uses since it would not require adopting another technology.  George Hovey, Manager for IT Program Management, replied that in conversations with retailers the general consensus was resistance against integrating their system and networks with ours.  George Hovey recognized that technology is moving that direction; however the retailers do not seem to be responsive to that technology yet.

Director Lubow thanked staff for their work on this very complex project.  She expressed her concern over the tight schedule since there are so many dependencies we do not have control over.  She asked staff what Plan B would be and what would be the consequences of adopting a second plan.  Kim Heldman thanked Director Lubow for recognizing the complexity of the project.  Kim Heldman said that Plan B would be unfolding the program during the 1st quarter of 2016.  She explained that the main consequence would be not having the product available for the general public at the timeframe that has been expected.

Director Archuleta wondered if the web portal would function like event web portals, where customers could buy a ticket, print it out at home, and use over the next 24 hours.  Kim Heldman clarified that customers will be able to purchase and reload the card via the web portal.  They would be able to use the card to purchase tickets.

Director Francone expressed her gratitude to staff for their work on the project.  She inquired about the November 1, 2015 release date and if it would be under the current fare structure.  She also asked if staff has been overseeing the web portal project.  Kim Heldman recognized the hard work her team has put into the project.  She replied that the November 1st release date will be under the current fare structure.  If and when the Board approves a new fare structure, staff will then make the adjustments necessary to provide the services needed using the SmartCard technology.  Kim Heldman also noted that her team has been working very closely with Xerox overseeing the web portal project.

Director Folska thanked staff for their work.  She asked staff to help her visualize the ADA component of the project.  George Hovey said that the web portal will be ADA accessible as it will be through the RTD website.  Staff completed an audit with Xerox and made some modifications.  He noted that staff has been working with the National Federation of the Blind in Colorado and have modified the validators in order to make them more accessible.  Director Folska noted that the current validators require sight in order to enable the voice activation.  She wondered if this was true for the new components.  George Hovey said that he would look into this and will have an answer at the next meeting.

Director Deadwyler thanked staff for all their work.  She wondered what the cost of just getting the card will be and how it would affect those with low income.  Doug MacLeod said that staff has had initial conversations about the card cost.  The original recommendation was giving it for free.  He said that currently the cards cost $1.25 to manufacture.  The new vendor will manufacture them at $1.12.  Staff is still discussing what would be a good incentive to keep the card while taking into consideration that some people will not have the ability to purchase them.

Director Tobiassen expressed his gratitude for the scope of the project and the many variables out of staff’s control.  He wondered what the consequences would be if the Board did not approve the proposed fare structured.  He said that staff could answer that question later.

Director Menten inquired if the SmartCard would be rigid like a credit card or flexible like some gift cards.  She also expressed her surprise at the manufacturing cost and the problem of just using a card once.  Doug MacLeod replied that the cards would be rigid as they have a chip inside.  The more flexible kind with a magnetic strip posed many security concerns.

Director Menten noted that there are kiosks in Lakewood were riders can go and look up route information.  She wondered if they are meant to be informational machines or could they have the capacity to generate a card out of a slot.  George Hovey replied that the kiosks are informational.  He said staff has reviewed different options, including the longevity of the current kiosks.

#### 2. Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Update (Leeds School of Business)

Doug MacLeod, Acting CFO, introduced Robert McNown and Brian Lewandowski from the CU Leeds School of Business.  They reviewed the RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model presentation as included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet for March 17, 2015.  The presentation covered the model development; economic drivers; uncertainty; forecasts and revisions; and the comparison with the Colorado Legislative Council and the Office of State Planning and Budgeting.  Robert McNown noted that the forecast includes Moody’s Analytics as they are well respected by many firms.

Director Bagley reminded the Directors that in 2011 the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force requested a third party Sales and Use Tax forecast.  He mentioned former Director John Tayer as one of the major proposers of the task force.  Director Bagley noted that the fact that the forecast has been on the conservative end means that RTD is doing better than expected.  He applauded the work of the Leeds School of Business as it has helped RTD have better communication with stakeholders, customers, and tax payers.

Director Folska echoed Director Bagley’s sentiment.  She appreciates that the Leeds School of Business is from the University of Colorado, her Alma Mater.  She asked Brian Lewandowski to remind the Directors what the term and value of the contract with the Leeds School of Business is as well as other entities that they work with.  Brian Lewandowski replied that the current contract with RTD is up on December, 2015.  Other entities that they work with include City and County of Denver, Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation, Denver South Economic Development Partnership, as well as government entities and private companies.  Doug MacLeod said the contract is valued at $60,000 annually.

Director Folska recalled that while at the APTA Legislative Conference, a speaker mentioned that rail transportation to downtown from the airport has resulted in an 11-12% spike in revenue for most areas. She wondered if this value could be added to the forecast utilizing data from other cities.  Robert McNown replied that the forecast utilizes historical data and thus it would be difficult to add new information.  As data becomes available it could be incorporated into the forecast.  He added that maybe his team could be more creative in incorporating these types of changes.  Brian Lewandowski added that there are some models that could be use which quantify expanding traffic systems, such as the Regional Economic Models, Inc. (REMI).  Director Folska mentioned that hard numbers of predictable funding sources help the Directors in making their case when asking for Federal sources of funding.

Director Hoy noted the mention of the marijuana revenue, both for medicinal and recreational, is at 1%.  He asked what that 1% was from.  Robert McNown said that the 1% of RTD’s Sales and Use Tax Revenue is from marijuana.  Director Hoy asked if Leeds has measured the impact of RTD having parity with the State on taxes.  Brian Lewandowski replied that the specifics of the parity cannot be quantified because the State gets the revenue from retailers in general categories, not item by item.

Director Bagley addressed Director Folska’s suggestion.  He noted that it is very difficult to get the details of the fine grain economic analysis on a macro level.  Robert McNown agreed that it is really quite a challenge with so many variables.  He added that the REMI model Brian Lewandowski referred to uses different methodology and strategy to make assumptions on impacts, in this case, to RTD revenue.

#### 3. 2015 Amended Budget, 2016-2021 SBP, 2016 Budget - Calendar

Jannette Scarpino, Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, referred the Directors to the 2015 Summary SBP/Budget Calendar included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting agenda packet for March 17, 2015.  She highlighted the following dates:

- April 14 – 2016-2021 SBP and 2016 budget development process and assumptions review; proposal of 2016 performance measures

- April 28 – 2016-2021 Budget Study Session

- June 16 – Board Meeting: Adoption of 2015 Amended Budget

- July 28 – Board Meeting: Adoption of 2016-2021 SBP

- November 17 – Board Meeting: public hearings and adoption of 2016 budget.

There were no questions from the Directors.

#### 4. Fourth Quarter 2014 Performance Measures

Jannette Scarpino, Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, referred the Directors to the Fourth Quarter 2014 Performance Measures included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting agenda packet for March 17, 2015.

Director Lubow expressed her concern over the recent light rail accidents.  She noted that even when RTD is not at fault the agency is the one that looks bad.  Jannette Scarpino replied that of the few incidents in the Fourth Quarter 2014, only one was a preventable accident.  Phil Washington, General Manager, agreed with Director Lubow.  He said that RTD has upped our safety programs; RTD is working with police departments on educational programs and doing all we can.  He said that one preventable accident is too much.

Director Menten asked what “Info Rides” are, as referenced in Goal 7.1.  Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, replied that these are events when RTD takes a bus to schools or other civic events at which people are shown how to ride.  Director Menten asked if educating people how to use Access-a-Ride and other services fall under this category.  Scott Reed explained that Easter Seals does that kind of service in collaboration with Via Mobility.  Info Rides are targeted to people not familiar with RTD.  Director Menten wondered if rail safety would be under civic events.  Scott Reed replied that operations safety is not included in the performance measures but staff has that information available.

Director Hoy addressed the preventable and non-preventable accidents from his transportation background.  He noted that when an accident is non-preventable it is not a matter of guilty or not guilty.  He added that the record of only one preventable accident is incredibly good.

#### 5. January 2015 KPI Dashboard

Doug MacLeod, Acting CFO, presented the January 2015 Key Performance Indicators as included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting agenda packet for March 17, 2015.  He noted that ridership was down 2.3%, revenue was down at 1.1%, and Sales and Use Tax was up 10.8%.

Director Bagley mentioned that there has been a 50% reduction in the cost of oil and gasoline.  He said his prediction is that if the reduction stays under $60 we could expect to see lower ridership and revenue all year long.  He said that we would have to depend on higher Sales and Use Tax revenue in order to have a balanced budget.

#### 6. Fiscal Sustainability Task Force Recommendations Update

Jannette Scarpino, Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, referred the Directors to the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force Recommendations Update included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting agenda packet for March 17, 2015.  She highlighted the following areas:

- Fund Balance Policy – the target is $90 million; it is currently at $35.8 million

- Technology and Energy Innovation – we are now able to quantify our savings: average of $3,000 a month at East Metro and $500 a month in Boulder due to lighting upgrades.

- Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews – 15 reviews are being scheduled, 52 reviews are ongoing, and 8 are complete.

- Naming Rights – IMG has been meeting with potential partners.  Any proposed naming rights/corporate sponsorship contract will be brought to the RTD Board for approval.

Director Folska asked the Directors and staff to think about what the Board can do to fill the gap in the Fund Balance.  Doug MacLeod noted that the accounting balance for the fund balance is $75 million liability in our books.  He said that $68 million is for the represented fund and $7 million pension trust for the salary employees.  Staff position’s is that our obligation is what is in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, not the accounting entry.  Janette Scarpino said that this could be clarified for future reports.

### D. Other Matters

Chair Sisk noted that the Executive Committee met at 3:00 p.m. that afternoon and all 15 Directors attended the meeting.  He said that he appointed a General Manager Executive Search Committee.  The members are Directors Deadwyler, Bagley, Sisk, Tobiassen, and Francone.  The committee will focus on transparency, communication, and documentation.  He said the buddy system will ensure communication and input from all Board members.  The Directors are confident that the agency is on solid ground.  The Board is moving forward on a structured pace to accept interim applications.  Chair Sisk added that while he accepted General Manager Phil Washington’s resignation reluctantly, he also congratulated him on his new position at L.A. Metro.  Chair Sisk said that RTD owes it to the constituents and elected officials to keep an eye on the many balls in the air.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Tobiassen adjourned to the Operations and Customer Service Committee at 7:45 p.m.
