BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Finance and Planning Committee Work Plan

January 14, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
Article VI, Section 4 of the Board Bylaws details the purpose of and process for approving committee
work plans as follows:
Each standing and ad hoc committee must create, approve and forward to the full board for
review an annual work plan detailing the major issues the committee will consider throughout the
fiscal year. The work plan shall be developed in collaboration between the respective committee’s
chair, vice chair, and the responsible RTD staff with the input of the committee’s members. The
work plan must be created and approved by the committee no later than March of each year.
Work plans for standing committees may, for purposes of ensuring the continuity of a standing
committee’s work, extend through February of the following fiscal year. Adjustments and
additions to the work plan can be made by the committee chair in consultation with the
committee vice chair and responsible RTD staff.
Additionally, per Article VI, Section 1, d.), the Finance and Planning Committee is “responsible for
agency financial matters, including but not limited to budget and monthly financial statement review,
determination of the fiscal impact of all Board actions, asset management, and long-range planning and
capital projects.”
DISCUSSION
The Committee is asked to review the attached draft work plan and gain an understanding of the
committee’s workflow based on the items currently listed. Additionally, the Directors should provide
additional input on items they would like to see included in the work plan that are not already included in
the draft document.
Following the discussion at the committee meeting, senior staff will work with the chair and vice chair
of the committee to further refine the work plan. Additional discussions on all committee work plans are
slated for the 2025 Board Retreat, which is scheduled for February 1, 2025. The Committee will then
review the work plan for potential approval at its meeting on February 11, 2025. Per the Board Bylaws,
all committee work plans must be approved by the end of March.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to the discussion regarding the Committee’s work plan.

This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the Finance and Planning Committee’s ability to effectively govern
directly impacts the overall performance of the agency. A solid committee work plan will ensure RTD’s
resources are used efficiently, and that the Board’s policy and governance objectives are more focused,
collaborative, and obtainable.
