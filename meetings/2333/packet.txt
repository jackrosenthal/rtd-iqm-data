Re:

Board Meeting

BBMK assisted and participated in the CSG West two day Transportation Forum. Delegates of
CSG West were able to tour Denver Union Station, ride the light rail, view the 9 mile station,
and explore the progress of the East and R Line concluding with a tour of the Westin Hotel at
DIA. This two day summit showcased to legislators and policy makers from around the country
the success and vision of RTD’s regional innovative approach to transportation challenges.
RTD Board Directors Sisk, Solano, Tobiassen, James and Francone attended the CSG West
Transportation Panel and heard from a diverse panel of speakers that included CDOT Director
Shailen Bhatt, Denver Metro Chamber CEO Kelly Brough and RTD’s Interim General Manager
David Genova. Director Francone was able to join us for the final panel and participated in a
facilitated discussion with legislators and staff. Many thanks to RTD Staff and Directors for
their assistance in participating and planning the Transportation Forum.

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: AUGUST 4, 2015
MAP-21 Reauthorization and the Highway Trust Fund (HTF):



Surface transportation programs are currently operating under a two-month policy extension
that expires this Friday, July 31, with revenues in the HTF falling to critically low levels
shortly thereafter – before the end of August – if no Congressional action is taken to
supplement them.



Senate floor consideration of a 6-year surface transportation bill continues into its second
week; any vote on final passage of the bill would not take place until Thursday, July 30 – by
which time the House will have adjourned for its 5-week August recess.



Even if the House were still in session on Thursday, House leaders have made clear they
have no intention of simply taking up and passing the 6-year Senate bill.



Instead, on Wednesday, the House will likely approve a 3-month highway patch, paired with
legislation providing emergency funding for veterans’ programs. The House will send this
combined measure to the Senate and then depart Wednesday afternoon until after Labor
Day. The House plans to consider its own multi-year surface transportation bill this fall.



Therefore, it is looking increasingly likely that before the Friday deadline, the House and
Senate will both adopt a 3-month patch that will shore up the Highway Trust Fund
and extend current surface transportation programs through October 29, averting
any lapse in Federal transit and highway funding.

FY 2016 Transportation/HUD Appropriations Bill:
The fiscal year 2016 appropriations process has come to a halt.


The House and Senate are expected to adjourn for August recess with no substantive
movement toward resolving the partisan disagreement over sequestration-dictated spending
levels limiting all of this year’s appropriations bills.



When they return, the two chambers will have only 10 legislative days before the October 1
start to the fiscal year to reach a funding agreement that would prevent a government
shutdown.



As a result, Speaker Boehner publicly conceded last week that a continuing resolution (CR)
will be needed. Under a CR, OMB generally prohibits Federal agencies from providing any
funding for discretionary programs like New Starts; discretionary allocations generally must
await a full-year appropriations bill.



A decision on the length of the CR will not be made until after the August recess.

Attachment: Fed Update 8 4 15 (2471 : Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs)

Below is the state of play on Congressional reauthorization of Federal surface transportation
programs as of July 28. Mike Dino will provide a verbal report with the latest updates to this
information on August 4.
