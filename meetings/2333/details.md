#### 1. Local Government Update - CRL Associates

Roger Sherman, CRL, stated that tomorrow, August 5, is the day that candidates can officially pull petitions and start collecting signatures for the November election.  He said August 25 is the last day that petitions can be turned in to be certified.  He shared that CRL has begun creating candidate profiles for those that they know are running.  CRL will provide the Board with a full and final list after August 25 when the candidates have been certified.

Roger Sherman informed the Board that he took a tour with the Office of Economic Development and International Trade (OEDIT) of the East Rail Line and Denver International Airport Hotel.  He explained that Jeff Kraft from the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee works for the OEDIT and coordinated a tour for their office.  He said there were about thirty people from OEDIT along with Consuls from Japan, Mexico and Canada.   He thought the tour allowed for some great interaction on behalf of RTD.

Roger Sherman shared that tomorrow the Metro Mayors Caucus will be meeting.  He was hoping to be reporting that Senator Bennet was in town to talk about transportation funding but at the last minute was unable to attend.  He anticipates they will reschedule the discussion and will keep the Board informed.

#### 2. State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs

Jenifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry~McKenna, reminded the Directors that the Council of State Governments West was recently in town.  She shared that they really wanted to focus on the transportation successes of the region in a very challenging transportation funding time.  She thanked the Directors that attended the breakfast.

Jenifer Brandeberry noted that since this is a non-election year the general assembly are either taking time off or attending conferences.  There will be several more Transportation Legislation Research Committee meetings in the fall.  She believes that transportation will be a big issue during the upcoming legislative session.

##### a. State Update for 8-4-15

#### 3. Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs, informed the Board that the Senate is still in Washington, D.C.  They decided to stay an extra week as opposed to the House that is already on break.  He said that as everyone knows at this point the Senate was trying to be very ambitious with a long-term, six year transportation funding plan but that did not happen as the House had no intention of doing a long term bill.

Mike Dino explained that the biggest issue still to be resolved is how to fund a bill that goes beyond three months.  The House Republicans still want to use a one-time repatriation tax but the Senate Republicans do not agree; they would like to pay for a bill through the General Fund and offset it by other tax measures.  Mike Dino stated that there is no real plan to move forward.

Mike Dino said that early in the year the House and Senate were working together and it appeared that Fiscal Year 2016 appropriations might happen before October; however, that is no longer the case.  Mike Dino believes there will be a continuing resolution.  He noted that one small piece of good news is that the Senate appropriations bill did have good funding increases for transportation.  He hopes there is renewed vigor in trying to solve their issues when the House and Senate get back from Labor Day.

Director Folska wondered if Mike Dino had a sense if a broader definition of Bus Rapid Transit would be included in a new transportation bill.  Mike Dino shared that Squire Patton Boggs was able to present a new BRT definition to Senators Gardner and Bennet; however, rules imposed by Senator Leader McConnell were that there would only be two amendments to the bill.  He knows that they will continue to lobby for those changes to be an amendment and Squire Patton Boggs will continue to lobby that as well.

### D. Other Matters

Director Francone thanked CRL, Brandeberry~McKenna, and Squire Patton Boggs for all their work on behalf of RTD.  She has received comments at the Federal, State and Local levels just glowing about their efforts.  She also thanked Megan Wagner, Brendeberry~McKenna, for her work during the Council of State Governments West event.  She thought it was a wonderful opportunity to network with other legislators and showcase what RTD has done.

### F. Adjourn

Director Folska adjourned the meeting at 6:41 p.m. to the Planning and Development Committee.
