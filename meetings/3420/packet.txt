BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Strategic Plan Survey Results and Data Evaluation

Committee Meeting Date:
November 2, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Leah Riley, Chief Administrative Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
In adopting a five-year Strategic Plan, the Board established four strategic priorities and their associated
success outcomes the agency will strive to achieve:
Strategic Priority
Community Value: RTD Strives to be a strong
community partner, providing value to customers as
well as to the broader Denver Metro region while
sustaining planet Earth

Success Outcome
Establish baseline for community value
index and increase by 5%

Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently
deliver high-quality customer service

Establish baseline for customer net
promoter score and increase by 5%

Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and
retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce

Establish baseline for employee net
promoter score and increase by 5%

Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the
management of all financial resources

50% of outcome is that RTD spends
less money than it receives; 50% of
outcome is that the community
believes that it sees value in RTD’s
spending

Regarding the strategic priorities of Community Value and Customer Excellence, TransPro Consulting
was engaged in 2021 to conduct community and customer surveys to discern the agency’s community
value index and customer net promoter score for that year. Those surveys were completed November
2021 and the results were validated by Plante Moran in January 2022. On February 17, 2022, TransPro
Consulting presented the 2021 survey results to the Board.
The community value index and customer net promoter score (NPS) garnered from the 2021 surveys
serve as the baseline data against which future progress is measured for the strategic priorities of
Community Value and Customer Excellence.

DISCUSSION
Culminating from a competitive request for proposals, BBC Research and Consulting was awarded a
contract on August 3, 2022 to conduct the community value and customer surveys for 2022 follow-on
data. The instruments for both surveys were based on those developed in 2021 to ensure consistency in
data collection and reporting.
Customer Excellence Survey
1. Methodology: For the bus and rail surveys, the sampling plan was inclusive of the entire service
area, included all bus and rail lines and accounted for time of day. For the paratransit customer
survey, sampling was conducted via telephone with active customers. The surveys were available
in English and Spanish and were conducted from September 9 through September 25, 2022.
2. Survey Results: Compared to 2021, the customer NPS scores are lower across all service modes.
The NPS scores are still above zero, meaning the agency has more promoters than detractors;
detractors continue to comprise a small percentage of customers.
3. Key Factors:
•

The key factors for bus and rail garnered from the surveys are on-time performance, fare
price and frequency of service. Other key factors impacting customers’ perception of
services are information regarding service disruptions, high-quality communications,
personal security while waiting for and riding vehicles and vehicle cleanliness.

•

The key factors for paratransit garnered by the survey are on-time performance, courteous
drivers and the ability to get to needed places. Other key factors impacting customers’
perception of services are information regarding service disruptions, high-quality
communications, personal security, travel time, helpful drives, drivers securely fastening
customers and availability of scheduling staff.

Community Value Survey
1. Methodology: Surveys were mailed to a random sample of US Postal Service addresses within the
RTD service area. The surveys were available in English and Spanish and were administered from
September 22 through October 5, 2022. ZIP codes with high shares of people of color were
oversampled to ensure representation. Survey data was also weighted by age to accurately
reflect the composition of community members.
2. Survey Results: Compared to 2021, the community value index (NPS) is lower and indicates more
detractors than promoters.
3. Key Factors: The below list represents the key factors, ranked by importance, impacting
community members’ perception of agency value:

SURVEY INSTRUMENTS
Customer and community survey instruments were based on survey instruments developed
in 2021
► Questions directly related to RTD performance scorecard metrics

► Questions largely similar to 2021 in terms of language and structure to ensure
comparability and allow RTD to track changes
► Revised select questions to clarify intention (e.g., safety vs. personal security
questions)

► Surveys administered in English and Spanish

1.C.1.a

Packet Pg. 9

KEY TAKEAWAYS
● Satisfaction and Net Promoter Scores (NPS) are down across all service modes and for
community members
● Paratransit customers continue to be the most satisfied across service modes

● Overall satisfaction and likelihood to recommend ratings indicate that RTD has a strong
customer base across service modes, and that a relatively small percentage of
customers is dissatisfied
● With improvements in key areas, RTD could drastically improve customer satisfaction
and NPS scores
► Bus and rail customers report lower satisfaction in key areas—including on-time performance,
service communications, security, and cleanliness—than in 2021

2022 RTD CUSTOMER & COMMUNITY SURVEYS | 5

Attachment: 2022 RTD Surveys Presentation_Final (4724 : Strategic Plan Survey Results

1.C.1.a

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
● Understanding changes in customer characteristics in terms of transit dependency and
economic stress is important for understanding customer satisfaction
► Compared to 2021, bus and rail customers are less likely to be transit dependent and more
likely to be looking for ways to save money

● Similarly, acknowledging broader socio-economic factors that continue to impact the
metro area, and identifying their impacts on customer experience is important in
understanding changes in customer satisfaction
► Statistical and qualitative information suggest that factors related to the unhoused,
cleanliness, violent crime, and drug use in public spaces continue to impact the metro area
and customer experience
► As those factors persist over time, without adequate response, customer satisfaction will likely
continue to drop

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
● RTD should consider whether any events potentially impacted participant responses,
including:
► Light rail derailment (September 21), which occurred just before the community survey was
launched (September 22)

► August Zero Fare month, which occurred shortly before the bus/rail survey was launched

METHODOLOGY
The study team used Address Based Sampling to conduct the community survey
► USPS addresses with ZIP codes in RTD’s 8-county service area were included in the
sample
► The survey was administered from September 22-October 5

► The study team mailed survey invitations to a random sample of addresses
► ZIP codes with high shares of people of color were oversampled to ensure
representation
► Community members could complete the survey online or via telephone

► 600 community members completed the survey resulting in an overall margin of
error within +/-4.01 percentage points at a 95 percent confidence level
► The survey data were weighted by age to accurately reflect community members
