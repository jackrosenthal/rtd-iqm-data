Updates
 Eagle P3 DBE Update Introduction
Kenn Hardin informed the Board that DTP has been extremely cooperative. In
his last five years of doing this, the DTP team has been really good to work
with. For a contract of this magnitude we have not had a team so energized
and so cooperative. We are in the process of reviewing their DBE Plan and once
complete, we will share it with the Board. If things conclude the way they are
starting out this will be a great benefit to the community.

Eagle P3 DBE Update Report

Gregg Amparano of DTP provided an update on the DBE/SBE process and
progress. They have an existing letter of intent with 49 DBE/SBE which equate
to a value exceeding 119 million dollars. The plan is to convert 65% of the
letters of intent to contracts by the end of this year.
Director Malpiede congratulated RTD and DTP on the outstanding report and
efforts. She asked what happens to the person who is unemployed and asked
how the process will be tracked. Greg answered that they will get ahead of the
message and set expectations. The majority of the jobs will peak during
construction phase. They will also be a visible member of RTD’s Workforce
Initiative.
Director Tobiassen also thanked RTD and DTP for the hard work and asked about
outreach for DBE/SBE registration programs outside of Denver. There are many small
businesses in other communities that could benefit from these efforts.
Director Christopher commented that we need to get as creative as we can in
getting the word out and not just getting qualified for DBE but letting the people
who are unemployed know the magnitude of what this is about and the
opportunities. They need to work all the channels for communication (i.e.
Chambers, Economic Development, community businesses, nonprofits, etc) to
let them know.
Director Martinez encouraged that the handout gets out to the DBE/SBE
Community; it provides great information. Carla Perez indicated they are
working a plan for getting this information out to the community.
Kenn Harden added that when these letters of intent are converted, he is proud
to state the total value of contracts for FasTracks project will be around
$400M.
