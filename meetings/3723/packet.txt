Agency Performance Scorecard Recommended Revisions

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board to adopt revisions to the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Agency Performance Scorecard.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager/CEO
John McKay, Executive Business Partner
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan) was approved by the Board during a Special Board
Meeting held on Tuesday, August 10, 2021.
The Strategic Plan establishes the agency’s four Strategic Priorities, which serve as the functional pillars
used to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance:
•
•
•
•

Community Value: RTD strives to be a strong community partner, providing value to customers
as well as to the broader Denver metro region while sustaining planet Earth
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently deliver high-quality customer service
Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management of all financial resources

Each Strategic Priority is associated with a measurable Success Outcome.
Leveraging data garnered through Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership
surveys, staff held strategy sessions in late 2022 and throughout 2023 to develop tactics to improve
agency performance in specific areas. These tactics were distilled into three overarching Strategic
Initiatives for 2023 and 2024:
Back to Basics: RTD strives to enhance the reach and impact of internal communications and to
redouble agency efforts to maintain assets in a state of good repair leveraging sound asset
management principles.
People Power: Recognizing the critical importance of its people, the agency’s most important
resource, in achieving the agency’s mission, RTD seeks to vigorously address impediments to
recruitment and retention efforts and to foster a culture of learning and development.

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

Welcoming Transit Environment: RTD seeks to reduce the impacts of criminal behaviors and
Code of Conduct violations on agency services and workplaces and, in doing so, to improve
community and employee perception of personal and public security on RTD property and
vehicles.
For the performance period commencing September 1, 2023, and concluding July 1, 2024, each nonrepresented employee was required to develop and strive to achieve “stretch” goals developed using the
SMART framework and based on the Strategic Initiatives.
These goals have been intentionally designed to drive and incentivize individual performance, which in
turn improves the performance of the agency overall. Moreover, the initiatives reflect a renewed
collective focus to deliver meaningful progress toward achieving the Success Outcomes.
During the Board’s annual retreat in 2024, Board members discussed opportunities to enhance agency
transparency and bolster communication and engagement with jurisdictional partners, stakeholders, and
customers. At that time, Board members collectively discussed the development of a series of openended questions intended to probe whether the agency is meeting its performance goals:

Community Value

Customer Excellence

How is RTD achieving its
vision to be the trusted
leader in mobility?

How is RTD meeting
customers’ needs?

How has RTD delivered
value to the communities
it serves?

Employee Ownership

Financial Success

How well is RTD
How has RTD
attracting highly skilled
demonstrated good
and engaged job seekers? stewardship of taxpayer
dollars?
How is RTD creating a
What is RTD doing to How has RTD developed
welcoming transit
inspire employees to build trust as the leader in
environment?
a career?
mobility?

In alignment with this effort, staff has developed a public-facing agency performance dashboard
(performance dashboard) that will provide answers to these questions and serve as an easily accessible
repository for performance data related to the Strategic Plan. The performance dashboard will also be
expanded over time to house information related to the agency budget and financial reports, people
power statistics, and other key measurements. The performance dashboard will enhance agency
transparency and assist the Performance Committee’s efforts to assess the agency’s progress toward
Strategic Plan Success Outcomes.
The performance dashboard launched in late May 2024.
DISCUSSION
As noted in the Strategic Plan document, and as contemplated by the Board and staff in 2021,
performance metrics are subject to change during the duration of the Plan. Adjusting agency metrics,

Packet Pg. 4

1.C.1

and thereby adjusting agency operations and performance, in order to achieve success outcomes is an
essential element of the Strategic Plan.
Draft revisions to the scorecard were developed by staff in collaboration with the Board Chair and
Performance Committee Chair, leveraging both the above-referenced open-ended questions posed during
the Board’s 2024 retreat, as well as a detailed discussion with the Performance Committee at its
meeting on May 21, 2024.
Further, staff is developing a separate annual scorecard related to agency performance driven by an
operational vantage point. Related to this scorecard, staff will define success and develop action steps
that tie into staff work plans, which stem from strategic initiatives, and other key drivers related to
agency performance, predicated upon annual survey data. The annual scorecard will be presented to the
Performance Committee as a draft no later than the September 2024 Performance Committee.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of the Agency Performance Scorecard
revisions.
