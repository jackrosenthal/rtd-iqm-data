Board Meeting Date: July 28, 2015

Subject:

Recommendation for Passage of Resolution
Authorizing the General Manager to Execute a
Design Build Contract and other Agreements
for the Southeast Rail Extension

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
resolution authorizing the Chair of the RTD Board of Directors and the General Manager, whether interim
or permanent, or their officers or delegates to execute grant agreements, a two phase design-build
contract, intergovernmental agreements (IGAs), purchase and sale contracts, documents evidencing
property interests, and such other agreements as are necessary or appropriate for the construction of the
Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) and to accept third party contributions and increase the project budget
by such third party contribution amounts to implement third party requested betterments, all according
to the terms set forth in the Resolution.
BACKGROUND
On February 21, 2012 the RTD Board of Directors approved selection of a locally preferred alternative
following an environmental study mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as a
prerequisite to seeking federal funding for the SERE. The Board authorized RTD to apply to enter into the
federal new starts grant funding process with the goal of a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) on
August 28, 2012. A Record of Decision (ROD) for the project was issued by the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) on October 17, 2014. FTA has since issued a ROD and has authorized the project
for each phase of development that is a statutory prerequisite to obtaining an FFGA, and the executive
branch of the federal government has included SERE in each report and budget necessary to maintain
FFGA eligibility. RTD anticipates receipt of an FFGA in the first half of 2016.
The Chair and staff members will be required to sign acceptance of the FFGA and other federal grants.
On July 15, 2014 the RTD Board of Directors authorized staff to submit an amendment to the DRCOG
Baseline Report on FasTracks, which contained a listing of projects that would serve as the basis for
inclusion in the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). The Southeast Rail Extension was approved to
be included in this list in order to maintain eligibility for and support the RTD intent to seek federal
funding to construct the SERE.
The RTD Board of Directors authorized staff to issue a request for proposals for a design build contract
for construction SERE.
Responses were received from several qualified teams and a team
recommendation is described below.
Throughout the NEPA, funding, and procurement processes RTD staff have been engaged in negotiations
with the City of Lone Tree (Lone Tree), Ridgegate Investments, Inc. (Ridgegate), owner of significant
amounts of needed right of way, and Rampart Range Metropolitan District (RRMD), an additional
property owner, regarding project development.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Based on evaluation criteria and processes discussed below RTD staff recommends selection of a
design-build contractor and execution of a two phase contract, the construction phase of which will be
dependent on receipt of an FFGA.
Lone Tree is prepared to contribute funds of $25 million to the project and property interests necessary
for construction and operation on entry into an IGA as more fully described below.
RRMD is prepared to contribute property interests necessary for construction and operation on entry into
an IGA as more fully described below.
Ridgegate is prepared to contribute property interests necessary for construction and operation on entry
into a Purchase and Sale Agreement and supplemental agreements and deeds as more fully described
below.
DISCUSSION
The FFGA
Following completion of NEPA work and selection by the RTD Board of a locally preferred alternative,
RTD requested authority from FTA to enter into the first phase of Project Development which is
Preliminary Engineering. FTA authorized the first phase of Project Development in April 2013. Following
the Board’s authorization to include the project in the DRCOG RTD in July 2014 RTD requested
authorization to enter the Engineering Phase of Project Development in September 2014 which was
granted. The President’s budget for 2016 included the project, indicating that FTA is planning to issue
an FFGA next year. RTD hopes to receive the FFGA in the first half of 2016. The Chair and members of
RTD will be required to execute the FFGA as it is a contract between FTA and RTD. It obligates RTD to
complete the project within a specific time frame, to follow all federal terms and conditions including
Buy America, Davis Bacon Wages, construction of the project defined through the NEPA analysis and to
be responsible for all costs other than the FFGA contribution.
The Design-Build Contract
The Southeast Rail Extension is a 2.3 mile double track extension of light rail from the existing Lincoln
Station to a new end of line station south of Ridgegate Parkway. There will be two additional new
stations as well as three bridge structures.
After completing 65% design using RTD engineering staff, RTD embarked on a two-step procurement
process in November 2014 to select a Design-Build Contractor for the Southeast Rail Extension.
Requests for Qualifications (RFQ) were provided to the contracting community on November 17, 2014.
On January 16, 2015, RTD received 7 Statement of Qualifications (SOQ). Following a two week review
process, RTD shortlisted the following teams to receive an invitation to propose on the project in the
form of Request for Proposals (RFP):
1) Kiewit with Hatch Mott McDonald and Mass Electric
2) Balfour Beatty with Parsons Brinckerhoff
3) Stacy and Witbeck/Herzog Joint Venture with STV and Wadsworth
4) Graham/Kraemer Joint Venture with Stantec
The Request for Proposals were sent to the four teams on February 27, 2015 with the deadline for
proposals set for May 15, 2015. One on one meetings were held with each of the proposing teams
during the proposal period. Additionally RTD received numerous questions from each team as well as
Alternative Technical Concepts (ATC’s). On April 27, 2015, RTD provided final responses to all
questions and ATC’s in the form of a final addendum to the RFP.
On May 15, 2015, RTD received proposals from all four shortlisted teams. RTD staff evaluated and
scored the proposals based on the following four areas:
1) Technical Approach, Technical Innovation and Creativity (35 Points)

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

2) Management Approach, Experience and Approach (10 Points)
3) DBE/SBE/WIN Approach (10 Points)
4) Cost Proposal (45 Points)
In addition to this evaluation, a group of stakeholders also reviewed the proposals and provided their
input in the form of pros and cons.
The evaluation of the Technical, Management, and Cost Proposals were conducted separately. After
review and scoring by each Technical and Management Working Groups, those scores were provided to
a Technical Subcommittee which then prepared a recommendation to the Evaluation Committee which
consisted of members of RTD’s Senior Leadership Team. At the Evaluation Committee Meeting, the
results of the Technical and Management Approach Working Groups were combined with the scoring of
the Cost Proposal Working Group.
The Balfour Beatty/Parson Brinckerhoff team scored the highest with a score of 83.31, rating number
one in Technical, SBE and Cost, and number two in Management. Their price is $139,769,254.00,
which is also the lowest of the proposers.
The following basic components are included in the contract:
1) Lump Sum Contract Price.
2) RTD set a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goal of 20% for design and 24% for
construction. The contractor has committed to exceed those goals by an additional .5% each.
The contractor has also presented a plan to include to a voluntary Small Business Enterprise
(SBE) goal of 6%.
3) The Project hiring goals for Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) graduates are as follows:
a. Professional Service – Goal 8.5%: Participants may perform professional services such
as design, quality control, quality assurance, surveying, contract administration,
easement acquisition, and public information duties.
b. Skilled Craft – Goal 13.11%: Participants should perform skilled construction related
activities such as carpentry, masonry, iron worker, equipment operator, mechanic
work, or similar skilled construction work.
4) Davis-Bacon and Buy America Requirements – The contractor will be required to use DavisBacon wage rates and comply with Buy America Requirements.
The Lone Tree IGA
Lone Tree has agreed to be responsible for the cash contribution of $25 million for the construction of
SERE. RTD has been advised that other parties benefitting from the project will be contributing to the
$25 million but RTD will need to sign an IGA with only one entity, Lone Tree, to receive those funds.
The IGA will allow Lone Tree to use federal grant funds that would not otherwise have been available to
RTD as part of its payment. Funds will be paid over a three year period anticipated to meet RTD’s
construction cash flow needs. In addition to the cash contribution, Lone Tree is contributing property
rights in the form of deeds and non-revocable licenses to property worth about $50,000 in addition to
the cash. It is also contributing staff time and waiving permit fees with an estimated value of
$150,000.00. In consideration for the Lone Tree contributions and as a prerequisite to their receipt, RTD
must receive the FFGA and award a contract for the construction of the project. If RTD has not started
revenue service by 2020 it must reimburse Lone Tree unless RTD continues to make diligent progress.
Lone Tree is entitled to review all project plans, and all facilities that require local government permitting
will be subject to Lone Tree’s codes, ordinances and standards. The IGA also commits that RTD is
building some temporary drainage and roadway facilities that will be replaced with shared or public
facilities as additional infrastructure is developed in Lone Tree.
The RRMD IGA
The RRMD IGA Rampart Range Metropolitan District, a political subdivision of the State of Colorado is
conveying property required for construction of the line, subject to RTD’s consummation of its

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1

transactions with Ridgegate for its property and receipt of the FFGA. RTD estimates the value of the
property being donated by RRMD is over $800,000.
The Ridgegate Agreements
RTD will require right of way and easements from Ridgegate. RTD is acquiring a total of more than 10
acres and drainage and septic easements. The easements will be replaced with shared municipal
drainage and utilities as the area is developed. Closing on all real estate interests is contingent on RTD’s
receipt of an FFGA and proceeding with construction of the project along with satisfaction of title and
escrow matters and completion of the IGAs described above. RTD estimates the value of property being
donated by RIdgegate is about $2 million.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The current projected budget for the Southeast Rail Extension is $233.1 million. This total includes
$34.4 million that was spent through the end of 2014 on environmental analysis, preliminary
engineering and design, and the acquisition of eight light rail vehicles for the project.
The remaining budget for the project from 2015-2019 is projected at $198.7 million. Funding for the
remaining costs is projected to come from the following sources:
FTA Full Funding Grant Agreement

$92.0

FTA CMAQ Funds

7.5

Cash Contribution - Local Entities per IGA

25.0

In-Kind Contribution - Local Entities per IGA

3.0

RTD Local Funding

71.2

Total Remaining Funding

$198.7

Per the current budget projections, RTD would be responsible for 35.8% of the remaining project costs.
The local funding partners would contribute 14.1% of the remaining project cost, and federal grants
would provide 50.1% of the remaining funding. The RTD funding is included in the 2014 Board adopted
FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation and is programmed over the construction period.
Board authorization for Phase I of the Project will allow expenditures up to $24.4 million for design,
related staff costs, and some land acquisition costs from parties other than Lone Tree, Ridgegate and
RRMD. A transfer of $15,180,408 from the FasTracks Management Reserve to the project budget is
also included in the Resolution to cover a portion of the Phase I costs. The remainder of the $24.4
million will be included in the 2016 budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the
attached resolution authorizing the Chair of the RTD Board of Directors and the General Manager,
whether interim or permanent, or their officers or delegates to execute grant agreements, a two
phase design-build contract, intergovernmental agreements (IGAs), purchase and sale contracts,
documents evidencing property interests, and such other agreements as are necessary or
appropriate for the construction of the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) and to accept third party
contributions and increase the project budget by such third party contribution amounts to
implement third party requested betterments, all according to the terms set forth in the Resolution
2. Do not pass the attached resolution. This will jeopardize receipt of an FFGA and construction of
the project. This will put third party funding contributions including cash, right of way and staff
time in jeopardy.
