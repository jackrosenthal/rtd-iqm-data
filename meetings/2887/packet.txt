RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2019 to amend and appropriate funds for the proposed 2019
Amended Budget, to decrease the appropriation by $49.1 million to $1.267 billion, and to decrease the
appropriation of Capital Carryforward (previously approved capital funds) by $140.0 million to $579.5
million, as detailed below in the Discussion section of this Board Report.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1: Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
The purpose of this Board Report is to request an amendment to the 2019 Adopted Budget. This
amendment will account for capital carryforward adjustments from year-end 2018 to 2019. The
amendment also will detail other necessary adjustments to the capital budget and to the operating and
administrative budget since the 2019 Adopted Budget went into effect.
DISCUSSION
Overview of the 2019 Budget Amendment
The total proposed appropriation for the 2019 Amended Budget and the changes from the 2019
Adopted Budget are summarized in the first set of tables below.
The 2019 Amended Budget appropriation includes the amounts in the Amended Budget column below

2019 Operating Expense Adjustments
The operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment reflects a decrease
of $12.1 million from the 2019 Adopted Budget to $743.3 million. This change consists of a decrease
of $7.6 million on the Base System, a decrease of $27.3 million in FasTracks Project/Construction, and
an increase of $22.8 million in FasTracks Operations.
Of the $7.6 million decrease for the Base System, budget reductions of $13.6 million were made,
consisting of intentional reductions by departments in various line items in order to balance the MTFP
and expense carryforward reductions, offset by previously approved transfers and amended budget
increases. Increases to the amended budget consist primarily of $0.8 million for increased processing
fees for mobile ticketing associated with increased mobile ticketing sales, $0.6 million for audits of IT
licenses, $0.5 million for rail repair at 16th & Stout and 16th & California due to ground settling under the
active rail traffic, $0.4 million additional funding for repair of pavers on 16th Street Mall due to harsh
weather, $0.4 million increased cost of custodial and snow removal contracts for SERE and R Line (to be
allocated to FasTracks), $0.4 million for new contracted rate for armed security, $0.2 million for a cost
increase for continuing same level of snow removal for 2019, and $1.2 million to replenish the $5.0
million contingency fund.
For FasTracks Project, the $27.3 million decrease consists of corrections for duplicate carryforward in
launch marketing, misalignment in modeling and operational analysis funds, reductions and/or
realignment in capitalized salaries, adjustments to project budgets, as well as transfer of the FasTracks
service increase funds from FasTracks Project to FasTracks Operations.
For FasTracks Operations, the $22.8 million increase consists primarily of restored funding for 2018
underspend in the North Metro project, and transfer of the FasTracks service increase funds from
FasTracks Project to FasTracks Operations.
Major changes in Amended Budget operating expenses are summarized by department below (summary
excludes previously approved transfers and expense projects carry-forward unless noted), shown in
detail on the attached Amendment A.

Non-Departmental
Increase of $0.5 million for true-up of cost allocation from Base System to FasTracks, offset by increase
of $18.9 million to transfer FasTracks service allocation (from Base System) from FT Project to FT
Operations
Debt Service
On the Base System, budgeted interest expense will remain unchanged from the Adopted Budget. Debt
principal payments also will not change. This is due to the absence of debt refundings/issuances since
the Adopted Budget. Capitalized interest also is expected to show no change. On FasTracks, interest
expense is budgeted to remain unchanged from the Adopted Budget and debt principal payments will not
change. Capitalized interest also is expected to remain the same. No new financing will be issued
during the remainder of 2019 for either Base System or FasTracks.
2019 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed amended budget totals $92.6 million, consisting of $51.2
million for Base System and $41.4 million for FasTracks. The combined increase over the 2019
Adopted Budget new capital is $2.6 million. These changes result from program changes that have
occurred since the 2019 Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
Base System
Total new capital is $51.2 million for the Base System. New capital changes for Base System result in a
net increase of $0.9 million to new capital from the Adopted Budget. This adjustment to new capital
funding since the 2019 Adopted Budget is funding for an upgrade to the existing visual messaging
system and public announcement system at Mariposa Light Rail Division to address cybersecurity and
safety requirements. Please see Attachment B for detail and Program Capital attached.
FasTracks
Total new capital is $41.4 million for FasTracks (Project). New capital changes for FasTracks result in a
net increase of $1.8 million to new capital from the Adopted Budget. This results from updated project
schedules for current projects that changed the projected expenditures in 2019 and changes in cost
estimates (SERE, North Metro). Please see Attachment B for detail and Program Capital attached.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2019 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/18 were used to compute the
estimate of the capital projects carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of
the adoption of the annual budget. For the 2019 Amended Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as
of 12/31/18 were used to compute the estimate of the carryforward. This takes into account
expenditures that were made in the last quarter of 2018.

Packet Pg. 10

1.B.1

Previously approved capital to be carried forward is $579.5 million, a decrease of $140.0 million from
the 2019 Adopted Budget carryforward to reflect fourth quarter 2018 actual expenditures, transfers to
reclassify certain capital projects as expense projects and vice versa, previously approved transfers,
project scope changes, deferrals to 2020, and completion of projects. Of the carryforward amount, the
Base System portion is $98.7 million and the FasTracks portion is $480.8 million. Major capital
carryforward projects are 16th Street Mall Paver Repair, Colfax Avenue Transit Priority Project, purchase
of 27 LRVs, North Metro rail construction, and close-out for East Corridor, SERE, Northwest Rail, R and
Gold Line. Please see Attachment C for detail and Program Capital attached.
Revenue Changes
In the Amended Budget, revenues are projected to decrease $18.0 million on a combined basis from the
2019 Adopted Budget.









Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $5.9 million from the 2019 Adopted
Budget based on the CU-Leeds School March 2019 forecast. The 2019 Amended Budget
incorporates the baseline forecast of 4.4% over 2018 sales/use tax revenue. The 2019 Adopted
Budget used the CU-Leeds September 2018 baseline forecast which called for a 5.6% increase
over the then projected 2018 level.
On a combined basis, grant revenues including operating grants, capital grants, capital
maintenance, FASTER grants, STAMPS and CMAQ grants are projected to decline $12.3 million
from amounts in the 2019 Adopted Budget. On the Base System, grant revenue is projected to
decrease $7.8 million from decreases in CMAQ Funding, 5339 Bus funding, fixed guideway
SOGR 5337 funding, Stamps and FASTER grants, offset by increases in 5307 capital
maintenance grants. For FasTracks, grants are budgeted to decrease $4.4 million due to
decreases in Stamps grants and lower carryforward on SERE grants, offset by increases in CMAQ
grants.
o Contributed capital (not shown in the table above) is projected to decrease $28.8 million
due to reductions in third-party betterments and project contributions on the R Line and
Eagle project.
Farebox revenue is budgeted to remain unchanged in the 2019 Amended Budget for both Base
System and FasTracks. We will revise our estimates in the 2020 budget based on more months
of actual data. Of projected fare revenue of $163.6 million, $125.3 million is attributed to the
Base System and $38.3 million is attributed to FasTracks (Operations). Fare revenue is
forecasted on the basis of a fare change proposal presented by staff in September 2018 and
adopted by the Board. A fare model is being used to estimate and allocate fare revenue between
Base and FasTracks and within FasTracks service corridors, and which takes into account
ridership decline. Using this model, in 2019 a higher proportionate amount of fare revenue is
allocated to FasTracks and a lower amount is allocated to Base System than in previous periods.
Investment income is budgeted unchanged from the 2019 Adopted Budget.
Other income is budgeted slightly higher from the 2019 Adopted Budget. Miscellaneous amounts
are reallocated from Base System to FasTracks.

Although the primary sources of revenue are budgeted to remain flat or decline, other sources of funding
are anticipated to materialize or have done so to support the budgeted increases in operating expenses.
These include: 1) reduction in both capital and expense carryforward from the adopted budget, 2) offset
of requested amended budget items with unused funds elsewhere in departmental budgets, 3) release of
unspent funds from closure of capital projects, 4) intentional reduction to 2019 budgeted operating
expenses, 5) deferral of expenditures post-2019, and 6) use of contingency fund. Capital expenditures

Packet Pg. 11

1.B.1

(on-going and carry-forward) in 2019 will be funded by previously issued debt proceeds and previously
identified project funding.
Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance
The combined Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to decrease $38.9 million from the
Adopted Budget to $19.3 million reflecting the funding sources and uses described above, net of
amended budget revisions to both revenue and expenses, replenishment of the operating reserve fund,
and increases to reserves per fund balance policy. More importantly, the unrestricted year-end fund
balance for the Base System is restated on a cash basis in the amended budget (and going forward) to
match the cash basis unrestricted year-end fund balance in the Base System MTFP.
FasTracks Project Reserves
The proposed 2019 Amended Budget reflects maintenance of the FasTracks Management Reserve
(formerly contingency reserve) at a balance of $0.9 million. This reserve is appropriated annually, and
its purpose is to allow the District to accommodate minor changes to the FasTracks schedule without
requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from the FasTracks Internal Savings Account. The
FasTracks Internal Savings Account is budgeted at $84.9 million. These project reserve balances remain
unchanged from the 2019 Adopted Budget.
Budget Transfers
The proposed 2019 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and amended most recently on 4/1/10. The
policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000 require prior
approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2019 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.
Fund Balance Policy
The proposed 2019 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2019 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, Unrestricted Year-End Fund, and
Unrestricted Operating Fund (Base System only) in the District's working capital. The objective is for the
total of these funds excluding the Capital Acquisition Fund to equal approximately three months of
operating expenses excluding depreciation for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks
Project and FasTracks Operations). On the Base System, this objective is not expected to be met in the
2019 Amended Budget.

Packet Pg. 12

1.B.1

Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of debt principal are
treated as expenditures, (2) asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included, (3)
depreciation, gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the non-cash portion of longterm unfunded pension accruals are excluded from appropriation.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2019 to amend and appropriate funds for the proposed 2019
Amended Budget, to decrease the appropriation by $49.1 million to $1.267 billion, and to decrease
the appropriation of Capital Carryforward (previously approved capital funds) by $140.0 million to
$579.5 million as detailed above in the Discussion section of this report.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2019 Adopted Budget and amend the
budget with revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2019 Adopted Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2019 Adopted

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

July 2, 2019

Subject:

Approval of 1st Amendment to the Salaried
Defined Contribution Plan

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: July 2, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the First Amendment to the RTD Salaried Employee’s Defined Contribution (DC) Plan effective
January 1, 2014.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
The RTD Salaried Employee’s DC plan currently has the following provisions. If an employee
(Participant) is not yet vested and leaves RTD service, then they have five (5) years to return before they
are considered to have a permanent break in service. In addition, during that five (5) year period of time,
the Trust holds those funds in a suspense account in the event that the Participant returns within that
five (5) year period of time. The Trust cannot access those funds during that period of time. The
modifications outlined below would change the definition of “Permanent Break in Service” for those
employed on or after August 1, 2019 to one year, allowing the Trust to access the Participant’s account
balance within one year of termination of employment. Further, the modifications allow the Trust to
access the suspense account of those that began participating in the Plan and Trust prior to August 1,
2019 and terminate their employment with RTD before becoming 100% vested in their account balance.
In addition, if a Participant begins their participation on or after August 1, 2019, and has incurred a
Permanent Break in Service is re-employed by the employer, the Participant shall not be credited with
any Year of Service with respect to his or her prior service.
DISCUSSION
This amendment does several things:
 It modifies that definition of “Permanent Break in Service” from five (5) consecutive One-Year
Breaks in Service to a One-Year break in service for those Participants beginning their
participation in the plan on or after August 1, 2019.
 If the Participant has a “Permanent Break in Service” as defined above, the balance of the
Participant’s account will be forfeited.
 If the Participant returns to RTD after a “Permanent Break in Service” as defined above, the
Participant will not be credited any years of service with respect to his/her previous service.
 Allows the Trust to access the suspense account of those that began participating in the Plan and
Trust prior to August 1, 2019 and terminate their employment with RTD before or after August
1, 2019, before becoming 100% vested in their account balance.
o If the Participant returns before the five (5) years from their termination as an employee,
RTD will restore their suspense account.

Packet Pg. 34

1.B.2



Eliminate obsolete language regarding previous General Managers.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
This would have a positive financial impact on RTD and the Trust as it would allow access to funds that
were previously tied up for long periods of time. As of 12/31/18, the Trust is currently holding
$897,197 in a suspense account for Participants that have left RTD prior to the five (5) year vesting
period and have not yet returned to RTD. Forfeited funds may be used to offset RTD contributions to
the 401(a) which frees up funds for other purposes.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Recommended Action: It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
that the Board of Directors adopt the First Amendment to the RTD Salaried Employee’s Defined
Contribution Plan effective January 1, 2014.
2. Don’t pass the amendment. The current process would remain the same.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,

Date:

July 2, 2019

Subject:

Ridership Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: July 2, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: July 9, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND
At the April meeting of the Financial Administration & Audit Committee, staff presented year-to-date
light rail ridership statistics through February 2019 as part of the February 2019 Monthly Financial
Status Report. Staff indicated that the light rail ridership numbers were showing significant yearover-year decreases, and that staff were not comfortable with those numbers without further
analysis of their causes and validity. This presentation is the result of this analysis.
DISCUSSION
Through the end of May, revenue service ridership for 2019 is down 1.8% from the same period in
2018. While ridership has increased on fixed route bus, commuter rail, and the Flatiron Flyer,
ridership on light rail has decreased by 13.7% from 2018 levels. The decreased ridership on light
rail is occurring across all routes, and does not appear to be limited to specific times of day or
geographic areas. Staff first looked at the data collection and similar information collected from
other sources to confirm the validity of the reporting, and proceeded from there to try to identify
reasons for the changes.
Validation of Reported Data
This effort focused on identifying potential issues with the automatic passenger counter (APC)
equipment and looking at similar information collected from other data sources to determine if the
light rail passenger counts were reasonable.


As part of the FTA-required certification of APC equipment, RTD must take a sample of APCequipped cars and demonstrate that the APC counts are within 5% of human counts. RTD
has met this requirement so far.



Staff looked at three other sources of related information to look for similar trends:
o Year-to-date tap counts for Smartcard
o Year-to-date sales at ticket vending machines
o First quarter usage at Park-n-Rides
Data from all three sources showed significant decreases at light rail stations when compared
to the same time period in 2018.

Based on the information collected to date, the light rail passenger counts appear to be reasonable,
and there appears to be a significant decrease in light rail ridership.
Potential Reasons for Changes

Packet Pg. 57

1.C.2

This effort focused on looking at factors within and outside RTD’s control that could affect light rail
ridership, and would be expected to have a greater impact on light rail than on other modes.


There has been no decrease in student enrollment at the Auraria campus.



Staff looked at the average trip length to see whether there was a noticeable change, which
could mean that certain types of trips were more adversely impacted than others. However,
the average trip length had not changed.



The customer satisfaction survey completed in March 2019 showed that customers
considered on-time performance and value for the fare paid as the most important factors in
their rating of the quality of RTD services. Average ratings for on-time performance and value
received for fare paid have dropped since 2017.

Note: % reflects the percentage of respondents that rated an item as a 4 or 5



We are looking at the impacts of reduced seating on the trains as a result of ADA retrofit.
RTD has completed 141 trains or 82% of the fleet. All new trains are being received with the
new seat configuration.

Next Steps


Staff will continue to monitor ridership and on-time performance trends for light rail.



Staff will continue to perform analysis of the APC equipment to identify and correct any
maintenance issues that could affect the accuracy of reporting.

Staff will continue to perform side-by-side comparisons of APC and human counts to ensure that
RTD is meeting the performance standard required by FTA.

(1) Variance is due to lower parts and supplies and timing of invoices for purchased transportation and fuel
(2) Variance is due to lower labor, repair parts and purchased transportation mainly from timing of rail line openings.
(3) Variance is due to projects budgeted at beginning of year but now expected to start later.
(4) Variance is due to project invoices for contract maintenance budgeted earlier in the year than actual and lower compensation
(5) Variance is due to lower outside security services costs invoice timing
(6) Variance is due primarily to outside counsel costs related to litigation
(7) Variance is due to timing of outstide IT services costs for projects
(8) Variance is due to timing of outside printing costs for schedules and other outside services
(9) Variance due to purchasing card costs that initially get coded to this cost center until they can be coded to each cost center where they were incurred

Board Meeting Date: July 9, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND
RTD commits to reviewing its Fare Structure and Fare Programs every three years to determine if any
additions or changes are required to provide the best options for RTD ridership and meet RTD’s
revenue targets. Over 20 months ending in mid-2018, the Pass Program Working Group and RTD staff
reviewed all fares and fare programs to define potential fare changes and improvements. RTD staff
presented a recommendation to the RTD Board of Directors and received approval mid-September
2018. The goal of this project is to implement changes to the RTD Fares and Fare Structure, as well as
changes and additions to the Fare Programs, as approved by the RTD Board of Directors.
DISCUSSION
The January 2019 fare changes were implemented as scheduled. We are now focusing on the
development and launch of LiVE, the income-based fare discount program.
RTD is working with the State’s Office of Information Technology (OIT) to implement a program for
evaluating RTD riders’ eligibility for the LiVE Program using the State’s public benefits application
system, PEAK. RTD staff has been meeting with employees from various departments and OIT for
several months.
RTD is also working with Denver Human Services (DHS) to provide customer service to LiVE Program
applicants and perform certain income eligibility verification procedures.
The following have been completed:
 The Business Requirements Document (BRD) with OIT has been finalized. The BRD provides the
requirements necessary for OIT to develop the RTD application within the PEAK system.
 The MyRide LiVE card design and final proofs have gone to the smart card vendor for production.
 The technical design document for the development of the LiVE Program application in PEAK has
been completed.
 The Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between RTD and OIT has been finalized and signed by
both parties.
 The contract with Denver Human Services has been signed by RTD and submitted for approval
with the City and County of Denver.
 A request for quotes for a vendor to produce and mail LiVE ID cards has been issued by
Procurement.
 The order for LiVE 10-ride ticketbooks for organizations currently in the Nonprofit Program has
been placed and tickets have been received.
 RTD contractors and/or staff are working to make the necessary changes to the smart card

system, mobile ticketing, ticket vending machines and bus printers.
The eligibility card database has been completed.
The eligibility card interface from OIT to RTD has been completed.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) of the customer-facing PEAK application has been completed.

Next Steps:
 PEAK go-live confirmation by the State. Go-live is the date that we can start accepting
applications in the PEAK system.
 The City and County of Denver must approve the contract between DHS and RTD for LiVE
Program income validation and customer service functions related to applications.
 Issue contract for the production of LiVE ID cards.
 Finalize contingency planning for eligibility card printing in the interim.
 Finalize plans to provide customer service to LiVE Program participants regarding the program and
LiVE eligibility cards.
 Roll out the integrated marketing, communication and outreach plan for the implementation of the
LiVE Program and the related changes to the Nonprofit Program.
 Finalize and distribute informational materials.
2019 Approved Changes Summary:
 Cash Fare: $3 Local / $5.25 Regional / $10.50 Airport.
 3-Hour Pass: These fares allow riders to travel for three hours in any direction. This change
replaces the three-hour one-way transfer or ticket.
 Retain ticket book and MyRide discount with modifications. (Riders purchasing a 10-ride ticket
book or paying with a MyRide smart card will receive a discount.)
 The youth discount has increased from 50 percent to 70 percent and is solely age-based (ages
6-19).
 EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass are now being priced based upon trips taken.
 EcoPass: Other updates to pricing are based on changes in service levels and employer
categories.
 FlexPass: Program discount has been discontinued. Employers and employees pay regular
monthly pass price.
 New income-based fare discount program (targeting summer 2019)

Funding Scenarios – Concept 1
1) No New Bonding Authority or Funding
• Certificates of Participation (COPs) used to fund replacement of
vehicles
• Scenario 1a sequences Unfinished Corridors starting with least
expensive corridor first in order to accelerate as many projects as
possible (C 2039, SW 2040, NM 2041)

2050 horizon

• Scenario 1b sequences the NWR Peak Service first in 2042; no other
corridor complete by 2050 horizon

This initial report has been prepared by RTD staff as the first of a proposed series of detailed
responses to the RTD Board of Directors’ Resolution Number 004, Series of 2019, adopted on
April 16, 2019, addressing this agency’s continuing commitment to complete FasTracks and to
explore the construction and operation of a Peak Service Plan in the Northwest Corridor. A copy
of that Resolution is attached as Appendix A. That Resolution identifies four corridors and
extensions that have not been completed as of this date, nor have funds for their completion
been identified or committed: 1) the Northwest Corridor from Westminster to Longmont; 2) the
North Metro Corridor from 124th Avenue to State Highway 7; 3) the Central Corridor Extension
from 30th and Downing to 38th and Blake; and 4) the Southwest Corridor Extension from Mineral
to C-470 and Lucent. Collectively, these projects were identified as the “Unfinished Corridors” in

AF
T

the Board Resolution.
The April 16, 2019 Board Resolution directs “RTD staff to investigate and research all
reasonable cost-saving measures for construction and operation of the Unfinished Corridors and
creative funding mechanisms for the same as expeditiously as reasonably possible, with a
report to the Board . . . outlining proposed steps to appropriately move forward on these
Unfinished Corridors.” Additionally, that Resolution directs RTD staff to report to the Board

R

“outlining proposed steps appropriately moving forward on the [Peak Service] Plan.” (Appendix
A, April 16, 2019 Resolution, paragraphs 1 and 2.)

D

The ideas, opportunities and approaches presented in this report are draft and illustrative,
laying out options for the RTD Board to consider and to facilitate constructive dialogue with the
voters, taxpayers and stakeholders throughout the region. The most promising of these can be
further refined and pursued. As indicated above, this is the initial report to the Board regarding
these matters. As directed, this report identifies proposed steps to be taken in order to
accomplish the will of the Board. Over time, following the collaborative communications that will
take place, especially with the Board, RTD staff will refine these steps in order to present
further reports addressing “reasonable cost-savings measures for construction and operation of
the Unfinished Corridors and creative funding mechanisms for the same as expeditiously as
reasonably possible,” and “will proceed in a commercially reasonable manner to explore,
analyze, fund and facilitate construction and operation of the Peak Service Plan.” (Appendix A,
April 16, 2019 Resolution, paragraphs 1 and 2.)
The Board should note that the sales and use tax forecasts used in preparing the financial
scenarios in this report are based on the latest CU Leeds School of Business forecasts, and will

change as future updates are prepared for RTD. Similarly, the financial scenarios are subject to
change with Board adoption later this year of a new RTD Mid-Term Financial Plan, Long-Range

Financial Plan and Budget. Also, as further explained in the FasTracks Funding Scenarios section
of this report, the Base System unrestricted fund balance under all scenarios presented is
negative between the years 2021 and 2049. Other key inputs such as capital and O&M costs
are estimates and also subject to change. Of particular note, for the purpose of the Northwest
Rail Peak Service Plan, RTD has updated the order-of-magnitude capital cost estimates using an
approach that we believe is conservative, however, as described in the Northwest Rail Peak
Service Plan section of this report, these order-of-magnitude estimates have not been provided
by, nor reviewed by, the BNSF railroad.
The June 2018 “FasTracks Program Overview – Executive Summary” (included as Appendix B)
provides: an overview of the Program; a brief history of progress, challenges and key decision-

AF
T

points; a summary of the current status; and a financial overview. That document provides
detail on the variety of factors that impacted the FasTracks Program in the years between voter
approval in 2004 and today, including those highlighted in the Board Resolution: “(a) the
requirement that new technology, including Positive Train Control and new signal systems and
commuter rail cars, be employed; (b) the decision that all but one of the trains be electricpowered rather than diesel-powered; (c) additional EIS and local government drainage and
traffic requirements; (d) an increase in right-of-way acquisition costs; (e) significantly increased
costs for construction materials; and (f) the great recession of 2008-2009” (Appendix A, April

R

16, 2019 Resolution, sixth Whereas clause.)

To repeat, this will be an iterative process. This initial report is intended to provide an overview

D

of the issues, a background and history of the FasTracks project, an assessment of the current
situation, a series of possible funding scenarios, a discussion of creative funding options, and
supporting Appendices. With the benefit of Board consideration and further input, RTD staff will
continue in the refinement of these proposed steps and will regularly report back to the Board
for information, guidance and approval.

The 2004 FasTracks Plan (Appendix C) and ballot language (Appendix D) included more than
the construction of the completed rapid transit corridors and the Unfinished Corridors.
Regarding the use of the sales and use tax increase and the bond proceeds the ballot language
states: “…to be used and spent for the construction and operation of a fixed guide way mass
transit system, the construction of additional park-n-ride lots, the expansion and improvement
of existing park-n-ride lots, and increased bus service ” (emphasis added).
To implement the increased bus service component, the adopted FasTracks Plan included the
following enhancements: “Bus Feeder Service to Rapid Transit”; and “Suburb to Suburb
Service”. Funding for these Base System service increases was included in the 2004 FasTracks

AF
T

financial plan. Consistent with that financial plan, in January 2006, RTD began a financial
contribution from FasTracks to the Base System bus services equivalent to 1% of total bus
service hours each year, anticipated to continue through 2020. The intent was that the
contribution would increase starting in 2021 to 1½ % per year through 2025.
On December 18, 2012, the RTD Board of Director’s voted to fund the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA) in part by capping future enhanced bus service to 2013 levels plus

R

inflation (CPI). Between 2006 and 2013, prior to the FISA action, $73.5 million in total was
contributed for this service. It is estimated that between 2014 and 2025, $396 million in total
would have been used for enhanced bus service without the FISA action. In the absence of
change in the FISA policy, $230 million will have been provided for this enhanced bus service by

D

2025. The difference of $166 million will have instead been redirected to the FISA.
The 2019 Adopted Budget includes a FISA contribution of $13.4 million in 2019 based on this
bus service cap. This funding equates to approximately 133,000 revenue service hours. For
comparison this is approximately equivalent to the current service levels of: the routes 15 and
16; OR the routes 73, 76, 88, 100, 128 and 130.
By 2025, the contribution to the FISA is estimated to increase to $21.7 million. This funding
equates to approximately 185,000 revenue service hours. For comparison, this is approximately
equivalent to the 2019 service levels of: the routes 15, 16 and 31; OR the routes 73, 76, 88, 92,
100, 120, 128, 130, and 169; OR all local service in Boulder.
The following table provides FasTracks Program costs through 2020, including those expended
through 2018 and the total capital costs committed through 2020, the year service is scheduled
to start on the North Metro line to 124th Avenue, the final corridor for which to date funding has
been identified.

Southwest Extension
The Southwest Extension is a 2.5-mile double track LRT project that would extend the C and D
lines from the existing Mineral Station to a new station with a 1,000-space Park-n-Ride lot. The
additional station will be located near the C-470 & Lucent Blvd. intersection in Highlands Ranch.

An Environmental Evaluation (EE) was completed for the Southwest Extension in March of 2010
and the RTD Board adopted the mitigation measures from the EE. Limited activity on this
project is currently underway; the District recently made a financial contribution to access

of Englewood. Environmental review is largely complete for the project, and engineering design
reached approximately 30 percent. Moving the project forward will require identification of
operating and capital cost funding as shown in the table above.
North Metro Completion
The entire North Metro project envisioned in the FasTracks Plan consists of an 18-mile Electric
Multiple Unit (EMU) corridor going from DUS to SH 7/162nd Avenue. The majority of the
corridor is single track with passing locations in five areas along the corridor. The initial
operating line, from DUS to 124th/Eastlake, is anticipated to begin revenue service in 2020. The
project will utilize the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF) at 41st and Fox Street, which

AF
T

will be shared with NWES, the Gold Line and the East Corridor with Denver Transit Partners
maintaining the vehicles and RTD responsible for operations, right-of-way maintenance and
associated operational functions. The project will also share the substations (at Argo---Gold Line
and Sandown—East Corridor) with the EAGLE project.

The first phase of the project terminates at the 124th/Eastlake Station. Completion of the
project north of 124th Avenue as envisioned in the FasTracks Plan will result in additional
stations at 144th and SH 7/162nd. Design work for this future segment was completed up to the

R

30 percent level; additional environmental review and mitigations will also be necessary. Moving
this project forward will require identification of operating and capital cost funding as shown in

D

the table above.

Central Rail Extension

The project, as currently proposed, consists of in-street running LRT connecting the existing L
Line light rail service at 30th and Downing with the 38th and Blake Station on the University of
Colorado A Line (approximately 0.8 mile). Two new stations would be constructed at
33rd/Downing and 35th/Downing. Now referred to as the L Line Extension, the project would
provide rail service between downtown Denver and the 38th & Blake Station, and complete the
“loop” around downtown.
RTD completed a detailed mobility study for the project in 2014, examining several options.
During the study effort, it became clear that the project as currently proposed – in-street LRT
sharing the travelway with vehicular traffic – would operate unreliably. In fact, staff was unable
to write a schedule for the proposed service due to significantly variable travel times between

Attachment: 2019 FasTracks Unfinished Corridors Report draft 6-14 (002) (3875 : FasTracks Resolution Staff Report)

improvements near the proposed park-n-ride lot at the request of Highlands Ranch and the City

30th/Downing and 38th/Blake.

7

Packet Pg. 118

Based on that analysis, RTD is now working closely with the City and County of Denver as part
of Denver’s downtown transportation planning efforts to define a project that would meet the
intent of the FasTracks plan. When a feasible project is defined – that is, one that would meet
RTD’s service standards for reliability and on-time performance – identification of operating and
capital costs funding, likely in the range shown on the table above, would need to be identified.
Northwest Rail
In order to ready the Northwest Rail (NWR) corridor for final design and construction, RTD
completed an Environmental Evaluation (EE) in 2010. Operational analysis conducted during the
EE found that the maximum service that could be provided, given capacity constraints at
Denver Union Station, would be 30-minute frequencies. The EE recommended 30-minute peak

AF
T

service and one-hour off-peak service, which would provide 55 one-way trips per day. The EE
estimated the corridor cost at approximately $1 billion in inflated (year of expenditure) dollars
depending on how many stations were included in the corridor, as identified below.
The original FasTracks plan assumed eight stations, including Denver Union Station, as follows:
Longmont

•

Gunbarrel, Boulder

•

Boulder Junction

•

Downtown Louisville

•

Flatiron, Broomfield

•

Church Ranch, Westminster

•

Westminster Station

•

During the EE process, local stakeholders requested four additional stations for the corridor as
follows:
•

•

East Boulder at 63rd and Arapahoe

•

116th Avenue, Broomfield

•

88th Avenue, Westminster

It is informative to understand that the NWR corridor envisions passenger operations on track
that would be shared with the BNSF, which would continue to operate freight traffic in and
through the corridor. This shared track arrangement will require the use of passenger trains
that are compliant with the Federal Railroad Administration’s crash-worthiness standards. It also
means that RTD will need to continue to closely coordinate with the BNSF and to pay the
railroad for access and improvements to their infrastructure (tracks, signals, PTC, Quiet Zones
etc.).
To this end, RTD and BNSF have been working together on this project for over 15 years.
Beginning in 2003 the parties finalized a Letter of Understanding followed by a Memorandum of

AF
T

Understating (MOU) in 2009 and a Contract Agreement in 2010. Through the Contract
Agreement RTD paid BNSF $86 million for the right-of-way and relocations in the segment from
Union Station to Pecos Street, and $9 million for the segment from Pecos to 72ndAvenue
(Westminster Station). The Contract Agreement included NWR Segment 1 from Union Station to
the Westminster Station. The completion of this contract allowed the Eagle P3 project to
proceed, including construction of the B line from Denver Union Station to the Westminster
Station. Additionally, in 2011, RTD paid BNSF $650,000 through a Planning and Support
Agreement to prepare 30% design plans and evaluate operating assumptions for Segment 2

R

(Westminster Station to Longmont) based on two operating scenarios provided by RTD as
follows:
Scenario 1: Peak-Only Service, 18 trips per day, bi-directional service, 20-minute peak
period/peak direction headways, DUS to Longmont, no weekend service;

•

Scenario 2: Opening Day Service, 55 trips per day, bi-directional service, 30-minute peak

D

•

headways/60-minute off-peak headways, weekdays, DUS to Longmont, hourly service
on weekends.
Capital Costs provided by the BNSF as part of this work included upfront costs for purchasing
operating time slots in perpetuity, including double tracking the entire corridor, but not annual
Operating and Maintenance (O&M) costs.
The BNSF cost estimates were as follows:
•

Scenario 1:

$410 million capital (2011 dollars, unescalated)

•

Scenario 2:

$535 million capital (2011 dollars, unescalated)

The BNSF cost estimate did not include costs for items assigned to RTD, such as stations, Parkn-Rides, and vehicles. Based on the costs from the BNSF and the items assigned to RTD, the
2012 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) estimated the total corridor cost to be $1.035 billion
(2011 dollars). The high-level breakdown was as follows:
•

BNSF corridor improvements: $535 million

•

RTD corridor improvements: $314 million

•

RTD Stations and Park-and-Rides: $129 million

•

B), RTD, in collaboration with the Northwest area stakeholders, completed the Northwest Area
Mobility Study (NAMS) in August 2014. The intent of NAMS was to examine several key items in
the Study area. Three of those areas of analysis were directly related to the NWR corridor and
the findings from the final report found the following:

R

1. Confirm the cost to complete the Northwest Rail:

The cost to complete the NWR corridor from Westminster to Longmont ranged from $1.2 to

D

$1.4 billion (2013 dollars). This estimate was consistent with previous cost estimates.
2. Evaluate feasibility and cost of constructing the Northwest Rail in segments:
The study evaluated the possibility of operational/service and construction phasing options
along the Northwest Rail Line from the current terminus of the B line at Westminster Station
to Longmont. Phasing segments that were evaluated included:
•

116th St/Broomfield

•

Louisville

•

Boulder Transit Village

•

Downtown Longmont

These segments were selected based on a careful examination of technical considerations
including an understanding of BNSF operational requirements to co-exist in this corridor.

1.C.5.b

The phases outlined were reasonable segments for building the NW Rail project at some

10

Packet Pg. 121

point in the future. BNSF, while not an active participant in the study, did provide a list of
conditions for their further engagement in regard to allowing for the necessary rail
infrastructure construction and agreements which would allow RTD to provide commuter
rail service on the BNSF alignment to Longmont. The operating plan for this phasing
analysis assumed a 30 minute peak and 60 minute off-peak service plan.
The phasing considerations included avoiding grades greater than 1% and avoiding
impacts to BNSF, including accommodating their need to have 10,000 feet of “chambering”
or storage track at the end of the phased segment of commuter rail.
Along with the phasing considerations, RTD also conducted a funding analysis to determine

AF
T

the availability of FasTracks revenue to support a phased build-out of the corridor. The
analysis indicated that while phasing could provide incremental buildout of the corridor,
any FasTracks funding would still be beyond the 2035 timeframe. The Northwest Area
stakeholders and RTD, after careful consideration of study results, determined that given
the funding challenges and accompanying near-term inability to secure a railroad
agreement, the completion of the Northwest Rail was no longer a viable near-term goal for
the corridor. The costs, ridership, annual cost per trip and travel time for each segment
from NAMS are summarized in the table below:

3. Evaluate potential alternative routes as an alternate alignment (such as via extending North
Metro Line) to serve Longmont with rail service:
NAMS stated that reaching Longmont via an extension of the North Metro Corridor along the
Union Pacific Boulder Branch was not viable for a variety of reasons. The alignment would
not be cost-effective for the minimal projected ridership; Broomfield, Louisville and Boulder
would not be served by this alignment; and, the alignment was not in the original FasTracks
plan. Furthermore, the proposed alignments contained segments outside the District
boundary.
As part of NAMS, the stakeholders developed a Consensus Statement for prioritizing future
activities in the Northwest area. One request from the stakeholders was for RTD to provide

Peak Service Plan

AF
T

an annual update on the status of the Northwest Rail and any activities that have occurred
to advance the rail forward. On May 22, 2014, the Board approved Resolution No. 006,
which accepted the stakeholder Consensus Statement for prioritization of future activities in
the Northwest area, subject to future Board consideration.

In 2017, acknowledging the NAMS findings that the potential to phase service by segment is

R

not financially viable in the near-term, the local jurisdictional stakeholders requested that
RTD evaluate a limited, starter commuter service so as to reduce potential capital costs as
much as possible. In response, working closely with the local jurisdictional stakeholders,

D

RTD has developed a potential starter commuter service plan for the corridor – the Peak
Service Plan. The proposed service would be as follows:
•

Three trains from Longmont to Denver during the morning peak period; and

•

Three trains from Denver to Longmont during the afternoon peak period.

Stations would be provided at the following locations:
•

Downtown Longmont (1st and Main)

•

Boulder Junction

•

Downtown Louisville

•

Flatiron (Broomfield)

•

Broomfield (116th Avenue)

•

88th Avenue (Westminster)

•

Westminster (currently in operation as the B-Line terminus)

•

Union Station (currently in operation for the B-Line)

1.C.5.b

Packet Pg. 123

The projected travel time from Longmont to Union Station would be approximately 66
minutes. The estimated 2040 weekday daily ridership would be 1,400 riders.
In support of this report, RTD has also updated the order-of-magnitude capital cost
estimates for the NWR Peak Service Plan using an approach that we believe is conservative.
These updated cost estimates are based on actual commuter rail cost experience for the
Eagle and North Metro projects and on the cost information provided by BNSF through the
2011 work described in this report (which is substantially different from the current NWR
Peak Service Plan). These order-of-magnitude estimates have not been provided by, nor
reviewed by, the BNSF railroad. The NWR Peak Service Plan capital cost estimate is $708.2

AF
T

million (2018 dollars).
RTD has also estimated that the incremental cost for completing the full NWR corridor (at a
date subsequent to the initiation of NWR Peak Service Plan) to provide the full level of
service identified in the 2010 Environmental Evaluation (55 trips/day) would be
approximately $871 million (2018 dollars). The total capital cost estimate for first instituting
NWR Peak Service and then subsequently instituting full NWR service, then, is $1.579 billion

R

(2018 dollars), which is higher than the estimated capital cost estimate for constructing the
NWR full service scenario at $1.5 billion (2018 dollars) because of the costs associated with
updating planning, environmental, and engineering work, as well as mobilization and
additional construction costs associated with building the corridor in two phases.

D

RTD’s operating and maintenance cost estimate for the Peak Service Plan scenario is $14
million per year (2018 dollars), while the cost estimate for the NWR full service scenario is
$20.6 million per year (2018 dollars).
Since 2017, RTD has continued to discuss and analyze the NWR Peak Service Plan with
stakeholders to gain a better understanding of the related opportunities and challenges. To
this end, in the summer of 2018, RTD submitted a letter to the BNSF requesting feedback
on the Peak Service Plan. Subsequently, RTD has sent periodic status requests to BNSF and
based on their most recent response, we understand that the railroad is working on a
formal response which will include their feedback on the proposal.

1.C.5.b

Introduction and Modeling Assumptions
RTD annually prepares updated mid-term and long-range financial forecasts for the Base
System and FasTracks. These comprehensive forecasts utilize the latest cost information for
ongoing operations and maintenance, capital commitments, State of Good Repair funding needs
and all related costs needed to maintain service and keep the transit system operational while
meeting the Board of Directors’ priorities. Similarly, the forecasts utilize updated forecasts
regarding all revenue sources, including sales and use tax, farebox, grant revenues and other
sources. Specifically, the sales and use tax revenue forecasts use the latest information (March
2019) provided by the CU Leeds School of Business. These sales and use tax forecasts will
change as future updates are prepared for RTD. Similarly, the financial scenarios are subject to

AF
T

change with Board adoption later this year of a new RTD mid-term Financial Plan, long range
financial plan and 2020 budget. Additionally, other key inputs such as Unfinished Corridor
capital and O&M costs are estimates and also subject to change. As documented in the
previously referenced June 2018 “FasTracks Program Overview – Executive Summary” and in
various financial updates to the RTD Board of Directors and to stakeholders and the public, RTD
does not forecast the capacity to proceed with any FasTracks capital investments in the near to
mid-term horizon. Nothing in the intervening time has changed to improve these forecasts.

R

Recognizing these financial constraints, RTD staff has prepared ten FasTracks funding scenarios
with differing assumptions regarding the timing of delivery of Unfinished Corridor projects and

D

regarding the construct of potential future TABOR elections in support of the preparation of this
report. These scenarios extend the financial planning horizon to the year 2050, consistent with
the horizons for the Transportation Transformation (T2) Comprehensive Plan and DRCOG’s
upcoming Regional Transportation Plan.
The forecasts and conclusions presented in this section focus on the FasTracks financial plan.
The related financial forecasts for the RTD Base System for these scenarios have not been
optimized; however, the Base System unrestricted fund balances under these scenarios is
negative between 2021 and 2049. This means that: 1) no Base System Funds are available to
support funding of FasTracks projects; 2) no Base System Funds are available to loan to
FasTracks projects, even if it where permissible to make such loans; and 3) during this
extended period, there will be no capacity to support Base System bus or rail service increases.
In fact, if the negative balances cannot be resolved, there may be the need to cut levels of Base
System bus and light rail service throughout the District. All scenarios are based on the capital
and annual operating and maintenance costs described previously in this report. All revenue,

cost, bonding and associated projections are stated in inflated (year of expenditure) dollars. All

14

Packet Pg. 125

scenarios also assume ongoing operations and maintenance, including vehicle replacements and
capital maintenance, consistent with expected useful life, of all currently open and committed
FasTracks projects.
Scenarios 1a and 1b: No New Bonding Authority or Funding
These Scenarios assume the existing 2004 FasTracks sales and use tax authorization (0.4%)
and bonding authority with no new or additional FasTracks bonding authority nor any additional
sales and use tax funds. They do assume Certificate of Participation (COP) funding for required
replacement of previously purchased FasTracks vehicles. These scenarios identify if and when
each of the Unfinished Corridors can be opened for operation based on the capital and O&M
cost estimates contained in this report. Neither scenario allows for completion of the Unfinished

AF
T

Corridors by the year 2050.
Scenario 1a sequences the Unfinished Corridors starting with the least expensive corridor first in
order to accelerate as many of the projects as possible. This scenario results in completion of
the Central Extension in 2039, the Southwest Extension in 2040 and the North Metro
Completion in 2041. Under this scenario there is not sufficient funding to finish either the NWR
Peak Service Plan or the NWR Full Service plan by 2050.

R

Scenario 1b sequences the NWR Peak Service Plan first. The earliest that this project could be
opened for service is in the year 2042. No other corridors can be completed within the 2050
horizon under this scenario.

D

Scenarios 2a, 2b and 2c: TABOR election for Additional Bonding
Similar to Scenarios 1a and 1b, these Scenarios assume the existing 2004 FasTracks sales and
use tax authorization (0.4%), but they also assume that a TABOR election is held prior to 2032
authorizing additional bonding authority. Similar to Scenarios 1a and 1b, these Scenarios also
assume Certificate of Participation (COP) funding for required replacement of previously
purchased FasTracks vehicles. These scenarios identify if and when each of the Unfinished
Corridors can be opened for operation based on the capital and O&M cost estimates contained
in this report.
Scenario 2a sequences the Unfinished Corridors starting with the least expensive corridor first in
order to accelerate as many of the projects as possible. This scenario results in completion of
the Central Extension in 2037, the Southwest Extension in 2038, the North Metro Completion in
2039 and the NWR Peak Service Plan in 2048. Under this scenario there is not sufficient funding
to finish the NWR Full Service plan by 2050.

1.C.5.b

Packet Pg. 126

Scenario 2b sequences the NWR Peak Service Plan first. The earliest that this project could be
opened for service is in the year 2042 in this scenario. Under Scenario 2b, the Central Extension
would be opened in 2047, the Southwest Extension would open in 2048 and the North Metro
Completion would be accomplished in 2049. Under this scenario there is not sufficient funding
to finish the NWR Full Service Plan by 2050.
Scenario 2c tests the capacity to finish the NWR Full Service plan given the assumptions
identified. In this case, the NWR Full Service plan corridor could be completed by 2046. Under
this set of assumptions, no other Unfinished Corridor could be completed by the year 2050.

Scenarios 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d and 3e: TABOR election with Bonding and Sales Tax

AF
T

Increase
These Scenarios assume that a TABOR election is held in 2021 authorizing both additional sales
and use tax rates and revenue and additional bonding authority starting in 2022. None of these
Scenarios require Certificate of Participation (COP) funding for required replacement of
previously purchased FasTracks vehicles. All of these scenarios provide for the completion of all
of the Unfinished Corridors prior to the year 2040.
Scenario 3a assumes a 0.1% sales and use tax increase (one-tenth of a penny). It sequences
the NWR Peak Service Plan first, followed by the remaining Unfinished Corridors starting with

R

the least expensive corridor next. It is designed to strike a balance between delivering the
Unfinished Corridors quickly while also minimizing the number and size of debt issuances to
support project delivery. This scenario results in completion of the NWR Peak Service Plan in

D

2026, followed by the Central Extension in 2027, the Southwest Extension in 2032, and the
North Metro Completion in 2035. It also provides for the completion of the NWR Full Service
plan by 2039.

Scenario 3b assumes a 0.1% sales and use tax increase (again, one-tenth of a penny). It
sequences the Unfinished Corridors starting with the least expensive corridor first, finishing with
construction of the NWR Full Service plan. Under this scenario the NWR Peak Service Plan is not
funded with the objective of completing the all Unfinished Corridors in their entirety in an
expeditious manner. This scenario allows completion of the Central Extension in 2026, the
Southwest Extension in 2027, the North Metro Completion in 2028 and the NWR Full Service
Plan in 2032.

Attachment: 2019 FasTracks Unfinished Corridors Report draft 6-14 (002) (3875 : FasTracks Resolution Staff Report)

1.C.5.b

Scenario 3c assumes a 0.1% sales and use tax increase. Scenario 3c is a variation on Scenario
3a where the key distinction is an acceleration of the projects accomplished by issuing more
bonds and assuming more debt. This scenario results in completion of the NWR Peak Service
16

Packet Pg. 127

Plan in 2026, followed by the Central Extension in 2027, the Southwest Extension in 2028, and
the North Metro Completion in 2030. It also provides for the completion of the NWR Full Service
plan by 2037.
Scenario 3d is a variation of Scenario 3b which tests the impact of a higher sales and use tax
increase at 0.15% (less than one-seventh of a penny). This scenario results in completion the
Central Extension in 2026, the Southwest Extension in 2027, and the North Metro Completion in
2028. It also provides for the completion of the NWR Full Service plan by 2032. Similar to
Scenario 3b, under this scenario the NWR Peak Service Plan is not funded with the objective of
completing all the Unfinished Corridors in their entirety in an expeditious manner. This scenario
would also allow funds from the sales and use tax increase to be used to support Base System

AF
T

priorities and needs.
Scenario 3e assumes a 0.1% sales and use tax increase and is another variation of Scenario 3b.
It tests a three year delay in the delivery of each of the Unfinished Corridors, allowing both for
larger FasTracks fund balances and for funds from the sales and use tax increase to be used to
support Base System priorities and needs. It would allow for the opening of the Central
Extension in 2029, the Southwest Extension in 2030, the North Metro Completion in 2031 and
the NWR Full Service plan in 2035.

Funding, Finance, and Revenue Options
In addition to the FasTracks funding scenarios described in the previous section, other
options are also worth considering. This section presents a wide array of these potential
options. For many, either legislative action or an election under the auspices of TABOR
would be required. RTD staff (with contributions from consultants, stakeholders, and
lobbyists) present these to demonstrate the wide variety of tools available, without
attempting to consider the political viability nor the pros and cons.
1. Federal New Starts and Small Starts grants (Capital Investment Grant Program):

AF
T

For a detailed description of the eligibility of the Unfinished Corridors, please see
the section immediately following entitled “Summary of Federal New Starts or
Small Starts Grant Analysis for Unfinished FasTracks Corridors”.
2. Federal loan/finance options: similar to the scenarios described in the previous
sections, all of these would require repayment and TABOR election authorization.
These options include:
TIFIA (Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act): RTD
previously utilized this funding source for the US 36 BRT project.

•

RRIF (Railroad Rehabilitation & Improvement Financing): This funding
source was among those utilized for Denver Union Station.

•

Private activity bonds (originally authorized with the SAFETEA-LU

R

•

D

authorization): These would require a private partner arrangement.

•

Transit GARVEEs (Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles). These are bonds
secured by future transit apportionments, and have been considered by
RTD on previous occasions.

3. Stakeholder Cash Contributions or Loans/Private Equity Contributions or Loans:
with the exception of stakeholder cash contributions, all of these would require
repayment and TABOR election authorization. These options include:
•

Stakeholder Cash Contributions: RTD has previously used this funding
mechanism. Most recently, RTD received a $25 million stakeholder
contribution on the SERE project. RTD has received cash contributions on
other projects but most of the time the contribution is associated with
stakeholder betterments.

19

Attachment: 2019 FasTracks Unfinished Corridors Report draft 6-14 (002) (3875 : FasTracks Resolution Staff Report)

1.C.5.b

Packet Pg. 130

•

Stakeholder or Private Entity Loans: This could be a possible funding
source but requires repayment authority through a TABOR election. If
RTD had borrowing authority, it is likely that RTD could issue tax-exempt
debt at a lower cost than borrowing through stakeholders or private
entities. RTD utilized this financing mechanism in the Eagle project.

•

Private Equity Contributions: The private entity will require repayment
and RTD will need to have borrowing authority and would be subject to a
TABOR election. If RTD had borrowing authority, it is likely that RTD
could issue tax-exempt debt at a lower cost than accepting private equity
contributions. RTD utilized this financing mechanism in the Eagle project.

4. Tolled roadway facilities:
There is precedent to direct toll revenues from a highway corridor that is
parallel to a rail project. One recent example is the Metropolitan
Washington Airports Authority (MWAA), which is funding the construction

AF
T

•

of the Silver Line to Dulles Airport in northern Virginia (for WMATA).
Tolls not predicated on a parallel facility can be directed to fund transit.
One example is the Pennsylvania Turnpike Authority, which issues $400
million in toll-backed bonds each year for transit including SEPTA in
Philadelphia and the Port Authority in Pittsburgh.

•

Congestion pricing in the urban core could potentially be directed to
transit purposes. For example, tolled access to lower Manhattan is slated

R

•

to begin in 2021 with funding directed to MTA. London, Singapore and

D

Stockholm already have congestion pricing in place with funding directed
to transit purposes.

5. VMT (Vehicle Miles Travelled) tax on vehicular travel: this option has been
discussed (typically as an alternative to sales tax) on a statewide level during
previous Colorado transportation funding initiatives, but never placed before
voters for consideration.
6. Parking charges: these would be governed by state legislative restrictions and
RTD policies. Potential locations include:
•

RTD park-and-ride lots. The District completed and presented to the
Board an initial examination of daily parking charges for all users in 2016.
The Transportation Transformation Comprehensive Plan will provide an

Attachment: 2019 FasTracks Unfinished Corridors Report draft 6-14 (002) (3875 : FasTracks Resolution Staff Report)

1.C.5.b

opportunity to revisit this option.

20

Packet Pg. 131

1.C.5.b

Municipal parking garages and streets (outside of RTD jurisdiction). This
has not been previously analyzed by the District.

7. Fees collected on other transportation modes/delivery models:
•

Licensing fees collected from private entities predicated on access to RTD
facilities. This could include transportation network companies and
micromobility providers.

•

Fee collected from private companies traveling to and from Denver
International Airport (DEN already collects fees from these entities).

8. Fees for access to anonymized RTD trip data. The District could explore
monetization of data desired by private entities, while simultaneously providing
user privacy and cybersecurity.

AF
T

9. Property tax (one form of value capture): A special assessment district for value
capture purposes could be established to include commercial properties along a
project corridor. One example is the Dulles corridor, where commercial
properties along the, where commercial properties will generate $750 million to
fund the construction of the Silver Line project.
10. Development impact fees: after establishing boundaries adjacent to a transit

R

corridor, one-time impact fees could be collected on new development to help
find a nearby transit project.

D

11. Marijuana tax: RTD could explore an increased share of revenues collected
within RTD boundaries.
12. State-level transit and rail funds:
•

A potential future physical tie-in between the RTD rail system and a
future statewide passenger rail network could result in funding to
improve or enhance the District’s existing and planned rail infrastructure.

•

CDOT funding: a new statewide funding source, such as a State-wide
ballot measure, could include RTD projects.

13. RTD could explore the sale or lease of air rights over RTD stations. For example,
sale of air rights is a significant revenue source for Union Station in DC.
14. RTD could investigate opportunities to lease rights-of-way to private entities.

21

Attachment: 2019 FasTracks Unfinished Corridors Report draft 6-14 (002) (3875 : FasTracks Resolution Staff Report)

•

Packet Pg. 132

1.C.5.b

Federal-level funding and finance proposals, which were explored, but are not available
•

Investment tax credits (RTD sells to a tax-oriented entity, generating revenue to
RTD).

•

Revive PNRS (Projects of National and Regional Significance) funding program:
These are multi-year grants, distributed either competitively or through
earmarks. DUS received a $50 million earmark under this program in SAFETEALU. LA Metro has publicly proposed revival of PNRS.

•

Earmarks: the next infrastructure/surface transportation authorization bill or FY
2021 (not 2020) appropriations bills could include earmarks. While there is no
law against earmarks, the Senate Republican caucus recently adopted a ban on

AF
T

earmarks.
In conclusion, this section has presented an array of creative funding, finance and
revenue mechanisms – some of which have been successfully utilized by RTD in the
past, and many of which have been explored previously, at least preliminarily. While
some of these present challenging levels of complexity and applicability, RTD staff will
actively continue to seek out and evaluate potential regional funding opportunities. This

D

R

effort will include continuing communication, collaboration and cooperation with the
Metro Mayor’s Caucus, DRCOG, city and county stakeholders and others – all with a view
toward a constructive and productive dialogue designed to implement the Board’s
wishes as stated in the April 16, 2019 Resolution.

Summary of Federal New Starts or Small Starts Grant Analysis for Unfinished
The 2004 financial plan for FasTracks anticipated Federal Capital Investment Grant
Program funding (New Starts) for the following projects:
•

East (University of Colorado A Line);

•

West (W Line); and

•

Gold (G Line)

RTD was successful in receiving New Starts funding for all three projects. In addition,
RTD applied for and received a Small Starts Construction Grant for the Southeast Rail
Extension (SERE) in 2016. Federal funding for SERE was made possible based on (1) the

unprecedented local agency contribution.

At the Board’s request, staff conducted a thorough review of the unfinished FasTracks
corridors to assess the likelihood that these corridors would qualify for Federal New
Starts or Small Starts funding. This exercise, completed in 2016, included a thorough
analysis of FTA project justification criteria (50 percent of overall rating) and local

R

financial commitment criteria (50 percent of overall rating).

FTA rates projects on a five-point scale, from Low to High. You must have at least a
Medium rating for project justification and local financial commitment to qualify for Small

Starts or New Starts. The only project that appeared to meet project justification criteria
was the Central Rail Extension, which received a Medium rating for project justification.
North Metro and Northwest Rail received Low ratings for project justification, and the
Southwest Extension received a Medium-Low project justification rating.
In addition, these four projects would not achieve a Medium financial commitment rating
based on current and anticipated RTD financial projections and forecasts. Significant
RTD and non-RTD sources would need to be committed and budgeted to raise the
financial commitment rating above Low. (Note that SERE received an overall financial
rating of High due to significant non-FTA overmatch by RTD and stakeholders).
At this time, only one remaining FasTracks project, the Central Rail Extension, appears a
possible candidate for FTA funding. The other three would be disqualified under project

In this initial report (the first of an anticipated series of reports), RTD staff has proposed
for the Board’s consideration a series of possible scenarios and options for completing
the FasTracks Unfinished Corridors and implementing the Peak Service Plan as
expeditiously as reasonably possible in a commercially reasonable manner. It remains
clear that, given RTD’s current limited resources, the path forward will require continued
discussions regarding the trade-offs among alternatives. As noted in the Introduction,
the ideas, opportunities and approaches presented in this report are draft and
illustrative, laying out options for the RTD Board to consider and to facilitate constructive
dialogue with the voters, taxpayers and stakeholders throughout the region. The most
promising of these can be further refined and pursued.

The scope of work for the Transportation Transformation Comprehensive Plan (T2 Comp
Plan), authorized by the RTD Board of Directors in May 2019, includes opportunities for
further in-depth analysis and dialogue regarding many of these topics. Between now
and the adoption of the T2 Comp Plan, we will have laid the groundwork and provided
the Board opportunities to address how to:

Balance various existing and anticipated mobility options to meet the District’s
transportation needs; and

•

Proceed forward with completing the FasTracks Unfinished Corridors within a
comprehensive, sustainable framework for the future.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) FasTracks Program has experienced many successes
and challenges since the voter-approved 0.4 percent tax increase in 2004. This document
includes: an overview of the original 2004 FasTracks Program; accomplishments to date;
modifications to delivery, costs and schedule; current financial status; as well as a summary of
next steps.
FasTracks Program Overview
The FasTracks Program was created through extensive stakeholder partnerships to provide
much-needed transit improvements to the Denver Metro area. The 2004 FasTracks Plan
(included as Appendix A) envisioned the program as a 12-year, $4.7 billion series of transit
improvements and additions. The plan’s goals included:



Provide improved transportation choices and options to the citizens of the district;
Increase transit mode share during peak travel times; and



Establish a proactive plan that balances transit needs with future regional growth.
DRAFT as of 5/29/ 18

The following map identifies the key elements included in the 2004 FasTracks Plan, including:


119 miles of light rail and commuter rail: construction of new rapid transit in six
corridors and existing rapid transit enhancements and extensions in three corridors;




57 new rail/BRT stations;
18 miles of bus rapid transit (BRT);



Enhanced bus network and transit hubs (FastConnects);



31 new Park-n-Rides and expansions to nine Park-n-Rides (adding more than 21,000
parking spaces);



The renovation of Denver Union Station into a major multimodal center providing access
to nearly every rapid transit line and regional buses, local circulators and intercity
rail/bus service;



Transit facilities and amenities to improve safety, convenience and use of the transit
system; and



Opportunities for transit-oriented development (TOD).

environmental clearances for the FasTracks Corridors. In 2006, as a result of safety concerns
(and partially in response to a deadly 2005 rail accident in California) the freight railroads
mandated that only Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) compliant passenger rail vehicles
would be allowed to operate in their rights-of-way. This eventually led to a change in scope and
technology for the Gold Line from light rail to commuter rail. Concurrently, in 2006 – 2007 RTD
undertook capital and operating cost analyses of commuter rail technologies for the East, North
Metro, Northwest Rail and Gold Line Corridors. Capital cost estimation for these corridors in the
original FasTracks Plan assumed diesel technologies, which have lower up-front construction
costs. However, RTD determined, based on multiple factors including lower forecasted
operating costs, that Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) technology would have lower life-cycle costs
than diesel for the East, North Metro and Gold Line Corridors. The choice of EMU technology
was also influenced by the desires of local governments and citizens, expressed during the
course of the environmental clearances, for electric-powered rather than diesel-powered
commuter rail. This decision resulted in higher capital costs for these corridors based on
infrastructure (such as overhead catenary), vehicle and right-of-way requirements. In 2008, the
federal government’s requirement that FRA compliant passenger railroads install Positive Train
Control systems to enhance safety added an additional capital cost requirement for these
projects that was not included in the 2004 cost estimates for FasTracks.
DRAFT as of 5/29/ 18

In 2007, the FasTracks Program was negatively impacted by decreased sales and use tax
revenues and increased costs of construction materials and was forecast at the time to need an
additional $1.5 billion to deliver the remaining projects in less than a decade. This perfect storm
caused the agency to explore strategic and creative ways to complete FasTracks. The problem
was exacerbated by the country’s slow dive into the 2008 recession. As Denver recovered from
the Great Recession, then Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper, and other political and business
leaders supported RTD in using innovative thinking to complete the program. They viewed mass
transit as essential to making Denver a metropolitan force that could compete with cities not
just in the United States, but throughout the world.
RTD began extensive stakeholder outreach and coordination to identify innovative ideas to
complete more of the FasTracks Plan sooner, including determining whether there was support
for an additional tax increase. This outreach included establishing the FasTracks Metro Mayor’s
Task Force to increase the technical understanding of regional stakeholders and elected officials
concerning the FasTracks Program and the agency’s financial plan. This outreach approach

Attachment: 2019 FasTracks Unfinished Corridors Report draft 6-14 (002) (3875 : FasTracks Resolution Staff Report)

History
Following passage of FasTracks, RTD initiated work on preliminary engineering and

engaged a broad group of elected officials in a multiyear educational/partnering process that
allowed them direct and informal access to a variety of technical and financial resources.

3

Packet Pg. 144

1.C.5.b

began evaluating whether there were opportunities to implement a Public Private Partnership
(P3) for any of the FasTracks projects. In 2011, RTD held an industry forum, Transformation

Through Transportation (T3), to seek innovations to complete the FasTracks Program as soon
as possible, enhance customer experience and reduce operational costs. This call for
innovations enticed more than 200 high-level executives from a cross-section of large and small
firms to attend, including engineering, construction and financial firms as well as major
companies not typically involved in transportation projects.
After much research, RTD realized that voters were likely not willing to vote for a tax increase
and decided it was too risky to move forward with an additional ballot initiative given the
economic situation. Therefore, RTD turned its focus to closely collaborating with the private
sector and the public to continue building towards the ultimate FasTracks vision. The
collaborative environment established with regional stakeholders, elected officials and the
private sector resulted in the following major accomplishments for the program:


RTD gained support to move forward with the P3 for the commuter rail line to the
airport (i.e., the Eagle Project), making RTD the first U.S. transit agency to successfully
leverage private-sector investment and federal funding to build a commuter rail system.



RTD received and accepted unsolicited proposals from the private sector that ultimately
resulted in construction of the I-225 corridor and a substantial section of the North
DRAFT as of 5/29/ 18

Metro corridor.


RTD analyzed the remaining FasTracks projects and determined that the Southeast Rail
Line was a strong candidate for additional federal grant funding. The federal funds,
combined with an unprecedented local contribution provided by the local stakeholders in
the project area, allowed RTD to begin construction on that rail line.



RTD established the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) to capture and track any
excess revenues available in a given year so that they could be leveraged in the future
to build the remaining FasTracks projects.

Status
RTD has made significant progress in completing the FasTracks Program to date. Since its
inception, RTD has expended over $5.6 billion on improvements in the region, has stimulated
$2 billion of development around Denver Union Station alone, has provided $1.032 billion of
revenue to small and disadvantaged businesses and has created over 15,000 full-time jobs.
The following table and map provide an overview of the status of completing the FasTracks
Program and the remainder of this report provides a financial overview and the status of each
FasTracks project.

The 2004 Financial Plan for FasTracks forecast a $4.7 billion capital cost for program build-out
over a 12-year period. The primary revenue source was forecast to be the voter-approved 0.4%
increase in sales and use tax within the District supporting various debt instruments (Bonds,
COPs and a TIFIA loan from the federal government), along with federal grants, “Pay as you go
Cash” and funding support from local jurisdictions. The following table provides the original

To proactively address the funding gap for the FasTracks Program, RTD:


Instituted a more detailed annual FasTracks budget analysis and forecast named the
Annual Program Evaluation (APE).



Conducted extensive public outreach, presenting options for program delivery given
funding constraints.



Applied to the FTA seeking entry into the Public Private Partnership Pilot Program
(Penta-P) for the Gold Line and East corridors, which ultimately led to the successful
award of $1.03 billion in federal funding. The Eagle P3 award resulted in a cost savings
to RTD of $305 million compared with internal estimates, with the savings used to
complete more of the program.



Convened a Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) FasTracks Task Force with representation of
one mayor from each of the FasTracks corridors. This MMC FasTracks Task Force met
regularly, with RTD staff support, over the next several years, asking key questions,
assuring local government understanding of RTD decision-making, and providing RTD
with input.



Several times, over multiple years, RTD considered pursuing an additional election to
increase sales and use tax. RTD finally determined that the economic conditions were
not suitable for an election.



Formed a Fiscal Sustainability Task Force for the purpose of making recommendations
ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force’s recommendations were
approved by the Board of Directors in 2011, with direction to staff to pursue
implementation.



Convened a group of state and local government economic and financial advisors to
review RTD’s sales and use tax forecasting methodology – resulted in having the
University of Colorado Leeds School of Business to prepare all future sales and use tax
revenue forecasts.



Evaluated “Potential Critical Adjustments” (PCAs) for FasTracks, which included possible
changes to the original FasTracks Plan that did not fundamentally alter the length of
corridors, number and general location of station or the types of vehicles.



Held the “Transformation Through Transportation (T3) Industry Forum” to seek private
sector innovations to complete the FasTracks Program as soon as possible, enhance
customer experience and reduce operational cost.



Revised cost estimates for the Northwest Rail Line, based on inputs from the BNSF
Railway and updated construction costs.



Approved proposal to complete the full I-225 Light Rail Line following a competitive
solicitation that was initially spurred by an unsolicited proposal received by RTD.
DRAFT as of 5/29/ 18



Developed a Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) to identify specific cost saving/revenue
enhancing measures that would result in additional short-term funding for the FasTracks
Program.



Developed the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) budget account to identify
and track any additional funds that could be used to complete the FasTracks Program.



Moved forward with constructing the North Metro corridor to 124th Avenue in response
to an unsolicited proposal from the private sector.



Received federal funding for the Southeast Rail Extension which, paired with local
financial commitments, allowed RTD to proceed with construction of this project.



Continually worked on scope refinements and budget containment throughout the
FasTracks Program development.

competitive federal grant funding in the sum total of $815 million for the East, West and Gold
rail lines. RTD was successful in the pursuit of federal funds for each of these projects. In 2016,
RTD was awarded additional competitive grant funding for the Southeast Rail Extension after
determining the potential eligibility of this project under the FTA’s updated rules and criteria.
Through 2018, the FTA has awarded RTD with over $1.4 billion in federal funding for these
projects, exceeding the original 2004 plan of $815 million by approximately $615 million.
RTD has continued to explore viability for additional federal grant funding for FasTracks projects
that are not yet under construction. Based on current federal criteria, only one project – the
Central Rail Extension – would possibly meet the project justification criteria to receive a federal
grant. However, it does not meet the project financial justification criteria primarily because
applying for federal funding would require a substantial local share that is not currently
identified in RTD’s financial plan. Should RTD’s financial position or federal eligibility criteria
change significantly, the Central Rail Extension or other unfunded corridors could be considered
as possible additional candidates for federal funds.
Potential Next Steps
RTD is committed to completing the full FasTracks Program over time and will continue seeking
DRAFT as of 5/29/ 18

innovative ideas and working with partners to move the program forward. However, RTD is
facing significant financial challenges. As the following chart depicts, RTD does not anticipate
having any capacity to issue additional debt until 2026.

authorization limiting total debt for the program to $3.477 billion in principal and $7.129 billion
in total debt service. Given current outstanding sales tax and appropriation obligations and the
debt limits identified in the voter-approved authorization, RTD will not be in a position to issue
additional debt to fund additional FasTracks projects until 2026 at the earliest. As of RTD’s last
debt issuance, there is a remaining authorization of $381.95M in total repayment outstanding.
That would allow RTD to issue approximately $195M in bonds sometime after 2026
In the meantime, RTD continues to seek opportunities to identify scope refinements and budget
containment with on-going projects and continues to track excess revenues through the FISA,
which as of year-end 2017 has a total balance of $49.4 million. The following table identifies
actual expenditures by project through 2017 as well as total project budgets (total expenditures
through 2017 plus committed expenditures through 2020).

On behalf of the Regional Transportation
District Board of Directors and staff, we
welcome this opportunity to present to
you the FasTracks Plan, our
comprehensive plan for high quality
transit service and facilities in the Denver
metropolitan region. It is the culmination
of an extensive planning and
development process involving the
general public and all the local cities and
counties over the last five years. It
represents our vision for a better
transportation system by providing an
enhanced region-wide, reliable and safe
transit system.
We at RTD are dedicated to deliver to
the citizens of the metro region the
highest quality and most cost effective
transit services today and in the future.
Over the last four years, from 20002003, RTD has continued to improve the
services that it offers to the public by
providing:
•

The opening of two new successful
light rail lines, the Southwest Corridor
and the Central Platte Valley Spur on
time and within budget. Ridership on
these lines continue to exceed
projections. RTD’s next light rail line,
the Southeast Corridor, or T-REX, is
under construction in a joint
partnership with the Colorado
Department of Transportation (CDOT)
and is also on time and within
budget.

•

Overall improvements to the RTD Bus
System. These include enhanced
fixed route service as well as service
diversification to include community

Preface-1

based transit systems and call-n-Ride
service. This has been accompanied
by an aggressive bus fleet
modernization program that will
reduce the average age of our bus
fleet from 12 years in 1999 to 5
years in 2004. RTD’s access-a-Ride
paratransit system continues to grow
and is responsive to the disabled
community.
•

An enhanced accident prevention
program that has resulted in a 54
percent reduction in accident rates
between 2001 and 2002. To date, in
2003, accident numbers have been
reduced an additional 32 percent
below last year’s levels. This
reduction was achieved through
comprehensive management and ongoing driver training.

•

Overall prudent financial management
of RTD activities. Between 2000 and
2002 Worker’s Compensation claim
amounts were reduced by 55 percent
by tightly controlling this process
thereby saving millions of dollars.
Enforcement of existing attendance
polices has reduced absenteeism
among bus operators by 5% saving
personnel costs. Beginning in 2001,
RTD reacted early and effectively to
slumping economic conditions
thereby minimizing the impact of
reduced revenues for our customers
and our employees.

These achievements, as well as many
others, led to RTD being named this year
as the best transit agency in North
America by the American Public
Transportation Association (APTA). This
award is a testimony to the hard work

award is a testimony to the hard work
and dedication of the employees at RTD
who, on a daily basis, put the customer
first.
RTD intends to continue this record of
service and achievement by providing to
the metro area citizens a transit plan that
will give residents transportation choices
on how they will travel. The FasTracks
Plan provides new and expanded rail and
bus rapid transit lines, enhancements to
the current bus system including
suburban-to-suburban bus service, over
thirty new and expanded park-n-Rides ,
and other transit facility improvements
including a major downtown multimodal
center at Denver Union Station. All of
these major components are integrated

to provide seamless travel throughout
the metropolitan area . So, whether you
are traveling from home to work, to
school, to the doctor, or to a sporting or
entertainment event, transit can be your
best option .
RTD wishes to thank all of our
customers, the local communities and
the general public for their participation
in the planning process for the FasTracks
Plan. Your input was invaluable to
development of the final plan
components . RTD will continue to ask
communities to tell us what they want
and we will do everything we can to
carry out their requ st

Overview of FasTracks

FasTracks is RTD’s twelve-year
comprehensive plan for high quality transit
service and facilities in the region. FasTracks
is a proactive plan that responds to the
growing transportation needs of the Denver
metropolitan region by providing an
enhanced region-wide, reliable and safe
transit system.
According to the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG), the Denver
metropolitan region is expected to add more
than 900,000 people and 600,000 jobs by
2025. This growth will place a tremendous
strain on the region’s already congested
transportation system. Weekday vehicle
miles of travel are expected to increase from
58 million in the year 2001 to 95 million by
the year 2025, a 64 percent increase. As
part of its Fiscally Constrained 2025 Interim
Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), DRCOG
has noted that this combination of
population growth and vehicle miles
traveled will increase severe congestion by
89 percent even with the transportation
improvements that are scheduled for
implementation. Person hours of delay are
predicted to increase by two times the
current amount. By 2025, we will have
more traffic than our existing transportation
system can handle.
In its 2003 Annual Urban Mobility Report,
the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) rated
Denver as the third most congested city in
the United States. The report also states that
“it would be almost impossible to maintain a
constant congestion level with road

ES-1

construction only” and that “peak period
public transportation service during
congested hours can improve the
transportation capacity.” The report
indicates that “Public transportation lines
that do not intersect roads can be particularly
reliable as they are not affected by weather,
road work, and other unreliability producing
events.”
FasTracks also responds to Metro Vision, the
Denver region’s plan for future growth and
development. The second of the six core
elements of Metro Vision states that the
region must create “a balanced multimodal
transportation system” which includes “an
extensive fixed guideway transit system and
bus transit.”
Finally, FasTracks responds to current
sentiment on transportation needs within the
metropolitan area. In a recent survey
entitled 2003 Statewide Customer Survey –
Results on Transportation Issues in Colorado
conducted by the Colorado Department of
Transportation (CDOT), the lack of
public/mass transportation was identified as
one of the top transportation issues. The
CDOT survey also states that if transportation
funds became available, in the metro area,
the highest priority for spending that money
should be on light rail. FasTracks provides
the opportunity to implement rapid transit by
funding a region-wide system of light rail,
commuter rail and bus rapid transit in the
next twelve years.
FasTracks has three core goals:

Executive Summary

1.C.5.b

Additional transportation choices add to
the region’s quality of life. Reduced
reliance on a single mode of
transportation by providing additional,
convenient transit options gives
individuals choices on how to travel and
where to live, work and play. FasTracks
provides over 119 miles of new rail
transit, contributes to the construction of
18 miles of bus rapid transit and greatly
enhances the bus network to support
investments in rail, serve suburb-tosuburb trips, and provide local and
regional service.
Increase transit mode share during peak
travel times.
Existing congestion during peak travel
times of the day is frustrating for many
drivers and is only expected to get worse
as the region continues to grow.
Providing viable transit options during
the peak travel times will help provide
relief for frustrated drivers. FasTracks is
projected to increase the percentage of
people taking transit during the peak
hours from 11 to 22 percent in the
region’s major transportation corridors
where congestion is worst.

Key Components of FasTracks

2.

Significant planning efforts and public
involvement have gone into development of
the FasTracks Plan. It anticipates building a
number of major components described
below. Costs are estimated based on the best
data currently available. Transit elements
shown are based on completed planning and
engineering work and environmental studies,
or work that is ongoing at the time of
publication. While specific details of the
plan may change based on unanticipated
economic circumstances over the next
twelve years, and the results of the
environmental, planning, and engineering
work that is still ongoing, RTD expects to
deliver the major transit corridors and related
improvements within the overall budgetary
framework and timeframes set out in the
plan.
•

Rapid Transit - FasTracks will
provide new and expanded rapid
transit in nine major travel corridors
by funding over 119 miles of light
rail and commuter rail and
contributing to the construction of 18
miles of bus rapid transit. The rapid
transit component includes
expansions and extensions to
existing light rail lines, construction
of new light rail and commuter rail
lines, and construction of the stations
and other improvements for bus
rapid transit. (Figure ES-1)

•

park-n-Rides - One of the most
successful elements of the RTD
system is the extensive park-n-Ride
system throughout the District. RTD
has 65 park-n-Rides today with over
21,000 spaces that are served by
both buses and rail. (When

Establish a proactive plan that balances
transit needs with future regional growth.
The Denver metropolitan region is
expected to grow from 2.46 million
(2001) people to 3.39 million in 2025.
This growth requires an enhanced transit
system to help meet the future
transportation needs of the region.
FasTracks responds to this need and
provides opportunities to focus
development near transit to take
advantage of the increased capacity and
convenience of the enhanced system.

metro region. As the central
intermodal hub for the region, DUS
will provide access to nearly every
rapid transit corridor included in
FasTracks as well as Regional,
Express and Local bus service, the
16th Street Mall, Amtrak, the Ski
Train, Greyhound, and the new
Downtown Circulator. Elements of
DUS that are part of FasTracks
include: construction of below
grade light rail access into DUS, atgrade commuter rail access into
DUS, and construction of
components to facilitate transfers
such as underground passenger
waiting areas, concessions, and
restrooms. (Figure ES-4)

completed in 2006, T-REX will add 9
more park-n-Rides, and over 5,000
new spaces.) FasTracks will provide
funding to increase the number of
parking spaces by over 21,000.
These spaces will be added to
existing park-n-Rides as well as 31
new park-n-Rides to serve growing
areas of the metro region. (Figure ES2).
Enhanced Bus Network and Transit
Hubs - FasTracks offers a family of
bus services tailored to individual
markets and linked together to create
a comprehensive and seamless
network. RTD will continue to
operate the full array of bus service it
offers today, and will offer two new
services. Recognizing that
employment, residential, commercial
and educational opportunities are
dispersed throughout the region,
FasTracks includes a comprehensive
network of suburb-to-suburb bus
service linked together with
“FastConnects” or timed transfers at
transit hubs throughout the region.
The FastConnects concept schedules
buses and trains to arrive at transit
stations, stops and park-n-Rides at the
same time, minimizing the time a
passenger has to wait to transfer to
another vehicle. (Figure ES-3). The
second new service offered by
FasTracks is an extensive system of
bus feeder service to rapid transit
stations. This service will provide
neighborhoods near rapid transit
stations a convenient option for
accessing rail or bus rapid transit
lines.

congested highways. Ridership
trends on the RTD’s current light rail
system support the forecasts. Nearly
60 percent of new riders on the
Southwest Corridor use light rail at
least three days a week. Moreover,
78 percent of light rail riders had a
vehicle to use for this trip. More
trips on transit means fewer cars on
the road. One full bus can remove
60 cars, one full light rail vehicle can
remove 125 cars from the road.

The 2003 Annual Urban Mobility Report
prepared by the Texas Transportation
Institute reported 36 annual hours of delay
per person in the Denver area in 2001. The
same report also indicated that 60 percent of
the freeway lane miles in the Denver area
were congested during the peak period in
2001. Delay and congestion are projected
to increase significantly in the future.
FasTracks provides a fast alternative to
driving in the major highway corridors.
Travel Times/Speeds - With the FasTracks
Plan, it will be faster to travel by transit than
by auto to key destinations during the peak
times. As shown in Figure ES-5, most transit
travel times are significantly less for rapid
transit than for autos in 2025. With
FasTracks, about 474,000 fewer vehicle
miles would be driven each weekday in the
region in the year 2025. Because of the
reduction in vehicle miles driven, highways
adjacent to the rapid transit corridors will
generally operate slightly faster during rush
hours and through traffic on nearby roads
will also decline.
•

Safety/Reliability - Transit,
particularly rail and bus guideway, is
much more dependable and reliable
in inclement weather and is not
subject to highway incident related
traffic. Additionally, compared to
road systems, transit systems are
significantly safer. Generally, trips
with similar destinations result in
200,000 fewer deaths, injuries and
accidents when made by public
transit than by car, adding up to
between $2 billion and $5 billion
per year in safety benefits.

•

Peak Hour Mode Split – The
FasTracks Plan will increase the
percentage of people taking transit
during the peak hours from 11
percent today to over 22 percent on

ES-8

Economic Growth and Development
There are a number of positive impacts to
the regional economy with FasTracks. Sprawl
and growth continues to be a concern to
most metro area residents. FasTracks
promotes smart growth and higher density
development along transit corridors where it
is consistent and appropriate and supported
by local cities and counties and their
citizens.
•

Transit Oriented Development Opportunities for transit oriented
development around rail and bus
stations have been shown to increase
property values. This has occurred
locally at Englewood City Center
Station on the Southwest Corridor.
The Alexan City Center apartments, a
transit oriented development along
the Southwest light rail line recently
sold for $5,000 to $10,000 more per
unit due to their location next to
light rail. In the Southeast Corridor/
T-REX project, which is currently
under construction, approximately
50 acres directly adjacent to the
Belleview Station have been rezoned
from open space to transit mixed
use.

•

Increased Economic Activity FasTracks in the short term will
provide increases in employment

and disposable income through the
creation of many new construction
jobs. This is consistent with the TREX project where over 1,400 local

jobs have been added to the
economy. Regional economic
activity will increase as a result of
FasTracks.

Carbon Monoxide, small particulates
(called PM10), and Volatile Organic
Compounds emitted into the region’s
air. DRCOG also projects a slight
increase in Nitrogen Oxide
emissions, but the overall impact of
the FasTracks plan on the region’s air
quality is positive and will increase
over time as transit ridership
increases.

In the long term, the implementation
of FasTracks will provide the needed
infrastructure to sustain our economy
by creating a livable environment
that will be attractive to business and
development. In Dallas, Texas, the
light rail starter line generated over
$922 million in development,
surpassing the $860 million cost of
the project. Additionally, the DART
system in downtown Dallas
contributed to a 30 percent jump in
retail sales between mid-1997 and
1998, compared to a 3 percent rise
citywide.
•

Economic Benefits to Individuals and
Businesses – Transit can save
commuters money in transportation
expenditures by reducing the travel
commute times and the cost of
commuting. Studies have shown
that public transportation-intensive
metropolitan areas save $22 billion
annually in transportation costs.
According to DRCOG, by 2025,
548,000 jobs, or 26% of all jobs in
the region, will be within a one-half
mile walk of a rapid transit station
with FasTracks. With a short bus
ride, this job accessibility grows to
46%. Additionally, 12% of all
households will be within walking
distance of a rapid transit station, and
86% will be within a 5 mile drive of
a rapid transit park-n-Ride. Many
cities are finding that businesses are
considering transit service a key
factor in location decisions.

Environmental Benefits
FasTracks will provide environmental
benefits to the region in a number of areas.
•

Air Quality – According to DRCOG,
the FasTracks plan will have a net
positive impact on the amount of

ES-11

•

Energy Conservation –
Implementation of the FasTracks Plan
will also contribute to energy
conservation. A bus with as few as
seven passengers is more fuel
efficient than the average car with
one occupant used for commuting.
The fuel efficiency of a fully
occupied rail car is 15 times greater
than the typical automobile. For
every passenger mile traveled, public
transportation is twice as fuelefficient as autos and trucks.
Nationally, if 1 in 10 Americans used
public transportation regularly, the
U.S. reliance on foreign oil could be
cut by more than 40 percent.

Development/Refinement of Plan
Concept

Since 1994, RTD has conducted a number of
planning and environmental studies for
major transportation corridors, designed and
built three new rapid transit lines (Central
Corridor, Southwest Corridor and Central
Platte Valley), and initiated construction with
CDOT on the T-REX (Southeast Corridor)
light rail and highway program which will
open in 2006. Additionally, RTD partnered
with CDOT to develop capital cost estimates
for regional transportation improvements,
conducted public outreach, and worked with
financial consultants to examine long term
funding options. A brief summary of these
key inputs is described below.

Attachment: 2019 FasTracks Unfinished Corridors Report draft 6-14 (002) (3875 : FasTracks Resolution Staff Report)

1.C.5.b

Packet Pg. 172

Corridor Planning and Environmental
Studies
RTD conducted extensive studies for all six
new and three enhanced transit corridors
that are included in the FasTracks rapid
transit component. These included Major
Investment Studies for the East, West, Gold
Line, US 36, I-225 and North Metro
Corridors, an Environmental Impact
Statement for the Southeast and West
Corridors, Feasibility Studies for the
Southeast (Lone Tree) and Southwest
Corridor Extensions, and operational
analyses for the Central Corridor. From
1998-2001, RTD also conducted a Twenty
Year Transit Needs Assessment and System
Plan to insure that financial investments are
being made to maintain RTD’s existing assets
and to insure that individual corridor
recommendations coordinate with future
region-wide service level requirements. The
draft FasTracks Plan adopted by the RTD
Board in the summer of 2001 was built upon
the foundation of the long-term transit needs
assessment and plan that included the
detailed work of the planning and
environmental studies.
Community Outreach/Public Input and
Progress of the FasTracks Plan
A survey to gauge interest in transit-related
improvements for the metro area was also
conducted by the Colorado Department of
Transportation, RTD and the Transit Alliance
(a group of metro area local municipalities
and other business interests) in July of 2001.
The results of this survey indicated a 78%
approval rating for improving transit in the
metro area. Twenty-one open houses were
conducted throughout the RTD District
during September and October 2001 to
gather public input on the plan concept. In
addition, individual meetings were held with
elected officials, Chambers of Commerce
and civic groups in each corridor. In order
to gain additional comments about the
FasTracks Plan, a web site was established

ES-12

and surveys were distributed to members of
the general public. A number of changes
were incorporated into the plan based on
this input.
In December of 2002, the RTD Board
adopted the FasTracks Plan as the vision for
transit in the metro area. By the Spring of
2003, financial forecasts indicated that
lagging sales tax revenues would not allow
RTD to build the FasTracks Plan as originally
proposed (i.e., full build-out of the rapid
transit system within 10 years based on a 0.4
percent sales tax increase). A revised plan
was proposed which scaled back the rapid
transit build-out into two phases. Sixteen
open houses were held in August and
September 2003 to gather public input on
the proposed changes to the plan. To date,
over 347 public meetings and presentations
have occurred.
In general, the public and elected officials
preferred that RTD modify other plan
features in order to build the entire rapid
transit system. As a result, the FasTracks
Plan was revised to include a build-out of the
rapid transit system within a 12-year period
with modifications in rail and bus operations
in the opening years.
Capital Cost Estimates (Methodology, Unit
Costs, Risk Assessment)
The capital cost estimates for the FasTracks
Plan were prepared in conjunction with the
extensive study work that lead to the
definition of the FasTracks Plan elements.
They were also reviewed and revised using
unit prices consistent with past and current
construction costs in the metro area. In
2002, RTD hired an engineering consulting
firm to independently review the FasTracks
Plan rapid transit cost estimates. This
consultant previously validated the
CDOT/RTD T-REX project cost estimates.
The result of their analysis validated the
corridor-adjusted costs within 1.78 percent

1.C.5.b

RTD has included in each corridor cost
estimate funds to mitigate impacts to the
local street networks. The construction of
the FasTracks Plan will have an impact on
the local roadway networks wherever a
corridor is built. RTD recognizes that
corridor-specific impacts will be identified as
the preliminary and final design progresses.
At this time, RTD has identified specific
locations in each corridor that will need to
be mitigated for bridges, grade crossings, and
street restoration. In addition, RTD has
allocated 7 to 8 percent of construction costs
in each corridor to cover noise, urban
design, and traffic control/signing and
striping. These additive costs account for
approximately 15 to 20 percent of the cost of
the construction items.
A formal risk assessment was prepared for
FasTracks that evaluated the potential
financial risk associated with the proposed
alignments and facilities and assigned a
monetary value to the costs and the
associated risk. The risk assessment
developed contingencies for the FasTracks
Plan in major categories (i.e., hazardous
materials, schedule delays, quantity
adjustments). The cost assigned to each
category was established based on the cost
estimate for the project and the estimated
cost for each individual component that
might be affected. A percentage risk
adjustment was determined based on past
history. Both a minimum risk dollar value
and a high-risk dollar value were established.
A probability was assigned to each item and
a statistical analysis was performed to
establish the dollar amount of probable risk.
The result of that analysis has shown that the
contingency amounts, provided in the plan

ES-13

cost estimates, are within the risk tolerance
for the plan.
RTD and CDOT staff also collaborated on an
analysis that was released in June of 2003
that explored the construction coordination
that would be needed between the FasTracks
Plan and the state highway system. This
analysis was used to develop a Master
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between
RTD and CDOT that was signed by both
agencies on April 12, 2004. The Master IGA
establishes a coordinated process which
facilitates the implementation of the
FasTracks Plan and preserves the ability to
pursue planned highway and transit
improvements in corridors where both
highway and transit improvements are likely
to occur.
Rail and Bus Operating and Maintenance
Cost Methodologies
The LRT operating and maintenance costs
were based on FY 2002 National Transit
Database (NTDB) cost and statistical data
provided by RTD. Unit costs were developed
for specific costs categories within cost
centers. The cost centers are based on NTDB
categories within the following areas:
vehicle operations and vehicle maintenance,
non-vehicle maintenance and general
administration. The model was validated to
prior years. Specifically, prior year service
statistics were entered into the cost model
and cost results were deflated based on
Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rates.
The model was found to generate costs
within a few percentage points of actual
costs.
Bus operating and maintenance costs for
FasTracks were developed using the RTD
bus operating and maintenance cost model.
The RTD bus cost model is an incremental
cost model which uses unit costs based on
actual RTD financial data and scheduled

Attachment: 2019 FasTracks Unfinished Corridors Report draft 6-14 (002) (3875 : FasTracks Resolution Staff Report)

of the estimate provided by RTD. Since that
time, RTD has updated the estimates to
reflect current conditions and costs in
coordination with local governments and the
operating freight railroads.

units of service. The bus cost model
develops unit costs based on the class of
service operated, and allocates these costs to
the service variable (or variables) most
closely associated with the specific type of
cost.
Incremental operating and maintenance
costs for service to FasTracks bus routes were
estimated at a systemwide average
incremental cost of $54.00 per hour. In
addition to the incremental operating costs
described above, the FasTracks Plan includes
the opening of an additional bus
maintenance facility. The bus cost model
also was used to develop an annual
operating cost for that facility, based on the
2002 operating costs for RTD’s major
facilities.
Schedule and Implementation Plan and
Building on Past Successes
RTD has been successful in its capital
construction program. Starting with the
CDOT, City and County of Denver and RTD
partnership on the Downtown Express/Bus
HOV lane project in 1994 and continuing
with the three RTD operating light rail lines,
the Central Corridor in 1994, the Southwest
Corridor in 2000 and the Central Platte
Valley in 2002, RTD has completed each
corridor on time and within budget. The TREX project, a combined RTD and CDOT
construction project, also remains on
schedule to open in 2006 and is within
budget.
Similarly, for the FasTracks Plan, RTD is
confident that its capital project cost
estimates and its schedule and
implementation plan are realistic. RTD has
developed a schedule for implementation
that places each of the corridors into revenue
service within twelve years. In order to
achieve this goal, the logical and sequential
scheduling of all FasTracks elements is

ES-14

incorporated into the schedule. The schedule
was developed based on several factors that
included:
•

Activity in each of the corridors
begins within one year after passage
of FasTracks

•

Prioritization of Facility/Corridor
Interdependence

•

Acquisition of Assets/Right-of -way

•

Ability to Finance

•

Sequencing of Activities

•

Status of Corridor Project
Development Activities

Sequencing of corridor construction will be
established to coordinate with forecasted
revenues so that RTD remains fiscally solvent
throughout the implementation of the
FasTracks Plan. There are other factors that
could positively impact design and
construction schedules for FasTracks. These
include:
•

Revenue receipts higher than
forecasts.

•

Additional federal funds (beyond
current assumptions).

•

Receipt of Senate Bill 1/revenues
(state of Colorado).

•

Lower corridor construction costs.

•

Third party financial partnering to
accelerate the construction schedule.

On the conservative side, RTD has estimated
construction costs and timeframes on a
design-bid-build basis but intends to evaluate
every corridor and project for the possibility
of design-build in order to implement the
most cost effective and efficient means of
construction. The management and
implementation of the Plan will be the
responsibility of RTD.

RTD’s schedule was reviewed by a
consulting firm with expertise in this area.
The consultant prepared a schedule
independent of the one prepared by RTD
staff. The sequencing of the projects
remained consistent with that of RTD. In the
independent analysis, the consultants
established their own logic to develop a
schedule based on the experience of their
personnel and from previous projects
throughout the country. Durations varied
slightly, but completion of each corridor was
within the 12-year period established as the
goal for the FasTracks Plan. This
independent analysis concluded that the
FasTracks Plan can be accomplished within
the 12-year time period.
Financial Plan
The FasTracks Plan is a comprehensive $4.7
billion plan for addressing mobility needs in
the Denver metro area over the next twelve
years. In order to finance the plan, the
District will seek voter approval for a 0.4
percent increase in the regional sales and use
tax – this equates to 4 pennies on a $10
purchase. This will bring the total tax in the
District to 1 percent, comparable to other
urban areas in the Western United States
including Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and
San Francisco.
The Plan leverages local funding to support
an estimated $815 million in federal New
Starts funding for various plan
improvements. This is approximately 17
percent of the total cost of the plan and is
reasonable compared to federal funds
received over time by RTD for similar
projects and at other transit properties
throughout the United States. It also utilizes
contributions from local jurisdictions
benefiting from transit in an amount equal to
2.5% of project corridor costs or an
estimated $95 million. Local contributions
could consist of right-of-way dedications,

ES-15

permit fee waivers, cash contributions,
corridor utility relocations as well as any
other direct corridor contributions.
In addition, RTD has incorporated an
estimated $110 million in other federal grant
revenues as part of the financing plan. An
estimated $50 million is expected from FTA
in the form of bus discretionary funds for
Denver Union Station or other bus projects
such as vehicles and facilities. An estimated
$60 million is for federal flexible dollars
through the DRCOG planning process
between the years 2010 and 2015,
consistent with the District’s past receipts,
allowing RTD to meet the implementation
schedule requirements requested by local
governments and adopted by the RTD Board
of Directors.

contributions that are reasonable and
consistent with RTD’s past funding history.

Conclusion
FasTracks is a comprehensive twelve-year
plan designed to implement high quality
transit service and facilities in the region. It
responds to the growing transportation needs
of the Denver metropolitan region by
providing alternatives to traffic congestion.
The Plan has been in development for over
five years with major study activities taking
place to define rapid transit corridor
improvements, bus service and other
elements. In conjunction with those study
activities, RTD has solicited and
incorporated local government and public
input as part of each corridor
recommendation. For the FasTracks Plan,
alone, RTD has conducted 37 public
meetings and 310 individual presentations
on the plan. The final FasTracks Plan
responds to local governments and the
public to build a transit system that serves
the needs of the community.

The FasTracks Plan will provide a number of
direct benefits for citizens in the metro
region. Travel times will be reduced for
those using the transit alternatives outlined in
the FasTracks Plan. Transit, particularly rail
and bus guideway, is much more
dependable and reliable in inclement
weather and is not subject to highway
incident related traffic. Riding a bus or train
is much safer than auto travel.

RTD has been successful in its capital
construction program. RTD has completed
each major corridor construction project
(Downtown Express, Central Corridor,
Southwest Corridor and Central Platte Valley
Spur) on time and within budget. The T-REX
project, a combined RTD and CDOT
construction project, also remains on
schedule and within budget. Similarly, for
the FasTracks Plan, RTD is confident that its
capital project cost estimates and its
schedule and implementation plan are
realistic.
The FasTracks financial plan will allow
implementation over twelve years with voter
approval for a 0.4 percent increase in the
regional sales and use tax. This will bring the
total tax in the District to 1 percent,
comparable to other urban areas in the
Western United States. Other sources of
funding for the plan include federal and local

ES-16

Implementation of the FasTracks Plan will
have a positive effect on the region wide
environment. For every passenger mile
traveled, public transportation is twice as
fuel efficient as autos and trucks. The
FasTracks Plan will lead to an annual
reduction in metro area pollutants such as
carbon monoxide, particulates and ozone.
There are a number of positive impacts to
the regional economy with FasTracks. Sprawl
and growth continue to be a concern to most
metro area residents. FasTracks promotes
smart growth and higher density
development along transit corridors where it
is consistent and appropriate and where it is
supported by local cities and counties and its
citizens. Opportunities for transit oriented
development around rail and bus stations
have been shown to increase property
values.
FasTracks in the short term will provide
increases in employment and disposable
income through the creation of many direct
construction jobs and other indirect jobs
during the construction period. This is
consistent with the T-REX project where
1,400 local jobs have been added to the
economy. In the long term, the
implementation of FasTracks will provide the
needed infrastructure to sustain our economy

by creating a livable environment that will
be attractive to business and development.
RTD has taken a number of actions to: 1)
assure the success of the FasTracks plan; 2)
assure accountability to the residents of the
region; and 3) provide for continued
coordination and communication with local
governments, citizens, CDOT and DRCOG.
Key examples of these actions follow:
RTD FasTracks Adoption and Election
Resolution
On April 22, 2004, the RTD Board of
Directors approved a resolution adopting the
FasTracks plan and declaring the
commitment to hold an election on the
FasTracks plan in the November 2, 2004
general election if sufficient signatures are
obtained on a petition, in accordance with
state law. In their resolution, the RTD Board
committed to ensuring “that the residents
and taxpayers of the region are provided
information about the progress of FasTracks
implementation in the event an election is
successful and have an ongoing opportunity
to review progress and provide input in the
numerous decisions that will be required for
construction of each corridor.” To
accomplish this, the resolution directs the
creation of “a citizen’s advisory committee to
monitor and provide input on the
improvements for each corridor contained in
the Plan.”
DRCOG Senate Bill 208
On April 21, 2004, the DRCOG Board of
Directors approved the FasTracks plan and
the individual corridors, the technologies,
and the method of financing, pursuant to
C.R.S. 32-9-107.7 (the “Senate Bill 208”
process), mandated by the state legislature.
In support of this action, DRCOG performed
a comprehensive technical review of the
individual FasTracks corridors and the
FasTracks financial plan.

ES-17

Master Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA)
between CDOT and RTD
On April 12, 2004, CDOT and RTD
executed the Master IGA that establishes a
coordinated process which facilitates the
implementation of the FasTracks Plan and
preserves the ability to pursue planned
highway and transit improvements in
corridors where both highway and transit
improvements are likely to occur.
RTD Hold Harmless Resolution
On February 17, 2004, the RTD Board of
Directors approved a resolution entitled
“Regarding Board Commitments for
FasTracks (Hold Harmless)”. This action
confirmed RTD’s commitment to build each
corridor’s specific list of corridor
improvements consistent with and as
described in the FasTracks Plan and within
the fiscal constraints and schedule of the
plan subject to the completion of the
environmental process and conformity with
any federal Record of Decision for a
corridor. It further formalized the
commitment to analyze the Plan annually to
determine current revenue projections from
both local and federal sources. The
resolution states, “If RTD revenues are better
or worse than expected then all the corridors
will be adjusted accordingly.”
Additionally, the Hold Harmless resolution
commits "that prior to construction, a
corridor cost risk assessment and value
engineering (will) be conducted to minimize
the potential for cost overruns and schedule
delays. Based on the results of both, project
and financial analyses, modifications to
individual corridor project elements, service
plans, and schedules may be necessary for
all FasTracks corridors. This may be
necessary so as to not impact the scheduled
construction and operation of the remaining
FasTracks corridors, thereby "holding
harmless" those corridors. This information
shall be reported annually to the general

public.” Each annual review will be
conducted by RTD, through the DRCOG
process, and will be reported to local
governments and the public.
Furthermore, the sixth point in the approved
resolution reads as follows: “Construction of
FasTracks committed improvements within a
corridor will not start until there is a firm
commitment of all required funding sources,
be they private, local-match or federal
monies and intergovernmental agreements
are in place with local governments
concerning permits, design and plan review
proves for timely implementation.”

Program Description

•

FasTracks is an integrated program of transit
improvements which includes:
•

•

•

Construction of rapid transit in six new
corridors, and enhancements and
extensions to existing rapid transit
lines in three corridors. The rapid
transit element includes light rail,
commuter rail and bus rapid transit.
Enhancements to bus service,
including an extensive feeder bus to
rail and bus rapid transit stations and
new suburb-to-suburb bus service
along major corridors.

Transit facilities and amenities
designed to improve passenger, safety,
convenience and use of the transit
system.

The FasTracks Program includes 119
miles of rail and 18 miles of bus rapid
transit.

The major components of the FasTracks Plan
are described in greater detail in the
following sections.

1.1

Rapid Transit Corridors

The FasTracks Plan includes 119 miles of rail
rapid transit in nine corridors and contributes
to the construction of 18 miles of bus rapid
transit. An overview of the rapid transit
elements of the FasTracks Plan is shown in
Figure 1, FasTracks Rapid Transit Corridors.
The recommendations for transit technology,
alignment and operating plans in each of the
corridors were developed through a
combination of Major Investment Studies,
(MISs), Environmental Impact Statements
(EISs) and Corridor Studies conducted since
1997.

A system of “FastConnects” timed
transfer points to enhance passenger
convenience and minimize wait times
for transfers between modes.

A brief history of the process and studies is
summarized for each of the corridors,
followed by a map depicting the major
corridor elements that will be funded as part
of the FasTracks Plan.

•

Thirty-one new park-n-Rides and
expansions to nine park-n-Rides –
more than an 80% increase over
existing and new T-REX spaces.

•

A major downtown multimodal Center
– Denver Union Station – which will
provide access to nearly every rapid
transit line as well as regional buses,
local circulators and inter-city rail and
bus service.

The Central Corridor light rail line opened in
October 1994 and was the first segment of
light rail in Denver. This light rail line is 5.3
miles in length, and extends from I-25 and
Broadway to the Denver downtown area,
and along Welton Street through Five Points
to 30th and Downing. The
Central Corridor has
fourteen stations and three
park-n-Rides.
The Central Corridor was
connected to the Southwest
Corridor light rail line in
July 2000, and to the
Central Platte Valley (CPV)
light rail spur in April
2002.
The CPV spur is a 1.8-mile
light rail line that serves
four stations and numerous
venues including the
Auraria Campus, Invesco Field at Mile High,
the Pepsi Center, Six Flags/Elitch Gardens
and Union Station.
The Central Corridor and Central
Platte Valley LRT lines will be
enhanced to serve as the spine of the
regional rail network.

A number of rail infrastructure improvements
will be made along the Central Corridor to
improve service efficiency. Improvements
include a partial grade separation at 13th
Avenue and the construction of two
additional tracks between Broadway and
Alameda and between 10th
Avenue and Osage and the CPV
Junction.
FasTracks will also fund a new
circulator system to serve
commuters arriving at Denver
Union Station and needing to
travel to the Civic Center area of
downtown Denver and other
downtown destinations. The
specific route and characteristics
of the downtown circulator are
currently being defined as part
of the Downtown Multimodal
Access Plan (DMAP), currently
underway. Once the study is
complete, RTD will incorporate the final
alternative(s) into the FasTracks Plan. The
performance standards and characteristics
that have been defined for the circulator
include:
•

To handle the forecasted ridership for build
out of the overall rapid transit system, the
FasTracks Plan will modify the existing light
rail stations in the Central Corridor and CPV
to accommodate four-car trains and extend
the light rail north from the 30th/Downing
station to the 40th/40th station where it
connects to the East Corridor. All
improvements will be subject to the results
of the final environmental process.

•

Service frequency that minimizes
dwell times

•

Quick service from one end of
Downtown to the other, with travel
times that are comparable to the 16th
Street Mall Shuttle (Dependent on
RTD’s ability to receive agreement
from the City and County of Denver
for dedicated lanes on the
Circulator’s alignment).

•

Uniform, bi-directional service
throughout Downtown that is visible
and user-friendly

•

Free fare service for RTD patrons

•

Service to office and residential areas

•

Technology that is reliable, provides
adequate capacity, and is
environmentally friendly.

•

Easy and effective transfer at Denver
Union Station.

•

Service that complements and
enhances the 16th Street Mall Shuttle
by providing sufficient capacity and
connecting additional areas of transit
demand.

In 2003, RTD finished a Light Rail (LRT) and
Traffic Simulation Study to increase LRT
operating capacity through Downtown
Denver. The consultant study concluded
that it would be reasonable to operate 16
trains per hour in the downtown area. This
study also indicated that with signal timing
or physical modifications at two locations
RTD could operate four-car trains through
downtown Denver. FasTracks includes this
provision to increase operating capacity.

northeast along the railroad right-of-way to
Blake and East 40th Avenue. From there, the
alignment follows an easterly course along the
railroad right-of-way that parallels Smith Road
to Airport Boulevard, where the alignment
curves north. The alignment then roughly
follows Peña Boulevard north and
east to the airport terminal.

The East Corridor is 23.6 miles in length, and
connects downtown Denver and the eastern
portion of the metro area to Denver
International Airport (DIA) with five stations.
The East Corridor provides a number of
important transportation functions including
interstate/intrastate
travel along I-70;
regional access from
downtown Denver and
the eastern metro area
to DIA, linkage as an
“inner beltway”
between I-225 and I270, and access to
adjacent employment
areas and intermodal
freight facilities.

The MIS recommended a singletrack commuter rail line from
Denver Union Station to Denver
International Airport, including five
stations and reconstruction of I-70
and widening of I-70 between I-270
and Peña Boulevard. In 2003, RTD
and CDOT initiated an
Environmental Impact Statement for
the East Corridor, which is currently
on-going.

Development trends
indicate that the
corridor will be a major
regional destination for
future employment.
Several areas in the vicinity of this corridor
have a relatively high proportion of transitdependent residents who would benefit from
improved access to expanding employment

The East Corridor will connect DIA,
Stapleton and Downtown Denver.
opportunities. Additionally, this corridor will
serve the substantial residential and business
growth in the former Stapleton Airport area and
the Gateway Area at 40th Avenue and Airport
Boulevard. Congestion along I-70 is forecasted
to be severe by the year 2025, resulting in slow
travel speeds, increased number of accidents,
and incident-related congestion.

The FasTracks Plan
would fund the
transit
recommendations
of the MIS.
FasTracks also
includes funds for
an additional
station at Peoria
and Smith Road to
connect to the
I-225 light rail line, and double-tracking the
commuter rail line to allow for more frequent
(15 minute) service. The transportation
improvements in this corridor are subject to
the results of the Environmental Impact
Statement in progress.

The recommendations for the East Corridor
were developed through an MIS conducted by
DRCOG in 1997. The alignment of the East
Corridor begins northeast of Denver Union
Station (at roughly 20th and Delgany) and runs

I-225 Corridor
The I-225 Corridor is 10.5 miles long, and
connects the Southeast Corridor light rail line
at I-225 and Parker Road to the East Corridor
rail line at Peoria and Smith Roads. The
corridor completes the rapid transit system
linkages in the eastern metro area and
improves suburb-to-suburb travel. The I-225
Corridor also provides light rail access to the
Aurora City Center, the Arapahoe County
Municipal Center, the Aurora Mall and the
future University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center at
Fitzsimons with seven
light rail stations.
Growth along this
corridor has been greater
and occurred much
faster than anticipated,
and the Interim DRCOG
2025 Regional
Transportation Plan
indicates that I-225 is
projected to experience
“pervasive and severe”
congestion in the future.
The corridor does not
have the sufficient
capacity or facilities to
handle increased demand from employment
growth within the corridor or the increased
demand from regional growth.
The recommendations for the I-225 Corridor
were developed through an MIS conducted
by RTD between 1998 and 2001. The MIS
recommended light rail transit from I-225
and Parker Road to Peoria and Smith Roads
and the widening of I-225 to eight lanes.
The light rail alignment of the I-225 Corridor
generally begins at the Nine Mile park-nRide and traverses northerly within the
median of I-225 and then turns eastward into
the Aurora City Center. The alignment
traverses northeast through the City Center,
crosses Alameda Parkway and runs north

1-10

along Sable Boulevard to Ellsworth Avenue
where it turns west toward I-225. The
alignment then runs northward along I-225
I-225 LRT will serve Aurora in addition
to providing a key regional rail linkage
between the East Corridor and
Southeast Corridor.
to Colfax Avenue where it turns west,
crossing over I-225, and turns north along
the proposed Sand Creek
Parkway. At Montview
Boulevard, the alignment turns
west into Fitzsimons. On the
west side of Fitzsimons, it turns
north at Peoria to terminate at
Smith Road.
The FasTracks Plan would fund
the transit recommendations
from the MIS subject to the
results of the final
environmental process and
incorporates the latest planning
efforts by the City of Aurora to
serve the Fitzsimons
redevelopment area.

The recommendations for the North Metro
Corridor were developed through an MIS
conducted by RTD between 1998 and 2001.
The MIS recommended an integrated plan of
transit, roadway, bus/high occupancy vehicle
(HOV) lane and corridor preservation to
improve mobility, reduce congestion and
improve access to all parts of the study area.

The North Metro Corridor includes the area
bounded by Pecos Street on the west, I-76
The North Metro Corridor will bring
rail to the northern metropolitan area
as well as preserve additional
opportunities to serve future needs.
on the east, 168th Avenue on the north, and
downtown Denver on the south. The North
Metro Corridor commuter rail line is 18
miles long and connects Thornton,
Northglenn and Commerce City to the
Denver metro area with eight stations and
provides connections to DIA through a rail
transfer at Denver Union Station. The City of
Thornton is planning transit oriented
development (TOD) at many of the proposed
rail stations.
The North Metro area
is forecast to be one of
the fastest growing
areas of the region
over the next 20 years.
Growth rates for both
population and
employment are
forecast to be double
the regional average.
The I-25 and I-76
corridors are forecast
to intensify as
employment corridors,
with the areas
between the two
interstate facilities
filling in with residential development.
Congestion along north I-25 is already
severe, with forecasts indicating increasing
severity and duration of congestion.

The MIS recommended light rail or diesel
multiple unit (self-propelled commuter rail)
transit along the railroad right-of-way from
Denver Union Station to 124th Avenue,
preservation of right-of-way for future rapid
transit or rail service to Brighton, additional
park-n-Rides along the rail line and along
I-25, extension of Bus/HOV lanes on I-25
from US 36 to SH 7, addition of Bus/HOV
lanes on I-76 and SH 224, widening of I-25
and I-76, and implementation of grade
separations on US 85.
The FasTracks Plan would fund a
double-track commuter rail line
along the railroad right-of-way to
124th Avenue, new and improved
park-n-Rides along the commuter
rail line and along I-25, eight
stations and contribution towards
right-of-way preservation for
transit service to Brighton.
Additionally, FasTracks would
extend the rail line on a single
track to SH 7 (160th Avenue) to be
consistent with local planning
efforts by the City of Thornton.
All improvements to be
implemented are subject to the
results of the final environmental process.

The Southeast Corridor (T-REX multi-modal
project) is currently under construction by
RTD and CDOT, and remains on-budget and
on-time to open in 2006. The Southeast
Southeast Corridor LRT will be
enhanced to serve growing demand
and extended to serve additional
communities.
Corridor includes 19.1 miles of light rail
transit with 13 stations along I-25 from
Broadway to Lincoln Avenue and along
I-225 from I-25 to Parker Road, as well as
reconstruction and widening of I-25.
In 2002, the
City of Lone
Tree
approached
RTD with a
formal request
to evaluate the
feasibility of
joining the
RTD district.
(At that time,
the entire City
was not within
the legal
boundaries of
the District).
The request
was made to better serve the current and
future transit needs of the residents and
developing commercial areas. The City of
Lone Tree and RTD partnered to conduct a
study to evaluate the feasibility of extending
the current Southeast Corridor light rail line
south and east to serve the City’s current and
future developments. The study
recommended the extension of light rail
south along I-25 to a new station at the

1-14

Health One Hospital Complex on the west
side of I-25, a cross-over of light rail to the
east side of I-25 to a new station at the
planned Lone Tree Town Center, and an
extension south to an end-of-line station at
RidgeGate. The City and RTD worked
cooperatively to develop a supporting bus
plan. In July 2003, the RTD Board of
Directors accepted voter petitions from the
City of Lone Tree to hold an election in
November 2003 for the purposes of joining
the RTD District. On November 4, 2003,
Lone Tree voters approved annexation into
the District with support from 73 percent of
voters. The Lone Tree extension
improvements are subject to the results of
the final environmental process.
The FasTracks Plan would fund the 2.3mile light rail extension with three stations
into the City of Lone Tree, upgrade the
remainder of the 13 planned T-REX light
rail stations to accommodate four-car

trains, add 520 spaces to the Lincoln park-nRide, and add bicycle and pedestrian
improvements at Arapahoe and Belleview.

The Southwest Corridor light rail line opened
in July 2000, on-time and within budget.
The 8.7-mile light rail line extends parallel to
Santa Fe Drive from
the terminus of the
Central Corridor at I-25
and Broadway to
Mineral Avenue in
Littleton with five
existing stations. Since
its opening, the
Southwest Corridor has
doubled ridership
projections and has
experienced parking
shortages at the park-nRides, particularly at
Englewood City Center
and at the end-of-line
station at Mineral
Avenue.
Based on the overwhelming success of this
corridor, RTD initiated a study to evaluate
alternatives to accommodate existing and
future demand. The Southwest Extension
Transit Corridor Planning and Conceptual
Engineering, study was completed in
December 2002 and recommended
extending the Southwest light rail line to
Highlands Ranch. FasTracks would fund this
2-5-mile extension into Highlands Ranch,
including a new end-of-line station at C470/Lucent Boulevard with 1,000 new
parking spaces. The implementation of this
extension is subject to a final environmental
process.

1-16

FasTracks includes a new station at Bates
Avenue in Englewood, contingent on a
successful financial and operational
arrangement between the city,
RTD, and adjacent property
owners. This agreement would
commit the city to share in the
cost of the station with RTD and
the developer of the adjacent
transit-oriented development.
Further, FasTracks also includes
an additional 440 parking spaces
adjacent to Englewood City
Center station, and modifications
to existing light rail stations to
accommodate four-car light rail
trains.
Consistent with RTD’s transit
oriented development policies,
RTD will be promoting the construction of a
Southwest Corridor LRT will be
enhanced to serve growing demand
and extended to serve Highlands
Ranch.

US 36 Corridor and Longmont
Extension
The US 36 Corridor consists of two elements,
Bus Rapid Transit and Commuter Rail. The
Bus Rapid Transit highway portion would
extend 18 miles along US 36 from I-25 to
Table Mesa park-n-Ride in the City of Boulder
and includes 6 stations located in the center of
US 36 for easy loading and unloading of
passengers. BRT service would extend past
Table Mesa along Broadway to CU-Boulder
and north along 28th Street to 30th & Pearl.
The commuter rail portion of this corridor
would extend along railroad right-of-way from
Denver Union Station in downtown Denver to
the City of Boulder and then on to the City of
Longmont. This 38.1-mile commuter rail
corridor will have seven stations.
US 36 is the major artery connecting the
northwestern communities of
Boulder, Superior, Louisville,
Lafayette, Broomfield,
Westminster and Arvada.
The corridor provides access
to numerous employment
concentrations, including the
City of Boulder, the
University of Colorado, the
Interlocken Business Park,
the Flatiron Crossing regional
mall and downtown Denver.
Travel patterns along US 36
have changed significantly
over the years with the
expansion of urbanized development along the
corridor. Commuter trips are now destined to
multiple locations along the corridor, which
has resulted in significant increases in bidirectional congestion along US 36. Transit
usage is high, with many park-n-Rides and
buses at or over capacity.

lanes along US 36 and implementation of Bus
Rapid Transit service with on-line stations,
widening portions of US 36, a single track
commuter rail line along the railroad right-ofway, and a bikeway along US 36. Subsequent
planning by RTD and the communities resulted
in a recommendation to extend the commuter
rail line to the City of Longmont along the
railroad right-of-way. In 2003, RTD and CDOT
initiated an Environmental Impact Statement
for the US 36 Corridor. This study is currently
on-going.
The FasTracks Plan would fund the transit
recommendations from the MIS, including
funds to upgrade the existing railroad tracks
and build a new adjacent track for the
commuter rail line to Boulder, extend the
commuter rail line to Longmont in
a single track configuration, and
add six commuter rail stations.
Parking will be added in Niwot and
Longmont. FasTracks will also
include a commuter rail station in
Westminster at 71st Avenue and
Lowell Boulevard, and new and
expanded park-n-Rides for both rail
and bus service. For Bus Rapid
Transit, RTD will provide slip
ramps and access improvements to
park-n-Rides from Boulder to
Denver and funding for centerline
Bus Rapid Transit stations,
platforms and a proportional share
of HOV lanes ($66 million in 2002 dollars)
with coordination from CDOT. Also included
is funding ($8 million in 2002 dollars) for the
commuter bikeway. The final transportation
improvements in this corridor are subject to
the results of the on-going EIS.

RTD conducted an MIS between 1998 and
2001 for the corridor which recommended a
set of multi-modal transportation
improvements including extension of HOV

US 36 Commuter Rail and BRT will
improve and extend service for one of
the largest transit markets in the
region.

The West Corridor is a 12.1-mile light rail
transit line that extends west from Denver
Union Station in downtown Denver through
west Denver, Lakewood and Jefferson
County and is served by 11 light rail stations.
The line follows the former Associated
Railroad right-of-way (approximately 12th and
13th Avenues), and parallels West 6th Avenue
and I-70, two of the most congested
highways in the region. Significant
population and employment growth is
West Corridor LRT will provide a
connection between Golden, the
Federal Center, and Downtown
Denver.
forecast for the corridor, creating significant
burdens on both the highways and arterials
in the corridor. The West Corridor would
serve a significant number of
low-income, minority and nonvehicle households that are
transit-dependent and provide
access to employment
opportunities in downtown
Denver and the City of
Lakewood. The West Corridor
has been the subject of
transportation improvement
studies for more than 25 years,
and state and local agencies are
in agreement of the need for
additional transportation
capacity improvements.
RTD initiated an MIS for the West
Corridor in 1997 which recommended
light rail transit in the corridor, as well
as bicycle, pedestrian and roadway
improvements. In 2001, RTD initiated
an EIS and preliminary engineering
efforts for the West Corridor. The RTD
Board adopted the recommendations
from the Draft EIS in August 2003 and
RTD published a Final EIS in September
1-20

2003. RTD submitted the Final EIS to
the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
in October 2003 and held a Final EIS
Public Meeting to review the
document. The FTA issued the Record
of Decision (ROD) on April 19, 2004.
The West Corridor begins at Denver
Union Station and follows the CPV
Spur to the Auraria West Station. It
then proceeds south to approximately
14th Avenue. From this point, it is
grade-separated from the Consolidated
Mainline by a structure over the freight
rail tracks and the South Platte River.
The alignment then follows the former
Associated Railroad right-of-way
alignment westerly. The alignment
remains on the Associated Railroad
from the South Platte River through the
park along
Lakewood Gulch
westerly to Quail
Street. At Quail,
the alignment turns
south still
remaining on the
existing Associated
Railroad trackbed
then across 6th
Avenue on a
structure into the
Federal Center.
From the Federal
Center the alignment continues in a
westerly direction under 6th Avenue
and Union Street and parallels 6th
Avenue on the north side of the
highway to its final end-of-line station
on the west side of the Jefferson County
Government Center. The FasTracks
Plan would fund all recommendations
from the EIS.

Enhanced bus services in the FasTracks Plan
include:

Bus Service Enhancements

1.2.A Enhanced Bus Services
Bus service will continue to be a major
component of RTD’s transit services.
FasTracks offers a family of bus services
tailored to individual markets and linked
together to create a comprehensive network.
RTD recognizes that basic bus services are
critical to our transit-dependent customers, not
only non-driving elderly and disabled patrons,
but also those in lower income communities
who depend upon transit accessibility for
economic and quality of life factors. RTD will
continue to operate Local, Limited, Express,
and Regional fixed route service, call-n-Ride,
access-a-Ride, seniorRide and Special Event
services. FasTracks adds several new bus
service elements such as an extensive bus

• Bus Feeder Service to Rapid Transit
Every rapid transit corridor will have a
reconfigured local bus network to take
advantage of connectivity to rapid transit
lines and serve new destinations as a
result of growth through 2025.
Enhanced feeder service to rapid transit
lines is proposed throughout the region,
as illustrated in Figure 1-12, further
enhancing connections at travel origins
and destinations.
• Suburb-to-Suburb Service
The FasTracks Plan incorporates suburbto-suburb bus service, recognizing that
employment, residential, commercial
and educational opportunities are
dispersed throughout the metro area.

Bus Service Enhancements will serve
growing needs and optimize the
efficiency of services provided.
feeder service to the rail and BRT stations,
suburb-to-suburb bus service along major
corridors, and timed transfer points to improve
bus connections and make it more convenient
for passengers to travel throughout the region.
Following RTD policy, all bus service in
FasTracks will take into account community
input, RTD service standards and the results of
the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
process. Communities also have the option of
choosing other RTD services, such as call-nRides instead of fixed route bus service, to
meet their local service needs.
By 2025, RTD will provide an additional
700,000 hours of bus service annually, an
increase of 36 percent over 2003 bus service
levels. Figure 1-11 illustrates RTD’s bus
service enhancements, with new and improved
service highlighted. Figure 1-12 provides an
overview of future transit service frequencies
for the enhanced FasTracks bus plan.

1-22

New suburb-to-suburb service includes
transit connections between major
employment centers and park-n-Rides in
the outlying areas. The suburb-to-suburb
service is designed around a network of
timed FastConnects, or transfer points.
•

FastConnects
FastConnects provides efficient
connections for those transferring from
one transit vehicle to another. This
applies to bus-to-bus, bus-to-rail, busto-BRT, and rail-to-bus transfers.
Service is designed so that buses and
trains traveling to multiple destinations
are timed to arrived at a major
destination or transfer facility at the
same time, minimizing the time a
passenger has to wait. FastConnects
improves the overall efficiency of the
transit network and reduces travel
times for patrons.
The suburb-to-suburb bus service
connections including FastConnects is
shown in Figure 1-13.

1.3

Transit Facilities

The FasTracks Plan will include investments
in transit facilities to complement the
proposed rapid transit lines and enhanced
bus service. Facilities include park-n-Rides,
transit centers and FastConnects.
1.3.A park-n-Rides
Park-n-Rides are the backbone of the RTD
transit system. Currently there are 65 park-nRides with
over 21,000
spaces. These
facilities
provide
flexibility for
those who
want to use
transit, but
want the convenience of having direct
access to their own vehicle. FasTracks will
provide funding to increase the number of
parking spaces at existing park-n-Ride
facilities and construct new park-n-Rides to
serve growing areas of the metro region.
FasTracks has identified nine park-n-Rides to
be expanded and 31 new park-n-Rides to be
built along major transportation corridors for
a total of over 21,000 new parking spaces.
FasTracks will increase the number of
parking spaces (both existing and under
construction) throughout the district by over
80%. Figure 1-14 shows the park-n-Ride
improvements provided by the FasTracks
Plan.
1.3.B

Transit centers have amenities such as
restrooms, passenger seating, and
concessions. These facilities serve as
collection and distribution points for buses
and rail within central business districts
(CBDs). RTD transit centers include Market
Street Station, Civic Center Station, and the
Boulder Transit Center at 14th/Walnut Street.
Denver Union Station (DUS), described in
the next section, will serve as the major
transit center hub for the region.
FastConnects are designated points where
extensive transit transfers can occur outside
the CBD. These points may be park-n-Rides,
rail stations, designated shopping centers or
employment centers where bus routes
connect.
At these designated points, transfers between
buses and/or rail are coordinated to
minimize wait times between transfers. The
primary purpose of this concept is to
improve transit service for suburb-to-suburb
travel. The FastConnects concept allows for
seamless transit connections between
suburbs and minimizes the wait time
between connections, dramatically
enhancing transit services. At major
FastConnects such as the Federal Center and
Stapleton, additional passenger amenities
will be provided.

Transit Hubs

Transit hubs are facilities where extensive
transfers between transit can occur (i.e., busto-bus transfers, bus-to-rail transfers, bus-toBRT transfers, and rail-to-rail transfers). In
the FasTracks Plan, transit hubs have been
assigned to two categories: transit centers
and FastConnects.

Denver Union Station is the proposed
location for a Downtown Multimodal
Center, a centralized intermodal facility that
provides access to all parts of the Denver
metro region. As the central intermodal hub
for the region, the DUS Vision Plan will
provide access to nearly every rapid transit
corridor included in FasTracks as well as
Regional, Express and Local bus service, the
16th Street Mall, Amtrak, the Ski Train,
Greyhound, and the new Downtown
Circulator.
DUS is located on a 19.5-acre parcel in the
Central Platte Valley. The DUS Master Plan,
currently under development, has identified
a recommended vision for the facility. The
recommended vision locates all rail access to
DUS underground allowing for the extension
of 18th Street between Wynkoop and
Wewatta Streets. The recommended vision
represents the ultimate buildout of DUS
beyond
FasTracks.
FasTracks
includes some
of the elements
of the
recommended
vision. Elements
not included in
FasTracks are to
be funded through other potential funding
sources such as private development.
Elements of the DUS Vision Plan that are
part of FasTracks include:

•

Construction of below-grade light rail
access into DUS;

•

Improvements to at-grade commuter
rail access into DUS;

•

Construction of components to
facilitate transfers such as
underground passenger waiting
areas, concessions and restrooms;
and
•

Accommodation of
multiple forms of
transportation
including Ski Train,
Amtrak, taxis, the
16th Street Mall
Shuttle, and the
new Downtown
Circulator.

In addition to providing enhanced
connections, Denver Union Station also
provides an opportunity to create a dense,
mixed-use transit oriented development
adjacent to the transit facility. The Denver
Union Station Master Plan identifies an
opportunity for nearly two million square
feet of development on the DUS site.

DUS will be the “Grand Central
Station” of Denver as the center of the
regional transit system in the heart of
the city.

The transportation improvements at DUS are
subject to the results of the Environmental
Impact Statement in progress.

Transit Amenities

The FasTracks Plan incorporates
improvements to increase passenger security,
convenience and access to the system.
Major elements include the following:
1.4.A Passenger Security and
Information
FasTracks will provide an expansion of
RTD’s passenger security system. Emergency
phones and security cameras will be
installed at all stations and major park-nRides. In addition to cameras on RTD buses
and rail vehicles, security provisions include
remote monitoring of rail and bus stations
through RTD’s Security Command Center at
the Mariposa light rail facility. Using state-ofthe-art
equipment,
RTD is able
to transmit
live camera
pictures to a
viewing
center
located
inside the
RTD Security Command Center. This room
is monitored by trained technicians who
review the live pictures for signs of activity
requiring either a law enforcement response
or the rendering of other aid. All cameras
record continuously and these recordings are
kept for periods of up to one month to allow
after-the-fact review of incidents. RTD
places cameras on train platforms and in
parking lots that service light rail stations.
Upon completion of the T-REX project, 256
cameras will be monitored. In addition,
RTD employs a private security firm to
provide on-site monitoring of RTD transit
facilities.

Real time passenger information will be in
place for major rail stations along the
Southwest, Southeast and Central Platte

Bicycle Facilities

FasTracks will provide bike racks at all
stations, bike lockers at major stations and
park-n-Rides, and will accommodate bike
access to rail stations and park-n-Rides from
existing bike paths and bike routes.
FasTracks will also contribute half the cost of
the proposed bike path along the US 36
corridor.

The Regional Transportation District (the “District” or “RTD”), has developed a comprehensive $4.7
billion Plan, known as “FasTracks” for addressing mobility needs in the metropolitan Denver region
over the next twelve years. The ability to implement the FasTracks plan depends on a variety of
financial assumptions and projections that have been developed using the best available current
estimates of costs, reasonably anticipated federal funding based on current federal law and
regulations, and revenues from other sources including RTD sales tax and fare collections. Over the
anticipated build-out of twelve years specific cost items, federal and other contributions, and RTD
revenues may vary. Based on the extensive analysis behind the financial assumptions used, RTD
expects to deliver the major transit corridors and related improvements within the time frames set forth
previously. RTD cannot guarantee that each separate assumption will be met, and expects that over a
twelve year time-frame, certain adjustments and modifications will be required. This section details the
assumptions used and provides further explanation as to how RTD expects to pay for the FasTracks
Plan.
Unlike typical transit development strategies, which are pursued one corridor at a time and can take
decades to accomplish, the Plan offers a comprehensive, region-wide approach to transit
development.
Under the Plan, 40 miles of Light Rail, 79 miles of Commuter Rail and 18 miles of Bus rapid transit
improvements will be developed between 2005 and 2017.
Base bus service levels will increase by 1% per year between the years 2006 and 2020, and by 1.5%
per year between 2021 and 2025. Overall, 2025 bus revenue service hours will increase by 30% over
2003 service levels.
In order to finance the Plan, the District will seek voter approval for a 0.4% increase in the regional
sales and use tax. This will bring the total transit tax rate in the District to 1%, comparable to other
areas in the Western United States with urban rail systems.
The Plan also anticipates $815.4 million in Federal discretionary new start grant funding in conjunction
with $110.0 million in other Federal grant funding, and contributions from local jurisdictions benefiting
from transit in an amount equal to 2.01% of total project costs or $95.03 million system-wide.
In addition to Federal grants, the Plan assumes a loan from the US DOT under the Transportation
Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (“TIFIA”) program in the amount of $142.7 million.
Table 2-1 summarizes the sources of funds expected to pay for the Plan’s $4.7 billion of project
expenditures:

The District has proposed a $4.7 billion Plan designed to transform urban mobility opportunity in the
metropolitan Denver region within a twelve-year period. Unlike the traditional corridor-by-corridor
approach, usually highly dependent on external funding from the Federal government, the District’s
Plan allows local policy makers and voters to direct the agenda in terms of project delivery and funding
options. The Plan responds to the projected increase in District population to 3.39 million in 2025.
Integral to the Plan is the ability to simultaneously improve mobility throughout the region. This
approach will not only address congestion needs, but will also provide an unprecedented economic
stimulus to the region, providing a measure of protection against recession through 2017.
The Plan includes six new multi-modal corridors involving light rail, commuter rail and bus rapid transit
improvements. Base bus service levels will increase by 1% per year between the years 2006-2020,
and by 1.5% per year between 2021 and 2025. Overall, 2025 bus revenue service hours will increase
by 30% over 2003 service levels. Significant expansions to the existing Southwest, Southeast, Central
Platte Valley and Central corridors, parking enhancements and additional buses and LRVs for the
current system are also funded.

Revenues
Since inception, the primary funding source for the District has been a sales and use tax imposed on
transactions within the District boundaries. Effective January 1, 1974, the District imposed a tax
equal to 0.5%. On May 1, 1983, the tax was increased to 0.6% or six-tenths of one percent and the
tax base was adjusted. The current tax generates revenues of $210.447 million annually (2003).
As seen in Table 2-3, although revenues are down in 2002-2003, the District has experienced sales
tax growth over the past decade up to 12.4% per annum.

In November, 2003, voters in the City of Lone Tree approved annexation into the RTD District. In
February, 2004, the RTD Board of Directors annexed the Park Meadows Mall into the District. The
sales and use tax forecasts assume that RTD will begin collecting sales and use tax from Lone Tree
as of January 1, 2004, and from Park Meadows as of July 1, 2004. This results in an increase of
$4.758 million to RTD's base collections in 2004, and an additional increase of $1.257 million to
RTD's base collections in 2005.
Fundamental to the Plan, is the assumption of a voter-approved increase in the sales and use tax
during the November, 2004 election of an additional 0.4%. This would bring the total sales tax rate to
1%, equal to that imposed for transit in Dallas, Houston, and Los Angeles, Santa Clara, San Mateo
Counties in California, and the total sales taxes for transportation in the San Francisco Bay Area
Counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Francisco.
The 0.4% tax is assumed to be effective on January 1, 2005, and would initially generate an
additional $158.2 million in sales and use tax revenues annually. Both the new incremental tax and
revenue from the existing tax are used to fund the Plan.

The sales tax growth rates used by RTD to project revenue growth in the plan are based on two
sources. Sales tax growth projections from 2004 through 2009 were based on the Colorado
Legislative Council (CLC) forecasts. The sales tax growth rates for the years 2010 through 2025 were
provided by AECOM which based their forecasts on data from the Center for Business and Economic
Forecasting (CBEF). CLC growth forecasts, while for the entire state, are used in the report because
the Denver region constitutes over half the population of the state.
Assumed growth rates are shown in Figure 2-2:

Packet Pg. 215

1.C.5.b

Local Contributions
This Plan assumes that this policy will continue and that impacted jurisdictions will contribute an
amount in aggregate equal to 2.5% of the eligible corridor costs, which equates to 2.01% of total
project costs. On a plan wide basis, the amount of this contribution is estimated to total $95.03
million.
The source of funding for the local contribution is at the discretion of each local jurisdiction. Local
contributions could consist of right-of-way dedications, permit fee waivers, cash contributions,
corridor utility relocations as well as any other direct, project-related corridor contributions. Generally
throughout the system, the financial benefits from transit development in terms of assessed
valuations, enhanced development potential, reduced travel times and improved congestion accrue
to the local communities.
On February 17, 2004, the RTD Board of Directors approved a resolution entitled “Regarding Board
Commitments for FasTracks (Hold Harmless)”. This action confirmed RTD’s commitment to build
each corridor’s specific list of corridor improvements consistent with and as described in the
FasTracks Plan and within the fiscal constraints and schedule of the plan subject to the completion of
the environmental process and conformity with any federal Record of Decision for a corridor. It further
formalized the commitment to analyze the Plan annually to determine current revenue projections
from both local and federal sources. The resolution states, “If RTD revenues are better or worse than
expected then all the corridors will be adjusted accordingly.”
Additionally, the Hold Harmless resolution commits "that prior to construction, a corridor cost risk
assessment and value engineering (will) be conducted to minimize the potential for cost overruns and
schedule delays. Based on the results of both analyses, modifications to individual corridor project
elements, service plans, and schedules may be necessary for all FasTracks corridors.This may be
necessary so as to not impact the scheduled construction and operation of the remaining FasTracks
corridors, thereby "holding harmless" those corridors. This information shall be reported annually to
the general public.
Furthermore, the sixth point in the approved resolution reads as follows: “Construction of FasTracks
committed improvements within a corridor will not start until there is a firm commitment of all required
funding sources, be they private, local-match or federal monies and intergovernmental agreements
are in place with local governments concerning permits, design and plan review proves for timely
implementation.”

Federal Funding
Both the Southwest and the Southeast corridor projects were undertaken with assistance from the
Federal Transit Administration in the form of New Start Grant funds. Under Federal procedures, once
a project is qualified for funding, the FTA enters into a “Full Funding Grant Agreement” or FFGA. The
Agreement sets forth the maximum amount of the Federal contribution, and the percentage of federal
funding. In the case of the Southwest Corridor, the federal New Start percentage was 68% and in the
case of Southeast the Federal percentage was 60% of the project costs.
The Plan assumes that only three corridors, the East, West and Gold Line, will seek federal
discretionary funding through an FFGA. The total amount of Federal funding is assumed to be
$815.4 million in Federal New Start Grant funds and $110.0 million of other Federal grant revenues.
Of the $110.0 million, the Plan includes $50 million in federal assistance from FTA in the form of bus
discretionary funds for Denver Union Station or for other bus projects such as vehicles and facilities.
In addition, the Plan assumes $60 million in federal flexible dollars through the DRCOG planning
process between years 2010 and 2015 consistent with the District's past receipts. The New Start
funding is assumed to equal to 49% of the project costs for each of the corridors.

2-7

Attachment: 2019 FasTracks Unfinished Corridors Report draft 6-14 (002) (3875 : FasTracks Resolution Staff Report)

Beginning with the Central Platte Valley and the Southeast Corridor project, the District has
established a policy of requiring a portion of major project costs to be paid by local jurisdictions.

Packet Pg. 216

The District has the option to focus Federal participation in other corridors, or to seek Federal funding
for multiple corridors in response to Federal policy initiatives or funding availability in the future. The
Federal transit program is currently subject to reauthorization. As with prior reauthorizations, the
level of federal match is subject to change by the Congress. Although the statutory local match has
been at 20% for some time, the practical match for competitive projects has been historically near the
40% level. Congress may change the statutory match in subsequent reauthorizations. Federal
receipts are assumed to be capped at a reasonable appropriation level based on past RTD receipts
of New Start Grant Funding and current Federal funding practices. Therefore the financial plan has
accounted for instances when the Federal funding is received after the year in which the costs are
incurred.

Interest Earnings
During the construction period, the District will accumulate balances of both sales tax revenues as
well as bond proceeds awaiting expenditures. In developing the Plan, debt issuances were
scheduled every two years to allow the District to take advantage of federal arbitrage rules generally
allowing local issuers to keep positive interest earnings if all bond proceeds are expended within a
designated two-year test.
The Plan assumes investment revenues will be earned at a rate equal to 4.0%. Thus, with the
exception of the variable rate debt, we have not assumed any net positive arbitrage on bond
proceeds. Any such earnings would act as either additional revenues or as an offset against higher
borrowing costs.
Sales tax cash balances have been managed to ensure a projected minimum of $25 million in the
Transit Development Reserve at the end of each year.
Between 2005 and 2017, investment earnings are projected to total $234.34 million.

Farebox Revenue Forecasts
Base System
Base system farebox revenues were based on the forecast contained in RTD’s 2004 Adopted
Budget. This forecast was based on the 2003 Amended Budget forecast of farebox revenues,
adjusted for the fare increase that occurred on January 1, 2004, and the additional service provided
as of January 1, 2004 with the annexation of the city of Lone Tree into the RTD District.
Farebox revenue forecasts for the base system for the years 2005-2025 assumed growth based on
population growth and service growth. Farebox revenues were assumed to increase with the rate of
population growth each year, due to ridership increases associated with population growth.
Additional increases were tied to increases in service, with farebox revenue assumed to increase at
75% of the systemwide average revenue per service hour with each increased hour of bus service
provided. These adjustments were initially applied in constant 2004 dollars.
FasTracks Corridors
For the FasTracks corridors, RTD prepared travel forecasts for the horizon years of 2015 and 2025.
Both forecasts assumed the full build-out of the FasTracks rapid transit system. Although some lines
open later than 2015, these forecasts allowed RTD to understand ridership growth as a result of
population and employment growth between those horizon years.
Second, RTD combined the construction schedule with the forecasts. Passenger fare revenues were
assumed to start six months after operating costs are incurred. This reflects the fact that each
corridor will incur operating costs for six months of testing and start-up, before passenger fares are
collected.

The travel forecasting model produces daily ridership estimates. The fare recovery rates are applied,
then the daily fare totals are annualized. The annualization factor was adjusted to ensure that it did
not overestimate fare revenues for existing years of 2001 and 2002, and also cross-checked for
reasonableness. The Federal Transit Administration allows annualization factors of up to 300x daily
ridership in the Federal New Starts process. FasTracks was calibrated at 288x daily ridership from
the model, well under the allowable standard.
Fare Increases
The initial farebox revenue projections were developed in constant year dollars, and adjusted to
incorporate fare increases to keep pace with inflation. RTD fiscal policies state that RTD’s six-year
Transit Development Program (TDP) will include periodic fare increases to permit fare revenues to
keep pace with cost increases, as measured by the Denver-Boulder Consumer Price Index (CPI-U).
Over the past 15 years, the timing of these increases has ranged from annually, as in the years 20022004, to an eight-year period between the 1989 and 1997 fare increases.

corridor in constant 2001 dollars. Based upon the forecast boardings by station, RTD estimated the
percentages of riders on each corridor expected to be paying local, express, regional, and skyRide
fares. Table 2-4 shows the 2001 average fare paid by class of service.

The 2004-2009 TDP, as adopted by the Board of Directors in August 2003, assumed fare increases
in 2006 and 2009 to keep pace with inflation. These fare increases were assumed to yield an 8%

increase in fare revenue after any ridership loss caused by the fare increases. The FasTracks
farebox revenue forecasts assume that these fare increases will be implemented, and that similar
fare increases will be implemented every third year after 2009. Therefore, the constant dollar
revenue forecasts were adjusted to nominal dollars by assuming an 8% revenue increase every third
year, beginning in 2006.

Debt Financing Requirements
Historically, the District has utilized two primary debt-financing techniques: Sales Tax Revenue
Bonds and Certificates of Participation (COPs). This section describes a possible scenario for
utilizing these methods of financing, along with other borrowing methods including commercial paper
and federal loans. Provided RTD keeps within voter approved ballot authorizations for debt and
repayment, RTD may use any combination of legally available financing methods and the amounts
set forth in the discussion below are subject to change.
The District currently has $273,415,000 in sales tax bonds outstanding. In August 2001, a
commercial paper program, secured by sales tax revenues on a junior lien to the fixed rate sales tax
bonds was implemented in the amount of $118.5 million. Of this amount, $92.5 million has been
issued.
Table 2-6 shows the debt service requirements for the existing bonds, and estimated debt service
requirements for the currently authorized bonds.

The District has used COPs, which are a form of lease purchase debt for financing buses and rail
vehicles. COPs are not secured by a pledge of the sales tax revenues themselves, but represent a
lease secured by the equipment and the District’s commitment to appropriate payments in each
annual budget.

Of the $118.5 million authorized commercial paper, it is estimated that $92.5 million will be issued,
with interest debt service on the CP estimated to be $3.1 million annually and the principal scheduled
to be retired between 2006 and 2008.

The Plan assumes that new debt authorization will be sought from the voters in 2004. Bonds to
finance the Plan will be secured by the full 1% sales tax that will then be in effect.

Bond issues are staggered in two-year increments in order to reduce costs associated with issuance
and to provide the opportunity for the District to take advantage of arbitrage earnings opportunities.
Bonds are assumed to be issued on a fixed rate basis, but this is not required. An assumed TIC
(True Interest Cost) of 6.354% representing current rates plus a margin in excess of 100 basis points
was used in the Plan. For Plan purposes, all bonds were assumed to be issued on January 1 of their
respective years of issuance and have a thirty year maturity.
An additional $213.5 million in debt was assumed to be issued as COPs. COP debt service is not
covered by TABOR restrictions.

In the Southeast Corridor Plan, the District addressed the problem of lagging Federal grant receipts
through the creation of a commercial paper program. Commercial paper allows the District to provide
short term, interim financing of the Federal cash flow and thus keep the project on schedule.
While it is currently impossible to predict the ability of the FTA to meet its cash flow requirements in
the 2007-2017 timeframe, it is highly probable that some form of interim financing will be required.
As with the Southeast Corridor Plan of Finance, a Tax Exempt Commercial Paper Program (CP) is
recommended as an interim funding vehicle to ensure delays in the receipt of Federal Funds do not
delay the construction of the corridors.

Attachment: 2019 FasTracks Unfinished Corridors Report draft 6-14 (002) (3875 : FasTracks Resolution Staff Report)

Sales tax revenue bonds are provided as the “backbone” of the financing program. This is because
senior lien sales tax bonds provide the strongest security, and thus lowest long-term borrowing costs
to the District.

Commercial paper is a commonly used financing tool that allows issuers to “ramp-up” their debt for a
term ranging from one day to 270 days. This flexibility makes it possible for issuers to keep the debt

2-13

Packet Pg. 222

1.C.5.b

In the case of the FasTracks Plan, $815.4 million of commercial paper is assumed. This will fund
expected Federal commitments with the funding schedule varying for each corridor. In other words,
the Plan allows federal support to lag the project cash flow requirements without delaying the
construction schedule.

TIFIA Loan
TIFIA, or the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 provides a new source
of project financing to eligible projects. Under the provisions of TIFIA, the US DOT can provide direct
loans, credit enhancement or lines of credit.
To date, TIFIA has approved financing instruments totaling $3.59 billion for 11 projects. Transit
projects that have utilized TIFIA include Washington Metro, the Tren Urbano project in Puerto Rico,
the Staten Island Ferries, Miami Intermodal Center and the New York Penn Station renovations.
Eligible projects must meet some specific federal criteria. These include the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Project must be at least $100 million
TIFIA support limited to 33% of project costs
Project adheres to federal project requirements (labor, civil rights,etc.)
Repayment must be from project revenues or non-federal tax sources
Project sponsors senior debt must be investment grade

In the case of the Plan, we have recommended a loan in the amount of $142.95 representing 33% of
the North Metro project costs. (The District may choose to program a different corridor for federal
participation depending on project delivery strategy at the time of implementation).
The advantage of the TIFIA program is it allows the District to borrow on a subordinate basis to its
other debt. The financing rate is based on the 30-year Treasury bond rate, which is currently 5.07%.
(The basis of the rate will be related to a spread over the SLGS rate as Treasury phases out the 30year bond but will be comparable). For purposes of this plan a 6.00% TIFIA rate was assumed.
Repayment of the loan may be deferred to accommodate senior debt requirements and amortized
over 35 years. Loans may also be repaid early without penalty. While the interest rate is higher than
traditional tax-exempt debt, it is low compared to other deeply subordinate debt options and it
provides excellent flexibility.
The current federally adopted selection criteria for TIFIA projects include the following eight elements:
(1) The extent to which the project is nationally or regionally significant, in terms of generating
economic benefits, supporting international commerce, or otherwise enhancing the national
transportation system (20 percent);
(2) The creditworthiness of the project, including a determination by the Secretary that any
financing for the project has appropriate security features, such as a rate covenant, to ensure
repayment (12.5 percent);
(3) The extent to which such assistance would foster innovative public-private partnerships and
attract private debt or equity investment (20 percent);
(4) The likelihood that such assistance would enable the project to proceed at an earlier date
than the project would otherwise be able to proceed (12.5 percent);
(5) The extent to which the project uses new technologies, including Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) that enhance the efficiency of the project (5 percent);

2-14

Attachment: 2019 FasTracks Unfinished Corridors Report draft 6-14 (002) (3875 : FasTracks Resolution Staff Report)

outstanding for only the time it is needed, until permanent funds are received. In recent years, nearly
every transit agency undertaking a new start project with federal funding as identified the need for an
interim funding vehicle such as commercial paper. Commercial paper may be issued using any
legally available technique for rate determination.

Packet Pg. 223

(6) The amount of budget authority required to fund the Federal credit instrument made available
(5 percent);
(7) The extent to which the project helps maintain or protect the environment (20 percent);
(8) The extent to which such assistance would reduce the contribution of Federal grant
assistance to the project (5 percent).
The TIFIA program, like the FTA program is subject to reauthorization, and its availability to
provide support to the Plan is dependent on its reauthorization.

The Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR), or Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution,
approved by Colorado voters in November 1992, restricts the ability of the District to enter into a
multi-year fiscal obligation without voter approval unless there are adequate present cash reserves.
TABOR also requires voter approval in advance for: (i) any increase in the District’s revenues and
spending from one year to the next in excess of a specified growth rate, (CPI plus a growth factor
based on net increase in the value of new taxable property) (ii) any new tax or tax increase.
The Plan is premised on voters approving a ballot issue in the November 2004 election the wording
of which was established by the Colorado legislature. It would give the District the necessary
authority to issue debt, increase the current tax rate by 0.4% and keep the revenue to build the
system. A portion of the tax increase may remain after the system is built, as operating costs for the
expanded system may be higher than for the current system.
While the increase in the authorized tax rate is fairly straight forward, the authorization for debt must
estimate both the principal amount of debt issued and the expected interest rate for transactions
extending through 2013. COPs have not been treated as debt subject to TABOR approval by the
Colorado courts and they are not included in the voter authorization.
There are three elements of the financial plan subject to the TABOR requirements: fixed rate bonds,
commercial paper and the proposed TIFIA loan. All of the estimated principal and interest for these
items are included in the amounts the voters will be asked to approve. How the principal and interest
is allocated among these different financing mechanisms is subject to change. The total amount of
principal and debt service the voters will be asked to approve is shown in Table 2-10.

As with any long range capital improvement plan, the actual implementation of the Plan is dependent
on project costs, inflation factors, revenue trends, and interest rate environment in the future. These
factors can never be predicted over a thirteen year horizon with exact precision.
For this reason, the Plan reflects significant contingencies. For example, the project cost estimates
contain a price contingency. Interest rates have been assumed to be over 150 basis points higher
than the Colorado municipal market data tax exempt current market rate of 4.81%. Variable interest
rates have been assumed to be more than 200 basis points over the current Bond Market
Association (BMA) index rate of 1.02%.
The FasTracks cost estimates also include contingency factors to account for unforeseen changes in
project scope or unit cost increases beyond general rates of inflation. The contingency was applied
to the items with the greatest risk factors for unforeseen cost changes, with factors varying by the
assessment of potential risk. Table 2-11 shows the overall contingency factors by cost element.

Thus, the FasTracks cost estimates used in the cash flow already include a total of $573 million in
uninflated dollars for contingency.
The Plan also automatically assumes that Federal grants will be received two years after initial
eligibility. To the extent Federal funding is provided on a more-timely basis, some of the debt
assumed in the Plan will be unnecessary.
Should the District be faced with a significant economic recession, or find project costs are
substantially higher than are currently estimated, and that such costs exceed the contingency budget,
the District has several options to address this situation. These include delaying projects, modifying
the scope of certain projects, seeking additional Federal or local funding or seeking additional voter
approved funding options. Prior to taking any of these actions, the Board will hold full and complete
public hearings and provide sufficient notice to the stakeholders in the region.

RTD Draft Initial Unfinished Corridors Report (June 14, 2019)
Board Member Questions and DRAFT Staff Responses
July 2, 2019
This document provides the questions posed by the RTD Board of Directors regarding the RTD Draft
Initial Unfinished Corridors Report at the June 18, 2019 RTD Board of Directors meeting and in
subsequent communications from Board members to RTD staff, as well as the initial RTD Staff
responses.
Note that some of the Board’s questions at the Board meeting were answered in the course of that
meeting. Not all of those questions are included in this document. Additionally, as noted, some
questions require additional time for staff response and the answers will be provided to the Board at a
later date.

T

Question 1: In the past there have been regional ballot questions approving tax increases for stadiums
and other types of capital improvements that included provisions for the sunset of the tax. Under the
funding scenarios (3a through 3e) that include a potential sales tax increase election, was there a similar
consideration made to sunset the tax?

DR

Response 1: No, not in these analyses, however that is something that can be analyzed if the Board
expresses interest in further developing these scenarios. Note that the 2004 FasTracks ballot included
provisions for a partial sunset of the 0.4% sales and use tax increase following the repayment of debt, to
the level required to operate and maintain the FasTracks improvements in a state of good repair.
Question 2: There are portions of the metropolitan area (Aurora subdivisions, Castle Rock and portions
of southern Weld County, for example) that are not included within the legal boundaries of RTD. Should
we consider reconstituting RTD’s boundaries to include these areas, and if so what kind of revenues
would that generate?
Response 2: Staff can support these discussions and provide revenue estimates, which will vary
depending on the geographical areas included. This topic has been included as a task in the scope of
work for the Transportation Transformation Comprehensive Plan.
Question 3: Can you provide additional information from the 2014 Northwest Area Mobility Study
(NAMS) for the Northwest Rail Corridor by adding a column to the table on page 11 detailing the
ridership, cost and travel time information for the Boulder to Longmont segment.

1. Eagle Project Capital Costs $2,286.5 million have not been allocated between corridors since the
single project includes shared track segments (Gold and NW Rail) and shared maintenance
facility under the single P3 contract.
2. 2017 O&M costs are fully allocated costs, not incremental. Forecasts for the future corridors are
incremental costs without an allocation of the existing overhead, and not directly comparable.

Daily Ridership, Capital Costs and Annual O&M Costs

Packet Pg. 255

Question 5: Stakeholders have expressed enthusiasm regarding the Northwest Rail Peak Service Plan
based on previous estimates that the capital costs were approximately $117 million in 2018 dollars. The
estimate in this Report is significantly higher. We will need to address these expectations.
Response 5: Agreed that these expectations need to be addressed. To that end, when staff has
presented the $117 million estimate, we have always noted that the cost estimate is only for RTD capital
costs and does not include the cost of BNSF infrastructure upgrades and operating slots, nor does it
include costs for needed right-of-way.

AF

T

In the Report, further explanation is provided as follows “In support of this report, RTD has also updated
the order-of-magnitude capital cost estimates for the NWR Peak Service Plan using an approach that we
believe is conservative. These updated cost estimates are based on actual commuter rail cost experience
for the Eagle and North Metro projects and on the cost information provided by BNSF through the 2011
work described in this report (which is substantially different from the current NWR Peak Service Plan).
These order-of-magnitude estimates have not been provided by, nor reviewed by, the BNSF railroad.”
We also note that “Since 2017, RTD has continued to discuss and analyze the NWR Peak Service Plan
with stakeholders to gain a better understanding of the related opportunities and challenges. To this
end, in the summer of 2018, RTD submitted a letter to the BNSF requesting feedback on the Peak
Service Plan. Subsequently, RTD has sent periodic status requests to BNSF and based on their most
recent response, we understand that the railroad is working on a formal response which will include
their feedback on the proposal.”
Question 6: How reasonable is it that BNSF would have track “just laying around.”

DR

Response 6: The BNSF line from Denver to Longmont is the Front Range Subdivision. BNSF has over
32,000 miles of track across 28 states within the US. The Front Range is an element within the BNSF
system, running 10 -17 trains a day across this section of track. BNSF utilizes all their subdivisions on a
regular basis and in emergencies will change the primary purpose to handle reroutes and temporary
service. Bottom-line, BNSF does not have track just laying around, it is part of their entire network and
they know it is almost impossible to buy additional corridors. Therefore, they are very careful regarding
the restrictions they place on their infrastructure.

Question 7: All these cost scenarios talk about RTD funding, what about grants like RTD received for the
Southeast Corridor Rail Extension? The Board wants to hear more about these opportunities.
Response 7: In the Weekly GM and CEO Summary dated June 20, 2019, Mr. Genova provided a copy of
the presentation entitled “Future Construction FasTracks Corridors Federal Funding Analysis” that was
provided at the July 5, 2016 FasTracks Monitoring Committee meeting.
Question 8: Let us know your strategies in putting together a proactive ask for a tax increase and the
opportunities for collaboration with key stakeholders.

T

Response 8: Staff have been monitoring and participating in dialogue and meetings convened by
stakeholders such as the Metro Mayors Caucus and Denver Regional Council of Governments regarding
various funding mechanisms for transportation at the regional and state levels. We will continue to do
so and keep the Board apprised and involved especially if and when policy level discussions occur. The
Board’s continued dialogue and engagement around the Draft Initial Unfinished Corridors Report
supports these collaboration opportunities.

AF

Question 9: When the Board revisits this Report at the July 9 Committee meeting, be prepared to talk
about strategies regarding inclusivity.
Response 9: Staff is prepared to participate in and support this discussion.

DR

Question 10: Some Board members expressed an interest in receiving information on railroad topics
pertinent to the Northwest Rail and BNSF operations. For example, years ago, freight trains would pull
into sidings and passenger trains would be able to pass by; now the priority has reversed. Why? Also,
while there is a lot of coal train traffic today, the trend is that coal power plants are being closed and the
coal trains going away, how will that affect available track time? Would like some discussion from
BNSF’s viewpoint on sharing tracks with them.
Response 10: Capital Programs staff is working on a response. One option under review is to schedule
an in-depth “Railroads 201” session for those Board member that have an interest in these and related
topics; another is to make appropriate staff available for a more informal question and answer session.
Also, as noted in the Report and in the Response to Question 5, RTD has reached out to the BNSF for
input on the NW Rail Peak Service Plan and is awaiting an expected response from the railroad.
Question 11: There are trade-offs between the need to provide sustainable service throughout the
District, to our diverse passenger base and populations, vis-a-vis the expansion of rapid transit corridors.
Please be prepared to speak to that dichotomy and how that interacts with the various scenarios.
Response 11: Staff is prepared to participate in and support this discussion. This is a topic that will also
be central to the work, citizen and stakeholder engagement and analyses within the Transportation
Transformation Comprehensive Plan.
Question 12: RTD has a revenue source that other transportation providers do not have, that is the fares
that we charge passengers for our services. Can we explore lowering our fares in conjunction with a
potential request of the voters for a tax increase?

Response 12: Yes, if there is direction to continue analyzing relevant Scenarios, at the Board’s direction,
Staff can analyze the financial, operational, capacity and ridership opportunities and constraints of such
an approach.
Question 13: This question references the analyses which assume a TABOR election for additional
bonding authority – both Scenarios 2a - 2c and 3a – 3e. Doesn’t the amount of money and debt to be
issued under each of these scenarios vary greatly dependent on how much bonding authority is
requested, what year it is placed on the ballot, and whether or not the money is “banked” or spent
immediately? Presuming so, then isn’t there a great potential variability of results based on what is
asked for from the voters and when? Could RTD develop different scenario results if we just asked for
more money to bond and what are the practical limits and constraints based on our ability to pay back
the bonds?

T

Response 13: Yes, with additional time, staff can develop different scenarios in the future. Note that the
current scenarios that model bonding authority only (Scenarios 2a – 2c) program the bond issuances
based on when RTD would be able to repay the debt and maintain operations. Per IRS regulations, we’re
not allowed to “bank” money and earn interest on it; we have to have a plan to spend the proceeds
within specified time frames.

DR

AF

Question 14: Last year's sales and use tax forecasts from the CU Leeds School of Business were much
rosier than this year’s, which were used to prepare the scenarios contained in this report. I want to
assure citizens and stakeholders that these forecasts change regularly, and that each change can bring
vastly different forecasts, with none of the results being guaranteed because they are all so speculative.
To this end, I am interested in seeing what Scenarios 1a and 1b would look like, vis-à-vis the capacity to
deliver the Northwest Rail Corridor Full Service and Peak Service? Would it be possible to run these to
see the results?
Response 14: Yes, with additional time, staff can develop different scenarios in the future.
Question 15: Leeds sales tax forecasts change and they change our projected cash flow. The last Leeds
projection showed a lot of excess of revenue over expenditure in a cash flow graph, beginning in 2026.
Now, there is a new Leeds projection – when did that come out?
Response 15: We get two forecasts per year, one in March and one in September. The most recent
sales and use tax forecast came out in March 2019. In April, Leeds presented the forecast to the RTD
Board of Directors.
Question 16: Would it be possible to see a cash flow chart comparison between the two vastly different
Leeds forecasts, to be able to see the difference in when money would become available?
Response 16: See Attachment 1, which compares the March 2019 forecast to the September 2018
forecast. The September forecast was used for the 2019 Budget and the March forecast will be used for
the Mid-Term Financial Plan and Long Range Financial Plan.
Question 17: It would be good to see a visual comparison. (Reference prior cash flow chart from 2018
showing lots of potential money.)

Response 17: We included cash flow comparisons for each of the scenarios in the report that was sent
to the Board. The prior cash flow charts included only debt service and O&M costs, and did not include
the programmed capital expenditures. The cash flow comparisons in the report to the Board include
capital expenditures.
Question 18: Was it only the tax projections that changed under Leeds?
Response 18: Leeds only does sales and use tax forecasts for RTD. RTD forecasts the other revenue
streams internally.
Question 19: What revenue streams lead into the Leeds revenue streams, and did they change? If yes,
can we see a comparison of the different revenue streams?
Response 19: Leeds uses Moody’s forecasts and several other economic factors to arrive at their sales
and use tax forecast. In addition, they take into consideration RTD’s historical tax collection results.
Leeds does not looks at RTD’s other revenue streams.

AF

T

Question 20: To say, on page 14 of the Report, that all unrestricted funds balances are negative assumes
that the expenditures aren’t subject to choice. Isn’t it possible we could lower our expenditures by
forestalling base projects?

DR

Response 20: We could; however, the 2026-2040 long range plan only has projects that replace or
maintain existing assets in a state of good repair. The Board would need to reduce bus service below
existing levels, or allow existing assets to deteriorate below a state of good repair, in order to provide
funding from the base system to complete FasTracks projects. For the Mid-Term Financial Plan staff
provides a list of projects funded by the base system to the Board for review.
Question 21: What are the base projects that are included in the base expenditures that result in 20212049 base fund balances always being negative?
Response 21: See response to previous question (Question 20).
Question 22: Given that we want to finish FasTracks corridors, couldn’t the Board see the priority list of
base projects so we can decide whether to include them or forestall them, and thus possibly use the
freed-up revenues for construction of FasTracks corridors?
Response 22: Yes, this list is provided to the Board prior to the adoption of the Mid-Term Financial Plan
each year. Please see attachments 2 and 3 for the 2019 – 2024 Mid-Term Financial Plan list that was
approved by the Board last fall.
Question 23: Can we be provided a list of FasTracks bonds, and another list of base bonds, with the
sunset date for each?
Response 23: Attachment 4 has a chart showing the debt service requirements for all of RTD’s debt
obligations which gives a good idea of the cash flow impacts. The debt service payments have been
structured in a manner to best meet RTD’s cash flow forecasts when the debt was issued.

1.C.5.c

Page | 7
Packet Pg. 259

Question 24: Why can’t we use the money freed up at each sunset date for the FasTracks projects,
either the money itself or as new bonding collateral for additional money
Response 24: The long-term financial plan already contemplates the use of cash being freed-up with the
payoff of each debt issuance. The Base System bonds from the T-REX project will be paid off in 2024 and
the cash that becomes available for not having to service this debt is forecasted to be used going
forward. Under RTD’s current TABOR authority, we were limited to the total principal amount of debt
we can issue, the total repayment and the annual debt service amount. Under that existing authority,
we have used most of the total repayment authorized and have a relatively small amount remaining that
we are authorized to issue in tax-secured obligations (bonds).
Question 25: Why not think of FT projects in building block segments, so that they can be completed in
segments that are not prohibitively expensive, and thus keep the project moving, such as through sunset
bond amounts. Ie, using a sunset bond amount as the basis for a letter of intent from RTD to do a
project of part of a corridor, to be able to get into a DRCOG project list.

AF

T

Response 25: RTD has looked at completing sections in segments and the cost is substantially higher
than completing longer or entire sections mainly due to the cost of mobilization, NEPA, design, etc. that
would have to be performed many times due to the number of segments rather than a single time.
Question 26: Are we getting Wayfair tax money coming in yet? What are the projections for that and
we couldn’t we use some for FT?

DR

Response 26: We are assuming you are referring to sales tax from on-line vendors. We have been
receiving those revenues for some time and they have already been assumed in the forecast that Leeds
provided.
Question 27: How much would RTD need to assess as a mill levy to raise the same amount of revenue as
would be raised by the modeled increases in sales and use tax?
Response 27: Using the 2018 net taxable assessed valuation for the District and the 2022 sales tax
forecast, RTD would need a mill levy of 1.3287 mills to raise the same revenue as a 0.1% sales and use
tax increase, and a mill levy of 1.9930 mills to raise the same revenue as a 0.15% sales and use tax
increase. However, given the differences in the bases for property tax and sales tax, this relationship
may not hold true in the future.
Question 28: Why are NW Rail Ridership forecasts going down when our population is going way up? In
particular, I understand that the revised, lower ridership figures addressed the lowered development
expectations based on the Great Recession. So, now that we’re a decade beyond the Great Recession
and we continue to be in the Great Boom, have the revised upwards development figures been
included, which should push projected ridership up? If not, why not? Also, show a comparison of all the
corridors with the changed ridership estimates based on the Great Recession, and then hopefully
revised upwards for the Great Boom, so we can know it wasn’t just the NW Corridor that had its
ridership figures halved.

Response 28: As noted, socioeconomic data forecasts (provided by DRCOG) decreased subsequent to
completing NAMS. In particular, employment in the Northwest Rail Corridor was forecast increase by
1.5% per year at the time of NAMS, more recent forecasts show this annual increase show an average
annual growth in the corridor of 0.9%. DRCOG works with local government to update their forecasts
periodically, RTD expects that DRCOG’s forecasts will be revised in support of the development of their
2050 Plan, which scheduled to start soon.
The table below shows weekday ridership forecasts for the year 2035. The second column shows those
forecasts developed in 2012 (consistent with the NAMS forecast timeframe) compared with more recent
forecasts from 2016. RTD expects to update these forecasts in the coming year in support of the
Transportation Transformation Comprehensive Plan using updated DRCOG socioeconomic forecasts.

Project Description
Real-Time Passenger Information (RTPI) provides RTD passengers with predictive
arrival times for their next bus. IT and Marketing are working toward providing
predictive arrival times for buses via three primary delivery systems: 1) General
Transit Feed Specification for Real Time or GTFS-RT (which feeds the information to
Google Maps and some third party application developers), 2) Passenger Information
Display (PID) signs, and 3) the RTD website. Additional funding will be required to
implement future phases of this project. This will include planning, design, and
development of a third party developer portal that will allow the open developer
community to access rich data based on APIs (application programming interface, as
opposed to the flat file/GTFS-RT protocol), and build interesting and contextually rich
applications for our ridership and trip planning components. Also integration with IVR
and RiderAlert data will require additional funding.

Project is the demolition of the existing 17 year old concrete highblocks and

Southwest Corridor. The existing highblocks are over 17 years old. Due to the high use
of magnesium chloride (MgCl) and age, the highblocks are rusting and the concrete is
cracking/breaking. They are very unsightly and are a blight on the neighborhood
which is going through a revitalization.
The proposed Cab Signaling project would enable RTD Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) to
constantly display, on the dash of the cab, the maximum speed a train is permitted to
operate based on signal indications and track conditions ahead of the train. The
wayside signal logic transmits a 100 hertz pulsed signal into the rail using 7 unique
pulsed rates, each having a different speed limit associated with it. If an Operator fails
to comply to a reduced speed limit zone and begins braking within a predetermined
grace period, the LRV will automatically apply brakes and come to a complete stop.
The project costs are estimated to provide for new software and hardware for all of
our current LRV fleet. Additionally the project funds would provide for new signal
software for each of our existing corridors that currently have Automatic Train Stop
(ATS) functionality.

frequently and repair parts are getting more difficult to find.
The existing dry fire sprinkler piping is deteriorating. It is plumbed with a thin gauge
pipe that is subject to corrosion damage because of condensation in the piping
reacting with the air in the system. The piping, fittings, and other related material
required for system repairs are no longer available. RTD has a very limited stock of
these materials remaining. Deterioration will continue, so eventually spare material
will be unavailable. Renovating the existing dry fire sprinkler piping systems will
increase system reliability and safety for RTD now and in the future. Building
maintenance will be reduced as a result of a new dry fire sprinkler piping system

Project Description
Project is to replace existing particulate sensors with CO NO2 sensors to monitor air

automation system (BAS) monitors air quality in the bus parking garage using
particulate sensors. The particulate sensors send a signal to the BAS to activate
ventilation systems when a programmed level of particulates is reached. Particulate
sensor technology is outdated and no longer available for this application. The current
method of determining the concentration of tailpipe emissions is using a CO NO2
sensor. CO (carbon monoxide) and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) are the main components
of bus exhaust. The existing particulate sensor technology is outdated, unreliable and

Elati Light Rail Division

Project will replace/rebuild the existing inspection pits at East Metro. The existing
inspection pits are constructed of steel framing and grating. The steel is 40 years old
and is showing signs of metal fatigue. Eventually there will be failure in the steel
members. This steel is nearing the end of its useful life and the inspection pits need to
be replaced.
Project is to add a second floor mezzanine at the Elati Light Rail facility for training of
Rail Operations personnel. We are currently renting a double wide trailer used for
operator training purposes with no running water or adequate relief facilities. Utilizing
the unused space on the second floor of the Elati facility will eliminate the need for
construction of a separate building as was previously considered. It will also allow the
project to be completed in a more timely manner.

Security Command Center University Project

Location
Districtwide

Project Description
RTD owns a vacant 10,000 square foot facility which is located at the University
Station under the existing parking structure. This request is to relocate the existing
Security Command Center Operations to this location. This space is ideal for our needs
for many reasons, including its size, which is more than 4 times what is currently being
used. This space will also provide for the Map 21 recommendation of an (EOC)
Emergency Operations Center for the District. The facility will be designed primarily
as a Security Command Center, but also function as an EOC (Emergency Operating
Center). This design would greatly benefit the District's operating divisions by creating
a facility that could support and operate Light Rail Control, Bus Dispatch and the IT
Division during critical incidents. It would serve as a redundant common operating
facility in emergencies for all disciplines while under an EOC activation. The design will
allow for redundant face to face operations, should a large scale emergency occur.
The facility would also provide a large server room, designed to support both security
operations and corporate IT redundancies. The existing Security Command Center
would be re-purposed into the Transit Police Division as a “Field Operations” building
to consolidate services between the Transit Police Division, Allied Universal Security
and the Denver Police Department contracted police. The current view room would
be converted into a large conference and training room. The current server room
would be surrendered to the IT Division for continued use to support security and RTD
corporate networks.

Project Description
This project will include all of the downtown track and infrastructure from 7th Street
to 30th and Downing. This alignment is 24 years old and has been in service since
inception. For the most part this infrastructure has reached its potential lifespan.
There are several projects in place to make repairs and replace the worst of the
defects but an overall plan is needed to replace all track, turnout switches, street
crossings, concrete flat work, etc. Please see the attached report from MOW and SGR,
highlighting the condition of the infrastructure in the area. This is a six year plan. The
alignment will be divided into segments that can be completely refurbished within the
span of one construction season. Our estimates are at a cost of between $2,500,000$3,000,000 per year for 6 years.

Northwest Rail Line

Project is to construct approximately 18 miles of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the SH 119
Corridor to connect Boulder and Longmont in accordance with the recommendation
of the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS). It is anticipated that approximately half
of the total costs for this project would be grant-funded. The establishment of BRT in
the corridor would raise ridership from approximately 1,900 to approximately 5,000
daily weekday riders in 2035. Detailed cost estimates and design will be established
through environmental clearance and preliminary engineering ahead of construction.

Project Description
Over the last several years, the rail system has grown significantly. As the rail system
grows so does the need for additional staff to maintain safe operations and provide
timely and reliable service to our customer base. With the growth, we are requesting
7 new positions, to include 3 Signal Traction Power Maintainers, 1 Rail Laborer, and 3
LRT Field Supervisors. Rail Ops is responsible for 5 separate corridors including West,
Downtown, East, Southeast and Southwest. With the current staffing level, it is
difficult to support and provide a timely response for each corridor. The lack of
coverage has a direct impact on our response times to incidents such as mechanical
failures, passenger accidents, requested operator assitance, etc. As we move forward,
it is imperative to have the correct number of personnel in a position where they can
assist/respond when needed to avoid major delays and maintain the safety of our
alignment. Our headcount has not kept pace and does not account for the fact that
our infrastructure is aging and requires continuous maintenance/replacement.

Mariposa Light Rail Division The drainage issue is occurring at the loading dock where there has been a settling of
the slab and upheaval of the drainage pipe which has resulted in the storm water not
being able to have a negative slope back to the main storm drainage pipe. Water is
pooling in the vicinity (up to 3 feet at times) and in the winter it is causing ice buildup
at the loading dock which makes this issue also safety related.

RTD offers to its Riders a versatile online payment system called FlexPass. The
FlexPass program helps move people by providing a fiscally sustainable program for
RTD as well as to employees of participating employers, and it helps contribute to
overall customer satisfaction. The program’s flexible nature enables employees to
choose their service level, vary passes from month-to-month, and enter or leave the
program at any time. Plus, it offers incentives for employers and employees to
participate including a pre-tax option. The program accounts for approximately $4.5
million in annual revenue and it continues to experience growth each year. In March
2010, RTD contracted with 360Media in Englewood, CO to provide and administer an
eCommerce website to provide services to FlexPass business customers and their
employees. The term of the agreement was for two (2) contract years and three (3)
one (1) year options. In 2014, RTD exercised the final option to retain the services of
360Media. It was envisioned that this eCommerce website will be replaced by RTD’s
SmartMedia system and that this function will be brought in-house in the near future.
Unfortunately, this solution is not currently budgeted for or in the immediate Smart
Card plans for implementation. It will most likely be discussed in 2020. Historically this
program was funded through a Smart Card line item which is no longer available.

Request is for an increase for processing repairs to on-vehicle advertising direct
application advertisements. It is the intent of this project to create a single line item
for repairs to direct app advertisements in order to streamline the processing and
payment of invoices associated with these repairs. Currently, there is a multi-stream
process to request, track, process invoices, track repair and process payments for
these repairs. We are anticipating an increase to this O&M expense in the coming
years due to the anticipated increase in light rail vehicles to service the light rail
expansions.

After further analysis, it has been determined that the project will require $225,000 in
Operating and Maintenance Costs rather than the approved $75,000 in on-going
Operating and Maintenance. The additional funds are necessary because the cost of
the product is higher than we originally scoped. In addition, it has come to light that
there is a need for a new email service and text messaging provider in order to send
out the customized, targeted messages to riders. We are resubmitting this request to
ask for additional Operating and Maintenance funds to maintain and build upon the
product going forward. Communications is looking to implement a Rider Alert System
in order to communicate up-to-the-minute service alerts for our riders in timely
manner. The system will include a web-based interface that allows staff to create and
manage the thousands of service alerts that are sent out each year. The Alerts System
will be intuitive and fast to use, allowing simple alerts to be created in seconds. At the
same time, the system will offer fine grained control over selecting the specific route,
branch, trip, or stop an alert applies to, when an alert is in effect, and by what
channels (like emails, text messages, electronic signs, agency website, General Transit
Feed Specification real-time feeds and third party apps) the alerts should be
disseminated. The system will use templates to automatically generate appropriate
messages for all the dissemination channels.

This project will implement a District-wide comprehensive Enterprise Content
Management (ECM) solution to consolidate identified existing systems that create,
capture or store content at RTD to create a single point of access. The project scope
will include the development of policies, procedures, taxonomy and metadata for the
consistent identification, use, maintenance, retrieval, retention, and destruction of
data. The project also will include identification of personnel and tools required to
implement the policies and procedures, implementation of the system, and the
development of training and audit tools to support the ongoing utilization of the
system. The current project cost estimate beyond the approved scope for IQBG
assumes that RTD will own and maintain the hardware and software in-house. As part
of its scope, IQBG will recommend a path forward for procurement of ECM tools,
which could include externally hosted systems or software-as-a-service (SaaS) systems
instead of in-house tools. If a hosted or SaaS system is selected, the cost structure of
the project and future staffing levels will change.

The proposed project would allow the Legal Services division (“RTD Law”), which
functions as RTD’s in-house law firm, to come into compliance with its legal and
ethical obligations. There are three components: (1) secure management and sharing
of legal records along with case management of those legal matters; (2) docketing and
calendaring of court-mandated deadlines; and (3) collection, review and production of
electronically stored information (“ESI”) for purposes of executing and enforcing legal
holds and producing documents in litigation and in response to other requests.

compliance gaps in our IT systems, remediate those gaps, and monitor for and
respond to suspicious activity in a timely manner. Assessment and mitigation requires
specialized skill sets and separation of duties (from RTD systems specialists) which are
more cost-effective and operationally effective to outsource at this time; additional
equipment and services are needed to achieve compliance and security goals such as
network separation, threat monitoring, and asset discovery.

TrapezeCOM has been the only customer complaint and commendation tracking tool
in use for the past 8 years at RTD and most departments find it difficult to use and
limited in its functionality. Various departments/projects like Communications,
FasTracks, and the SmartCard system use their own customer issue
tracking/management tools to collect customer data and feedback that is not
integrated. Reporting from TrapezeCOM is also not conducive to the needs of the
District. Customer Care and other departments, including Legal, are unable to pull
reports to view a customer's overall interaction/relationship with RTD. In addition, the
current system has no analytics capabilities, so we are unable to pull reports to
understand complaints about specific routes, lines, stops, etc. The recommendation
from some of the studies like the SmartCard Business Process Re-engineering (SMT
BPR) and Fare Systems visioning exercise was that RTD procure and implement an
Enterprise Level CRM system that would meet the needs of all departments and
projects. The first phase (2018) of this project is to implement a contact center
customer relationship management tool for servicing customer needs and to replace
the TrapezeCOM functionality as a customer service case management need. The
future phases (2019 and beyond) will be to integrate and implement the service
module to other needs of the RTD district towards marketing/sales.

Oracle E-business suite support will end in 2021. RTD would need to upgrade to the
next version starting 2019 or start looking at alternatives in 2018. Project is to
implement the future of business applications such as finance, HR, procurement,
recruitment, and so on. The project will assess the need to upgrade existing
technologies and/or investigate/implement new technologies for these business
functions. The project will analyze the need to move/segregate the business functions
as necessary in order to upgrade existing application or move to the cloud or SAAS

Real-Time Passenger Information (RTPI) provides RTD passengers with predictive
arrival times for their next bus. IT and Marketing are working toward providing
predictive arrival times for buses via three primary delivery systems: 1) General
Transit Feed Specification for Real Time or GTFS-RT (which feeds the information to
Google Maps and some third party application developers), 2) Passenger Information
Display (PID) signs, and 3) the RTD website. Additional funding will be required to
implement future phases of this project. This will include planning, design, and
development of a third party developer portal that will allow the open developer
community to access rich data based on APIs (application programming interface, as
opposed to the flat file/GTFS-RT protocol), and build interesting and contextually rich
applications for our ridership and trip planning components. Also integration with IVR
and RiderAlert data will require additional funding.

RTD’s Rider Alert system is being replaced in late 2018/early 2019 with a much more
intuitive and robust system that allows for much more detailed and refined alerts to
subscribers, including down to a route/block/stop level. With this new system, RTD
will be able to communicate information related to dropped trips, detours by
impacted stops, disruptions by rail station, etc. Customer Care’s Digital Customer
Relations Liaison team will assume responsibility for increased outbound
communication to passengers, and will also assume responsibility from Bus Ops
Dispatch on certain detours and planned disruptions. With the addition of two FTE,
the team will now be at six and will need a Lead/Supervisor rather than reporting
directly to the Senior Manager of Customer Care.

In an age where organizations across markets and industries depend heavily on
technology to operate successfully, the IT Auditor plays an increasingly important role
in helping to manage and respond to risks. Information Technology (IT) Audit was
introduced in 2015 to ensure that RTD was prepared for the current global scenario of
Information Technology. IT Audit was introduced with Board of Directors support, but
the resources that accommodate the successful introduction and ensure efficient and
effective work are still needed. This request will ensure that RTD Audit has the
resources needed to provide assurance on the protection of assets, data integrity,
system reliability and information security as required by the Board of Directors.

Security Command Center University Project

Project Description
RTD currently owns a vacant 10,000 square foot facility which is located at the
University Station under the existing parking structure. This request is to relocate the
existing Security Command Center Operations to this location. We feel this space is
ideal for our needs for many reasons, including its size, which is more than 4 times
what is currently being used. This space will also provide for the Map 21
recommendation of an (EOC) Emergency Operations Center for the District. The
facility will be designed primarily as a Security Command Center, but also function as
an EOC (Emergency Operating Center). This design would greatly benefit the District's
operating divisions by creating a facility that could support and operate Light Rail
Control, Bus Dispatch and the IT Division during critical incidents. It would serve as a
redundant common operating facility in emergencies for all disciplines while under an
EOC activation. The design will allow for redundant face to face operations, should a
large scale emergency occur. The facility would also provide a large server room,
designed to support both security operations and corporate IT redundancies. The
existing Security Command Center would be re-purposed into the Transit Police
Division as a “Field Operations” building to consolidate services between the Transit
Police Division, Allied Universal Security and the Denver Police Department contracted
police. The current view room would be converted into a large conference and
training room. The current server room would be surrendered to the IT Division for
continued use to support security and RTD corporate networks.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: July 2, 2019

From:

Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations

GM

Date:

July 2, 2019

Board Meeting Date: July 16, 2019

Subject:

Award of “Group 29” Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Transdev for the
provision of contracted fixed-route transit services “Group 29.” This contract is for three years,
with two one-year options for a total of 5-years. The initial 3-year contract amount for service is
$85,326,407.00; the option year 1 amount is $30,560,167.00; and the option year 2 amount is
$31,742,845.00. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for service is $147,629,420.00. In
addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be
$9,614,906.00 for the initial 3-year contract term; $3,356,141.00 for option year 1; and
$3,435,828.00 for option year 2.
The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for fuel is
$16,406,875.00. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for the contracted fixed route transit
service and fuel is $164,036,295.00.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND:
Originally mandated in 1988 by Senate Bill 88-164 and revised by other legislative activities over the
years, RTD is obligated to “implement a system under which up to fifty-eight percent of the district’s
vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses pursuant to competitively negotiated
contracts.” RTD currently outsources approximately 45% of its fixed-route service, 100% of its
ADA paratransit service (Access-a-Ride), and 100% of its general public on-demand service (Flex
Ride, formerly known as Call-n-Ride). The total amount of vehicular service currently contracted out
is close to 56%.
On February 26, 2019, a Request for Proposals (RFP) 19-DH-009 named “Group 29” was issued
soliciting proposals for the provision of fixed-route transit services. The “Group 29” service package
replaces “Group 25”, which will expire in 2020. The service package consists of 111 buses
operating 36 routes providing approximately 340,371 revenue hours per year. A summary of the
routes included in “Group 29” is included as Attachment A. Responses to the Request for Proposals
were due on April 26, 2019. Proposers were required to provide detailed operating plans for
providing fixed-route service, including hiring and training employees, maintaining RTD-provided
transit vehicles, and conforming to RTD operating requirements. The contract award was anticipated
to be awarded on a fixed-price basis and based on “best value” competitive proposal procedures.

Packet Pg. 293

3.B.1

DISCUSSION:
This recommendation represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response
to Request for Proposals (RFP) 19-DH-009 to provide “Group 29” Public Transportation Services. The
contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective on January 12, 2020.
PROCUREMENT:
Two (2) proposals were received from Transdev and First Transit in response to RFP 19-DH-009 for
the Provision of “Group 29” Public Transportation Services. Both proposals were evaluated on the
following evaluative criteria: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%);
b) experience/qualifications and safety record (30%); c) price (30%); and d) SBE plan and goal
attainment (5%).
The technical evaluation team reviewed and scored each proposal based on a)
understanding/approach and organization for implementation and b) experience/qualifications and
safety record. The technical evaluation team consisted of Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager,
Contracted Services; Greg Smith, Manager, Competitive Services; Steve Gieske, General
Superintendent, Maintenance; Loradeane Clinkenbeard, Manager, Bus Operator Training; and Erin
Vallejos, Technician, Contracted Services.
The SBE plan and goal attainment was reviewed and scored by Brittany Eroen, Compliance Officer,
SBO.
The proposal pricing was reviewed and scored the Procurement Department staff.
“GROUP 29” PROPOSALS:
Transdev - The following is a summary of the strong points of the Transdev “Group 29” proposal
which support the recommendation of contract award to Transdev:
Facility. Located at 2775 S. Vallejo Street Englewood, CO 80110 which is on the west side of the
Denver metro area and is centrally located within the “Group 29” service area. The facility is fully
functional and its location does not require any increases in diesel fuel use or increased travel times
to get to bus route terminals.
Bus Operator Wages. Transdev’s proposal provides an increase in bus operator wages. The bus
operator starting wage will increase from $18.47/hour to $19.80/hour (RTD starting wage for
operators will be $20.58/hour). Adjustments were also proposed for other operator wage levels.
RTD, as well as our contractors, have faced long-term challenges with recruiting and retaining
qualified operators. The proposed wage increases will provide Transdev the opportunity to offer a
more attractive wage package which will improve recruitment and retention of operators and result in
improved service for our passengers.
Mechanic Wages. Transdev’s proposal provides an increase in mechanic wages. The Transdev C
level mechanic wage will increase from $21.67/ to $22.32/hour (RTD starting wage for an entry
level mechanic will be $26.08/hour). Adjustments were also proposed for other mechanic wage
levels. The proposed wage increases will provide Transdev the opportunity to offer a more attractive
wage package which will improve recruitment and retention of mechanics.
Dedicated On-site Recruiter. This new full-time position will be solely focused on the recruitment of
bus operators and maintenance personnel for the Transdev location.

Packet Pg. 294

3.B.1

Enhanced Quality Control. Transdev will track all performance metrics captured through Trapeze,
Webrisk, MMIS and SmartDive to monitor, maintain and if necessary improve performance under all
RTD Board of Director adopted performance measures.
Maintenance Program. Transdev will add an on-site Diagnostics Training Manager dedicated to
providing additional training for mechanics. Transdev will accomplish this through a maintenance
training lab which will provide real time and virtual training ensuring technicians are equipped to
diagnose and address all maintenance repairs. All mechanics will receive 60 hours of initial training
when hired and 40 hours of refresher training each month. During the term of the “Group 29”
contract Transdev has committed to obtaining an Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) shop
certification. The Transdev division has five mechanics that are ASE certified and one mechanic that
is Master Technician certified.
Proposed Management Team. Under this team’s leadership, the Transdev division consistently
meets/exceeds most of the RTD quarterly performance goals. The team has developed and nurtured
positive and productive relationships with surrounding governments and communities. The team has
long-term experience providing service for RTD and there will be no disruption of service when
transitioning from the previous “Group 25” contract to the new “Group 29” contract.

local operation is supported by a number of experienced professionals at the Regional level.
SBE goal set at 5%. Transdev’s proposed SBE plan meets the 5% goal.
The technical evaluation team requested further clarification on a few items which were adequately
addressed by Transdev.

Packet Pg. 295

3.B.1

First Transit - The following is a summary of the First Transit “Group 29” proposal that does not
support the recommendation of contract award to First Transit:
Facility. First Transit proposed a bus facility at 18000 E. 22nd Avenue Aurora, CO 80011 with
arterial access to I-70 and I-225. The technical evaluation team determined this facility did not meet
the needs of the “Group 29” solicitation for two reasons.
1. Arterial access in this area is highly congested and would cause significant delays for buses
traveling to assigned bus routes. This would result in delayed service start times.
2. The proposed facility is located on the east side of metro Denver while the service package for
“Group 29” is located primarily on the west side of metro Denver. Buses would have to travel
greater distances to get to bus terminals resulting in increased diesel fuel use and cost to RTD.
Management Team. The proposed First Transit local management team did not meet the minimum
qualification requirements set forth in the “Group 29” RFP.
Cost. First Transit’s proposed price included an additional $10,600,000 in startup and additional
costs to support a new operating facility. The price proposal also included an additional $4,200,000
in additional management fees. For this reason and the others noted above, the technical evaluation
team determined that it was not in the best interest of the RTD to pursue any further action with the
First Transit “Group 29” proposal.
TRANSDEV “GROUP 25” PERFORMANCE:
The Transdev division currently operates the “Group 25” fixed route service package. The division’s
performance was evaluated based on the following Board of Directors adopted performance
measures:


Packet Pg. 296

3.B.1

all employees at monthly safety meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at
their facilities.
Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 Miles: Transdev raises awareness of passenger safety
through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000
miles. All five passenger accidents that occurred in 2019 were classified as non-preventable.
On-Time Preventive Maintenance Inspections: Transdev places a high emphasis on completing
preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local operation is diligent about
completing these inspections on time.
On-Time Performance: Transdev understands the impact new operators, construction detours, and
traffic can have on OTP. From the beginning of the “Group 25” contract, Transdev worked in
conjunction with RTD Service Planning and Scheduling to improve OTP. They identified low
performing routes and assigning street supervisors to campaign the routes and to meet with
operators to discuss factors that impact their ability to run on time. Schedule issues are forwarded
to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
Miles Between Lost Service Road Calls: Transdev did not meet the goal in 2018 but improved to
46,843 Miles Between Lost Service Maintenance Road Calls through May 2019 compared to 22,737
in 2018. During a 2018 routine review of maintenance activities, deficiencies were identified in
Transdev’s Maintenance Management team, Preventive Maintenance Inspection (PMI) and Quality
Control (QC) practices. During the remainder of 2018, Transdev hired a new Maintenance Manager
and Quality Control Manager who in conjunction with the local and regional Transdev Management
teams, revised PMI and QC maintenance procedures. Transdev has since improved Preventive
Maintenance adherence to 100%, reduced repeat maintenance occurrences by 50% and improved
miles between lost service road calls to 46,843.
Competitive Services staff will continue to monitor Transdev to ensure they complete preventive
maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely manner, monitoring repeat issues,
provide additional training for mechanics, and taking a pro-active approach to maintaining the buses
in their fleet.
Operator Complaints per Boarding: Transdev continues to investigate and address customer
complaints with operators and take other remedial actions to reduce the number of customer
complaints.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
RTD Competitive Services Internal Cost Estimate:
This estimate was prepared by the Competitive Services Department to anticipate the amount RTD
could expect to pay to outsource the “Group 29” service package to a contract operator. Due to the
recent increase in bus operator wages by RTD and its contractors, RTD anticipated proposers would
also similarly address labor challenges by increasing other wages. RTD also factored an increase in
costs for inflation. RTD Competitive Services total five-year estimate for the “Group 29” service
package was $144,179,082.
Transdev’s proposed total five-year price was $147,629,420. Transdev’s price proposal included
increases in inflation, CBA agreed upon Operator and Mechanic wage increases to address
differences between RTD and Transdev wages, and maintenance costs associated with the aging

Packet Pg. 297

3.B.1

2005-2007 Gillig bus fleet. (Transdev Bus Operator starting wages will increase from $18.47/hour
to $19.80/hour. Transdev C level Mechanic starting wages will increase from $21.67/hour to
$22.32/hour.)
First Transit’s proposed five year price was $166,732,373. First Transit’s price proposal included
significantly higher costs associated with starting up a new operating facility. First Transit’s price
proposal was not considered further since their proposed price was significantly higher than RTD
would expect to pay for the “Group 29” service package. Below is a breakdown of the RTD
Competitive Services estimate and price proposals received.

RTD Cost Model:
The Cost Model estimate was prepared by the RTD Finance Department to estimate the cost for RTD
to operate the “Group 29” service package in house rather than outsource to a qualified contract
provider.
The RTD internal financial analysis (Attachment B) indicates that the five-year estimated cost for RTD
to provide these services would be $165,571,112, which is $17,941,693 higher than the five-year
cost proposed by Transdev. The RTD Cost Model Estimate is based on current and projected wage
rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience providing other fixed-route
services. In addition to estimating the cost for RTD to provide the services included in the “Group
29” service package, the cost of providing a facility to serve as the operating and maintenance base
for the provision of the services is also included in the estimated cost of RTD operation. RTD
currently does not have the capacity to provide these additional services without building or leasing
additional facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance base for the provision of the services.
The Transdev total five-year proposed price represents a $17,941,693 (11%) savings over the
estimated cost for RTD to provide the service. Please see the “Group 29” - Proposer Service Cost

ABSTRACT
As part of the FasTracks program, the North Metro Corridor will be served by the North Metro
Rail Line between Denver Union Station and Thornton. The project currently under construction
with completion in 2018 is Phase 1 which has a northern terminus at 124th Avenue. A future Phase
2 would extend this rail line north to 162nd Avenue, but is currently unfunded.
In order to fully leverage the Phase 1 investment in the North Metro Corridor, this report
evaluates market conditions and existing transit service network performance as a prerequisite
to developing a transit service implementation plan for the study area. The study area includes
eleven local bus routes, one SkyRide route, three Regional routes and one limited route. Existing
demographic profiles, proposed station area development, travel patterns, and other local and
regional factors are studied to provide context for local services, and inform the development of
a modified transit network for the North Metro Corridor.

PROJECT PURPOSE & BACKGROUND (2015)
As part of the overall FasTracks program to enhance rail connectivity in the Denver region, the
upcoming North Metro Rail Line (N Line), is designed to provide an attractive option for
commuters and other travelers in the North Metro area.
The project is expected to increase ridership within the North Metro Corridor transit network as
well as stimulate residential, retail, and commercial growth. The North Metro Corridor Service
Plan will develop an integrated bus network capable of meeting the mobility demand and needs
generated by the new N Line commuter rail service. The recommendations for this study will be
developed through a comprehensive assessment of existing conditions, service area
demographics, transit market opportunities and needs, and route performance for transit services
in the North Metro Corridor together with stakeholder input. 1

Study Area
The study area for the North Metro Corridor, as defined by RTD, borders I-25 on the west, I-76 on
the east, E-470 in the north, and Denver Union Station in the south. Northglenn, Thornton, and
Commerce City are the primary cities in the study area with parts of Federal Heights included as
well. The study area also includes some unincorporated areas in Denver and Adams Counties.

Rail Line Project Description
The North Metro Corridor is an 18.5-mile electric commuter rail line between Denver Union
Station (DUS) and 162nd Avenue in Adams County. As part of Phase one of the North Metro
Corridor, the N Line will operate on a 13-mile segment between DUS and 124th Avenue Station at
Eastlake. This segment with six stations is expected to open in 2018, with presently available
funding. The remaining planned section from 124th Avenue Station to 162nd Avenue will have two
stations and will be built and operated as Phase two of the North Metro Corridor though it is
currently unfunded.

RELEVANT STUDIES
North Area Origin and Destination Study (2014)
The RTD North Area Origin and Destination Study used a survey of all modes to analyze travel
patterns of North Area Residents and workers, to determine origins and destinations for future
trips, time of day travel for commuters, and barriers to transit usage. This online survey, in both
English and Spanish, was made available for three weeks in March 2014. Community members
were invited and encouraged to participate through email, survey link distribution by local
governments, the RTD website, and social media. By the deadline 1,028 individuals responded.
Results from this study provide a background of transit usage patterns for North Area residents,
useful in informing service design plans complimentary to the North Metro Corridor project.
The biggest barriers to transit usage were travel time concerns and service frequency, followed
by proximity to stops. As can be seen in Figure 1 below, the most common transportation mode
for commuting is a single occupancy vehicle, even though a large portion of the survey group used
RTD for a portion of their trips. Additionally, as Figure 2 notes, probability of transit usage during
weekdays coincided with RTD weekday peak service schedules, while on weekends midday
service was most commonly used.

Figure 2: Transit Usage Likelihood

Station Area Masterplans—Denver North
The station area masterplans summarize the potential development plans drafted by affected
cities to leverage the station area for increased transit ridership and tax revenue. There is an
overall goal of creating a symbiotic relationship between the station areas and sustainable transit
usage, such that the stations themselves become attractive activity centers as well as broaden
transit options in those areas.
All current station area plans are geared towards transit oriented development (TOD), and include
residential-commercial mixed use development including mixed income housing. There is an
emphasis on pedestrian friendly complete streets that are well connected through a grid street
network, with multimodal street design and open space linkages. The plans envision the
development to be well integrated with the existing character of the neighborhood, while also
contributing to overall economic growth, as is evident in Figures 3 and 4 below. Increased infill,
additional senior housing, and opportunities for institutional developments are also highlighted
in the plans. Overall, the cities aim for these station areas to be vibrant, distinctive, and attractive
for residents and visitors alike.

RTD Market Size, Usage, and Segmentation Study
(2014)
The RTD Market Share, Usage, and Segmentation Study is a region-wide study focusing on District
level transit usage patterns among residents. The study found that 61 percent of total
respondents indicated RTD usage at least once in the past twelve months; 13 percent used RTD
on a daily or near daily basis. Denver County had 24 percent of their respondents who categorized
themselves as frequent riders and over half of the respondents (51 percent) indicated light rail
preference over bus services. Approximately 15 percent of Adams County respondents indicated
that they were frequent RTD riders.
Denver County had 33 percent of respondents suggesting no usage of RTD revenue service in the
past 12 months while 53 percent of Adams County respondents indicated no usage of RTD in the
past 12 months. The study did not break down market segments at a sub-county level, but this
generally shows greater transit usage in the core of the metro area such as Denver, with
significantly lower ridership in Adams County, which encompasses most of the North Metro
Corridor area. Based on a broad conclusion of this study evident in Figure 5 below, the N Line has
the potential to increase RTD usage with the introduction of additional rapid transit options.
Figure 5: Transit Usage in RTD Service Area in past 12 Months

RTD Market Segmentation Study (2014)
A similar but distinct RTD Segmentation study was conducted to help define groups of Denver
area residents based on their attitude towards public transportation and their use of RTD services.

Results from this study will be instrumental in both designing “consumer-centric” transit and
effectively communicating with consumers. Based on the response, RTD could group consumers
into five categories, which are: Practical Travelers, No Hassle Travelers, Car Travelers, Avid RTD
Users, and Conscientious RTD Users. As Figure 6 below shows, the largest group of respondents,
25 percent, was categorized as Avid RTD Users followed by Practical Travelers at 22 percent and
No Hassle Travelers at 21 percent. Based on the results, the study recommended encouraging rail
to those new to transit, using preferred media in every segment to communicate transit
information, and customize communication towards the group’s attitude towards transit and
RTD. With the introduction of the N Line, opportunities exist to attract infrequent users or nonriders into the RTD system through effective service design and targeted communication efforts.

Downtown Denver Commuter Survey Report
(2015)
The downtown Denver Commuter Survey Report discusses various demographic characteristics
and commuting patterns in downtown Denver. Commissioned by the Downtown Denver
Partnership Inc., this report summarizes survey response data. The following graphic (Figure 7)
illustrates commuter profiles, mode split, of the factors that influence commute choice, commute
activity and other commuting trends and habits of downtown commuters, included in the report.
As the N Line serves Denver Union Station in downtown Denver, this study can benefit from
understanding commuting patterns and trends of downtown Denver commuters and highlight
opportunities for future transit ridership gains.

Gold & Northwest Corridors Service Plan (2016)
RTD will open the G Line (Gold corridor) in 2017 and the B Line (Northwest corridor) opened in
July 2016. These both are commuter rail services. The G Line will provide a connection between
Union Station in downtown Denver and Wheat Ridge via northwest Denver, Adams County, and
Arvada, while the B Line connects Union Station and Westminster. RTD implemented a bus service
plan for the Gold and Northwest Corridors, in preparation for the new rail services (developed by
TMD in collaboration with RTD). The plan evaluated the performance of existing transit,
underlying demographics, and other market factors in order to develop recommendations for bus
service that better leveraged the performance of the two new rail lines, as well as changing
development patterns. A similar effort will be undertaken for the N Line in the North Metro
Corridor.

US-36 Service Plan (2015)
The US-36 corridor Flatiron Flyer Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) provides regional transit service between
Boulder and downtown Denver as of 2016, shown in Map 3. The commute shed that this service
draws from overlaps partially with the commute shed of the N Line. Previously, the corridor was
served by a total of 13 routes serving more than 10,000 average weekday boardings. The BRT
Service Plan recommended rethinking the complicated route structure to simple, more uniform
service patterns, as a strategy to make it more consumer friendly, increase ridership, and improve
overall corridor service performance.
The primary focus of the plan sought to reduce travel times, both out-of-vehicle-wait times as
well as in-vehicle-travel time. The plan also advocated for greater service reliability by enhancing
station access, incrementally improving service frequencies, and maximizing the use of new
managed lanes. The third strategy focused on increased customer accessibility of transit by
consolidating service patterns and creating clearer, more uniform and more marketable service
elements. After the rollout of the US-36 BRT service, the Flatiron Flyer, overall ridership in the
corridor has increased significantly. Lessons learned from this rollout will inform the development
of the N Line service plan, especially I-25 services such as Routes 120X and 122X.

North Metro Corridor Transit Operations Plan
(2016)
The North Metro Corridor Transit Operations Plan developed by the RTD Planning Department
includes both rail and bus service between downtown Denver and North Thornton-Hwy 7, of the
North Metro Corridor Project. This is an update of the initial draft plan published by RTD in 2011.
This plan highlights service details including corridor alignment, rolling stock requirements and
specifications, travel durations, cycle times and service frequencies. The plan also details the
locations for single and double track segments; it also discusses expected station Park-n-Ride
requirements and locations for transit transfers, bus-to-bus, as well as bus-to-rail. The Denver
Regional Travel Demand Model was used to estimate travel-demand, which guided understanding
of route performance, mode of access for different stations, distribution of peak hour loads; as
well as developing cost estimates, analysis for operation, and maintenance. The projected mode
split and ridership estimates by station, as depicted in Figure 8 below, will help determine the
unique station constraints moving forward, as well as the types of connecting services that will
have the highest chances of success.

EXISTING CONDITIONS (2015)
Market Assessment
The market assessment provides an overview of the development, demographic, and geographic
characteristics of the Denver North Metro Corridor sub region served by the new rail line and
highlights opportunities for coordinated transit service and network changes to coincide with the
opening of the N Line.

Population and Employment Density
Population
The distribution and concentration of population are two of many factors that influence the level
of transit use in an area. Higher densities tend to lead to more passengers per unit of service due
to the presence of a critical mass of potential riders and destinations within proximity. As shown
in Map 4, very high population densities are concentrated in two pockets of the study area. The
first is a residential area in Northglenn near East 117th Avenue. The second area is in Thornton
between Coronado Parkway and North McElwain Boulevard. Outside of these two small pockets,
the vast majority of the study area is comprised of low-density single-family housing with few
institutional and commercial/retail locations interspersed. This makes it difficult to provide
frequent bus services without having to sustain lower productivity and high passenger subsidies.

Employment
According to Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data, there are approximately
65,000 jobs in the N Line study area, most of which are concentrated near the I-25 corridor. Not
all workers residing within the study area can stay local for work. Approximately 90,000 workers
that reside in the region commute to jobs outside of the study area. This trend is typical of
suburban communities, which have a net loss of workers on a daily basis. This trend will mean
that there is likely to be greater demand traveling to jobs outside of the study area to job centers
in the region such as downtown Denver, which are more easily accessed by transit. In the reverse
direction, employment is not concentrated at the N Line station areas, and the connections near
I-25 where jobs are concentrated are not as robust from the future commuter rail line. It is likely
that additional public mobility options will be needed, for “first and last mile” connections beyond
fixed route bus service to facilitate connections to and from the N Line stations.

Demographic Characteristics
Transit usage varies from neighborhood to neighborhood based on local conditions. The
demographic characteristics of the area population, as well as local mobility options play a large
part in determining customer preferences for transit. Certain demographic groups, like those with
limited vehicle access or financial constraints, typically utilize transit service more often than
others. Recognizing the geographic distribution of these population groups will enable RTD to
better meet their mobility needs. In addition, this demographic analysis supports RTD’s
responsibility to comply with Title VI Federal regulations, which require the identification and
efforts to mitigate disproportionate burden and/or disparate service impacts to minority and lowincome populations, as result of service changes.

Poverty
Individuals in poverty are much more frequent users of transit services and are an important
consideration in developing an effective transit service network for the new N Line. According to
2014 Census data an individual with an annual income of $11,000 or less falls under the poverty
line.
As is evident from Map 5, the study area predominantly consists of more affluent neighborhoods,
with lower densities of individuals in poverty, especially northeast of the N Line. Sections of the
study area with slightly higher concentrations of poverty are mainly dispersed to the southeast,
east, and west of the N Line, towards Commerce City and in between 56th and 72nd Avenues
bordering on Quebec Parkway. South of the N Line, closer to Denver Union Station in downtown
Denver, also witnesses higher densities of poverty. Figure 9 illustrates the distribution of income
groups by station area for the N Line. A station area is defined as a half-mile radius around each
N Line station with Census block groups falling in that region being used for this analysis.

Minorities
Minorities are defined as all but non-Hispanic White individuals. As Map 6 shows, minority
populations are concentrated east of the N Line, along East 120th Avenue, and further south in
Commerce City. West of the N line, minorities are most concentrated in the communities of
Federal Heights and Sherrelwood. In comparing this distribution with those in poverty, the study
area includes minorities of all income groups.

Figure 10 illustrates the distribution of populations by race and ethnicity by station area for the N
Line. It is evident from the figure that the most common groups in these station areas are NonHispanic White and Hispanic. The 48th Avenue and Brighton station has the highest proportion of
minorities whereas Thornton and 88th Avenue has the lowest proportion. Overall, it is evident that
there is significant demographic variation among the six new stations as part of the N Line.

Zero Vehicle Households
Zero vehicle households rely on transit and other alternative modes
of transportation to complete daily trips. Within the N Line study
area, most neighborhoods are characterized by single-family
households with high vehicle access. However, in certain areas such
as Northglenn east of I-25, west of Washington Street between 120th
Avenue and 112th Avenue, and in Commerce City the concentration
of zero vehicle households is more significant.

Most neighborhoods in
the study area have low
concentrations of zero
vehicle households.

Figure 11 shows the breakdown of household vehicle access by station areas. The figure shows
that the highest proportion of households have either one or two vehicles. Households with no
vehicle access are very limited, with the lowest proportion of zero vehicle households around

Seniors (Ages 65+)
The senior population, defined as persons age 65 and older, is generally more dependent on
transit for shopping, medical, and other personal trips when compared with other age groups.
Overall the study area has low to medium densities of senior individuals. Station areas near
Thornton and 88th Avenue and Northglenn and 112th Avenue contain the highest density of seniors
within the corridor. Map 8 below illustrates this distribution. As is provided elsewhere in the
region, dedicated scheduled mobility is provided by senior facilities beyond the regular fixed route
transit network.

Development Patterns
Most of the study area is planned on a grid street pattern and is dominated by single-family
residential development with commercial/retail establishments concentrated just east of I-25. A
few multi-family residential apartments are scattered in the study area along with public schools,
medical facility, and other institutional centers, many of which can be good candidates for
mobility connections to the N Line.

areas. However, future development in areas such as Thornton will include more multifamily
residential complexes and mixed use centers in addition to the traditional single family home
neighborhood development facilitating effective public transit mobility. These proposed,
approved, and active developments, especially those which provide an increase in housing
densities can be targets for building transit connections with the N Line. These developments will
also increase employment densities around the N Line, which will serve as a magnet for future
transit ridership growth in the corridor.
Other parts of the study area include the historical Eastlake area which has many opportunities
for redevelopment due to its proximity to the N Line. Additionally, Commerce City on the south
east of the study area, contains many parcels that are lying vacant near the proposed rail station,
which has been zoned, with more intensive land use densities in mind. This TOD is expected to
attract riders and enhance the utility of the N Line.

Market Typologies
The general market typologies in the study area can be broken out into commercial core,
industrial, and suburban areas. A large part of the study area is suburban in nature with low to
medium densities and has an automobile-centric development pattern. These areas are
characterized by large auto oriented streets and intersections, and limited pedestrian facilities.
Additionally, the discontinuous street pattern outside the major corridors further limits access of
transit into those neighborhoods. However, the ability to attract ridership will depend on the
ability to compete with automobile travel times and parking availability and costs, to downtown
Denver as well as to the surrounding areas with the multi-modal transit network.
There is limited diversity in land use in the study area. Outside of the large suburban residential
developments, the region sees employment centers concentrated in parts along the eastern
edges of I-25 and along the western edge of I-76. These facilities may have mobility needs during
non-traditional hours and the demand would depend on parking availability and transit access
near these locations. The retail employment centers have more potential for increased transit
ridership and are located on major mixed-use corridors. In many of these instances, alternative
last-mile public mobility may be more cost effective like station cars/vans, taxi/Transportation
Network Companies, and casual station carpooling.

Service Evaluation
Evaluating existing transit service provides a greater understanding of the role individual routes
serve within the larger transit network. Route performance is analyzed and benchmarked against
established RTD service standard metrics. This assessment includes a ridership analysis, which
helps in identifying trends and opportunities for route consolidation or service enhancements.

Transit Route Network
The fixed route bus services, which RTD offers are divided into different classes, which vary based
on service type, operating regime, and frequency. The standards for each class are based on
performance of all routes within each class. RTD evaluates performance indicators of subsidy per
boarding and boardings per hour as a part of annual route review.
As categorized in the Table 1, RTD routes within the study area fall under all service classes: CBD
Local, Urban Local, Suburban Local, Regional, and SkyRide. As defined above, CBD Local Routes
offer one-seat rides into or through downtown Denver, however Urban Local routes connect the
urban core to the greater RTD network in areas surrounding downtown and operate only on major
streets. Suburban Local routes provide transit connectivity to lesser developed areas outside of
the core service area. With Regional service, RTD focuses on meeting the peak-period demand
between suburban communities and downtown Denver, while the SkyRide routes cater to
passengers who pay premium fares and desire one-seat rides from transit nodes in the region to
Denver International Airport (DIA).
The different service classes tend to have varying frequencies, with Local, Suburban, and Urban
routes primarily operating on 30-minute peak frequencies and 30 or 60 minute off-peak
frequencies. Additionally, the SkyRide service to DIA operates with a frequency of 60 minutes all
day. Regional routes tend to have the much more focused service frequencies in the peak
commute periods than other more locally focused services.

Fixed Route RTD Service Categories 2
•

Regional: Includes routes providing high-speed service on limited access highways
from suburban and outlying communities to downtown Denver, Denver International
Airport and other metro, major employment centers, and provided at distances of
approximately 6 miles or more.

•

Local CBD: Local or Limited routes operating to/from the Denver Central Business
District.

•

Local Urban: Local or Limited routes that predominantly serve urban areas, which
have high residential and/or employment densities. About 35% or more of route
length within a ¼ mile buffer has population and employment density of 12 per acre
or greater.

•

Local Suburban: Local or Limited routes that predominantly serve suburban areas,
which have low to medium residential densities, medium to large lots and
homogeneous land uses. About 34% or less of route length within a ¼ mile buffer has
population and employment density of 12 per acre or greater.

•

Free Shuttle Services: Free shuttle services, known as the MallRide and the
MetroRide, operate in downtown Denver. The former travels on 16th Street between
Union Station and Civic Center Station and the latter runs between Union Station and
Civic Center Station along 18th and 19th Streets.

•

SkyRide: The SkyRide routes prove direct connection to the airport from multiple
points in the RTD service area.

Transit Service Levels
Transit service levels are measured, by frequency and span. Frequency indicates how often a
route runs and span includes the hours and days of operation. These measures are dependent on
several factors with actual usage (or market demand) being the most important. A higher demand
for transit requires an equally high transit supply. The demand and supply gap is met through
adjustments in frequencies, spans, and days of operation. Additional factors that affect transit
service levels comprise network role, connectivity to popular destinations, historical precedent,
regional significance, and operating agreements.

Frequency
The RTD network operates on one of three different “clock face” frequencies, i.e. spontaneous
use (15 minutes or better), coordinated (30 minutes), and lifeline (60 minutes or more).

Derived from RTD Service Standards (2016)

3.C.1.a

The purpose of spontaneous-use frequencies is to limit wait times for passengers and diminish
the need to plan trips around the schedule ahead of time while responding to high usage. This
results in more cost-effective routes as spontaneous frequencies attract higher number of riders.
Typically, CBD Local and Urban Local routes operate with spontaneous use frequencies.
Routes that are unable to support spontaneous-use frequencies, however have sufficient demand
to support higher service levels than lifeline frequencies, usually operate with coordinated
frequencies. With coordinated frequencies, passengers have the ease of coordinating their trips
ahead of time and schedule their arrival at the stops such that wait time is minimal and overall
travel time decreases.
Areas that do not have the demand for higher frequencies are typically serviced by lifeline
frequencies. These routes are planned to provide transit coverage to communities living outside
of the developed core parts of the region. With these routes, RTD aims to not increase ridership
but instead provide crucial lifeline mobility to vulnerable populations living in those areas. As a
result, lifeline frequencies are found on Suburban Local routes associated with lower residential
density and higher auto ownership.

Span
Service policy and ridership demand typically dictates the RTD span of service. The span of service
for routes varies by service class. Wider service spans offer higher flexibility to customers for
planning trips and boosting ridership, with associated increased operating costs.
Weekday service for CBD Local and Urban Local routes begins between 4:00 AM to 5:00 AM. The
end of service is not generally fixed and varies with routes and their service areas, with some
services ending as early as 8:00 pm and certain others as late as 2:00 AM.
Weekday service for Suburban Local routes usually begins between 5:00 AM and 6:00 AM and
ends at between 7:00 PM and 11:00 PM.
Regional service generally operates only during peak hours, typically operating between 5:00
AM and 9:00 AM in the morning and between 3:00 PM and 7:00 PM in the evening. This span of
service is allocated to accommodate commuter demand travelling to and from large employment
centers. The exception is Route 120X which operates all day due to more consistent demand.

Existing RTD Bus Ridership
Boardings per Hour
RTD also measures route performance through a boardings per revenue hour metric. Routes with
higher boardings per hour characterize routes with higher productivity, i.e. where market demand
is met more accurately by service supply. An increase in demand, with the supply remaining
constant will increase productivity. However, if supply increases but the demand does not, it
would result in a lower productivity measure. A good balance between market demand and
service supply is ideal in that it can create a higher transit return on investment while lowering
the associated subsidies.

Framework and Strategies
Recommendations to align RTD’s bus network with the North Metro N Line have been tailored in
accordance with RTD’s vision to ensure the most efficient service for passengers and the best
possible resource utilization. This vision is focused towards enhancing mobility, linking economic
opportunities, limiting congestion, and providing affordable commute options. Phase I of the
three-phase recommendation strategy maintains current resource levels in terms of peak buses
and bus operators; while Phase II requires a more robust service investment and is proposed for
future implementation based on potential demand growth from the market development within
the first five years the N Line is in operation. Phase III is a potential longer term phase that is
contingent on funding to extend the N Line to 162nd Avenue.
All recommendations have been developed to attract new ridership as well as retain existing
customers, while improving operating efficiency and enhancing transit network effectiveness.
Results from service performance, ridership analysis and market conditions, were instrumental in
developing the framework for the service plan recommendations. The framework and strategies
shaped recommendations from both a top-down network effectiveness perspective, as well as a
bottom-up route optimization perspective.

Service Fundamentals for Transit Design
Service fundamentals constitute two parts, Service Design Decisions and Performance Metrics.
Service design decisions qualitatively describe in detail the reasons for individual route
performance, while performance metrics quantify individual route performance. For individual
route performance, no single metric will give a complete overview of market demand for service
performance and evaluation of an entire network provides a clearer picture.

Service Design Decisions
Effective service design decisions can prove influential in steering customers to ride transit. The
following section discusses the role of service design indicators like frequency, span, speed,
reliability, route alignment, approachability, and network have on ridership levels.

Service Frequency
Service frequency is generally considered the most important service design characteristic for
attracting new riders. Routes that have service every 15 minutes or better, (also known as
spontaneous-use frequencies), prove beneficial to passengers, as they have less out-of-vehiclewait times. Market research has shown that this frequency level encourages passengers to “just
show up and ride” rather than timing their arrival at bus stops. Services with higher frequencies
also provide more convenient and reliable network connections which will maximize overall
ridership.

3.C.1.a

Service Span
Service span is the days and time at which a route operates. Service span relates directly to
ridership as it defines when a passenger can travel and impacts both ends of a trip. A greater
service span provides customers with increased travel flexibility, thus a better transit experience.
Conversely, a greater time span, similar to expanded geographic coverage may be unproductive
depending upon the market served, and prove costly and inefficient to the transit agency.

Service Speed
A greater service speed benefits the customer by reducing in-vehicle travel times and benefits the
transit agency by lowering resource requirements. A review of service speeds includes
identification of deviations (out-of-direction travel), excessive stop dwell times (stops that are
very closely spaced or result in long delays), traffic delays, and unsynchronized travel signal delay
for potential improvements.

Reliability
Reliability is the key service factor that helps retain existing customers. A primary metric is transit
on-time performance, which is essential for passenger reliance on the service in order to avoid
extended waiting and to reach their destination at the desired time, consistently.

Alignment
Alignment refers to the path where a transit route operates. An alignment is best designed when
it balances customer access (i.e. walk distance) with service directness (i.e. quick travel).
Customers usually prefer direct service since it ensures shorter trips, higher reliability, and more
efficient and effective service. A common impact of connecting buses to rail stations is having the
bus leave the regular direct alignment to reach the station. A goal should be to minimize the
nature of the required bus route diversion through good station location/access planning. The
number of patrons riding through the station on the bus versus the potential ridership at the
station must be both considered and are influenced by the length of the deviation (impact on
through riders per new station rider) 3.

Route Spacing
Effective route spacing is crucial to maximize network access. Placing services too close together
or too far apart can affect network cost effectiveness adversely (unproductive competition) and
create issues in network synergy. Where requisite densities are present, the usual route spacing

3

The industry best practice out-of-direction model measures the minutes of out-of-direction travel for the
deviation times the number of through-riders divided by the number of new station riders. A ratio of 2 to 5
minutes is the acceptable range of impacts with 2 minutes a good trade-off and 5 minutes as the highest
acceptable impact.

3.C.1.a

is no closer than ½ a mile and no farther apart than 1 mile. Route spacing is strongly influenced
by existing street networks and the mode and service level. 4

Round Trip Cycle Time
Round trip cycle time, also known as revenue time, includes in-service running time plus terminal
recovery time to ensure on-time departure for the next trip. The relationship between cycle time
and frequency is crucial to higher efficiency. It is also desirable that route alignments and
operating speed be designed to ensure that routes have efficient round trip cycle times whenever
possible.

Network Role
As important as the design of individual routes is, the way they form a network is even more
significant. If a network is effective and efficient, it will be successful in attracting transit use for a
variety of trips and by a wide range of demographic groups.

Approachability
The approachability of a transit system highlights its ease of access and use by existing and
potential customers. A system is considered “approachable” when patrons are comfortable using
public transit and their uncertainty associated with it is reduced or limited. Extensive complexity
and service variations in a transit system can adversely affect the customer perception/attraction
of the network. Qualitative in nature, this assessment is utilized to address issues such as line
branching, short/long lines, trippers, deviations, corridor alignments, service frequencies, proper
signage, and simple user policies.

Performance Metrics
Indicators of performance assist in quantifying a route’s performance and assessing it relative to
others in the system. These performance indicators serve as crucial route evaluation tools since
they allow routes with varying boardings, service levels and costs to be compared directly with
one another as a part of RTD’s service standards. Some of the performance metric inputs are
defined as the following:
•

Boardings: Unlinked passenger trips; includes transfers as boardings.

•

Revenue Hours: In-service hours plus recovery time, not including non-revenue time
(deadheading movements and pull-time to/from garage).

4

Industry best practice design recognizes that customers walk further for better transit with basic local bus
service drawing 80% of its riders within ¼ mile while rail and better bus (Rapid/BRT) have larger customer
walksheds with 80% coming from within ½ mile.

•

Operating Revenue: Cash, tickets, electronic fares, and passes allocated by route by
farebox recorded boardings plus other revenue directly attributable to service operation
(e.g., vehicle and shelter advertising).

•

Operating Cost: All operating, maintenance, and administrative costs for providing
current service; RTD’s 2015 cost allocation model allocates costs to each route based on
its miles, hours, and peak vehicles and varies between in-house and contracted
operations. Individual accounting line items are assigned to the most relevant service unit
variable by the model.

•

Subsidy per Boarding: Operating revenue minus operating cost, divided by ridership;

Network Design Strategy
The aim of the North Metro Corridor Service Plan is to create a more successful transit network
that comprises individual bus routes and a new rail line that do well independently as well as
collectively. Additionally, the plan seeks to encourage transit usage for commuters traveling from
North Metro towards downtown Denver.

Leverage North Line Operations
The construction of the N Line has provided an opportunity to rethink the regional and local bus
transit network that connects the Denver North Metro area to downtown Denver, as well as to
all areas between US-36 on the West and US-76 on the East. To obtain the maximum benefit of
this new rail service, adjacent and intersecting bus routes in this area were incrementally adjusted
to complement the rail service for maximum local and regional coverage where warranted.
Duplicative and unproductive service was removed or reallocated, route alignments were
adjusted, and bus schedules frequencies revised where feasible to better align with the frequency
of the N Line.
Recommendations are proposed in accordance with these actions and will attract additional
riders, improve operations, and enhance regional and community mobility with each plan phase.

Strengthen Bus Service Tiers
RTD operations on each service tier are defined by a target market and associated service
demand. The service tiers prominent in the N Line service area are Urban Local and Suburban
Local. Both these tiers fall in the “transit lifestyle” market in terms of land use and development
densities influencing the service performance and coverage.
Another tier that may require service strengthening in this corridor is the Regional service tier
which has approximately four routes and makes up a large portion of the demand travelling from
the North Denver region to downtown Denver and other parts of the region.

Packet Pg. 344

3.C.1.a

The proposed recommendations focus on increasing transit usage in lifestyle transit areas by
establishing connectivity with the N Line, while at the same time balancing existing and potential
demand with the Regional service.

Route Spacing and Prioritization
In the process of strengthening the transit network in the Denver North region, route
prioritization and consolidation were evaluated.
Route consolidation and prioritization provides an opportunity for RTD to direct limited resources
towards other faster and more reliable services. An example of this in the North Line study area
is Route AA (Wagon Road/Denver Airport). This service has a premium fare ($9.00 one-way cash
and $8.75 one-way My Ride card), making it expensive for airport employees who are the primary
riders. As a recommended alternative, this route can become an extension to Route 104, as 104L,
with local fares.
Similar recommendations have been mentioned in the subsequent sections for areas where
productive routes are operating on adjacent corridors. As these routes compete for the same
riders, prioritizing would improve service effectiveness and reduce net service cost for each route.

Route Design Strategies
For optimum performance of a transit network accompanied by best resource utilization, a clear
vision for the entire network is as essential as it is imperative for individual routes that to attract
ridership. The following strategies have been used as guiding principles to inform
recommendations for study area bus routes. This framework is expected to result in routes with
both improved operating efficiency and customer attractiveness.

Route Streamlining
Routes designed with extensive deviations tend to result in a higher operating cost and lower
ridership. While deviations may reduce walking distance making transit more attractive for a small
number of riders, they result in a degradation of service for a larger number of riders who travel
on the main corridor by creating access gaps and increasing travel time for the majority of
customers.
The N Line service plan aims to eliminate deviations unless they add value for significant numbers
of riders by serving major destinations, transit hubs, and rail stations falling within the corridor.
Additionally, the proposed recommendations look at streamlining bus transit to increase
efficiency and productivity, while facilitating network integration with the N Line.

Stop Consolidation
Even though closely spaced stops may appear to enhance service accessibility for riders, tight stop
spacing makes the service less attractive to people on the bus and may increase operating costs

Packet Pg. 345

3.C.1.a

by slowing service speed. Dwell time at bus stops is one of the major contributors to operating
delays and lower on-time performance, as it significantly impacts service reliability and operating
speed. A balance between efficient stop spacing to maintain convenient access to transit and
reducing unnecessary delay leads to improvements in transit service effectiveness. Even though
stop consolidation is not proposed in Phase I of the North Metro Corridor project, it is
recommended that RTD continue this program throughout the bus network.

Corridor Segment Consolidation
Route Segmentation
In some cases, certain routes perform much better in specific segments. This trend may be a result
of a very long route serving large geographic areas, parts of which may not be as well suited for
transit. In such cases, separating the route into two distinct routes not only improves adherence
to set schedules, but improves efficiency. In the North Metro Corridor, Route 92 is an example of
a route with relatively low ridership from Washington Street/88th Avenue to Summit Grove
Parkway, and higher ridership for rest of the route. This service is a candidate for route
segmentation.

Low Performing Service Replacement
In areas where a route or route segment performs poorly and has limited scope of improvement
in performance, alternatives to fixed route service are considered. These alternative mobility
options include Flex Rides, special shuttles, service routes (tailored for specific trip making, e.g.
seniors), or commute oriented programs (e.g. station vans, car/bike sharing). These options
maintain service coverage as well as reduce RTD’s net subsidy.

Rail Service
Per most recent simulation from LTK consultants (June 2019), operating plan consists of a 20minute peak and 30-minute off-peak headway. This includes the same vehicles, schedule margin,
station dwell times, minimum turn times at terminals, and three added signal restrictions. In
addition, the A Line has priority in the Denver Union Station (DUS) throat and a southbound N
Line train may experience delays, due to a westbound A Line train operating behind schedule.

The approved North Metro Commuter Rail Corridor Rail Operations Plan calls for base bus service
connections to/from the new corridor stations. Included in this plan are routes 12, 48, 49 (former
northern part of Route 48), 72, 80, 88, 88L (former northern part of route 88), 92, 93L (former
eastern part of route 92), 104, 112, 114 (NEW), 120, 120L (former part of route 120), 128, 520
(former part of route 120 within Brighton), 104L (former AA), RX, as well as 41L (former
southern part of route RC).
In order to serve the new stations with connections to/from base bus service, most of these routes
will require adjustments, in order to optimize the overall bus service network. Most of these
connections will result in the need for and cost of additional vehicles and in-service hours.
Routes 104X and RX are proposed to remain on their current routing, without deviating or
extending into any of the N Line stations, yet still are considered part of the overall bus operations
network for the N Line Corridor. However, Route RX would terminate at the northern end at US85
& Bridge Street Park-n-Ride, rather than its current terminal at the Adams County Justice Center.
The following describes these changes in more detail:
Route RX –

discontinuation of routing within City of Brighton; northern terminal would be
US85 & Bridge Street Park-n-Ride

The following routes are proposed to deviate from their current routing into at least one station
each, along the North Metro Commuter Rail Corridor:
Route 12 –

deviate north from current terminal at 106th & Melody Transfer Hub to
Northglenn at 112th Avenue; would require one additional all-day bus (wk)

Route 48 –

minor route adjustments; removal of deviation into Platte Garage, adding
deviation along Brighton Boulevard to access 48th Avenue and Brighton at

National Western Center Station, routing via Race, E 48th/York/47th for better
community access; no additional bus (wk/Sat/Sun); new northern terminal would
be 60th/ Dahlia Transfer Center; would save one all-day bus (Wk)
Route 49 –

would replace current northern portion of Route 48, as of 60th/Dahlia Transfer
Center; Route 49 would operate from 40th & Colorado Station (University of
Colorado A Line) via 60th/Dahlia and then deviate into its terminal at Commerce
City at 72nd Ave Station rather than current terminal at US85 & 72nd Avenue Parkn-Ride; would require one additional all-day bus (Wk)

Route 72 –

deviate into its terminal at Commerce City at 72nd Ave Station rather than
current terminal at US85 & 72nd Avenue Park-n-Ride; would require one
additional all-day bus (Wk)

Route 80 –

deviate north into Original Thornton at 88th Ave Station; would require one
additional all-day bus (Wk)

Route 88 –

deviate/reroute from Thornton PnR into Commerce City at 72nd Ave Station;

Route 88L –

operate from Commerce City at 72nd Ave Station to Original Thornton at 88th Ave
Station, replacing the current Route 88 northern route portion; would require
one additional all-day bus (Sat/Sun)

Route 104L –

(to be converted from SkyRide (AA) to Limited (104L) with opening of North
Metro Commuter Rail Corridor) - deviate into Thornton Crossroads at 104th Ave
Station; would require one additional all-day bus (Wk/Sat/Sun)

The following routes are proposed to have route extensions into at least one station each, along
the North Metro Commuter Rail Corridor:
Route 92 –

extend route into Thornton Crossroads at 104th Ave Station; no cost; would also
include discontinuing route north of 104th/Colorado due to low ridership
(Wk/Sat/Sun) and replacing route portion with new route 93L

Route 93L –

operate between Thornton Park-n-Ride, via Thornton Crossroads at 104th
Station, and current route 92 northern terminal at Summit Grove Parkway and
Colorado Blvd

Routes 104/ 114 – discontinue current routing between US36 & Sheridan and US36 & Church
Ranch Stations. New west-end terminal at US36 & Church Ranch Station. New
short-turn pattern (Route 114) in the peaks, between US36 & Church Ranch
Station and Front Range Community College, along 104th north, Westminster Blvd
and 112th to Front Range Community College. All other current trips would extend

Route 120 –

current short-turn trips between Us36 & Broomfield Station and Wagon Road PnR
would be extended into Eastlake at 124th Ave Station; would require one
additional AM and PM peak bus each (Wk); break route east of the station into
120L (to US85/Bridge St) and 520 (within Brighton only)

Route 120L – would replace current Route 120 between roughly 120th & Washington
and US85 & Bridge Street Park-n-Ride
Route 520 – would replace current Route 120 between US85 & Bridge Street Park-n-Ride
and Prairie Center Mall
Route 128 –

extend route into Eastlake at124th Ave Station; would require one additional allday bus (Wk)

The following route is proposed to be curtailed and rerouted into at least one station along the
North Metro Commuter Rail Corridor:
Route RC (New 41L) – curtail trips at Commerce City at 72nd Ave Station rather than current Route
RC stop location at US85 & 72nd Avenue Park-n-Ride; use saved in-service hours
for 3 additional AM and PM peak trips each, peak direction; these peak trips
would operate bi-directional, between Civic Center Station, via Central Park
Station (A-Line Connection) to Commerce City at 72nd Avenue Station; no cost

We understand that currently several of the routes listed above are not exhibiting a strong
ridership; however, all but route 104 are within the acceptable passengers/hr range for their
current level of operations. Route 104, as described above, is proposed to be restructured so that
it can have multi-purpose and noticeable potential for increased and steady ridership. Thus, there
essentially are no vehicles or in-service hours to ‘harvest’ in order to address the above listed
operational shortfall needs.
In addition, since parking availability, overall along the North Metro Commuter Rail corridor has
been curtailed substantially, from the original anticipated design, it will be vital to the rail line to
have effective and efficient bus route feeder service, in order to provide the needed access to it.
As no budget is assigned within FasTracks to cover these additional bus requirements and inservice hours (resources), Service Development has designed a bus operations plan, for the
upcoming opening of the North Metro Commuter Rail Corridor, which is overall revenue neutral.
Additional vehicle needs will be met through regular service change adjustments prior to the
opening of the corridor.

Conclusion
The introduction of the North Metro Corridor (N Line) presents an opportunity to maximize the
investment by tailoring complementary service that matches market demand, and
accommodates the changing urban landscape in the study area. Currently, many of the
communities served by N Line stations are lower density and suburban in nature. Travel demand
shows a significant number of commuters travel south for work, which presents an opening for
the N Line to facilitate that movement. Outside of the popular I-25 bus routes (120X/122X), most
of the routes within the study area provide basic levels of service and the corridors they operate
on are not yet suitable for high frequencies. The Service Plan recommendations evaluate the best

use of limited resources, for transit in the study area and will fully leverage the new N Line, as well
as the well-utilized I-25 bus routes.

SUMMARY
The North Metro Corridor Draft Service Plan presents the proposed changes in the existing RTD
bus service network for N Line opening in Spring 2020. The Plan includes opportunities for
improving bus transit in Phase I (initial opening of N Line) and Phase II (a 3 – 5 year period
subsequent to N Line opening, based on resource availability), as markets and mobility needs
evolve.
Presently being suburban and low density, with employment concentrated near the highways,
the study area is transitioning from an area with overall low transit usage to an increasing focus
on sustainable mobility. The two I-25 Regional routes (120X and 122X) have high ridership and
productivity indicating significant demand for transit commuting from the north to downtown
Denver. The North Metro Corridor Draft Service Plan focuses on adjusting the bus network to
complement the new N Line while minimizing adverse impacts to existing customers and
maintaining the constraint on added operating resources.
A number of existing bus routes, especially west of the I-25, to stations on the N Line, have been
incrementally extended to stimulate further demand (e.g., routes like 104 that do not connect
with the I-25 Regional transit). These extensions are also geared to provide direct east-west
service and enhance connectivity between neighborhoods in Federal Heights, Westminster,
Thornton, and Northglenn. Routes east of I-25, within the study area, were not altered
significantly to complement the N Line. Significant transit demand is observed south of US-76, in
Commerce City where routes would be adjusted for improved coverage and alignment with the
N Line.
The objective of minimizing rider impacts is met with only 1.1 percent now walking more than a
convenient ¼-mile (5-minute) and just 0.3 percent walking more than the reasonable ½-mile (10minute).
Further consideration of bus service revisions, in a potential long term Phase II, currently
unfunded option, extending the N Line to 164th Avenue were not formally analyzed as part of this
study. However, it is reasonable to presume that RTD regular fixed route service would perform
in the much-lower density of the suburban areas north of the current 124th Avenue terminus, in
a similar fashion to existing low-density areas and have difficulty in meeting minimum productivity
thresholds. Consequently, it is suggested that local mobility connections to the future 144th
Avenue and 164th Avenue stations, on the extended N Line would be best provided by
microtransit/TNC (e.g., Uber, Lyft, Bridj), or autonomous vehicle services in the future. The

availability of such affordable and reliable first-mile and last-mile services is likely to also reduce
the need for station Park-n-Ride capacity, with fewer people driving personal vehicles to the new
stations.

Re:

Service Availability – June 2019

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.54% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in June 2019. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons reflect a significant
decrease compared the same month (June) last year. Service delivery has improved significantly
since July 2018. Lost service for personnel related reasons follows:





June 2019 – 190.12 hours
June 2018 – 1,444.99 hours
Year to date hours for 2019 – 2,255.04 hours
Year to date hours 2018 – 8,740.53 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in June were increased summer special events
(such as: PrideFest, Denver Heart Walk, Rockies home games, Pop Culture Con, and the Garth
Brooks Concert) and planned/unplanned bus bridges (such as: Juneteenth & Truck Stop Rally).
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.54% of all scheduled hours of service in the month, it
was necessary to cover 2,411 shifts with operators working a 6th day (one of their scheduled
days off). This represents approximately 19,288 hours of service being provided by a “6th day”
RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our contractor
partners, First Transit and TransDev.
Additional information regarding bus operator headcount follows:
