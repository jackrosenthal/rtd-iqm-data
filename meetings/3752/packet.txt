BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Strategic Plan Document

February 3, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
John McKay, Executive Business Partner
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan) was approved by the Board during a Special Board
Meeting held on Tuesday, August 10, 2021.
The five-year Strategic Plan includes the agency’s vision, “To be the trusted leader in mobility, delivering
excellence and value to our customers and community,” its mission, “Making lives better through
connections,” and values: passion, respect, diversity, trustworthiness, collaboration and ownership. The
Plan also establishes the agency’s four Strategic Priorities, which serve as the functional pillars used to
plan, develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance:
•
•
•
•

Community Value: RTD strives to be a strong community partner, providing value to customers
as well as to the broader Denver metro region while sustaining planet Earth
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently deliver high-quality customer service
Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management of all financial resources

Each Strategic Priority is associated with a measurable Success Outcome.
Leveraging data garnered through Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership
surveys, staff held strategy sessions to develop tactics to improve agency performance in specific areas.
These tactics were distilled into overarching Strategic Initiatives beginning in the 2023-24 employee
performance cycle, and a fourth Strategic Initiative was developed for the 2024-25 cycle:

•

Back to Basics: RTD strives to enhance the reach and impact of internal communications and to
redouble agency efforts to maintain assets in a state of good repair leveraging sound asset
management principles

•

People Power: Recognizing the critical importance of its people, the agency’s most important
resource, in achieving the agency’s mission, RTD seeks to vigorously address impediments to
recruitment and retention efforts and to foster a culture of learning and development

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

•

Welcoming Transit Environment: RTD seeks to reduce the impacts of criminal behaviors and Code
of Conduct violations on agency services and workplaces and, in doing so, to improve community
and employee perception of personal and public security on RTD property and vehicles

•

Customer and Community Connections: RTD is committed to fostering community building and
enriching the customer experience

During the Board’s annual retreat in 2024, Board members discussed opportunities to enhance agency
transparency and bolster communication and engagement with jurisdictional partners, stakeholders, and
customers. At that time, Board members collectively discussed the development of a series of openended questions intended to probe whether the agency is meeting its performance goals:

Community Value

communities it serves? environment?
build a career?

mobility?
As noted in the Strategic Plan document on page 20 and as contemplated by the Board and staff in
2021, performance metrics are subject to change during the duration of the Plan. Adjusting agency
metrics, and thereby adjusting agency operations and performance, in order to achieve success
outcomes is an essential element of the Strategic Plan.
As such, draft revisions to the Agency Performance Scorecard, the essential core of the Strategic Plan
used to monitor progress toward the established Success Outcomes, were developed by staff in
collaboration with the Board Chair and Performance Committee Chair in 2024. Both the abovereferenced open-ended questions posed during the Board’s 2024 retreat, as well as a detailed discussion
with the Performance Committee during its meeting on Tuesday, May 21, 2024, directly informed those
draft revisions. The Board adopted the revised Agency Performance Scorecard during the monthly Board
meeting on October 22, 2024.
In regard to the Strategic Plan, the Office of the State Auditor (OSA), in an August 2024 report
regarding its recent fiscal governance audit of RTD, recommended that:
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Board of Directors (Board) should ensure that it
receives sufficient information from RTD management so that it can monitor RTD’s
progress in meeting its strategic priorities by…[d]eveloping and implementing a written
policy, bylaw, or other form outlining what changes RTD management can make to RTD's

1.C.1

strategic plan, or other Board-approved or -adopted long-range plans, without Board
consultation and approval, and to what extent management must provide updates to the
Board on any changes made to these plans.
In its response to OSA, RTD stated:
The recommended action report that will accompany the next iteration of the 2021-2026
Strategic Plan in printed form will include reference to the elements that are within staff’s
authority to amend, such as work plans associated with strategic initiatives, and those
elements that must first be considered and approved by the Board prior to revision. Any
revisions to the Strategic Plan contained in this future iteration itself must first be
considered by the Board. Staff intends to present the updated 2021-2026 Strategic Plan
document for the Board’s consideration and approval by March 2025.
DISCUSSION
As pledged in RTD’s response to OSA recommendations in August 2024, staff intends to provide an
updated Strategic Plan document to the Board for its consideration in March 2025. The document will
feature updated design and narrative elements, centered around the revised Agency Performance
Scorecard approved in October 2024. No substantive changes to the Strategic Plan document will be
considered in March 2025, and the Strategic Plan’s Vision, Mission, Values, Strategic Priorities, and
Success Outcomes will remain unchanged.
RTD’s commitment to OSA highlighted herein will be honored and incorporated by reference in the
forthcoming Recommended Action to be considered by the Performance Committee, and subsequently
the full Board, during the March 2025 meeting cycle.
Staff anticipates collaborating with the Board in 2025 and into 2026 regarding an approach to develop
and, prior to the current plan’s expiration in August 2026, implement the next iteration of the agency's
Strategic Plan.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Board Briefing Documents

February 3, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
John McKay, Executive Business Partner
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board of Directors receives information from staff through several channels, including but not limited
to Board agenda packets, email, memoranda, oral reports, scheduled trainings, study sessions and
conversations held in public meetings, and content provided through the agency’s public website.
In January 2021, staff began providing routine monthly updates via Board Briefing Documents housed
on the website and regularly shared by the Board Office. The Board Briefing Documents are intended to
supplement information provided through other channels and can include timely information that does
not by its nature require discussion during Board or committee meetings. This information includes
routine monthly reports, such as those pertaining to financial data, open procurements and recently
awarded contracts, risk settlements, bus and rail service availability and operator vacancies, and recent
community engagements, as well as timely topical information intended for the Board’s awareness.
In May 2024, RTD launched on the agency’s website the Performance Dashboard, an easily accessible
repository for performance data related to the Strategic Plan. The Performance Dashboard enhances
agency transparency and assists the Performance Committee’s efforts to assess the agency’s progress
toward Strategic Plan Success Outcomes. The Performance Dashboard houses information related to the
agency budget and financial reports, people power statistics, and other key organizational performance
metrics.
DISCUSSION
During the committee meeting scheduled for Monday, February 3, 2025, staff will discuss with
committee members how the Board Briefing Documents can best be formatted and streamlined to
provide the Board timely, easily accessible, need-to-know information, which revisions could potentially
include the relocation of certain reports, metrics, and data to the Performance Dashboard or elsewhere.
RTD Board Briefing Documents can be found on the RTD website at: https://www.rtd-denver.com/aboutrtd/board-of-directors/board-briefing-documents

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Performance Committee Work Plan

February 3, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and Chief Executive Officer
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Article VI, Section 4 of the Board Bylaws details the purpose of and process for approving committee
work plans as follows:
Each standing and ad hoc committee must create, approve and forward to the full board for
review an annual work plan detailing the major issues the committee will consider throughout the
fiscal year. The work plan shall be developed in collaboration between the respective committee’s
chair, vice chair, and the responsible RTD staff with the input of the committee’s members. The
work plan must be created and approved by the committee no later than March of each year.
Work plans for standing committees may, for purposes of ensuring the continuity of a standing
committee’s work, extend through February of the following fiscal year. Adjustments and
additions to the work plan can be made by the committee chair in consultation with the
committee vice chair and responsible RTD staff.
Additionally, per Article VI, Section 1, f.), describes the role of the Performance Committee as follows:
The Performance Committee has three oversight functions: 1) Performance management of the
General Manager and CEO, 2) in close coordination with the General Manager and CEO, the
development, ongoing review, and subsequent amendment of long-range strategic planning
efforts, including the agency’s Strategic Plan, 3) high-level monitoring of agency performance in
relation to the Strategic Plan.
With respect to the performance management of the GM/CEO, the committee has primary
oversight over the GM/CEO’s employment agreement, annual goalsetting, the annual performance
assessment framework, and annual performance assessment. The Performance Committee is also
the appropriate venue through which the Board members periodically engage in dialogue with the
GM/CEO to discuss feedback regarding the GM/CEO’s ongoing performance.

Packet Pg. 9

1.C.3

The Committee is responsible for monitoring performance metrics related to, and progress
toward, the agency’s Strategic Plan. The Committee will collaborate with the GM/CEO to set the
cadence, timing, and topics of performance updates relative to the Strategic Plan when
developing and adopting its annual committee work plan.
DISCUSSION
The Committee is asked to review the attached draft work plan and gain an understanding of the
committee’s workflow based on the items currently listed. Additionally, the Directors should provide
additional input on items they would like to see included in the work plan that are not already included in
the draft document.
Following the discussion at the committee meeting, General Manager and CEO Johnson and other senior
staff will meet with the chair and vice chair of the committee to further refine the work plan. Additional
discussions on committee work plans occurred at the 2025 Board Retreat, which was held on Saturday
February 1, 2025. Prior to the retreat the Board Office solicited further input from Directors on items
they wish to see on work plans for the Board’s standing committees. The Committee is asked to discuss
its work plan again at this meeting and incorporate additional potential work plan items that have been
raised in discussion to occur at the meeting as well as via various channels since the Committee’s
January 21, 2025 meeting. Finally, the Committee will look to approve its work plan at its meeting
scheduled for March 3, 2025. Per the Board Bylaws, all committee work plans must be approved by the
end of March 2025.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to the discussion regarding the Committee’s work plan.
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the Performance Committee’s ability to effectively govern directly
impacts the overall performance of the agency. A solid committee work plan will ensure RTD’s resources
are used efficiently, and that the Board’s policy and governance objectives are more focused,
collaborative, and obtainable.
