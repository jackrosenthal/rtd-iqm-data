BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Exercise Contract 19FK002 Options to Purchase 117 40foot and 25 30-foot Transit Buses

Committee Meeting Date:
January 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
January 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO to exercise options and to amend
contract 19FK002 (contract) with Gillig LLC (Gillig) to purchase 117 40-foot and 25 30-foot transit
buses, along with associated spare parts and training, for a total price not to exceed $70,271,993.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
On September 24, 2019, the Board of Directors approved the purchase of 46 40-foot transit buses with
options for an additional 264 buses over a five-year period under the contract.
On Feb 25, 2020, the Board approved the exercise of contract options for 34 additional 40-foot buses.
Exercising options for the purchase of 117 40-foot and 25 30-foot buses will continue the fleet
replacement of the agency’s existing bus fleet that has met its useful life and is consistent with the
agency’s fleet replacement plan.
The buses included in this purchase are equipped similarly to other vehicles recently purchased under the
contract. The 40-foot buses include a seating arrangement with offset areas to maximize space for
customers who utilize mobility devices. Given the differences in base configuration between the 40-foot
and 30-foot buses, RTD will work with Gillig to optimize the seating arrangement on the 30-foot buses
for all customers.
All the buses are equipped with clean diesel engines meeting the current Environmental Protection
Agency emissions requirements. Estimated lifetime vehicle emissions from each bus will be significantly
reduced, by over 100 tons of greenhouse gases, 6.5 tons of Nitrous Oxides and 0.25 tons of particulate
matter, as compared to the buses being replaced, which were purchased in 2005 and manufactured in
2006.
Gillig pricing is based on initial base contract pricing plus:
• An inflationary price (4.89%) adjustment computed using the U.S. Department of Labor’s
“Producer Price Index” or PPI which is published monthly, and
• Equipment changes
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency is striving to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan
priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence and Financial Success. In addition to producing
higher vehicle emissions as cited herein, the buses to be replaced have become prone to on-the-road

failures and are expensive to maintain, as they have met or exceeded their useful life as deemed by the
Federal Transit Administration of 500,000 miles or 12 years. The buses to be procured produce fewer
emissions, have lower downtime, maintenance costs and are more comfortable and reliable.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adoption of the recommended action will create a financial impact not to exceed $70,271,993, the
funding for which is included in the 2022 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2022 Boulder HOP Agreement

Committee Meeting Date:
January 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
January 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO to enter into an agreement with
the City of Boulder (Boulder) to provide funding to support the HOP bus service in an amount not to
exceed $1,356,928.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Erin Vallejos, Senior Manager, Contracted Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD provides extensive bus service to, from and within Boulder. Since 1994, Boulder has supplemented
RTD’s service within the city by providing circulator service, known as the HOP. The HOP provides
mobility and access to Boulder’s commercial areas, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent
business and residential developments. Additionally, the HOP connects to many local and regional RTD
bus routes, as well as with the Downtown Boulder and Boulder Junction at Depot Square Stations.
RTD financial support, along with supplemental funding from Boulder, is used to fund operations and fuel
costs for the HOP bus service.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, RTD seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of
Community Value. From January through November of 2021, the HOP has averaged approximately 673
boardings per day, a 68% reduction from 2019, when average daily boardings for the same period were
2,121.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action, as HOP program
funding support for calendar year 2022 was included in the 2022 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2022 DRCOG Vanpooling Agreement

Committee Meeting Date:
January 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
January 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO to enter into an agreement with
the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide financial support, in an amount not to
exceed $663,000, for calendar year 2022 for the Way to Go vanpool program operations in the Denver
metropolitan area.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Erin Vallejos, Senior Manager, Contracted Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The DRCOG Way to Go Vanpool program (program) provides mobility options for program participants
through ridesharing opportunities. RTD has provided financial support for the program’s vanpools
operating within the agency’s service area since April 2001.
Vanpooling is a transit option in which individuals whose residences are in close geographical proximity
commute to and from their work sites on a regular basis utilizing vans provided by a third-party entity.
Typically, vanpool vans carry six to 12 passengers and are operated and maintained by one of the
vanpool participants. Vanpools provide regularly scheduled, personalized transportation at a low cost and
offer increased capacity as compared to carpools.
By reducing individuals’ reliance on single-occupancy vehicles, the program provides enhanced mobility
options, reduces traffic congestion, and improves air quality.
Through the agency’s financial support, the program’s fares can be more competitive in the transit
marketplace. Funding is also used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool operators and
provide capital funding to acquire necessary vehicles.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, RTD seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of
Community Value. While fewer vanpools are active in January 2022 than prior to the COVID-19
pandemic, as of November 2021, the program’s vanpool fleet is at 78.5% capacity, serving an average
of 5.3 individuals per van, which represents a respective improvement over pre-COVID-19 ridership
levels in 2019.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no additional financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action, as
funding for support of the vanpool program for calendar year 2022 was included in the 2022 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
May 2022 Service Change Proposals

Committee Meeting Date:
January 12, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Acting Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargain Agreement
(CBA) shared between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001, the May 2022 Service
Change Proposal facilitates both an opportunity for bus and rail operators to select new work
assignments and the opportunity for Service Development staff to make adjustments to the operations
plan for the transit network.
Current system-wide ridership trends are relatively stable, showing an overall increase in ridership with a
customary drop in ridership associated with the holiday season (see Figure 1 in Attachment B).
However, operator availability challenges still exist, made worse by absentee issues relating to COVID
19, making it more than difficult to both maintain system on-time performance and expand service
offerings to customers.
DISCUSSION
Following the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Customer Excellence and recognizing
the agency’s ”people power” problem, the proposals herein are directed at improving on-time
performance, adhering to the CBA and adjusting service levels to match anticipated summer ridership
demand.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on established Service Standards
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

Packet Pg. 9

1.F.1

Given the current economic conditions due to the COVID induced economic slowdown, the overarching
guidance for the proposed May 2022 service changes come from the Board adopted guidance for
COVID-19 Budget Reductions, especially Principle number three (3):
“We will prioritize mobility for people who must depend on transit during the pandemic: we will strive to
maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services to
access essential jobs and their necessities, while also keeping our community activity centers
appropriately connected.”
A summary of the list of service proposals are provided below, which are detailed in Attachment A.
