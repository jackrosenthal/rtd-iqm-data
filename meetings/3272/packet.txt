BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
September 2021 Service Change Proposal - Service
Equity Analysis

Committee Meeting Date:
July 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
July 20, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report to comply with federal
laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE

PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
With public health restrictions on building capacity and public gatherings lifting there has been an
increase in requests for a return to pre-pandemic service levels. Though current ridership levels indicate
modest increases, the anticipated return to school and workplace planned for the September 2021
timeframe support the need for increased commuter service. The September service change proposal,
contain a mix of service enhancements and adjustments that address commuter/school service patterns
and contract compliance, leveraging the resources previously dedicated to supporting social distancing.
The proposed service changes further modify the initial COVID-19 service plan implemented April 19,
2020 and modified in both January and June of 2021. The route services contained in the September
service change proposal are a mix of formerly suspended commuter routes with educational institutions
as major ridership generators. The projected school attendance and the number of requests received for
additional commuter service align this proposal with RTD’s service guidelines.
The Board adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Given the current economic conditions due to the COVID induced economic slowdown, the guidance for
the proposed September 2021 service changes also incorporate the Board’s adopted guidance for
COVID-19 Budget Reductions, especially Principle 3:
“We will prioritize mobility for people who must depend on transit during the pandemic: we will strive to
maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services to

Packet Pg. 3

access essential jobs and their necessities, while also keeping our community activity centers
appropriately connected.”
DISCUSSION
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The September service
change proposal includes 18 major service changes. Thus, an analysis is required to be brought before
the RTD Board of Directors for approval. The complete Title VI Service Equity Analysis report is shown
in Attachment A.
RTD’s Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All major
service changes will be subject to an equity analysis.
Major Service Change Results: RTD is proposing changes to 28 bus route/patterns and 3 rail lines of
RTD’s forthcoming September 2021 runboard. Of these 31 changes, 18 services meet established
thresholds for a major service change. The routes listed below have proposed modifications or
reinstatements to service that were greater than 25% of baseline service. Routes in bold met a threshold
for major service changes.

Modified Services (26 services)
(Additional trips, expanded spans of service)

10, 19, 20, 42, 43, 45, 46, 48, 65, 105, 120, 121, 130, 153, 204, 206S, 225,
DASH, JUMP, SKIP, BOLT, LD3
E Line, N Line, W Line

Reinstated Services (6 services)

0L, 3L, 116X, CV, EV, P

Title VI Policies:
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10
percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10 percent more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150
percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
Methodology:

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route level, route block
group, and network level, to identify any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity
or income.
Summary of Findings:
• None of the proposed changes involve reductions in service; all service changes in this runboard
were additions of service through modifications or reinstatements of suspended service.
•

Of the 31 total proposed service changes, 14 had potential disparate impact findings and 2 had
both disparate impact and potential disproportionate burden findings.

•

At the route level, equity routes and non-equity routes were compared only for those with major
service changes. Of the 18 routes with major service changes, all but 1 route (P) serve aboveaverage minority or low-income populations.

•

When considering the demographics within the service areas of routes with major service
changes and as a proportion to the District overall, both minority and low-income equity
populations received a greater increase in service (were positively impacted more) compared to
non-equity populations. Minority areas had a nearly +2% benefit above non-minority areas and
low-income areas received over +6% compared to higher income areas.

Conclusions:
Although some of the major service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact or a
disproportionate burden at the route-level, Title VI concerns are minimal at the network level when
comparing the service changes between the June 2021 and September 2021 runboards. In aggregate, a
review of all routes found no adverse impacts between equity and non-equity routes. Overall, the
system-wide service increases have positively impacted equity groups moderately more compared to
non-equity groups. Therefore, no system-level disparate impact or disproportionate burden is found
related to the proposed major service increases in the September service change proposal.
RTD’s on-going pandemic response, the substantial ridership decline, personnel impacts, resource
allocation (human and capital), and recovery uncertainty serves as justification for maintaining the
September service changes proposal.
RTD will continue to assess the equity implications for all subsequent service change proposals and will
propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis does not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Executive Summary
This document summarizes the analysis of the service changes between the June 2021 and September
2021 runboards to ensure changes have not inequitably impacted minority and low-income populations.

Methodology
RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes,
disparate impacts, and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group
levels to identify any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes
RTD is proposing changes to 28 bus route/patterns and 3 rail lines of RTD’s forthcoming September 2021
runboard. Of these 31 changes, 18 services meet established thresholds for a major service change. The
routes listed below have proposed modifications or reinstatements to service that were greater than 25%
of baseline service. Routes in bold met a threshold for major service changes.
Modified Services (25 services)
(Additional trips, expanded spans of service)

Findings
None of the proposed changes involve reductions in service; all service changes in this runboard were
additions of service through modifications or reinstatements of suspended service. Service was modified
with additional trips, decreased headways, or longer spans of service, and some routes were finally
reinstated since their elimination during extreme service reductions in the face of last year’s challenging
pandemic.
Major service change increases were entirely invested on bus services, and within bus service classes,
these additional hours were distributed among Central Business District (CBD) Local (22.4%), Urban Local
(34%), Suburban Local (26.5%), and Regional (16.7%) bus routes.
When considering the demographics within the service areas of routes with major service changes and as
a proportion to the District overall, both minority and low-income equity populations received a greater
increase in service (were positively impacted more) compared to non-equity populations. Minority
areas had a nearly +2% benefit above non-minority areas and low-income areas received over +6%
compared to higher income areas.
However, potential disparate impacts and disproportionate burdens were identified: of the 18 routes
that had major service changes, 14 had potential disparate impact findings and 2 routes had both
disparate impact and disproportionate burden findings.

Introduction
Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) mission to provide mass transit
service in the Denver Metro Area. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and
adverse effects of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This
principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898
pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin
in programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United
States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied
the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall
make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately
high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on
minority populations and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that are proposed to occur between
the June 2021 and September 2021 runboards. Routes with major service changes include 19 major
increases with 6 of those major service changes being reinstatements of formerly suspended routes.
These changes and all others have been reviewed individually at the route level and in aggregate at the
block group level to identify potential impacts to the communities RTD serves.

Service Change Philosophy
An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD.
These changes include the addition of new routes, the elimination of existing routes, and changes to the
alignment and trip frequency within existing routes. RTD has established principles to identify the service
changes needed to meet the diverse travel needs of the residents of the District and maintain a highperformance, sustainable transit system.

RTD Service Changes Guiding Principles
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color
or national origin; also disparate effects on low-income and minority populations; and
•Response to changes in the communities where services are provided.

RTD services are divided into various service classes depending on service type, route alignment, and
frequency. Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all routes
within each class. RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in
ridership and operational performance of the transit system. It is also the District’s responsibility to
identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment, or cancellation of
service as warranted. In keeping with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to
establish performance metrics used to identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The
District uses these metrics to identify a series of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of
the proposed major service changes on minority populations and low-income households at or below 150
percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider leastcost alternatives in discharging its responsibilities. The general assembly further finds that the
farebox recovery ratio of the district must be improved so that resources once allocated for
mass transportation can be made available for other surface transportation needs.
--Colorado Revised Statutes 32-9-119.7 Farebox Recovery Ratios -- Plans

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These
policies and their applicable thresholds are listed below:

1.B.1.a

1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All
major service changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse
effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that
includes, but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating
segments, rerouting an existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the
degree of adverse effects and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority
population 10 percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a
disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a lowincome population 10 percent more than higher income populations; this level of impact is
considered a disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who
are at or below 150 percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will
consider modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it
removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot
be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service
change, the FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources & Methodology
Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey
(ACS) 5-Year Estimates for years 2014 to 2018 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level.
Other data related to the analysis includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of
these datasets into a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with
changes in service at a geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts to District equity
communities.
The equity analysis for the September 2021 runboard looked at whether an individual route’s major
service changes impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the proportional
difference in changes made to equity populations within a route’s quarter-mile service area. These
proportional differences were compared against District population proportions of equity populations and
route proportions of equity populations.
Low-income status for population within the District is derived from the Census Bureau and is based on
150% of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services guidelines),
based on local context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of 3. Minority status was based
on the non-white and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area was based on the
collection of block groups within the District boundaries.

Route service area population was determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around
bus stops and rail stations. This catchment area was then used to calculate the percentage overlap of
census block-based population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contained 100% of the
underlying block group, 100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter
mile; if 50% of a block group was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population
would count as being included (ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
RTD calculated the net change in service hours for each route modification to provide the percent
difference from baseline service hours. Any change at or above 25% from baseline was flagged as a major
service change for further review.

The public was also notified of the ability to submit comments to service.changes@rtd-denver.com, by
phone at 303-299-2004, and by fax 303-299-2227. The main comments were related to adding back
service.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact, and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
Proposed service changes for the September 2021 runboard that resulted in a 25% or greater change in
service were categorized by equity grouping (minority or non-minority, low-income or higher income) for
comparison. Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their identification within
the prior network using 2018 ACS 5-year demographic data.

A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to review the routes individually. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route service area and compared those against
the equity and non-equity populations of the District. If impacted equity populations within the route
service area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route had a
potential finding of disparate impact (for minority populations) or disproportionate burden (for lowincome populations) and was flagged for a finding of potential impact.
MAJOR SERVICE CHANGE TEST
Identify routes with proposed major service changes (annual trips) of 25% or more

Changes by Transit Mode
Additional hours of service were primarily driven into rebuilding bus services that had previously been
curtailed or suspended. Bus service was increased by nearly 454 daily revenue service hours. The E, W,
and N rail lines had modest increases in service (additional trips on E Line, additional trip on W Line, and
schedule modifications N Lines). Additional daily revenue service hours are proposed for modified or
reinstated services, with 380 of those hours at or above major service change thresholds.

Changes by Route Service Class
All service changes were reviewed by service class, categories generally describing the geographic location
or service area (and unique performance thresholds) of each route. Service changes included all changes
to daily hours in addition to only hours associated with major service changes. Service classes include 4
categories for bus services: Central Business District (CBD) Local, Urban Local, Suburban Local, and
Regional, a rail category, and 3 special services (MallRide, MetroRide, and the Englewood Trolley).
Generally, additional hours of revenue service were evenly distributed among CBD, Urban, and
Suburban Locals and Regional services, with slightly more allocated to Urban and Suburban Local
services.

Major Service Change Review
A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in
aggregate equity groupings of routes prior to individual review of routes, route block groups, and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are
categorized as the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions or Eliminations (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases/Restructuring (service increases of 25% or more related to new or
restructured service)

Major Service Changes
Eighteen bus routes had major service changes and included 12 bus routes with service increases of 25%
or greater and 6 reintroduced bus routes.

Major Service Change Reductions/Eliminations
There were no major service reductions.

Major Service Change Increases/Restructuring
Eighteen routes were found to have major service change increases. These included 6 reinstatements (0L,
3L, 116X, CV, EV, and P) and 12 modifications to spans of service or additional trips (10, 19, 42, 48, 120W,
204, 206S, 225, JUMP, SKIP, BOLT, and LD3). Other routes had modifications that did not meet the
threshold for major service changes (20, 43, 45, 46, 65, 105, 121, 130, 153, DASH, E Line, W Line, and N
Line)

Route-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in
the analysis is to look at each route individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (minority
populations) and/or Disproportionate Burdens (low-income populations). Both service reductions and
service increases are analyzed (for this analysis there were no reductions). For service increases, the

analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and lowincome populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse effects
of the reductions are disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.

DISPARATE IMPACT AND DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN ANALYSIS
For each route with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s impacted equity
and non-equity populations comprising the District’s equity and non-equity populations; if the
difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is required for potential
adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were
reviewed for potential disparate impact (DI) or disproportionate burden (DB) findings. In summary, the
review of these adverse impacts determined the following:
•
•
•

14 routes met the threshold for a potential disparate impact
2 routes met the threshold for a potential disproportionate burden
2 routes met thresholds for both impacts

A complete listing of all potential DI and DB findings can be found in Appendix B.

Network Analysis
A network analysis is not typical in RTD’s equity analyses but was used to understand the large number of
service changes occurring across the network. A network level analysis has potential to provide further
understanding of changes to service levels for Title VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
While RTD has not established a formal policy for a network level analysis, the major service change
threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as precedent to determine
potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring further review. Once
average District thresholds for low-income and minority populations were established, subsequent equity
analyses focused on the subset of District block groups that experienced major service changes of 25% or
greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major service changes
experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes with major
service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group levels
(block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•

Systemwide, service was increased by over 450 daily revenue hours.
Of the over 350,000 people available to be served by stops within the service area of routes with
major service changes, minority and low-income groups represented a higher share of population
than District averages, indicating targeted services to equity groups.

•

At the route level, equity routes and non-equity routes1 were compared only for those with major
service changes. Of the 18 routes with major service changes, all but 1 route (P) serve aboveaverage minority or low-income populations.

In aggregate, a review of all routes found no adverse impacts between equity and non-equity routes.
An analysis of all District block groups and their service levels was conducted to establish the baseline
equity thresholds for low-income and minority populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude
of impacts of the June 2021 to September 2021 service change. Block groups with low-income and
minority populations at or above the District average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block
groups whereas higher income and non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block
groups.
NETWORK ANALYSIS PROCESS
Determine block groups at/above District averages for low-income population (16.8%) and minority
population (35.4%)
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in annual trips for equity versus nonequity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for potential adverse impacts

There are 1,916 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District2. Using the 2018
5-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the
total minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the
District-wide low-income and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified
as above average. While the percent minority figure of 35.4% was derived by using the base population
of the service area (3.019 million) the low-income population percentage of 16.8% is derived from a
slightly smaller population figure. This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census
Bureau can determine3. The thresholds summarized in Error! Reference source not found.4 yielded 751
(39% of all) block groups above the District average for low-income population, and 715 (37%) block
groups above the District average for minority population.

Some block groups are not completely contained within the District boundaries due to differences in boundaries
between the District and Census-defined geographies.
3
The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total
population and results in a different base population used to determine low-income percent of population.

Proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate to determine overall impacts to underlying
population. Table 5 summarizes the change in service for block group population within one quarter mile
of stops with proposed major service changes proportionally compared to population in the District. This
comparison reviews the equity composition of those who may be impacted by proposed service changes
compared to the overall equity composition of the District overall.
Equity groups stand to benefit more than non-equity groups, with minority population benefitting almost
2% more than non-minority population and low-income population receiving 6% more than higher income
population.

Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the locations of above average low-income and minority block groups within the
District, as well as highlight routes with major service changes (orange). Low-income populations and
minority populations appear to overlap in similar areas outside of central Denver, including most of
Aurora, Commerce City, and Brighton, and areas east of Boulder, and areas southeast of Longmont. Lowincome populations appear to have greater spread, with additional areas in the mountain communities
and areas west of Downtown Denver.
Proposed major service changes indicated in these figures show the reinstatement of regional express
services in outer areas previously impacted by pandemic service cuts, such as CV, EV, and P. Reinstatement
of these services expands regional access across the District service area. Several routes also cover large
expanses of equity areas, such as Routes 3L, 19, and 42.

The June 2021 to September 2021 service changes are symbolized in Figure 3. Depiction of route and
segment changes by severity of change, June 2021 to September 2021. This map provides a generalized
view of where service is changing at the route pattern level. The June 2021 bus network is colorized
according to the percentage change in the annual trips. Rail service (E, W, and N lines) had minimal
changes and is excluded from shading. The September 2021 network includes several routes being
modified (light green or teal) or reinstated or having large increases in service (dark blue).
Many reinstated routes are occuring in the periphery of the network and are regional in focus. These were
some of the first and largest cuts to the bus network last year. This includes some of the mountain services
from Evergreen and Conifer to Denver, for example as well as LD3 from Longmont and Route P from
Parker. Some limited services were also reinstated such as 0L, 3L, and 116X among others. Most of the
urban core routes, particularly those in the East Sector serving significant levels of equity populations, saw
some increases in service, represented in green.

Summary of Findings
The network changes that are proposed between June 2021 and September 2021 include modifications
to service that include additional trips and longer spans of service as well as reinstatements of routes
previously suspended during the pandemic. These include limited stop overlays supplemental corridor
local service as well as regional express routes from suburban and mountainous areas of the District. The
major service change increases were entirely invested on bus services, and within bus service classes,
these additional hours were distributed among CBD Local (22.4%), Urban Local (34%), Suburban Local
(26.5%), and Regional (16.7%) bus routes. None of the proposed changes involve reductions in service;
all service changes in this runboard were additions of service through modifications or reinstatements
of suspended service.
Route-level Findings:
•

Of the 31 total proposed service changes, 14 had potential disparate impact findings and 2 had
both disparate impact and potential disproportionate burden findings.

Error! Reference source not found.6 summarizes major service changes by change type, provides findings
of potential disparate impacts and disproportionate burdens based on a comparative difference analysis,
and provides the individual route service change.

Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether there is an
alternative that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will
either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid,
impacts/disproportionate burdens, or;

minimize,

or

mitigate

potential

disparate

b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there
are no alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or disproportionate
burden on low-income customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals.
Alterations to the initial proposed September 2021 service changes4 include adding improvements to the
routes 42, 45, 49, and 121 (all serving high concentrations of minority populations) signifies RTD’s
response to ensure an equitable distribution of service improvements and to minimize impacts.
In addition to the systemwide-level findings below, RTD’s on-going pandemic response, the substantial
ridership decline, personnel impacts, resource allocation (human and capital), and recovery uncertainty
serves as justification for maintaining the September service changes proposal.
Systemwide-level Findings:
•

Of the over 350,000 people available to be served by stops within the service area of routes with
major service changes, minority and low-income groups represented a higher share of population
than District averages, indicating targeted services to equity groups.

•

Of the 18 routes with major service changes, all but 1 route (P) serve above-average minority or
low-income populations.

•

When considering the demographics within the service areas of routes with major service changes
and as a proportion to the District overall, both minority and low-income populations received a
greater increase in service (were positively impacted more) compared to non-equity
populations. Minority areas had a nearly +2% benefit above non-minority areas and low-income
areas received over +6% compared to higher income areas.

Therefore, no system-level disparate impact or disproportionate burden is found related to the proposed
major service increases in the September service change proposal.
