BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
January 4, 2022

2022 Bank Signature Authorization

Board Meeting Date:
January 4, 2022
RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement
(the Agreement) to authorize certain staff members and Board Officers to sign payments exceeding
certain thresholds regarding checks, automated clearing house payments and wire transfers.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Throughout the agency’s procurement, invoicing and payment processes, several internal budgetary
controls serve to prevent incorrect payments. Signature authorizations for certain large payments are
one such control. Payment thresholds have been established that require specific signatures for these
payments to be processed by the Accounts Payable Division and RTD’s commercial bank, currently
Wells Fargo.
Board approval is necessary to designate which individuals may sign these payments and to authorize
them to do so. Wells Fargo requires prompt notification of all modifications in the authorized signatories
on the agency’s various bank accounts. To reflect any changes in agency personnel and the election of
new Board Officers, the Agreement is updated at least annually and periodically as otherwise required.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this agreement, the agency is striving to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of
Financial Success through the authorization of the members of the Executive Committee, as well as the
General Manager and CEO, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operations Officer, and the Chief
Administration officer, serving as of the agreement’s signature date, to approve payments within their
designated signing authority.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Recommended Action has no direct financial impact.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2022 Redistricting Public Outreach Plan

Committee Meeting Date:
January 4, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
January 4, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2022 redistricting outreach plan in accordance with the
recommended by Chair Rivera-Malpiede and Directors Broom and Sloan.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
William C. Van Meter, Assistant General Manager, Planning
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Under RTD’s enabling statutes, following each federal decennial census, the Board must apportion the
composition of the Board into 15 Director districts. Pursuant to §32-9-111(1)(a), C.R.S., the Board must
adopt, by a two-thirds vote, a District map reflective of the revised Director districts. For the redistricting
process following the 2020 decennial census, the action regarding the revised District map must be
adopted on or before March 15, 2022.
In August 2021, the Board Chair established an Ad Hoc Redistricting Committee (committee) composed
of Directors Broom and Sloan. The committee is charged with guiding the redistricting process in
coordination with staff and a third-party consultant.
The committee’s first meeting was held on September 20, 2021. All committee meetings have been
publicly noticed and convened in a virtual setting due to the COVID-19 public health emergency.
At the November 16, 2021 Board meeting, regarding the solicitation of public input, the Board directed
the committee to:
• Hold no fewer than four and no more than six public meetings during the redistricting process to
receive comments from interested and impacted parties
• Present a plan for Board approval
• Hold at least three public hearings prior to the Board’s final consideration of a redistricting plan
DISCUSSION
The agency strives to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community Value and Customer
Excellence in establishing a robust public outreach plan for the 2022 redistricting process.
In adopting this recommended action, the Board establishes the following schedule of public meetings
and hearings:

Staff is currently working to schedule times for the additional public meetings and hearings that are not
associated with an event identified in the schedule included herein. Under this schedule:
• The first public meeting is anticipated to be held in conjunction with the January 19 Citizens
Advisory Committee meeting, which is publicly noticed
• Three additional public meetings are anticipated to be held between January 19 and 27, 2022
• Public hearings will begin on February 9, with the February 14, 2022 committee meeting serving
as the final public hearing
The public meetings held in January 2022 will provide the public with background on RTD and the Board
structure and seek comments regarding the redistricting process. The public hearings held in February
2022 will provide background on the redistricting process and seek comments regarding a recommended
draft map.
All meetings and hearings will be publicly noticed and held virtually due to the COVID-19 public health
emergency. At least one public meeting will be conducted through the social media platform Facebook
Live. All maps and accompanying materials will be posted on RTD’s website and will include the ability
for the public to submit written comment directly through RTD’s redistricting process webpage:
https://www.rtd-denver.com/rtd-redistricting-process
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact associated with the Board’s adoption of this plan is de minimis as existing staff
resources will be used in the normal course of business to plan and conduct the public meetings and
hearings.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Internal Audit Improvement Plan

Committee Meeting Date:
January 4, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2020 and 2021, RTD’s internal audit function was subject to review by external entities, namely the
Office of the State Auditor (OSA) and a peer review panel requested of the American Public
Transportation Association (APTA) by the General Manager and CEO. The performance audit performed
by OSA and the review performed by the APTA panel both resulted in overarching findings and
recommendations regarding the operation of the internal audit function and the Board’s Audit
Committee.
The internal audit function of a public entity:
• Is an independent and objective assurance and consulting function
• Is guided by a philosophy of adding value to improve the entity’s operations
• Utilizes a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the
entity’s governance, risk management, and internal controls
Following the OSA and APTA reviews, RTD launched a process to align its internal audit function with
recognized audit standards and practices of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) International Standards
for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing.
On July 19, 2021, RTD published a request for quotations from consultants for internal audit
improvements, with the intent to:
• Align the internal audit function with recognized audit standards and practices of the Institute of
Internal Auditors International Professional Practice Framework
• Ensure the efficacy of this function according to auditing best practices
• Implement recommendations from the OSA audit and the APTA peer review
RubinBrown was selected as the audit consultant in August 2021 and was tasked with undertaking the
following objectives:
• Understand and incorporate the findings from the OSA and APTA reviews
• Define an optimal internal audit structure
• Recommend an optimal structure for Board’s Audit Committee

Packet Pg. 29

•

Provide examples and best practices of internal audit charters and provide recommendations for
improvements to agency’s internal audit charter
Perform an enterprise risk assessment (ERA) and establish the templates and process for future
ERAs
Perform a peer comparison
Provide an internal audit report template and audit software recommendations
Assist with resource selection for additional internal audit resources

DISCUSSION
In implementing the recommendations from the OSA audit and the APTA peer review, the agency is
striving to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence,
Employee Ownership, and Financial Success.
RubinBrown will present recommendations during the January 4, 2022 Special Board Meeting regarding
the following:
• The optimal structure for RTD with respect to internal audit
• Audit Committee best practices and recommendations
• Enterprise risk management processes and conclusions
• The audit process and customary time frame
Staff, working in an administrative capacity, will undertake the appropriate next steps to retain
professional auditing services to effectuate the recommendations and ensure compliance with the OSA
in advance of the February 22, 2022 Legislative Audit Committee.
Additional next steps include:
• The establishment of an Audit Committee, with composition and responsibilities as recommended
in the IIA’s “Global Public Sector Insight: Independent Audit Committees in Public Sector
Organizations” publication and the IIA Benchmarking Report
• The creation of a risk-based internal audit plan for 2022 that addresses the risks identified by
RubinBrown in an enterprise risk assessment conducted in October and November 2021

In December 2020 the Colorado Office of the State Auditor’s (OSA) completed a
performance audit of the Regional Transportation District (RTD). In April 2021 the
American Public Transportation Association (APTA) completed an RTD Internal Audit
Peer Review. As a result of the OSA and APTA reviews RTD launched a process to align
its Internal Audit function with recognized audit standards and practices of the
Institute of Internal Auditor’s (IIA) International Standards for the Professional Practice
of Internal Auditing (Standards).
RTD engaged RubinBrown to assist with developing and implementing improvements
to the RTD Internal Audit function.

RubinBrown compared RTD’s current internal audit structure to peer transportation
authorities and the Institute of Internal Auditor’s (IIA) 2021AIS Benchmarking Report
(IIA Benchmarking Report). Peer comparisons and the IIA Benchmarking Report
validated APTA’s recommendations to increase RTD’s internal audit staffing to
approximately five auditors.
Qualitative key attributes considered for providing valuable internal audit services
to RTD:
Institutional and industry knowledge
Technical audit capabilities
Ease of staffing/scalability
Relationship development and communication
Primary staffing models evaluated:
In-house – Staffed with all internal RTD personnel
Co-sourced – Staffed with a mixture of internal RTD personnel and external
resources
Outsourced – An external firm functions as the internal audit department
