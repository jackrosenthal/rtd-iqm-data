Detail Regarding Staff Thinking on Additional EcoPass Increase

CEO~

.o/~

The memorandum outlines the methodology that was used to arrive at the staff conclusion that
an additional 4.4 percent increase should be applied to EcoPass pricing to get the average fare
for EcoPass riders in line with the new fare policies. This 4.4 percent increase is in addition to
the 13.3 percent increase that results from applying the current policy for pricing EcoPass on a
general fare increase.
We were able to use the 2011 Customer Satisfaction Survey to determine the breakdown of
EcoPass trips by trip type :
•
•
•

Local: 50.3%
Express: 22.2%
Regional (including Airport): 27.5%

Applying these percentages to the current fares we were able to calculate that the undiscounted
average fare for EcoPass riders would be $3.39.
•

0.503($2.25) + 0.222($4.00) + 0.275($5.00) = $3.39

Per the new fare policy recommendations, we applied a 30 percent discount to EcoPass which
indicated that those policies would result in an average fare of $2.38 per trip for EcoPass.
We worked with CH2M to utilize their FARES model to determine that the average fare that
EcoPass riders were paying was actually $2.28 which is 4.4 percent lower than the $2.38 that
was calculated for what we should expect EcoPass riders to pay. The FARES model was
calibrated with the most up to date information at the time we initiated the study which was a
combination of 2011 Customer Satisfaction Data and more up to date ridership and revenue
information.
Additional Details:
•

The 30 percent discount is calculated by applying the following discounts:

Monthly Pass: 15% (new fare structure resulted in this discount being reduced
from 20% to 15%)
ValuPass: 8.3%
FlexPass Volume: 5%
FlexPass Pretax: 5%
Induced Demand: 1.7%
When all applied together these discounts result in a 30.85% discount which was
rounded to 30% for simplicity.

Note that the $2.28 is slightly different than the average fare for EcoPass users shown in
the Title VI equity analysis that was completed for fare structure evaluation as part of the
first phases of the study. The initial equity analysis included simplifying assumptions
about pa~ses . Those simplifying assumptions were ok as part of that analysis since we
knew that pass programs would be evaluated in additional detail in the next phase of the
study. As part of the pass program phase, these assumptions were refined and it was
determined that the average fare EcoPass riders were paying was $2.28.

Why Pass Programs?
• Increase ridership
• Promote ridership among “specialized”
populations; potentially increases future ridership
(college students become regular riders)
• Promote the RTD brand and establish customer
loyalty
• Provide revenue certainty with upfront payments
• Reduce the cost of fare collection
• Improve efficiency of vehicle boarding
• Add convenience for passengers
• Promote relationships with local governments and
businesses

Current Policy for
EcoPass Utilization Pricing
• 2009 Board adopted policy
– No changes to EcoPass pricing until smart card
ridership data are available or there is a general RTD
fare increase
– Continued use of a matrix with employer size and
service area to determine Business EcoPass contract
prices
– Prices will be based on the value of all trips within a
matrix category with a 40 percent discount once data
are available (not yet implemented)
– No company contract should increase by more than
10 percent unless there is a general fare increase (for
the first two years)
– Revisit approach after three years of pricing based on
smart card data

Current Thinking on
Discount Level
• 40 percent discount was based on the
following:
– Monthly pass: 20 percent discount
– ValuPass: 8.3 percent discount
– Pre-tax benefit (FlexPass): 5 percent discount
– Quantity discount (>200/mo FlexPass): 5 percent
discount
– Induced demand from all-in program: 1.7 percent

• Current staff thinking: Change 40 percent
discount to a 30 percent discount
– Monthly pass discount decreased with the new
fare policies
– Discounts should be compounded not added

Business EcoPass Contracts
• Increase Business EcoPass contracts by
18.3 percent
– Apply 13.3 percent increase due to the new fare
structure (general fare increase factored by
ridership)
– Apply additional 4.4 percent increase based on
average fare analysis (survey data) that suggests
Business EcoPass is currently underpriced
(incorporates 30 percent discount)

• Eliminate $2.50 upgrade charge to DIA
– Include Airport trips on EcoPass consistent with
other Regional passes that include trips to DIA

Detail for Upgrade Charge to DIA
• 2014 data were used to estimate that the
revenue generated from the $2.50 upgrade
was approximately $85,000
– Approximately 34,000 trips

• Administrative costs associated with $2.50
upgrade
– Separate smart cards are required for DIA
EcoPasses

• Logistical challenges with train service to DIA
• Confusion for customers
• All other Regional passes will be valid for
travel to DIA including Day Passes

Revenue Impact
• 13.3 percent increase was included as an
assumption in the revenue modeling for
the structure and level analysis
– Minimum amount of increase needed to
achieve SBP fare revenue targets

• Additional increase in EcoPass contracts

additional fare revenue per year
