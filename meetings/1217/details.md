## IV. Retiree Awards

There were two retirees in September.  General Manager Washington and Brian Iacono introduced Glenda Rene Hagan who has been a purchasing agent for 28 years.  Brian stated there is no real way to introduce someone who has been dependable, faithful and loyal for over 28 years.  Rene started in procurement when RTD was at Alameda and later moved to the District Shops.  She has spent the last 15 years at the Blake Street office where she has purchased everything from diesel fuel to professional services. She worked on the grand opening, purchased material for the bus roadeo for 25 years, and has even volunteered to face paint at the bus roadeo.  Rene was extremely loyal to RTD and operated with fairness and what was in the best interest of RTD.

Rene stated that she loves RTD and RTD will always be a part of her family.  She started she ended the job loving what she did.  She will miss everyone and wishes RTD the best.

General Manager Washington introduced Rene’s husband, Ronnie, who was in the audience.

The Board gave Rene Hagan a standing ovation for 28 years of dedicated service.

Chair Anderson also acknowledged Ron Salisbury, materials handler & purchasing manager, with over 35 years of experience at RTD.

## V. Public Participation

- Gary Van Dorn, Board member of the National Federation of the Blind of Colorado, thanked RTD for the automated stop announcements.  He especially thanked Eric Farrington for listening to this need and getting it implemented.  He also thanked Chair Anderson and Directors Bagley and Solano for attending their 25-year anniversary.  Chair Anderson thanked the Center for the Blind for the invitation and expressed this was a wonderful and inspiring event.

- Audrey DeBarros, Executive Director for 36 Commuting Solutions, indicated they are in support of item C, approval of final scope elements for US 36 Bus Rapid Transit.  She spoke about a study that 36 Solutions had conducted related to the last mile in which concerns over appropriate bike shelters was an issue.  She stated there are various bike shelters around Boulder and they would be pursuing funding for these shelters.  They appreciate the support RTD has given to this issue and the intent to cooperate with US 36 Solutions on the pursuit of funding.

- Richard Martinez indicated that he is on strike with RMR. He stated the workers have been treated with injustice. He spoke of various issues with RMR involving safety, workers not being treated with respect and not being paid proper wages.

- Ngitia Nguyen noted that the RMR restitution has been investigated by the Department of Labor twice and that there is still an ongoing issue with DUS. They wish RTD had investigated RMR’s history more thoroughly where they would discover that there have been employment violations stemming from 2010 until current.  He understands RTD’s focus to get on with the transit business; however, they would hope RTD shows leadership and join with other transit properties who have implemented pre-qualification benefits.

- Martin Ramirez indicated he was a former RMR worker and speaking in support of workers of RMR.  He stated that RMR has some of the bigger contracts and it is not fair to give money to a company with so many labor disputes.  He thinks RTD should think twice before dealing with this type of company.

- Harold Christianson, Denver Mailers Union, stated that he is a bus rider and has always supported RTD; however, he is thinking twice about this when RTD is doing business with a company like RMR that has many wage and safety violations.  As a taxpayer, he does not approve. He really hates the labor violations and hopes RTD will look into these issues.

- Jim Toweill stated he was present to support the RMR workers.  He has been here before numerous times and is becoming frustrated regarding these ongoing RMR labor disputes.  He commented that in July, the DOL opened another investigation.  Yet, RMR continues to work on Eagle P3 and the North Metro Line.  RMR is noncompliant and continues to break the law. RTD should consider instituting pre-qualification standards similar to other areas such as LA Metro.

- Stu Steffens, Aurora, expressed frustration that RMR has incurred violations in 2010, 2011, 2012 and now 2013 but continues to get work in this area.  He is disappointed that public officials like the RTD Board have not taken action on these matters.

- Francisco Nuinez, operating with an interpreter, spoke that he has worked many years in the ironworker’s trade.  This is hard work.  He is here to support the RMR workers.  He is disgusted that the workers are being treated unfairly.  Workers should be treated with dignity and respect.  They should be paid the wages they are supposed to be paid and they should be paid on time. RTD should step in and do what is right.  He does not want his tax dollars supporting contractors who break the law.

- Doug Gragg commented that several months ago he had inquired about the railroad station picture gallery and has not received any feedback.  He also inquired about what has happened to the Railroad Club.  Recently he has been trying to help a person who is homeless and has a bike.  He has been having problems using our service and he wonders if bike transport is becoming an issue for RTD and what our plans were for transporting bikes. He stated that after hearing these RMR workers, he thinks there is a moral issue that needs to be addressed.

- Joe Thomas, who lives in District B works for Colorado Jobs for Justice, did an analogy of not investing in a contractor who had delivered faulty parts so why work with a contractor who is not living up to the contract for fair treatment of the workers. RTD should support workers who are not being paid the wages that are a legal requirement.  He looks forward to resolution on the RMR labor dispute matters.

- Robert McGoey, Denver, stated that public transportation and his bicycle are his main forms of transportation.  He expressed concerns that RTD would do business with a company like RMR.  The wage issues are unacceptable.  The average loss per worker is currently about $700.  He stated none of the Board members would take this figure lightly. As the end user of service of RMR, RTD has a responsibility to ensure workers are treated fairly and safely.  He wants RTD to implement standards to insure workers are treated fairly and paid appropriately.

- Louis Apolinar stated that he was a RMR worker out on strike.  He worked on the DUS site where he witnessed a number of abuses.  Workers started earning prevailing wages but without notice, wages were cut down to $15 per hour which is far below prevailing wages.  Many injuries go unreported on the job site. The employees are provided no water or breaks.  RMR is working on the I-225 and Eagle P3 and may try to work on the North Metro.  He is here because the issue continues to go on unresolved.  His stories are not isolated incidents and he is frustrated that RTD has not taken steps to make sure these issues/violations do not occur again.

### A. Minutes of Aug 20, 2013 5:30 PM

## IX. Chair's Report

- Chair Anderson provided an update on the Gold line tours.  The first tour hosted by Kevin Flynn occurred on September 6 and included Directors Deadwyler, Rivera-Malpiede and Lasater.  The second tour, which was scheduled for September 12, was rained out.

- Several Board members attended the RTD Bus and Paratransit Roadeo on Saturday, September 14.  Board members in attendance were Chair Anderson, Directors Daly, Hoy, Tobiassen and Walker.  She continues to marvel at the dedication of the employees and how much pride they take in their work.

- Chair Anderson, Director Bagley and Director Solano attended the Colorado Center for the Blind 25-year celebration.  Afterwards, Director Bagley escorted her throughout his district and showed her the extensions.  She saw the new apartments that were purchased by the Center for the Blind and they are conveniently located for public transportation.  She was also impressed with the tactile picture they showed that included stone, sky, mountains and other images.  She appreciates the good work that the Colorado Center for the Blind does not only for Colorado but for students who come from across the country.

- The Board members and the CDOT Commissioners will have a dinner meeting tomorrow night.  We try to have at least one annual meeting a year and we rotate the hosting of these events.

- Several Board members will be attending the APTA Annual event in Chicago.  General Manager Washington will receive the 2013 Outstanding GM of the year award.

- Several Board members will also attend the RailVolution Conference in Seattle.  This is a very educational event where Board members can learn more about the different types of rail technology going into this District.  Chair Anderson reminded Board members attending both event to prepare a “trip Tic” on these conferences.

- Chair Anderson shared that she has been participating in an interview with Channel 8 which is looking at the Gold Line in Arvada.  This will be part of the series on RTD and transportation.

- Chair Anderson reminded the Board members that if they have an item on the unanimous consent that they wanted to discuss or was concerned about, please ask to have that item moved to recommended action for further discussion.  She also asked the Board members who vote no or abstain on an item, to please share their reason with the Board.  This is helpful for the Board members to hear.

## X. General Manager's Report

- General Manager Washington provided a status update on the storm and flood impacts on RTD operations and Capital Program.  Staff has been sending out regular daily updates to the Board.  In general, we have maintained service throughout this situation.  The exceptions include routes N, Y, and YL due to impassable roads. We have had minor detours.  RTD is working with the Office of Emergency Management in helping to transport families that have been displaced. Our LRT has run on schedule throughout this process. FasTracks construction appears to be minimally impacted but they are still in the process of assessing the situation.  RTD has been asked to consider looking at an alternate route N for Nederlands.  They are evaluating this request but clearly there are safety concerns around things like road switchbacks, etc. that could affect drivers and passengers.  They will continue to process this request but our first priority is safety.  Our facilities appear to be in pretty good condition but we are doing a full assessment.  The employees did a tremendous job during the flooding.  In spite of the heavy rains, the rail crew did necessary repair work on the tracks in downtown Denver.

- Comments from Board members:

o        Chair Anderson explained concerns from the Board regarding the flooding situation and its impact on the Colorado community.  It may take a long time to rebuild some of the critical infrastructures that get people in and out of the communities.  She also shared that the Board had been contacted by American Red Cross and gave all of our free ride coupons to them (about 1200).

o        Director Sisk expressed appreciation to staff for looking for options to service Nederlands.  These people are heavily dependent on mass transportation and Eco Pass.  He hears that route 119 can be closed up to 30 days or more.  Cities like Nederland and Lyons are cutoff from the road and need our support and assistance.

o        Director Bagley echoed this sentiment and stated we have communities in crisis.  RTD has responded well thus far and we will continue to do what we can safely do.  He thanked Scott Reed (Public information) for the updates.

- General Manager Washington commented on the tremendous effort that went into the preparation and the actual bus roadeo event. In addition to RTD participation, the privates and the statewide transit agencies were represented with CASTA.

- Other Matters:

o        Two transit agencies from Boston (MBTA) and Broward County (FLA) will be coming to discuss best practices from Eagle P3 and the WIN program.

## XI. Unanimous Consent

##### a. Investment Policy 083013

##### b. 2013 Investment Policy

### B. Park Creek Metro District & Forest City Stapleton, Inc. Inter-governmental Agreement Amendment

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute a third amendment of an existing Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) with Park Creek Metro District & Forest City Stapleton, Inc. for participating in the funding for the design, construction, and management of the infrastructure that will support the Central Park PnR along the East Rail Line.  It is also recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute the necessary documents to convey a certain amount of RTD property for dedication as City and County of Denver ROW. The cost maximum for RTD’s share of the infrastructure improvements has been determined to be $5,564,325. Funding for this IGA is included in the 2013 Amended Capital Programs and the FasTracks Eagle project budgets.

Motion:              Director Deadwyler made the motion to approve the Park Creek Metro District & Forest City Stapleton, Inc Inter-governmental Agreement Amendment.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Rivera-Malpiede indicated she will abstain since she works for a TMA which gets some of its funding through the Park Creek District.

Vote on Motion:              The motion passed with 12 Board members in favor (Anderson, Bagley, Daly, Deadwyler, Folska, Hoy, James, Lubow, Sisk, Solano, Tobiassen and Walker) and 1 abstain (Rivera-Malpiede) and 1 no-vote (Menten) who had left the meeting.  Director Lasater was absent.

Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. CPS PNR BoardReport Exhibit_082813_22x34

### C. Approval of Final Scope Elements for US 36 Bus Rapid Transit

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the final scope elements (as illustrated in the table below) to establish BRT in the US 36 Corridor, as it is RTD Staff’s desire and intent to implement a “World Class” Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the US 36 Corridor.  RTD Staff believe that the implementation of these final scope elements will effectively complete a model BRT in the US 36 Corridor.  Approval of this action will allow RTD to commit to the completion of the US 36 BRT project through implementation of defined scope items, as RTD does on every other project in the FasTracks program.

Remaining Project Scope Items

Motion:              Director Sisk made the motion to approve the final scope elements for US 36 Bus Rapid Transit.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Folska indicated she would be voting for this motion but we are operating a multi-modal system which does include bicycles.  She encouraged staff and US 36 to pursue funding for the bike shelters.

Director Sisk referenced the letter that the Board members had received from the US 36 Commuting Solutions. He thanked the RTD staff for the progress and cooperation.  He stated that Audrey DeBarros and US 36 would be looking for a funding source for the bike shelters.  He thanked the RTD Board for their support.

Director Menten stated that she would be a no vote on this issue.  This item included passenger communications improvements which right now no one can provide a cost on what that is.  She needs more solid information and she will vote no unless someone moves to pull this specific item from the list.

Vote on Motion:              The motion passed with 13 Board members in favor (Anderson, Bagley, Daly, Deadwyler, Folska, Hoy, James. Lubow, Rivera-Malpiede, Sisk, Solano, Tobiassen and Walker) and 1 no (Director Menten).  Director Lasater was absent.

Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

## XIII. Executive Session

There was no executive session.

## XIV. Old Business

- Director Solano expressed that RTD needs to consider the RMR issues.  Labor is the backbone of this country.

- Director James wanted to welcome the Board members to his part of the hood for their dinner meeting with CDOT.

- Director James stated that he had attended the Matt Cohen fundraiser with the Realtor community.  Matt shared a few comments that were uplifting and inspiring.

- Director Menten asked for a status on her questions related to the unsolicited proposal for motorcycles to use our parking space.  General Manager Washington indicated they are looking at this whole piece and will have a response in about a week.

- Director Folska expressed that this whole RMR issue is concerning.  She asked if any of the speakers are actually RMR workers on strike.  She thinks this merits a further look.

- Director Lubow also expressed concern about the RMR issue.  There should be some standard that we uphold on fairness, whether we deal with who works for us directly or indirectly.  This issue has not reached completion and the Board members need more information.  Perhaps staff needs to talk to RMR and do a more thorough analysis to determine what we can do.

## XV. New Business

- Director Bagley stated that he attended the State of Downtown Denver along with Director James.  This was very informative.  Bill Mosher had presented on the status of the DUS project.  Walter Isenberg had provided an update on the hotel.  RTD infrastructure and the work we are doing are getting lots of focus from this group.

- Director Bagley reported that the Colorado Center for the Blind is in his District.  He was happy to escort Chair Anderson about town looking at the extensions.  He also thanked Director Solano for attending.  He shared they spent some time with the Mayor of Littleton and Brent Batron with the Center for the Blind.  The new apartments are wonderful and the bus service is great.  He is happy to provide a tour of this area to look at the importance of the Southwest/Southeast extensions.

- Director Hoy reminded the Board of the next CAC meeting.
