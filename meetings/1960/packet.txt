3 Intern Presentations - IT, Planning and Civil Rights
Phil Washington, General Manager, said that for the past decade RTD has been reaching
out to the community through the internship program. This program provides learning
opportunities for young people to work for RTD on an annual or summer basis. It also
provides RTD with valuable work in different areas and projects. Currently there are 30
interns throughout the District. Interns are both at the High School and College levels.
He mentioned that in the past week 8 intern teams presented their reports to the Senior
Leadership Team (SLT) and other RTD staff. Phil Washington asked 3 teams to report to
the Board: Planning Department, Civil Rights Department, and Information Technology (IT)
Department. He then introduced Victoria Broce, Labor Relations Administrator and
Internship Program Manager, to introduce the interns.
Victoria Broce introduced the Planning Department Annual Interns: Kim Kinnison,
University of Colorado (CU) Denver Geography senior student, and Rebecca Tate, CU
Denver Urban and Regional Planning and Business Administration graduate student.
Stephen Rijo, University of Denver graduate student and teaching assistant for the
Department of Geography and the Environment, was not in attendance.
Kim Kinnison said she worked with the Planning Technical Services team. Among her
contributions were the I-225 Draft Opening Day Schedule, Light Rail Simulation Calibration
and the 2013 Bike on Bus Report.
Rebecca Tate mentioned that Stephen Rijo recently started the internship at RTD. Among
his current projects are the License Plate Survey, Bike Parking and Accessibility Plan, and
Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This last one, GIS, is his area of expertise. She
said her work has focused on Transit Oriented Development (TOD), specifically Alameda,
Olde Town Arvada, Welton Corridor and Federal Center. She also worked on the 2013
TOD Status Report and on the Grant Task Force.

Victoria Broce introduced the Civil Rights Annual Interns from Arrupe Jesuit High School:
Andrew Ramirez (junior), Estefan Hernandez, (senior), and Jazmin Huerta (2014 graduate).

Victoria Broce introduced the IT Department Summer Interns: Jazzmyn Boykins (Overland
High School), Elijah Hewlett (George Washington High School), Devonte Stephens, (East
High School), and Jorden Cammack (Thomas Jefferson High School). As a group they
shadowed the IT Department and worked with The Hub. They learned about
troubleshooting, hard drives, firewall audit, and data collection and use.
Phil Washington acknowledged the parents and counselors in the audience. He said it was
great to see all these young people working different areas. He noted it was a great
indication of all the disciplines required to run the District.
Director Folska expressed her relief and hope about the future. She regretted not being
able to see the other presentations. She applauded Phil Washington and staff for the
internship work. Director Folska mentioned she knows Stephen Rijo as she has guest
lectured for Andy Getz, one of his professors. She sent her greetings to Jeremy Nemeth,
one of Rebecca Tate’s professors. She encouraged the IT interns to invent a “ping” sound
for the emergency blue phones.
Director Bagley remembered when, along with Phil Washington, he engaged WIN program
participants at the Alameda Groundbreaking event. He said the internship program is an
extension of such programs in creating ladders of opportunities. Director Bagley added
that he was proud of the groups as it is hard to present to the Board of Directors.
Director Walker congratulated staff on the internship initiative. He also thanked the
parents and counselors for their support. He offered the interns advice: always look for the
solution and not focus on the problem.
Chair Sisk expressed how proud he was of the young people serving the community and
the state. He encouraged Monte Whaley, reporter for the Denver Post, to write a story on
the interns as they are the true lead story. Chair Sisk thanked Phil Washington and staff
for the robust internship program.

ADA Update (Abel)
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, introduced Larry Buter,
Manager for Paratransit Services and Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager for Contracted
Services. Together they presented the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) Update
starting on page 2 of the Study Session Packet for July 29, 2014. Bruce Abel mentioned
that throughout many meetings the Directors have received updates on ADA and the
Access-a-Ride service. The purpose of the update during this meeting is to collectively
have a better understanding on the matter.
The presentation included an overview of the ADA law and RTD’s Access-a-Ride program
description, structure, eligibility, and certification process. It also covered the Access-aRide and Access-a-Cab programs descriptions and data. The presentation concluded with
the programs challenges, such as operator shortages, increased demand, and cost among
others. During the presentation, Larry Buter noted that Access-a-Ride consults the
government’s weather forecast in order to determine conditional services availability.
Bruce Abel emphasized that eligibility is not based on a medical condition but rather on
functional abilities. He also noted that in 2008 the Access-a-Cab subsidy changed from
$7 to $12. This proved to be an overall cost effective way to provide for constituents’
mobility needs.
Director Anderson said that some of her questions were answered throughout the course
of the presentation, including exploring newer, cost-effective vehicle options and weather
forecast. She inquired about a couple of her constituents who were denied Access-a-Ride
certification. Larry Buter indicated that one of them enhanced his mobility when he
acquired an electric wheelchair. He did get certified on a conditional basis for snow.
Director Anderson said she was impressed with the program’s flexibility. She also
complemented the staff on responsibly using tax payer dollars and being successful in
delivering ADA services. She shared that a friend’s mother is a client of the Access-a-Ride
program. The mother, as well as the family, loves the service as it gives her a great deal
of independence.
Director Bagley noted that Directors Daly, James, Tobiassen and he were part of the Board
in 2009 when route match was a topic of public participation at almost every Board
Meeting. This topic has not been an issue during public participation in recent years.
This, he said, is a symbol of a fine tuned service. He congratulated the staff on a job well
done.
Director Lubow asked staff to explain the barriers preventing all ADA services to be
classified as Access-a-Cab since that seems to be the option that costs the least. Bruce
Abel noted that not many cabs can accommodate wheelchairs. He also pointed out trip

Director Rivera-Malpiede complemented staff on serving the community. She asked if
there have been strategic conversations about operator’s shortage and if there are
additional skills required. Larry Buter answered that staff meets with carriers every week.
One of the carriers started advertising on the radio. Staff will be monitoring any results
from this marketing strategy. He also noted all operator training is done in-house and that
the only requirements are a valid CO license, clean MVR, a background check, and a
drug/alcohol check.
Director Rivera-Malpiede inquired about any conversations with other service providers
regarding referrals and/or assistance. Larry Buter replied that staff has had conversations
with the State regarding the Medicaid program. Their policy states that they will only pay
the lowest rate of the fixed route, in RTD’s case $2.25. The Access-a-Ride fare is $4.50.
Director Rivera-Malpiede asked about the Freedom Grants and its availability beyond
Longmont. Bruce Abel said that RTD uses Freedom Grants to support Travel Training,
which has been expanded District wide.
Director Walker asked if road construction qualifies as a conditional element for Access-aRide certification. Larry Buter answered that it is considered an environmental barrier.
Director Walker also asked regarding any relationship with Uber and Lyft drivers. Bruce
Abel said there is no relationship with that company. Director Walker noted that
Portland’s TriMet utilizes an app that highlights infrastructure improvements. He will
forward contact information to staff.
Director Tobiassen thanked staff for the update and their progress. He asked if the recent
re-enforcement of ADA policy on fixed routes has increased ADA customer’s ridership on
fixed routes. Bruce Abel said that it is hard to say if ADA ridership has increased. He also
said there are fewer complaints about the re-enforcement process. Carolyn Conover
mentioned that the routes with more complaints are utilizing buses in which a row of seats
have been removed to create room for stroller and carts.

distance: cabs are cost-effective on shorter distances while RTD’s van service is costeffective on longer distances. Bruce Abel mentioned that when contracting a service the
company must abide by RTD and Federal Transit Authority (FTA) guidelines, such as drug
and alcohol testing, background checks, and clean motor vehicle record (MVR). He said
most cab drivers would not pass the screenings. A subsidize service is a service the
customers use that RTD helps pay for. Director Lubow asked how purchasing wheelchair
accessible cabs would help. Bruce Abel said that scenario would be to RTD’s advantage.
He also noted that staff monitors taxi rates and trips distances. He pointed out many of
the Access-a-Ride customers prefer knowing an RTD van will pick them up.

6.A

Director Folska thanked staff for the update and for offering such robust services to the
community. She agreed with Bruce Abel about the lack of cab service to certain suburban
areas. She clarified that Larry Buter was referring to Transit Cooperative Research
Program (TCRP) 151, not TCRP 121 during his presentation. Director Folska mentioned
that Access-a-Ride customers are pleased to find out about the Access-a-Cab option. She
said that more outreach and education on the program would be terrific. She inquired
about the contract with Via Mobility for Travel Training and how it seems they only have 2
trainers, causing at times a 3 months waiting period. Bruce Abel said that Via Mobility
was contracted for a Travel Training pilot program in Boulder. This program has now been
expanded to the whole District. Larry Buter added that through the past 6 months Easter
Seals of Colorado, the contractor issuing Access-a-Ride certifications, has expanded their
outreach. Director Folska expressed her desire to see Travel Training be more effective as
new lines will be opening soon. She said that most disabled persons only need the
training once or twice. She then asked about Access-a-Cab reservation and modification
hours. Larry Buter said that reservations can be made 7 days a week from 6:00 a.m. to
9:00 p.m. Changes can be made at any time by calling dispatch. Chair Sisk asked to take
any further questions on this matter offline.
Director Hoy mentioned that commuter trains will have disabled areas with seats that will
need to be manually pulled down in order to be used by abled customers in case of
availability. He suggested this type of seats for buses as well. He asked for the overall
annual operating cost of the paratransit programs. Bruce Abel said it is between $35 and
$40 million dollars. The costs were broken down during the presentation to provide a
holistic view of the program. Director Hoy asked for clarification about Call-n-Ride
services as it seems that an assisted living home in his District favors this service over
Access-a-Ride. Bruce Abel said that is correct as for some regions Call-n-Ride seems to be
more cost-effective than Access-a-Ride.
Director Menten asked about adding to the amount of non-dedicated Access-a-Cab
vehicles during peak hours. Bruce Abel said that the new contract, which started on April
1st, calls for the contractor to make extra vehicles available during peak hours. Once peak
times are done, these vehicles return to regular cab services. Director Menten inquired
how long Access-a-Ride participants have been able to ride fixed routes for free. Bruce
Abel answered about 10 to 12 years. He said it is a strategy to encourage people to
become more independent. Director Menten asked about the kind of conversations had
with different entities that may provide their own disabled transportation services and how
this may affect hiring more RTD bus operators. Larry Buter said that RTD has been having

Packet Pg. 9

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 29, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Daly followed up on Director Lubow’s suggestion of increasing the number of
cabs and asked if cab service is infrequent in certain areas. Bruce Abel confirmed that
some areas of the District are underserved by taxi companies.

6.A

Director Deadwyler thanked staff for the update and the work on Access-a-Ride. She
wanted to confirm that contracting with Veolia/Yellow Cab would mean that there would
be more dedicated drivers during peak hours as many customers have experienced long
waits or no shows. Bruce Abel said that is the expectation. Larry Buter explained that
Viola/Yellow Cab is dedicated to Access-a-Ride through the First Transit Call Center.
Director Deadwyler thanked staff for implementing some of her suggestions.
Director Tobiassen asked if Access-a-Ride customers could get a discount on the $4.50
fare. Larry Buter said they could purchase a ten ride book for a 10% discount or use cash
for the full fare.
Director Folska noted the Call-n-Ride service in Highlands Ranch is used by people eligible
for Access-a-Ride since the former seems to be more cost-effective. She asked if these
customers would still be eligible for other ADA services. Bruce Abel said that they need to
be ADA eligible and certified in order to use the Call-n-Ride service.
Chair Sisk thanked staff for the in depth presentation and the Directors for the discussion.

IV.

Asset Management/State of Good Repair (Genova)
Dave Genova, Assistant General Manager for Safety, Security, and Facilities, introduced
Lou Cripps, System Administrator for Asset Management. Together they presented the
Asset Management/State of Good Repair Presentation starting on page 31 of the Study
Session Packet for July 29, 2014. The presentation covered a background on Asset
Management, implementation of works, and a summary of future work. Dave Genova
acknowledged the State of Good Repair team in attendance.
Director Folska asked if the Asset Management software was built in house or bought.
Lou Cripps said that the team has been acquiring data since 2007 through Maximus and
Oracle. Dave Genova added that the Enterprise Resource program was updated from
Legacy to Enterprise. Phil Washington led the process when he was the Assistant General
Manager for Administration. That transition proved to be a great foundation for the
current work.
Director Lubow congratulated staff on a well done program. She asked if the new Asset
Management federal requirement is a positive addition. Phil Washington said that RTD has
been working towards Asset Management and State of Good Repair before the federal
requirement possibility. The Federal Government is working on establishing the standards.

Packet Pg. 10

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 29, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

these conversations with different entities for the past 20 years. Bruce Abel said
Longmont is a good example of cooperation as RTD collaborates with other entities to
transport passengers.

6.A

Director Lubow asked when Asset Management/State of Good Repair cost-savings will be
reflected. Phil Washington said that it will take some time, but it will be seen, for
example, when deciding the specifications and/or ordering a new fleet of buses. These
practices are placing RTD ahead of the rest of the industry. Dave Genova added that
tracking devices have been added to light rail vehicles to assess maintenance needs.
These data will help extend a fleet life cycle. Phil Washington said that these practices are
being used by RTD’s capital programs by making upfront investments that will account for
savings in the long term.
Director Tobiassen asked about Asset Management for facilities, such as East Metro
Garage and Park-n-Rides, which have many physical components. Due to RTD’s, huge
inventory, he wondered how staff goes about condition assessment. He noted that in the
long term these steps should be able to forecast capital replacement. He also inquired
how the FTA assesses compliance. Dave Genova replied that the FTA is not assessing
compliance yet because they are still working on the requirements. Based on
conversations, RTD seems to be well positioned to comply with FTA requirements
whenever they are decided upon. He said that Director Tobiassen addressed one of the
purposes of Asset Management: giving the Directors the necessary details to determine
where to make investments. Lou Cripps noted that staff looks at system levels in order to
prioritize Asset Management. Some areas, such as IT, have a shorter life span. These
kinds of details are taken into consideration when considering assessments. Phil
Washington added that the Strategic Budget Plan addresses these types of prioritizations.
Staff also ties Asset Management to the customer experience.
Director James asked how Asset Management and State of Good Repair Program applies
to RTD’s real estate. Dave Genova said that currently the program focuses on assets
meaningful to revenue, such as rolling stock, infrastructure, facilities, and equipment. Phil
Washington added that staff hopes to soon be able to assess real estate’s Asset
Management and State of Good Repair. However, real estate assessment would require
extra resources and expertise. Director James asked staff to keep real estate on the radar.

Packet Pg. 11

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 29, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Through its leadership participation in APTA, RTD will help shape these requirements.
Dave Genova added that that RTD meets and/or exceeds the qualifications in discussion to
become requirements. The FTA estimates nationally a backlog of $80 million dollars in
State of Good Repair. Marla Lien, General Counsel, explained that funding will likely be
linked to State of Good Repair instead of new capital projects. Director Lubow noted it
would be a mixed blessing if an agency is interested in capital project. Marla Lien replied
that it is not a mixed blessing when interested in safety.

6.A

Director Menten asked for clarification on the cost based scoring on slide 18 found on
page 49 of the Study Session Packet for July 29, 2014. Lou Cripps said that the
performance score is based on all scores combined.

Chair Sisk thanked the Asset Management team. He acknowledged this type of
information may not be headline material but it is vital in saving money. He said that the
Directors are indebted to the team for making RTD viable, saving tax payers’ dollars, and
for working behind the scenes.

V.

Other Matters
Director Daly mentioned that he walked to the RTD Administrative Offices for today’s
meeting from Denver Union Station. The area was well lit and mostly construction free.
He asked why the pedestrian bridge is still closed. Marla Lien said the elevator did not
pass inspection. She said the bridge should be open by the end of August. Dave Genova
said some fences may be up every so often as Denver Transit Partners finishes
construction in and around the historic building
Director Bagley shared that he and Directors James, Menten, Rivera-Malpiede, and Solano
attended the Fare Study meeting. He said that it was very prudent for Board Members to
participate with suggestions and by listening. He commended staff on their work.
Director Walker commented on the APTA 2014 Transit Board Members & Board Support
Seminar he attended the previous week. He noted that Erin Klaas, Senior Board Office
Assistant, and Barbara McManus, Board Office Administrator also attended. He shared
some of the improvements in the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority. He also
said that he, along with Erin Klaas and Barbara McManus, distributed promotional material
to motivate attendees to register for the 2015 conference to be hosted by RTD. Paula
Perdue, Executive Director of the Board Office, said that one of the promotional materials
handed out was a copy of transportation-inspired lyrics to Rocky Mountain High written by
Director Walker. She said Director Walker performed the song during the conference.
Director Rivera-Malpiede volunteered as “deputy” to assist Director Walker in planning
next year’s conference. Director Walker thanked the Board Office Staff for their work
preparing the promotional material for the conference.
Director Folska asked if RTD has chosen a consultant for the Fare Study Task Force. Phil
Washington said that not yet and that the Board will be informed when it happens.
Director Deadwyler inquired regarding new signage at Denver Union Station to aid new
riders find their way. Chair Sisk replied that he knows staff is working on this item.

Director Lasater mentioned that he visited Denver Union Station over the weekend and the
water feature was not working, disappointing a young family. He asked as to when it

for the specific time that it was not working. He said that the feature is still in testing
period but at that time it should have been working.

B. Updates

• RTD Bus Passenger Shelters
Henry Stopplecamp, Senior Manager of Engineering, introduced Tom
Papadinoff, Team Lead/Landscape Architect-Urban Design, Michael
Washington, Title VI Manager, and Bill Bottini, Public Facilities Maintenance
Manager, who reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is
available in the August 5, 2014 Planning and Development Committee
Agenda Packet.
Michael Washington explained that per current RTD guidelines, a stop needs
40 boardings per day averaged over a month to qualify for a shelter to be
installed by RTD. He said that staff is in the process of developing
additional guidelines in conjunction with the boardings to help better
prioritize shelter installations as right now many of RTD’s stops meet the
requirement.
Tom Papadinoff noted that most of the RTD owned shelter locations are
along heavily trafficked bus routes. He shared that staff will begin a study
in 2015 to help identify shelter concepts that will better fit RTD’s needs; the
goal of the study is to come back to the Board with ideas in Spring, 2015.
Director Tobiassen commented that there are also many third party shelters
throughout the District. He wondered how it was determined where these
shelters are installed and who is responsible for their maintenance. Director
Tobiassen also inquired why some shelters have schedules posted while
others do not. Henry Stopplecamp shared that the third party shelters are
installed by advertising companies in conjunction with the municipalities.
These shelters are installed in highly visible areas, not based on the number
of RTD passengers that use the bus stop. He said that the advertising
company is responsible for the maintenance of their shelters. Scott Reed,

Chair Sisk was absent.

6.B

Assistant General Manager of Communications, explained that schedules are
only put in RTD shelters that are large enough to accommodate them as the
third party shelters are much smaller and completely covered by
advertisements.

Director Folska inquired if the RTD shelters are prefabricated and their cost.
Henry Stopplecamp said that RTD currently installs prefabricated Tolar
shelters. The cost per shelter is between $11 and $15 thousand. He
shared that all of the RTD shelters started out having glass. As the glass is
damaged RTD will replace it once; should it be damaged again RTD will
install metal mesh. Henry Stopplecamp said that staff would paint the mesh
several times if needed, but if damage continues eventually the walls are
removed, leaving just the roof.
Director Folska wondered how the shelters met ADA requirements. She
asked if the shelters were wheelchair accessible. She also wondered if the
schedules and public information provided available in in a manner for people
without sight. Henry Stopplecamp stated that there is a wide opening that
could accommodate wheelchairs. Scott Reed said that not all the
information was presented with braille. He explained that there are some
basic directions, including the telephone number for the Telephone
Information Center, at every RTD shelter.
Director Daly asked if RTD still has the Adopt-a-Stop program and if so, is it
working. Bill Bottini said the program is still active. He noted that the
effectiveness of the program really depends on the entity adopting the stop;
some fade in and out while others do very well.
Director Lubow inquired what other characteristics were being
evaluated/developed to prioritize where RTD shelters are installed. She
wondered if a criterion might include a stop that has a large number of
disabled patrons boarding. Michael Washington shared that right now staff
was just concluding an evaluation of the number of stops that meet the 40
or more boardings criteria. He said that staff is looking at a way to prioritize
stops with a large number of disabled riders but it is difficult to accurately
measure; staff is trying to look at other factors like the number of senior
centers within a certain distance of the stop.
Director Lasater asked if RTD has any policy for stops that have nothing but
the RTD Flag (sign that signifies there is a bus stop). He wonders if there is
Packet Pg. 16

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 5, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Tobiassen asked for further information on the Shelter Watch
program referenced in the presentation. He hopes this is something he can
help foster in his District to get more community involvement. Henry
Stopplecamp said that staff would provide Director Tobiassen with further
details.

6.B

Director Bagley wondered if there are other agencies using the metal screens
in their shelters. He asked if staff could provide information on how many
stops have a pull out for the bus versus it stopping in the traffic lane. Bill
Bottini informed the Board that he previously worked for the Colorado
Springs transit agency and they only install shelters with the screens.
Committee Chair James indicated that he would like to expand on Director
Bagley’s request for the number of pull out stops. He would like to see a
breakdown of all the types of stops, i.e. pull out, street, bulb outs, etc.
Henry Stopplecamp said staff would work to pull the information together.
Director Walker asked if the high boarding stops have any discernable
characteristics such as transfer points, limited routes, etc. Michael
Washington stated that transfer points are stops with very high boardings.
He said that stops along the limited routes are high as well as schools,
employment centers, etc.
Director Walker inquired if staff has noticed a higher level of rider pass up
calls at stops with shelters because the passenger is not seen or paying
attention. Michael Washington said that is not something staff has studied
but they will look into it.
Director Walker wondered how safety and security factored into shelter
installation. Henry Stopplecamp noted that bus shelters do get hit
periodically by cars, which is why shelters are installed away from the curb.
He said that staff is always working with the local police departments and
internal security to monitor the shelters; if something becomes a hot spot for
certain activities RTD has removed them from certain locations. Henry
Stopplecamp stated that the safety of our patrons is the most important
thing.
Director Deadwyler informed the Board that the shelters are not very
accessible for people using mobility devices because the bench is very close
to the entrance. She asked if this could be looked at for future designs.
Henry Stopplecamp commented that a lot of the upcoming shelter review
Packet Pg. 17

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 5, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

anything RTD can do to recycle old shelters. He shared that he has
experience restoring cars, many of which people believe are completely
unsalvageable. Director Lasater believes that there may be something RTD
can do to salvage at least a few shelters a year, even if it means combining
the best parts of two or three. Henry Stopplecamp stated that once a
shelter needs to be replaced it is in very bad shape; there have been no
shelters that could be relocated to date. Bill Bottini shared that staff does
try to salvage what they can from shelters that are hit by cars or removed
for some other reason than it needing to be replaced.

6.B

will be done in-house; he said he will make sure this is taken into
consideration.

Director Solano asked if any of the shelters have lighting. Bill Bottini said
that currently the shelters do not have any lights inside but light comes from
the surrounding street lights, parking lights, etc. Henry Stopplecamp said
that previously the technology was cost prohibitive but with solar
technology becoming available it is something RTD can look at; however, it
does become a maintenance issue.
Director Anderson pointed out that the advertising bus shelters were really a
city function. She asked if she was correct that RTD was not able to put
notifications in these shelters. She said if that was the case perhaps RTD
could work with the various cities to make sure we have a way to notify
people. Scott Reed stated that RTD can only put information in RTD
shelters because the advertising shelters are completely taken up by
advertisements.
Director Rivera-Malpiede wondered who is responsible for the trash removal
at all of our stops. Bill Bottini stated that for RTD owned shelters RTD is
responsible for trash removal. Dave Genova, Assistant General Manager of
Safety, Security and Facilities, said that for non-RTD owned shelters and our
other bus stops it is the property owner’s responsibility. He shared that his
team tries to contact the responsible party to make sure the trash is
removed.
Director Folska asked for the definition of minority. She stated that people
with disabilities are minorities as well. Michael Washington stated that
under Title VI it is required that RTD look specifically at race. Director
Folska reiterated that people with disabilities are actually minorities too. She
hopes there is a way that when Title VI is discussed the Board and staff can
try to include people with disabilities as well so everyone can be more
efficient with RTD’s resources. Michael Washington said that he agrees it is
something that needs to be considered.
Committee Chair James asked for an inventory of RTD owned shelters,
third-party shelters, and the number of stops with benches. Michael
Washington said that staff could provide an approximation but not definitive
numbers as RTD relies on the amenity owner to notify us of its installation.
Packet Pg. 18

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 5, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Hoy wonders why RTD guidelines have 40 as the minimum required
boardings per day since we are unable to install shelters at all the stops that
meet the requirement. Henry Stopplecamp explained that RTD could change
the number but right now staff wants it to remain at what RTD has always
used for more consistent evaluation.

6.B

• RTD Strategic Plan 2015-2020

Brian Welch pointed out that the staffing for the Strategic Plan includes five
staff members reporting to Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of
Planning, who make up the Strategic Plan Working Group. It will also
include a Strategic Plan Advisory Committee and the Senior Leadership
Team.
Brian Welch noted that RTD’s mission statements, goals, themes, etc. are
very common throughout other transit agencies; however, this will build on
the mission and vision by adding more specific strategies, initiatives and
performance measures that staff believes are unique to RTD. The Strategic
Plan will focus on 2015 to 2020 but will also look beyond 2020 since some
of the items considered in the Plan will not be achieved within the next 5
years.
Brian Welch stated that the Strategic Plan will be successful to the extent to
which the staff has adequately incorporated input and listened to all the
people who will be affected. Staff plans to get the word out through:
 Board of Directors Committee Meetings and Study Sessions
 Employee Brown Bag Lunches
 Employee Survey
 Public Survey
 Customer Access Panel
 Stakeholder Forum
Brian Welch reiterated that this is the first in a series of presentations to the
Board, each with increasing levels of detail on the document. He explained
that at this time staff does not have the document far enough along to ask
the Board for their input on the strategies or initiatives, but that will be
coming soon. He stated that the Board would be asked to adopt the
Strategic Plan in Spring, 2015.
Director Menten noted that staff does not have any specific details for the
plan; however, the timeline indicates an opportunity for Board feedback in
August, 2014. She wonders how the Board can provide feedback if there
are no specifics. Brian Welch explained that the purpose of this evening’s
presentation was to provide the Board with information about how staff
plans to approach the Strategic Plan and solicit public feedback/input.
Packet Pg. 19

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 5, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Brian Welch, Senior Manager of Planning, reviewed a Power Point
presentation with the Board that is available in the August 5, 2014 Planning
and Development Committee Agenda Packet. He said this is the first of four
updates hopefully leading up to Board adoption of the Strategic Plan in
Spring, 2015. He explained that the goal of the Strategic Plan is to
compliment the mission and vision that is already established at RTD.

6.B

Director Lubow believes it is really important and incredibly wise for any
organization to have strategic plans going out into the future; however, with
that being said her impression is that what staff is proposing is not typical of
strategic plans. Director Lubow stated that traditionally, it is the Board’s
role to set the goals. Director Lubow read several quotes from the American
Public Transportation Association Transit Board Member Handbook:
“Boards take the lead role in the strategic planning process, helping to create
the future by defining the organization’s vision, mission, core values…”
“Often, a board retreat is the preferred setting for this collaborative work;
this was the case for three-quarters of transit systems surveyed.”
“About two-thirds of transit agencies employed a consultant’s service to
conduct pre-retreat interviews; create, disseminate, and analyze
questionnaires; summarize the trend analyses and data; and facilitate
discussion…”
Director Lubow noted the Handbook also stated that quarterly staff reports
to the board and recommended that there should be a written agreement
about how and when to update the strategic plan. Director Lubow then
quoted from the website Simply Strategic Planning:
“Simply put, put as simply as possible, it is the board’s role in strategic
planning to set the organization’s goals.”
Director Lubow believes these quotes go along with the annual retreats that
the Board does with senior leadership where, at that time, the Board sets
the goals for the coming year. She said it is staff’s responsibility to
implement the goals; they have the experience, expertise, and time to put
out the details. Director Lubow stated that in a certain sense the starring
role in strategic planning is the Board and she does not see that in the
process staff is presenting. She suggested that, because staff is more
knowledgeable and experienced about transit issues, they put together a
variety of goals the Board can consider; then, a facilitator can review the
suggested goals with the Board, the Board can come up with our own ideas,
and then vote on them. Director Lubow expressed concern that the
approach for the strategic planning process does not give the Board the type
Packet Pg. 20

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 5, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten believes that this presentation indicated a priority on Transit
Oriented Development. She feels that from the Board and Senior Leadership
Advance this was not one of the priorities identified. Director Menten
shared that in the community she represents, people have a lot of concerns
about high density; if they wanted to live Downtown in high density areas
they would do that. She stated that is her feedback on the Plan at this time.

6.B

Brain Welch explained that staff’s intent is to start with the tactical goals
that the Board developed during the advance as well as the vision and
mission that are part of the RTD approach. He stated that it was not staff’s
intent to lessen the Board’s responsibility of policy direction. He believes
that when staff comes back with their next presentation, the Board will see
that staff is presenting the Board with the type of options Director Lubow
mentioned. Brian Welch noted that staff could develop an approach that
would have a more formal nature if that was the direction the Board wished
to take.
Director Lasater noted that there is not a deadline for development of the
Strategic Plan. He suggested that maybe the process for the Strategic Plan
should start at the annual advance, as this is really only a four month
difference. Director Lasater feels that a 5 to 20 year plan really needs more
adequate discussion at the Board level when the Board can really get to the
meat and potatoes of a discussion. Director Lasater also suggested that the
Strategic Plan needs to be worked on from the core out. The Plan needs to
start with an evaluation of why are we doing this, developing into the how
we do it, and ending with the results.
Director Anderson expressed that she thought this was a very well thought
out approach to the Strategic Plan. She feels it is completely based on the
issues that came out of the advance. Director Anderson believes this
approach plans well for Board input. She appreciates that it also talks about
listening to the community to determine if RTD is on the right track. She
reiterated that she does not feel it precludes any Board direction. She said
that she looks forward to working with staff and thinks they are on the right
track.
Director Folska shared that she is really troubled and deeply disturbed about
this recommendation. She thinks that staff is way overreaching with this
Plan. She reminded everyone that the RTD Board is elected by 2.9 million
people and is one of only three transit agencies with an elected board. She
believes that staff taking over the primary function of the Board for the next
5 to 20 years basically renders the Board irrelevant. She asked Director
Lubow to read an excerpt from the Regional Transportation District Act:
“32-9-109.5. Board of directors – membership – powers. (4) All powers,
duties, functions, rights, and privileges vested in the district shall be
exercised and performed by the board; except that the exercise of any
executive, administrative, or ministerial powers may be delegated by the
board to officers and employees of the district.”
Packet Pg. 21

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 5, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

of role a board would typically be given. She hopes this will be considered
as staff moves forward.

6.B

Director Tobiassen thanked staff for putting together what he believes is a
reasonable schedule that will allow the Board time to discuss the plan after
gathering ideas and speaking with the public and stakeholders. He requests
that when staff goes out to the stakeholders that they include all the
mayors, chambers of commerce, city transportation planners, etc. because
getting their ideas on how public transportation in their areas will be very
beneficial. He said that he appreciates staff’s effort and looks forward to
participating in the future.
Director Walker shares that when he read this document it was his
understanding that the Strategic Plan would take the Annual Program
Evaluation and Strategic Budget Plan and extend these out 20 years. He
noted that this is what the Board has already said we want to do. He
believes that staff is not usurping the Board’s power; they are just extending
what the Board has already identified as goals, priorities, etc. Director
Walker thinks this is a good stop to get an idea of what is out there on the
horizon.
Director Rivera-Malpiede expressed her support of the Plan as well. She
believes the employee brown bag lunches are so important as the employees
are our riders too. She feels that this is really a joint venture between the
Board and staff.
Director Solano stated that he feels RTD should be under the strict
instruction of what the State Legislature allows. He believes that the
current Board cannot plan 20 years out and assume the future Boards will
agree. He said this dilutes the power of the Board.
Committee Chair James said that he also believes this is a good idea. He
stated that anytime an organization thinks about the long-term future is it a
good idea. He feels there are adequate controls so the partnership the Board
has with staff can accomplish the mission in the best way it can. He
reiterated that there are adequate controls in place for the Board.
Director Folska expressed her support of long-term strategic planning;
however, she stressed that the Board does the what while staff does the
how. She stated that it is not a matter of controlling the process. In this
approach the Board is not even invited to the table nor are they on any
Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 5, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska stated that those powers were afforded to the Board by the
Colorado State Legislature. It is a privilege that the Board represent the
people within the District. She reminded everyone that the Board’s primary
role is the vision of the future of RTD and staff’s role is to come up with
how that gets implemented. Director Folska stated that while she
appreciates staff’s intention she completely rejects this Plan.

four times and that is supposed to be adequate input.

Committee Chair James shared that he recently had a conversation with Tom Clark,

Southeast Extension came up and Tom Clark informed Director James are watching
what the RTD Board does. He informed the Board that Tom Clark told him that
Charles Schwab would not have made such a significant move without the Board’s
approval of the extension. Director James believes this action is really creating
good community development.

their presentation during the FasTracks Update to the Transportation Legislation Review
Committee (TLRC). Also present were Directors Anderson, Bagley, Daly, Folska, Hoy,
James, Rivera-Malpiede, Solano, and Tobiassen. The Hon. Tracy Kraft-Tharp invited RTD
to attend the September 9th meeting to listen to the alternative transportation discussion.

No Recommended Actions were presented.

C. Updates

• State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna
Jenifer Brandenberry, from Brandeberry~McKenna thanked the Directors
who attended the TLRC. She said the legislators appreciated their presence.
The legislators see the RTD Directors as peers: elected officials working
together towards a common goal. She also commended Phil Washington
and Chair Sisk on their presentation. She said that the questions they
received were positive and constructive. She noted that RTD relations with
TLRC members have improved over the past few years thanks to the
Directors and staff.
She noted that election campaigns are under way. A third of legislators will
be new after the election. Brandeberry~McKenna has been meeting with
candidates and attending interim committees. During the July, 2014 TLRC
meeting there was a conversation on High-Performance Transportation
Enterprise (HTPE) and their role in financing transportation projects. Senate
Bill 228 stipulates that when the budget situation hits a certain threshold,
$200 million would automatically go to transportation funding. The
transportation community at large is working to have the funding occur as
directed by the current statutes.

Director Anderson said that the TLRC meeting earlier that day was great.
She pointed out how the RTD General Manager and staff are held in high
regard nationally. National and international delegations visit RTD to learn
how the agency does transit.
Committee Chair Folska also recognized Terry Howerter, Chief Financial
Officer, Doug MacLeod, Manager for Financial Reporting, and Sherry
Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, for attending the TLRC meeting.

Sherry Ellebracht said that Roger Sherman did not attend the meeting as
there were no updates at the local level. Mike Dino from Patton Boggs is
out of town. She will present the update, prepared by Jared Fleisher from
Patton Boggs, Washington D.C.
She said that Congress passed a last minute bill to keep the Highway Trust
Fund solvent until May, 2015, giving it a 10 month extension. Beneficiaries
of the Highway Trust Fund will probably find themselves in a similar
situation as the possibility of a long term bill during the lame duck session is
dependent on the election. The bill did extend the reauthorizations so RTD
is receiving the funds under MAP 21. Patton Boggs continues to advocate
on RTD’s behalf to restore the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) definition from the
prior transportation bill. The CO House Delegation penned a letter to
Secretary of Transportation Foxx asking again for another look at the BRT
definition.
She mentioned that the White House announced they will facilitate a Public
Private Partnership (P3) Initiative this September. Details are still being
determined. Patton Boggs and Senator Udall are working towards RTD
having a role during the summit.
Sherry Ellebracht attended Senator Bennett’s roundtable on infrastructure. It
was a short notice event held at one of Denver Union Station’s conference
rooms. Afterwards they boarded the W Rail Line to the Jefferson County
building. She said this is another example of RTD being front and center and
looked upon as a model. She emphasizes Patton Boggs and CO Legislative
Delegation’s work keeping RTD in the forefront.
Director Daly asked if he will still receive Saturday mail delivery, in reference
to one of the options to keeping the Highway Trust Fund solvent. Sherry
Ellebracht said that mail funds were not considered for the Highway Trust
Fund. She said that the Highway Trust Fund will remain solvent due to

B. Updates

• Northeast Area Transit Evaluation (NATE) II Update
Chris Quinn, Project Manager for Planning, presented the Northeast Area Transit
Evaluation (NATE) II Update starting on page 29 of the Planning &
Development/Government Relations/FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meetings Packet
for August 5, 2014. He said the purpose of NATE II was to expand/refine analysis of the
original NATE study as requested by local jurisdictions. Local jurisdictions requested to
have the transit path follow Highway 2 connecting with Colorado Blvd or Stapleton
instead of Downtown Denver. Included within the scope of the NATE II study is
updating environmental, transportation, land use and municipal plan information;
performing high-level fatal flaw analysis of Commuter Rail and Light Rail alternatives;
and developing Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) alternatives and evaluations. The study is being
conducted in-house by RTD staff and on-call consultant resources.
Director Anderson said that the NATE II study is very exciting, addressing it as a
possible “Northeast Extension”. Noting the cost-effectiveness of constructing on RTD
property, she asked if RTD owned any right-of-way in the NATE study area. She
mentioned she was under the impression that RTD may own some property in the area.
Richard Clark, Assistant Manager for Capital Programs, said that RTD doesn’t own the
right-of-way in that area. Any future projects would include negotiations with the rail
owners. Marla Lien, General Counsel, said that in 2006-07 RTD approached BNSF Rail
and Union Pacific in preparation for future public transportation options. Both
companies at the time decided not to enter into any agreements without definite ideas and
cost commitments for rail in the area.
Committee Chair Hoy reminded the Board and Staff to please be direct and concise when
giving their comments, questions, and/or answers. This, he said, is not meant to stifle
conversation.
Director Menten asked staff to send her a copy of the 2007 NATE study. She also asked
who the on-call consultant was. Bill Sirois, Manager for Transit Oriented Development
and Planning, answered that the consultant was through the Jacobs Engineering contract.
Director Menten asked if the original study would give other options for BRT besides
light rail and commuter rail. She also asked for the time frame of the Nate II study.

Committee Chair Hoy excused Director Bagley from the meeting.

Chris Quinn replied that beyond BRT, commuter and light rail there are no other options.
He also said no dates are set yet.

Director James asked staff to clarify about the Colorado Blvd Station, and perhaps further
south, as a potential location to end the Northeast line. Chris Quinn said that there is
interest to incorporate the line to route 40 allowing passengers a one seat bus ride to the
employment centers along that corridor.
Director Folska asked how much funding was allocated to the NATE II study. She also
asked for the study’s time frame. Chris Quinn said that there is $150,000 allocated for
the study since it is a very high level study. He estimated a little over 12 months as the
project’s timeline. Director Folska asked if staff had an update on the Northwest Area
Mobility Study (NAMS). Chris Quinn said that the study was sent to the stakeholders for
final reviews and comments. Staff hopes it will be available early next week. Committee
Chair Hoy asked Director Folska to take any further questions on the NAMS offline.
Committee Chair Hoy reminded the staff and the Board of the difficulties along the
Northwest corridor. He said that it is critical for RTD to work now with stakeholders as
they make plans for future developments through a possible corridor. He thanked staff
for their work.

• North Metro Rail Line Update
Ashland Vaughn, Project Manager for Engineer, presented the North Metro Rail Line
update starting on page 39 of the Planning & Development/Government
Relations/FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meetings Packet for August 5, 2014. The
presentation included an overview of the project elements as well as design and
construction updates. It also gave an update on the Suncor Energy Rocky Mountain
Pipeline Project.
Director Walker asked if the Suncor project would make any improvements that would
facilitate construction on RTD’s right of way. Ashland Vaughn said that the majority of
their construction is tunneling, usually at 30-50 feet underground, rendering them of
little use to RTD.
Committee Chair Hoy mentioned that he attended the Metro North Chamber Golf
Tournament on July 23rd. During the tournament, Suncor made a point to thank RTD for
our cooperation. He also mentioned that those in attendance were very excited about the
North Metro line. Their knowledge on the project was to various degrees. He expressed
his amazement at the Suncor pipes being so deep underground.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 5, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Daly asked staff if “fatal flaw” referred to projects staff would not recommend
moving forward with. Chris Quinn said that “fatal flaw” circumstances are considered
when a project encounters a barrier that it cannot work around, for example, a superfund
site. Director Daly stated that RTD used to own property in the NATE study area. He
wondered if it was sold. Richard Clark said that RTD is trying to dispose of a property
near Ft. Lupton.

C. Other Matters

Committee Chair Hoy asked if the press releases are sent to the Board members. Scott Reed said
that all press releases are included in the daily RTD clips internal email.
Dave Genova, Assistant General Manager for Safety, Security, and Facilities, reminded the
Directors of the Light Rail Rodeo on Saturday, August 9 at 6:00 a.m.

Director Menten said that she found out about the W Line closings this weekend through the RTD
email alerts and asked how the constituents are being informed, including those that do not get
alerts and may just show up to the closed stations. Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for
Communications, said that notices will be placed in strategic locations at the stations as well as
sent out through a press release. A bus bridge will be in place to transport commuters. Austin
Jenkins, Assistant General Manager for Rail Operations, said that staff chose this weekend as
there were not many events in the community, minimizing the impact of the closures. He also
reiterated that notices will be placed on the stations, bus bridges would be available, and probably
a representative from Public Information will be on site. He recalled that closures occurred when
the W Line first opened for 3 weeks. During this time, RTD received only 2 complaints.

C. Updates

• Second Quarter 2014 Investment Report
Doug MacLeod, Manager for Financial Reporting, introduced Brenden Morgan, Manager
for Debt and Investments. Brenden Morgan presented the Second Quarter 2014
Investment Report starting on page 4 of the Financial Administration & Audit/Civil
Rights/Operations & Customer Service Committee Meetings packet for August 12, 2014.
Brenden Morgan noted that all investment are meeting and/or exceeding benchmarks.
There were no questions or comments on this update.

• June 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod presented the June 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report starting on
page 9 of the Financial Administration & Audit/Civil Rights/Operations & Customer
Service Committee Meetings packet for August 12, 2014. He noted that RTD will be
losing the Vendor Allowance in July, 2014 as the State decided to implement a
moratorium back in October, 2009. The moratorium is included in RTD’s forecast and
budget.
Director Bagley noted the importance of having both the actual and budgeted figures on
the report. He also said that sales and use tax revenue, fare revenue, and ridership are all
down through the first half of 2014 when compared to the budget. He encouraged the
Directors to be conscious of these figures. He also considers it prudent for staff to
discuss this further.
Director Hoy said he was trying to understand the relationship between fare revenue and
sales and use tax revenue in both 2013 and 2014. He noted that fares are not contributing
as much to the revenue stream as they were in 2013. Doug MacLeod affirmed Director
Hoy’s observations. He said the sales and use tax revenue was made up on a higher
percentage of the revenue this year. Director Hoy said this information offered a
different perspective.

C. Updates

• Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) Program Update
Martell Dyles, Manager for the Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) program, and Kenn
Hardin, Senior Manager for Civil Rights, presented the WIN Program Update starting on
page 20 of the Financial Administration & Audit/Civil Rights/Operations & Customer
Service Committee Meetings packet for August 12, 2014. The purpose of the
presentation was to give an update on the WIN program since its inception in 2011, its
current standing as a national model, and plans for the future.
Martell Dyles said that there have been 391 participants through the WIN program since
2011. Nineteen (19) of those participants have been promoted to other positions. The
total number of participants served through the WIN program is 791. He explained that
“served” participants include those who receive training, career counseling, and other
services through the WIN program and find employment in other organization. Eighty
percent (80%) of the participants reside in the target zip codes. Martell Dyles mentioned
that 68 employers have partnered with the WIN program. The WIN program has created
13 customized training activities for employer partners.
Kenn Hardin emphasized that no participant falls through the program. Supportive
services such as career coaches, further skills training, and new position placements are
available to all participants. He said the WIN program emphasizes the mindset of
building a career in order for the participants to succeed.
Director Tobiassen said that the feedback on the WIN program is very positive. He asked
what the plans for the WIN program are for 2016 and beyond since RTD is halfway
through most of its construction projects. Martell Dyles replied that the program is
starting to train interested participants in the maintenance trade: facilities maintenance,
state of good repair, and light rail repair. The WIN program provides training and
certifications towards these new skillsets. A “pre-test” is provided by the WIN program
for the participants before testing for RTD, CDOT, or any other partnering entity.
Director Folska thanked staff for the presentation. She asked how many participants are
from other countries besides the United States. She also asked if these participants move
here for the program and if they go back to their home country after the training. Martell

Dyles responded that about 3% are not Americans. Most of these participants are from
Russia and Ethiopia. They have moved to the States and hear about the program from a
work force system. Participants stay after completing the training. Director Folska said
that the national recognition the WIN program receives reflects its strong, solid vision.
She suggested staff connected with the National Chamber of Commerce as a possibility
to train participants for other organizations and industries.

Director Walker shared that the WIN program was mentioned during a Succession
Planning presentation at the APTA Transit Board Members & Board Support Seminar in
July, 2014. He said he explained the program to the participants. He noted this
experience as an example of the program’s national recognition.
Director Solano mentioned he attended the Labor Council for Latin American
Advancement (LCLAA) National Convention in Houston, TX the previous week. The
conference focused on social issues and the future of our children. He thanked staff for
the WIN program as it is doing the greatest good for the greatest amount of people.
Director Lubow said she was most impressed with the program’s genuine concern for the
welfare of the participants. She asked for the timeframe of the grant project period
referred to during the presentation. Martell Dyles said the figures are through June 30,
2014.
Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede thanked staff for their vision and implementing the
model. She also thanked Director Deadwyler for her leadership and passion for the
community. Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede said she was most proud of the livable
wage for the participants. She recalled that when the program started, some of the then
new participants were working two minimum wage jobs in order to make ends meet.
She thanked the partnering organizations for their support. She acknowledged that it
takes a strong commitment to the community to remain in such close contact with the
participants.

Tobiassen and thanked staff for the answers.

C. Updates

• Fare Task Force
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, reviewed a Power
Point presentation with the Board that is available in the August 12, 2014
Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet. He noted that
this was just a brief status updated; a more substantive update will be
provided at the next Operations and Customer Service meeting. Bruce Abel
highlighted that staff had recently completed the consultant selection
process with consensus in awarding the contract to CH2M HILL. He noted
that the problem identification outreach meetings had begun with the
following:
 Fare Inspector Focus Group
 RTD Customer Panel
 Bus Operator Focus Group
 Local Government/TMA/TMO Meeting
 Community Based Organization Focus Groups
He shared that there are additional upcoming public meetings being held
throughout the District in Westminster, Lakewood, Commerce City, Aurora,
Denver and Longmont.
Director Folska said that she is very impressed and proud of how staff is
attacking this huge, huge endeavor. She thinks the outreach to the
community organizations has been incredible, constructive and positive.
Director Folska noted that one of the comments she has been hearing from
the community organizations is that they would like to see a means test
related to income and RTD fare. She wonders if there are other

Packet Pg. 40

Directors Anderson, Daly, and Lasater were absent.

6.G

organizations that already do this at different points of entry into the social
services system that might be able to assist RTD in this testing.

Director Solano feels this is a great study. He expressed interest in how
income might affect the outcomes of the study when comparing low income
areas to affluent areas. Director Solano commented that when he was in
Houston the previous week the light rail costs $1.25 for a three hour ticket.
He hopes RTD and CH2M HILL can look at how RTD’s fares compare to
other metro areas with a fine tooth comb. Bruce Abel stated that a peer
review will be part of the study.
Director Menten stated her surprise at getting such short notice on the dates
for the upcoming public meetings. She said she would have hoped for more
of an opportunity for her to conduct public outreach in her community. She
asked if there was any way to extend the August 29 th deadline for public
comments so she could reach out to her constituents. Bruce Abel stated
that staff and CH2M HILL will pay attention to all of the input that is
received, even past the August 29th deadline.
Director Menten inquired what other companies submitted a response to
RTD’s Request for Proposal (RFP). She shared that when she thinks of
CH2M HILL she thinks of design, construction and engineering, not customer
service analysis. Director Menten wonders if the other companies have the
same background as CH2M HILL. She also inquired as to the cost of the
contract. Bruce Abel said that the other respondents were IBI Group, LTK
Engineering and Transportation Management Design. He explained that
CH2M HILL has a very robust transportation unit, doing a great deal of fare
structure work throughout the industry. He stated that the cost is
approximately $140K, but he would need to get the exact figure.
Director Menten noted that the flyer for the fare study contained information
in Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean and Russian. She asked how these
languages were selected. She also wondered how often people request
language interpreters for RTD meetings. Michael Washington, Title VI
Manager, explained that if there are more than 1000 individuals that do not
speak English within the service area then information must be translated
into that language. He said that requests for meeting translation are rare.
Director Folska wondered if perhaps the reason Houston’s light rail was only
$1.25 was because they received a large amount of subsidy from the
Packet Pg. 41

Director Rivera-Malpiede informed the Board that she attended two of the
recent problem identification outreach meetings, which were excellent. She
said that she has received comments from several organizations thanking
RTD for doing this study. Director Rivera-Malpiede commended staff for
ensuring that the upcoming public meetings are in all parts of the District.

petroleum industry. Bruce Abel stated that he did not know the sources of
subsidy for Houston but that is something that would be looked at as part of
the agency comparison.
Committee Chair Lubow requested that the summary of comments be
broken down by group (i.e. fare inspectors, bus operators, public meetings,
etc.). She asked if the Board would be provided with a written report at the
end of the fare study. Bruce Abel stated that CH2M HILL would provide a
written document with recommendations at the end of the process.

David Genova, Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Facilities,
introduced Robin McIntosh, Senior Manager of Facilities, and Richard Rost,
Manager of Facilities Engineering, who reviewed a Power Point presentation
with the Board that is available in the August 12, 2014 Operations and
Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.
Richard Rost reminded the Board that there have been ongoing issues at
Civic Center Station so staff made the decision to completely start over,
rather than trying to fix what was already there. He said that design is 95%
complete, with final design completion anticipated by November, 2014.
Director Folska shared that she is very excited to see the progress in this
area. She appreciates the consistency of RTD branding with the canopy
being made of the same material as those at Denver Union Station (DUS).
Director Folska stated that she is concerned that the stakeholders who were
involved in the design process did not include people with disabilities or the
elderly. She suggested that staff contact Mayor Hancock’s office to work
with the Denver Commission for People with Disabilities and the Denver
Commission on Aging. Director Folska believes these two groups need to be
at the table during the design phase so RTD does not fall into some of the
same issues we have at DUS. She does not want accessibility to happen at
this location as an afterthought; accessibility needs to be built in at the
design phase.
Director James wondered what the total budget for the project is. He said
his impression is that most of the design work has been done. He asked if
the Request for Proposal (RFP) would just be a construction contract.
Richard Rost stated that the total budget, including design, is $21,139,326.
He said that Director James was correct that the RFP would just be for
construction.
Director James expressed concern that there were no neighborhood
organizations included as stakeholders in the design process. He knows that
the Golden Triangle Neighborhood Association is particularly concerned
about the pedestrian access of Civic Center. He believes this is an

Richard Rost explained that staff worked with the City of Denver (City) and
the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP) to develop a list of stakeholders
that were technically qualified for the urban design issues that accompany
this size of project, which did not include neighborhood groups. Bill Sirois,
Senior Manager of Transit Oriented Development, stated that RTD, along
with the City and DDP, just received a grant to complete a Master Plan for
Civic Center. This Master Plan will encompass the entire Civic Center area,
not just the bus station. He said that a primary focus of the Master Plan will
be looking at uses of the open parcel along Colfax.
Director James noted that the budget was very tight for this project; he
reminded staff that there is extensive experience working with very tight
budgets at Denver Union Station Project Authority should they need any
assistance.
Director Walker thanked staff for looking to make the Civic Center station
better instead of just putting it back together. He believes this will be a big
improvement over what is at the station now. He inquired if the bus facility
was one level or two. Richard Rost stated that the buses were all at one
elevation. He noted that there is an elevation difference between Broadway
and Lincoln which can make the station seem like two levels.
Director Tobiassen pointed out that safety and security are big issues at this
station. He hopes that this new design is being engineered with safety as a
priority. Dave Genova stated that the new design concept is more open,
fostering a better environment for security.
Chair Sisk thanked staff for a wonderful presentation. He thinks it is very
exciting to see such great things happening on the other end of the mall. He
said he hopes RTD can take the best ideas from the teams that submit
proposals and homogenize those into one construction project. Chair Sisk
noted that this station has an opportunity for naming rights that should be
considered before it is re-opened. Dave Genova explained that during the
industry review RTD will be asking teams to provide their technical
suggestions on schedule, savings, etc. that will be incorporated into the final
RFP.
Director Folska inquired if staff had considered a community garden for the
open space next to the bus station. Dave Genova stated that RTD’s
objective is to take care of our transit investment in the station. He said the
development of the Master Plan will really evaluate what opportunities exist
for that area.

opportunity to really engage the community to transform Civic Center.
Director James inquired about the long term plans for the open space next
to the bus station.

6.G

Director Lubow asked if the canopy would protect people from the weather
or was really just for aesthetics. She wonders if it would protect better if it
was made just a little wider. Richard Rost said it would give some
protection and provide a great deal of lighting for the station; however, the
size of the canopy was really a balancing act with the Civic Center building
as they wanted it to be as small as possible.

• Transit Watch Program
Dave Genova introduced Bob Grado, Transit Police Commander, who
reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the
August 12, 2014 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda
Packet.
Bob Grado shared with the Board that development of this App came from
his participation in RTD’s Multi Agency Exchange (MAX) program. RTD had
previously looked into developing an App but the cost far exceeded the
Department of Homeland Security grant RTD was awarded. He said that
when he was discussing wanting to develop an App with his counterpart in
Los Angeles, Los Angeles offered to allow RTD to use the app they had
already developed. Bob Grado stated that without this exchange of
technology RTD would not have been able to launch this App.
Director Folska wondered if RTD paid a licensing fee to Los Angeles Metro.
She suggested that perhaps RTD should begin getting patents for the
technology we develop to create additional revenue streams. Bob Grado
said that we do not pay LA Metro; they just have RTD permission to use
their App and work with the vendor for branding.
Director Tobiassen said that he is glad this program is taking off. He shared
that he was recently contacted by the Aurora Office of Emergency
Management looking for examples of texting in emergency situations being
successful. He thinks that they will also be very interested in this App.
Director Rivera-Malpiede asked if this App would be available in different
languages. Bob Grado stated that it was only available in English; staff
hopes it can be available in other languages in the future but there are no
plans for development at this time.
Director Bagley reminded the Board that the MAX program includes LA,
Atlanta, Dallas and Denver. It is a sharing of industry best practices. He
Packet Pg. 44

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 12, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley shared that he frequents this area at least two to three times
a month. He feels that the elevated garden and grass area really does not
work as it stands right now. He hopes the new design will be much more
friendly and open.

6.G

thinks it is so important not only for RTD to share how we do things, but
also to learn from the other agencies. Bob Grado informed the Board that
RTD saved over $250K in working with LA.
Director Solano asked if this App would also provide people with alerts, such
as an Amber Alert. He said that he also thinks developing the App in
different languages should be a priority. Bob Grado shared that RTD can
send out alerts but staff is still in the process of developing a policy on what
alerts will be sent and how.

Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, reviewed a
Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the August 12,
2014 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet. He
informed the Board that his four year anniversary was at the beginning of
August. This caused him to start thinking about what Rail Operations has
accomplished in such a short time and where they are going. He thought it
was important to share this with the Board.
General Manager Washington stated that Austin Jenkins has done a great
job. General Manager brought him on to the RTD team soon after he was
named the RTD General Manager. He said that one of the important things
Austin Jenkins is working towards is the reorganization of staffing. This is
in an effort to begin thinking about how RTD will transition people from
Capital Programs once those projects are complete, which is very important.
Director Bagley pointed out to the Board that he was wearing his shirt and
hat from last Saturday’s Rail Rodeo. It says ‘Big. Bold. Modern Transit.’
which is exactly what Austin Jenkins described in his presentation. Director
Bagley thought it was very instructive to be able to attend and speak with
the mechanics, drivers, etc. He said it was a really great experience.
Director Tobiassen stated that he too thought the Rail Rodeo was a great
event. He said that he is always impressed at how high the rookies place,
which is a great demonstration of the tremendous training program that RTD
has.
Director Tobiassen asked how many vehicles are in the queue to be
overhauled as well as the cost and time per vehicle. Austin Jenkins
explained that there will always be vehicles in the queue to be overhauled
because it is a process that will go on forever; by the time staff gets to the
end of the 100 series vehicles it will be time for the 200 series. He said
that a new light rail vehicle costs around $4 million while overhauling a
vehicle is in the range of $700K. Austin Jenkins stated that the goal it to
overhaul a vehicle in 4 weeks but there is a little lag due to staffing.

• Rail Operations Department

6.G

Director Folska said that she loves the idea that Rail Operations is working to
bridge the silos within RTD. She thinks this interdisciplinary approach of
bringing people from Capital Program to rail is fantastic.
Director Menten asked for examples of when a vehicle’s event recorder
might begin recording. Austin Jenkins said an example of this might be
when a train is traveling and there is a sudden brake application. He
explained that this event recorder will help the mechanics quickly identify
where the problem is. He offered to give Director Menten a demonstration.
Director Menten asked if it was correct that with the opening of the West
Line there were 800 first responders trained in addition to the RTD
employees. Austin Jenkins stated that was correct; first responders had to
learn how to get on the vehicles, move around them, etc. in case of an
emergency.
Director Rivera-Malpiede asked how many employees there are in the Rail
Operations Department. Austin Jenkins said there were just under 400.
Director Rivera-Malpiede shared that she absolutely loves to go to the annual
Rail Rodeo. She thinks it is so amazing to see all the families there to
support the participants. She congratulated Austin Jenkins on such a
fantastic event that people really want to come and participate in.
Director Deadwyler stated that she is not often impressed, but Austin
Jenkins and his team have totally impressed her with what they have
managed to accomplish in just four years. She thanked them for their
efforts and hard work.
Austin Jenkins pointed out that there are a lot of people around the country
doing the same job who wish they were him. He said he really has the best
organization to work for in the country.

Director Tobiassen shared with the Board that he used to do work for Union
Pacific (UP). At the UP facility there was a detector that could measure the
heat of the bearings and wheel circumference as the trains drove by. He
commented that this was great preventative maintenance and wonders if
RTD has looked into something similar. Austin Jenkins explained that the
expense of this technology makes it cost prohibitive to RTD; however, he
said that looking at the bearings and wheel circumference is part of RTD’s
regular periodic maintenance. Austin Jenkins noted that this preventative
maintenance and keeping the wheels so true to each other has led to one of
the best gear box records in North America.

6.G

D. Other Matters
Director Walker shared with the Board that he was asked to speak about the MAX
program at that APTA Transit Board Member & Board Support Seminar, where he
also spoke about the Workforce Initiative Now program. He said that RTD having
two call-outs in one conference really spoke to the recognition our programs have
nationally.

Director Bagley said that last week he attended several meetings: the Denver South
Economic Development Partnerships monthly meeting and the C-470 Corridor
Coalition meeting. He shared that Mayor Jim Gunning expressed to Director Bagley
that he has received numerous emails and phone calls of people who are so excited
that the Southeast Rail Extension was approved. Director Bagley said that despite
the positive feedback he was embarrassed by the questions he received in response
to an article that was in the Denver Post last Thursday.
Chair Sisk reminded everyone that there are no meetings scheduled for August 19 th
or 26th. The next meetings will be the committee meetings held on September 2 nd.

B. Updates
Committee Chair Folska asked the representatives from CRL Associates,
Brandeberry~McKenna, and Squire Patton Boggs to reflect on RTD’s position in the
near past and what are the challenges and items of interest as we move forward.
She also asked for examples on how to build coalitions and partnering with other
agencies.

• Local Government Update - CRL Associates
Roger Sherman from CRL Associates stated that the November elections will
decide much of what to look towards in the near future. He said the
upcoming elections include State Governor, State Congress, County
Commissioners, 3 municipal elections (Cherry Hills Village, Parker, and
Superior), and 5 contested RTD Board seats. The Denver City Council will
have 6 open seats for the May, 2015 elections. These results will bring
change and will impact how CRL works with the local partners on RTD’s
behalf.
He noted that Amendment 64 will not see a tax increase this year. After the
November elections the conversation to discuss transportation funding may
resume at a state or metro level. In both cases, RTD needs to be at the
table for the discussions.
Roger Sherman said that there is a renewed focus on rubber tire service. He
mentioned that the Denver City Council has made local transportation as top
priority. The Council is looking at transit options via partnering with RTD
and/or the private sector. He noted that Director James is involved in the
Denver discussions. Roger Sherman mentioned that he can see other
municipalities looking into intra-city transit services options.
RTD internal discussions, such as funding for unfunded portions of
FasTracks and the fare policy discussion will also have an effect on the near
future.

Roger Sherman addressed the RTD Board internal relations as another aspect
that affects the future work of RTD. He recalled his time serving on the
RTD Board in the early 90’s as a very difficult time. He encouraged the
Directors to head in the same direction with the same common goals
avoiding self-inflicting wounds. He said that solid RTD Board internal
relations will maintain the confidence of the stakeholders as RTD keeps
growing.

Director Lubow asked if there were any conversations about the sales tax
initiatives. Roger Sherman said that not until after the November elections,
but most likely until January, 2015.
Regarding RTD Board internal relations, Director Lubow asked if dissent is
considered a weakness. Roger Sherman answered that dissent is good. He
noted, however, that there’s a problem when the newspaper articles focus
on how the Board relates instead of the subject matter.
Director Bagley thanked Roger Sherman for his comments regarding Board
interaction. Director Bagley said the issue shows up when talking to his
constituents. He reiterated his embarrassment by the Denver Post article
from a few weeks back. Director Solano asked which article Director Bagley
referred to. Committee Chair Folska said that there are many articles in the
Denver Post and Director Solano may not have been present during the
meeting the article was discussed. Director Bagley suggested Director
Solano consult with the Board Office Staff.
Committee Chair Folska noted that the Denver City Council has made public
transit one of their top priorities. The Honorable Mary Beth Susman,
Councilwoman for Denver’s District 5, lived for a week using alternative
modes of transit and documented her experience. Committee Chair Folska
asked Roger Sherman if he was familiar with this story. Roger Sherman
answered that he was aware of her experience. He also noted how her
findings were misrepresented in the media. He said he believed her point
was that traffic congestion is the reality and will only grow, making
alternative forms of transit a necessity.
Director Lubow asked what the interaction between RTD and the Denver
City Council would look like now that the Council has transit as a prime
interest. Roger Sherman said that the Council recognizes RTD does a great
job with the resources available. They are also looking into connecting
Cherry Creek to downtown, all the employment hubs on Colorado Blvd,
larger residential neighborhoods, etc.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 2, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Folska thanked Roger Sherman for his comments and his
candor.

6.H

Director James thanked Roger Sherman for his comments. Director James
noted that the dialogue he has held with the editors of the Denver Business
Journal and the Denver Post has been interesting. The main topic has been
alternative forms of transit, not what RTD provides as transportation. He
explained that the Denver City Council has an emphasis on the last mile in
an effort to compliment what RTD offers. He thanked Roger Sherman for
helping the RTD Board focus on our mission instead of conflicts among
board members.

Jenifer Brandeberry from Brandeberry~McKenna noted that during election
season their main task is proactive education to candidates and other
parties. She thanked the Directors who attended the Transportation
Legislation Committee Review (TLRC) on August 5, 2014. The Honorable
Nancy Todd, TLRC Chair, requested a tour of the East Line and DIA.
Jenifer Brandeberry said the dialogue on how to use the $200 million from
Senate Bill 228 continues. She also mentioned Brandeberry~McKenna’s
work with Colorado Department of Transportation, the Metro Mayors
Caucus, and the Chamber of Commerce, among others. She said that after
the November elections they will move forward with other projects.
Committee Chair Folska asked if the agenda for the next TLRC meeting is
available. Jenifer Brandeberry replied that the agenda for the next meeting,
scheduled for September 9, 2014 was not available. She will forward the
agenda to the Directors as soon as it is. She said she didn’t anticipate RTD
having a major role on the agenda.

• Federal Update - Patton Boggs
Michael Dino from Squire Patton Boggs told the Directors that Congress
resumes next week. The expectation is that Congress will continue to pass
the resolutions for all the appropriations that have not been passed that are
due by September 30.
He said that there are 3 Federal funding opportunities of interest:
 The TIGER Grant recipients will be announced this month. RTD
submitted in April for the Northwest Area Mobility Study II and the
Central Rail Extension. The prediction is that somebody in Colorado
will receive a TIGER grant. It is hard to say who would receive it.
 Under the Ladders of Opportunity Grant Program RTD submitted the
Colfax Transit Signal Priority in early August.
 The Board submitted the Full Funding Grant Agreement for the SE
Extension. It is the largest sum asked from the Federal Government.
This one, he said, has the best chance of being funded. He noted that

Packet Pg. 51

• State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna

6.H

the Department of Transportation (DOT) keeps track of the money
they distribute and has a track record of granting funds to RTD.

Michael Dino said that Squire Patton Boggs is working with the Colorado
House Delegation to send letters to the appropriate House Committees
regarding Bus Rapid Transit Definition and Federal Transit Authority’s use of
opening day metrics to evaluate project funding. Letters have already been
sent to the appropriate Senate Committees. Funding has not been
established and will depend on the results of the November elections.
He said that the White House unveiled a Public Private Partnership (P3)
initiative. An Infrastructure Summit will be held on September 9th. Phil
Washington, RTD’s General Manager was invited to the event.
Looking ahead at the Federal level, Mike Dino said there are tensions
between the President and Congress, specifically the House of
Representatives. These tensions, mostly in the areas of immigration, climate
change, and military, may have an effect on other areas, including
transportation. There are 5 Senate seats for election in November: Colorado,
Alaska, North Carolina, Louisiana, and Iowa. If the Democrats win 4 of the
5, Vice President Biden becomes the deciding vote.
Michael Dino stated that the future hinges on the November elections. He
also noted that further changes will come with the 2016 elections. He said
that RTD seems to be aligned with DOT’s purview.

C. Other Matters
No other matters were presented.

B. Updates

• Eagle P3 Project Update
Brian Middleton, Consultant for FasTracks Project Management, recognized
Aaron Epstein as the new Denver Transit Partners (DTP) project director for
the Eagle Project. He said that Greg Amparano, the former project director,
will still be involved in the project as Fluor’s representative on the DTP Board
of Directors.
Brian Middleton presented the Eagle P3 Project Update included in the
FasTracks Monitoring Committee packet for September 2, 2014. The
updates presented included design and system status, commuter rail
vehicles, commuter rail maintenance facility, East Rail Line, Gold
Line/Northwest Rail, bridges and coordination with adjacent projects.
Brian Middleton noted that an Eagle P3 team review identified a problem on
the Jersey Cutoff bridge, just south of I-70 on the Northwest/Gold Line track
alignment. He said that DTP found deficiencies with the bridge design. DTP
determined that it is in the best interest of the project to demolish and
rebuild the bridge. RTD staff agreed with the decision. He stated that at no
time there was any danger to the public. He also said that neither RTD nor
the region’s taxpayers will incur any cost for this work as DTP is taking full
responsibility for both the cost and the work.
Committee Chair Hoy reminded the Directors to keep the questions and
comments on topic. He also asked them to wait until all Directors have had
a chance to speak before asking to speak for a second time.
Director Anderson said she was very interested in the lessons learned from
the Jersey Cutoff bridge. She noted that she understood that incidents

happen but that this one seemed to be of a greater magnitude. Director
Anderson wondered if the fault in the construction had anything to do with
construction through the wetlands. Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager
for Capital Programs, replied that his team will work with DTP on what
happened and how to move forward. Brian Middleton added that the
wetlands had no impact on the deficiencies.

Director Rivera-Malpiede asked if the rebuilding of the Jersey Cutoff bridge
would have any impact on the 2016 openings. Brian Middleton answered
the demolition and rebuilding will not have any impact on revenue service.
Committee Chair Hoy added that DTP is as motivated as RTD to complete
the project.
Director Bagley noted that there have been problems with bridges in the
past. He said that RTD has a thirty (30) plus years design, finance, build,
operate, and maintain agreement with DTP. He asked what the design life
of the projects’ bridges is. Brian Middleton answered that it is in excess of
sixty (60) years. Rick Clarke added that the length of time is specified in the
contract.
Director Menten asked for clarification on the structure of the Jersey Cutoff
bridge. Brian Middleton replied that the bridge is only for RTD commuter rail
use. Rick Clarke added that the bridge goes over BNSF tracks called Jersey
Cutoff.
Director Menten asked for more details on other problems encountered
during bridge constructions as she was not familiar with other cases. Brian
Middleton answered that about eighteen (18) months ago the Sand Creek
Bridge on the East Rail Line and another bridge, which he did not recall the
name, needed to be restored. DTP took full responsibility for the redesign,
reconstruction, and replacement.
Committee Chair Hoy pointed out that the check and balances process of
the Private Public Partnership (P3) works.
Chair Sisk asked for details on how RTD was made aware about the
deficiencies of the Jersey Cutoff bridge. He also asked for the estimated
replacement cost. Brian Middleton replied that RTD was made aware while
going through the P3 process. As areas of concern were identified they
were brought up to DTP. Upon DTP review, they agreed to demolish and

Director Anderson said that she appreciated the staff’s work with the City of
Arvada. She noted that the parking garage has gone through several
reiterations. She stated that the parking garage is an important component
for the City of Arvada’s Transit Oriented Development.

6.I

Director Lubow asked if these types of design problems are common or if
this should be interpreted as a red flag. Brian Middleton said that the design
process is intricate. Checks and balances are in place to ensure the quality
of the process. He noted that this is not the worst situation he has seen on
a project. He gave credit to DTP for accepting full responsibility and fixing
the problem. Rick Clarke added that the findings triggered an independent
review of all the bridges in the project. No other problems have been
identified.
Director Daly said he appreciated DTP’s honesty and responsibility. He
asked if there was a problem with the subcontractor. Brian Middleton
answered that he was not sure but he did not think so.
Director James said that the Jersey Cutoff bridge incident is both a problem
and an opportunity. From RTD’s perspective the problem is minimal as the
agency benefits from the P3 structure. The opportunity is showing the
public that a P3 is effective. He suggested the staff looked into how to
make the most of P3s in future projects. Rick Clarke added that his team
will assess the lessons learned from the project, both positive and negative.
Director Rivera-Malpiede noted that the Jersey Cutoff bridge was in District
C which she represents. She asked if there was a plan of action for public
outreach. Brian Middleton replied that DTP is working to develop public
outreach.
Director Folska noted that one of the reasons RTD has a P3 is the hard work
of the staff. She asked for a description of the bridge and what makes it
unique since there are so many bridges in the nation. She pointed out a
bridge in Washington, D.C. that is 5 miles long. Brian Middleton said that
the bridge design is unique for the project, not the nation. The original
design for the 500 feet bridge had a supported deck. The new design will

Committee Chair Hoy reiterated that this P3 is working properly. RTD chose
their partners carefully. DTP stepped up and owned the responsibility. He
said that he could not ask more from contractors.

said that the cost to RTD is zero (0) dollars. Rick Clarke added that under a

done this well under any other design delivery method.

B. Recommended Actions

• Contract Amendment; 2nd year 2014 option 2013-2015 Street
Improvements & Shelter Installations Contract # 33DM005
It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all
documents necessary to award a contract amendment to initiate the second
year of a three-year option contract for the annual Street Improvements &
Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $371,711.30.
Funding for this contract amendment is provided by the annual 2014 – 2015
Engineering Expense Budgets.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the September 16,
2014 Board meeting.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Henry Stopplecamp, Sr. Manager for Engineering introduced C.
Scott Woodruff, Project Manager for Street Improvements.
Henry Stopplecamp said that the motion requests a secondyear option for the three-year option contract started in
September, 2013. He noted that the cost is built into the
budget.
Committee Chair James asked for the specific period for the
second-year option. Henry Stopplecamp said it was from
September, 2014 to September, 2015.

C. Updates
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, presented the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) Update included in the Planning &
Development Committee Meeting packet for September 2, 2014. The
presentation included the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG)
TIP background, process, and criteria. The RTD projects to be submitted to
the TIP are the 15L Transit Station Improvements, the Regional Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) Feasibility Study, the 16th Street Mall Reconstruction, the SH
119 BRT Environmental Clearance Study, the Free MetroRide Service
Expansion, and the Speer/Leetsdale Corridor 83L/79L Study.
Director Anderson said that she was pleased with the projects chosen for
the TIP application. She recalled her days on the DRCOG Board. During
that time, an entity could submit up to sixteen (16) projects. Limiting the
amount to six (6) projects has reduced the competition. She asked staff if
they have strategized on how to move projects through the DRCOG process.
She mentioned the possibility of joint applications with municipalities or
counties. Bill Van Meter said that staff has strategized and at times solicits
support from other jurisdictions. This year DRCOG changed their
measurements of projects. He said that with fewer projects submitted, RTD
is not sure how the agency’s projects would score against other projects.
This augments the need to advance the best projects.
Director Bagley asked how many blocks compose the 16th Street Mall. He
also asked for how many blocks are currently under reconstruction, how
many are funded for reconstructions, and how many are left to reconstruct.
Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, answered that
the project is still in the design phase with a start date of first quarter,
2015. He said that there is $10 million to fund the reconstruction of the
16th Street Mall. This amount would fund two (2) to two and a half blocks.
He told the Directors he would double check the total amount of blocks on
the 16 Street Mall. Director Bagley said this would be helpful information
for the Directors to know.

• Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) Update

6.J

Director Bagley asked if the FreeMetro Ride request would expand the
service during the midday. Bill Van Meter said that the TIP request would
increase the frequency and hours of operation during the a.m. and p.m. peak
hours. Director Bagley asked for the dollar amount of expanding the
FreeMetro Ride service to the Golden Triangle. Bill Van Meter answered that
he can provide the amount from the study efforts that led to the current
operations.

Director Lubow asked if the SH119 BRT Environmental Clearance Study
would also be an Environmental Impact Study (EIS). Bill Van Meter said the
anticipation is for an Environmental Assessment Process.
Director Daly asked if there is any priority among the 6 projects submitted.
Bill Van Meter replied that there is no implied priority on the projects. Each
project corresponds to different scoring criteria. It is up to DRCOG’s scoring
process to determine which projects, if any, rate high enough to warrant
funding.
Director Folska told staff that she thought the project list was spot on. She
expanded on Director Bagley’s point on the FreeMetro Ride. Director Folska
asked how expanding the service timeframe as well as the route to the
Golden Triangle would build bridges with the community. Bill Van Meter
answered that RTD held public meetings when the route for the FreeMetro
Ride was originally created. Expansion of the route would merit a similar
process with stakeholders. The expansion, he said, would pragmatically
mean costs in operations, purchase of vehicles, and building stops. Bill Van
Meter noted that for this type of capital expenditure RTD would want to look
at partners to assist in funding. Director Folska asked how long DRCOG
would support the project if funded. Bill Van Meter replied that the support
would be for a 3 year period. After that, the funding would be RTD’s
responsibility.
Chair Sisk noted that 40% of the TIP funding is allocated to bicycle and
pedestrian projects. He said that RTD does not qualify for that allocation
unless the 16th Street Mall is considered a pedestrian project. Chair Sisk
said that he was interested in the “last mile”. He pointed out that RTD may
want to partner with cities and other entities in providing that service. Bill
Van Meter replied that the minimum request is $100,000. He also said that
DRCOG has set a limit on awards under $500,000. Bill Van Meter added
that most bicycle/last mile projects are in this smaller range. Staff
recognizes the need Chair Sisk pointed out and is working on a

bicycle/transit plan. This plan, however, does not fit the DRCOG TIP
qualifications. Chair Sisk thanked Bill Van Meter for the explanation.
Director Solano pointed out that the TIP submissions are a great idea,
particularly the Regional BRT Feasibility Study. This project affects the
Northeast quadrant which he represents.

D. Other Matters
Director Solano thanked Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of
Communications, for helping coordinate the Adams County Citizens Tour of Denver
Union Station. Scott Reed said that Julia Marvin and Lisa Trujillo worked in the
coordination of the event.
Chair Sisk asked Scott Reed to expand on an email sent to the Directors regarding a
Bus Operator with First Transit. Scott Reed said that on Monday, September 1,
2014, a Frist Transit Bus Operator was arrested for operating a bus under the
influence of alcohol. The operator had a previous DUI offense. The offense was
over fifteen (15) years ago, beyond the scope of RTD’s background checks. Scott
Reed said that he was pleased with First Transit’s reaction and communication with
the media.
Committee Chair James asked Bill Sirois, Senior Manager for Transit Oriented
Development, to explain the plans for studying and responding to the unsolicited
proposal for the purchase of the Bus Barn Site. Bill Sirois said General Manager Phil
Washington received an unsolicited proposal from D4, the developer working on the
Alameda Station. Staff is studying the proposal and will bring a recommendation to
the Board during the October committee meeting.

the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to transfer $676,745 from the event recorder capital project (10360) to the
Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance campaign expense line item.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the September 16, 2014 Board
meeting.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager for Rail Operations,

C. Updates

• Board Report January 2015 Service Changes

Jessie Carter introduced Jeff Becker, Senior Manager of Service
Development. Jessie Carter then presented the January 2015 Service
changes Board Report included in the Operations and Customer Service
Committee Meeting Packet for September 9, 2014. He stated that the
proposed changes totaled a $600,000 increase. The goal of the proposed
changes is to improve services while meeting Board adopted service
standards. The proposed changes include service improvements and
extensions as well as some service curtailment and cancellations. He
mentioned that there are five public meetings scheduled. The three offcampus meetings will be in the town of Parker, Highlands Ranch, and
Federal Heights. These are the areas affected by the proposed cancellation
of Call-n-Ride services.
Director Folska asked for further details on the service reductions for route
40. She asked if these changes included peak hours. Jessie Carter said
that trips are proposed for every 30 minutes instead of the current 20
minutes throughout the day, including peak hours. This reduced the route to
two trips an hour instead of three. He stated that the ridership on route 40
has decreased south of Colorado Boulevard. Jessie Carter mentioned that
there was some service duplication with route 46. Director Folska
commented that she has not received complaints on route 40. She also said
that route 40 offers a one bus trip for certain areas that are not served by
route 46.
Director Daly asked Jessie Carter to explain the meaning of the term
“hostler” as used on the W rail line service proposal. Jessie Carter explained
that a “hostler” is an employee who prepares the train at the end of the line
for the next trip. This allows for a longer break for the light rail operators.
Director Solano thanked staff for responding to his constituents’ request of
adding a bus stop on Holly between 60th and 63rd. He said he has received
positive feedback.
Director Anderson noted that the Belmar route was proposed to be
discontinued. She said that the Parker Call-n-Ride has been on life support
for a while. She asked if the town of Parker contributes towards the Call-nPacket Pg. 65

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 9, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Dave Genova, Assistant General Manager for Safety, Security and Facilities,
introduced Mike Gill, Deputy Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations,
and Jessie Carter, Manager for Service Planning & Scheduling. Dave
Genova emphasized that these changes are presented to the Board for
informational purposes. The final proposed changes will be brought to the
Board for approval at a later date.

6.K

Director Anderson pointed out that the Federal Heights is also marked for
discontinuation. She asked if staff has done marketing to increase ridership
on these routes. Brian Matthews said that there has been extensive
marketing done for these routes. The Parker Call-n-Ride averages 1.5
boardings per hour. He noted that even with the recent growth, the Federal
Heights Call-n-Ride has not met the minimum of 3 boardings per hour.
Director Hoy asked for an explanation of the last two lines of the Special
Services Report that reference the 5311 services. He said that these were
not included in the May or June reports. Brian Matthews explained that
these are services provided by non-profits in Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson
Counties. RTD provides a match for operations. He added that these nonprofits pull their numbers together to report to the Colorado Department of
Transportation (CDOT). The process to get specific metrics is slow.
Directory Hoy said he had further questions that he would take offline.
Director Hoy echoed Director Anderson’s concern regarding the Federal
Heights Call-n-Ride. He said he could not justify cancelling a service that is
increasing while other services are declining. Director Hoy asked staff to
explain when the service change process ends. Jessie Carter said that
proposals are always modified after community, staff, and Director input.
The process ends when brought to the Directors for final approval.
Director Bagley emphasized that the 3 areas with proposed Call-n-Rides
cancellations (Parker, Highlands Ranch, and Federal Height) will each host a
public hearing. He recalled that the Federal Heights Call-n-Ride started as
the result of a grant in 2012. The community is aware that the service
would be cancelled if it did not meet the requirements. He noted he has
been in conversations with Brian Matthews regarding the Highlands Ranch
Call-n-Ride. Director Bagley said that these three Call-n-Rides are in
residential areas where most people own a car. He noted that the most
successful Call-n-Rides are in office development areas. Director Bagley also
stated that all Call-n-Rides are different, attract different levels of citizen
participation, and need different kinds of marketing. These factors require
that each Call-n-Ride be looked at separately without generalizing the report
numbers. He asked staff for feedback on his comments to ensure accuracy.
Brian Matthews affirmed the uniqueness of each Call-n-Ride while
mentioning that there is a service standard. Jessie Carter said that the
Federal Heights Call-n-Ride does not operate out of RTD’s budget. In the
next year, if not cancelled, it would become a cost increase for RTD.

Ride services. Brian Matthews, Manager of Special Services, clarified that
the Belmar Flexroute is the one proposed for discontinuation. The Belmar
route will continue as it exists today. He said that the town of Parker does
not contribute towards the Call-n-Ride. Douglas County provided some
support.

Chair Sisk said he was advocating for the Federal Heights Call-n-Ride
service. He noted that the ridership was growing. He pointed out that the
area is economically challenged thus in need of the service. Chair Sisk
suggested that RTD work with municipalities, in this case, Adams County,
to explore cost-sharing options. He said that he understands the service is
not costing RTD anything; however, if discontinued there may be a cost in
how RTD is perceived in the community. He encouraged staff to extend this
service since it has only been available for less than 3 years. Brian
Matthews commented that RTD extended an invitation to all the Call-n-Ride
communities for a 50% cost-share option. Federal Heights replied with two
offers: one until May, 2015 and another until December, 2015.
Director Deadwyler said she was happy about the service extension for
routes 15 and 15L. She asked if this meant extra buses or service times.
She said that the route stops at Chambers Road at 7:00 p.m., forcing some
of her constituents to walk four miles home. Jessie Carter said that routes
15 and 15L are in a league of their own, with over 24,000 combined
boardings a day. The proposal is to add weekday morning and middle of the
day trips to the 15L. He also said that staff has asked the consultants on
the East Corridor to include the 15L services in their process. This includes
studying the possibility of extending the hours of operation past Chambers
Road.
Committee Chair Lubow asked why the Denver Union Station (DUS) routes
have no specific gate assignments. A constituent complained that this
makes it difficult to utilize the services. Jessie Carter said that DUS has 22
gates. Some bus routes have more frequency than others. Staff allowed
this flexibility in order to learn from the growth. After a few months of
operations, staff is ready to make some decisions on gate assignments.
Committee Chair Lubow asked how the public will be notified of these
changes. Jessie Carter said the timetable would be published. He
mentioned that the Rider Alerts could be used as well.

• US 36 Bus Rapid Transit Branding Update
Nadine Lee, Project Manager for US36 and Northwest Line, explained that
the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) will be a new class of service for RTD. It will
provide the quality of rail service with the flexibility of bus service. It is
expected that 20,000 passengers will board the service daily. She said that
branding will give the BRT its unique identity distinguishing it from other
RTD services. The report included in the Operations and Customer Service
Committee Meeting Packet for September 9, 2014 outlines the stakeholders’
engagement timeline.

Marketing. Stephen Reilly introduced Kate Wilson, Marketing Account

Director Menten asked if the design would interfere with advertising space.
Stephen Reilly answered that the branding is on the top half of the bus to
allow for advertising. Any advertising would cover the “swoosh” area of the
design, which is not essential to the branding. The back of the bus allows
for the essential functions of the vehicle and branding.
Director Menten asked if safety was considered in the design of the bus.
She also asked if the buses will have reflective stripping on the back.
Stephen Reilly said that safety is always a concern. He noted that his team
is working with the body shop to achieve safety measures on this vehicle.
Chair Sisk expressed his gratitude for working together with the
stakeholders and other participants through this process. He said that staff
has embodied so many aspects to make this BRT a service for US 36.
Director Hoy called the marketing staff exceptional. He mentioned that the
marketing team had to navigate through mine fields of staff and politicians.
He noted that staff was able to create a great design while working with
groups that may not move in the same direction. He applauded everyone on
the team for their work.
Director Folska asked when the first bus would be delivered. Nadine Lee
said the first bus would arrive in October, 2015.
Director James asked how branding a service and/or corridor fits into the
greater scheme of RTD. Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of
Communications, said that this corridor is the first true BRT and a part of
FasTracks. This makes it a unique service. He noted that RTD has naming
rights and branding rights in process through IMG Consulting. Any branding
opportunity will be brought to the Board for approval. Beyond these, RTD
has no current plans for branding other services. Director James noted that
it sounds like RTD may be exploring branding options. Scott Reed agreed.
Committee Chair Lubow asked if any new arterial BRT lines would also be
branded. Scott Reed said that this BRT is unique given the origin and
destination of the line. Arterial BRTs will be slightly different as they will be
in traffic and crossover with other routes.

Executive, and Cheryl Holmes, Manager for Creative Services. Stephen
Reilly unveiled the design for the Flatiron Flyer. He said the design is the
result of a year and a half collaboration with stakeholders, Senior Leadership
Team, Maintenance, and Operations. The design is modern and eyecatching, highlighting the topography of the corridor. He noted that it is
cost-effective, easily installed, and easily maintained.

Committee Chair Lubow asked if the branded buses would be exclusive for
the US 36 Corridor. Scott Reed said that there will be a flexibility agreement
depending on the system-wide needs.

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, told the
Directors that they have a copy of RTD’s Annual Report. The report, a
collaboration between Public Relations, Marketing, and all other
departments, will be sent out via email to all stakeholders and constituents.
He introduced Pauletta Tonilas, Senior Manager for Public Relations and
Public Information. Together they presented the RTD Public
Relations/Marketing Update included in the Operations and Customer Service
Committee Meeting Packet for September 9, 2014. The presentation
included an update on the Transit Watch Smart Phone App, Light Rail 20th
Anniversary celebration, FasTrack Vote 10th Anniversary, first commuter rail
car display, the I am FasTracks/I am RTD campaign and the I Heart My RTD
campaign.
Georgann Van Gemert, Account Executive for Marketing, expanded on the I
Heart My RTD Student Art Contest. This pilot program is designed to create
favorable RTD experiences for Middle School students through art. There
are 18 teachers enrolled and 2,400 students submitting entries from the
Cherry Creek and the Aurora Public School Districts. The deadline will be in
several of weeks. The voting process will be online. The winning design
will be featured on the side of a bus. Stephen Reilly noted that Dallas has a
similar program with an average of 120 submissions, highlighting the impact
of RTD’s pilot program. This program emphasizes the collaboration efforts
between municipalities, school systems and RTD. Director Folska is the
sponsoring Director for this program.
Pauletta Tonilas noted the FasTracks brochure is available. The brochure is
currently being translated into Spanish. She re-introduced Tina Jaquez,
former Public Information Manager for I-225 and currently working as
Manager for Public Relations. She also introduced Deborah Mendez-Wilson
as the new Senior Community Relations Specialist. She will target
grassroots outreach, Title VI Community Groups, marginalized low income
communities, ADA, and serve as the Spanish speaking spokesperson for
RTD.
Tony McCaulay, Senior Manager for Marketing, noted that each year the
first place winners of the AdWheel Awards are notified in advance of the
APTA Annual Meeting. RTD won 8 First Place Awards, the most ever won
by the agency, including both subcategories of the Special Events category.
The Special Events recognized are Market St. Station Closing and DUS
Opening. He said that RTD has a good chance of winning the Grand Prize in
this category. Grand Prizes are awarded during the APTA Annual Meeting.

He noted that usually judges are members from other transit agencies. This
year the judges were marketing professionals from the Washington, D.C.
area. He recognized the marketing team, including Joan Garcia, Graphic and
Web Designer.

Director Menten asked what the budgets are for the I am FasTracks/I am
RTD campaign, and the I Heart My RTD Student Contest. Pauletta Tonilas
answered that the combined budget for the I am FasTracks/I am RTD
campaign is $45,000. She said the fall rollout will include marketing on
buses, newspaper, community papers, billboards, and earned media.
Pauletta Tonilas mentioned that 5280 Magazine will publish an earned media
advertisement in the next issue. Stephen Reilly added that RTD is using as
much available space on RTD property for all campaigns. He said that he
doesn’t have the specific number of the I Heart My RTD Student Contest
budget. Stephen Reilly acknowledged that the budget is very limited. He
noted that all work has been done in house, from design to execution. He
invited Director Menten to talk to Director Folska and Paula Perdue,
Executive Director of the Board Office, for specific details.
Chair Sisk said the team has to be praised for their work with constituents
and stakeholders. He commended Director Folska on her initiative with the
student contest. He thanked Paula Perdue for taking a real interest in this
project. Chair Sisk said that by reaching 2,400 students RTD is also
reaching their parents, families, and school communities. He noted that
money spent on the student contest is money well spent. He looks forward
to this initiative growing and eventually being funded in conjunction with
school districts.
Director Deadwyler thanked Director Folska and Paula Perdue for their
involvement in the student contest for the past 2 years. Director Deadwyler
acknowledged Director Folska and Paula Perdue’s hard work obtaining
outside funding for the student contest. She said that it swells her heart
how marketing has taken the student contest to heart creating such a
beautiful design. She said this initiative is exciting for the kids and teachers.
Director Deadwyler noted that she can see this pilot program growing. She
again thanked Director Folska and Paula Perdue for not letting the concept
die when they did not get full support from the Board right away.
Director Tobiassen said that RTD’s marketing staff is a great team. He
expressed his disappointment with Tina Jacquez leaving the I-225 project.
He hopes another ace will join the I-225 team. He believes the student

contest is a great opportunity. He suggested that staff linked the student
contest with RTD’s Facebook page, which has grown exponentially over the
past year. He said that if linked, parents, siblings, friends, and others could
be connected to RTD through social media.
Director Solano said that he is happy the contest is happening at schools.
He expressed his hope to see cultural diversity outreach in future contests.

Judy McMurphy, Program Manager for Information Technology, presented
the Smart Card Update included in the Operations and Customer Service
Committee Meeting Packet for September 9, 2014. The update covered the
College/EcoPass Program, the Smart Action List and File Compression,
establishing business processes in support of the MyRide Program, Smart
Media Technologies (SMT) engagement with Fare Study Committee, SMT
involvement in the 2016 Rail Line openings, and Phase 1 of the Web Portal
Enhancements.
Judy McMurphy noted the capacity constraints of some of the validators.
She said that Xerox has made great strides in this area. Testing remediation
steps begin in four weeks. Staff will still be able to manually manage the
product behind the scenes.
Director Hoy asked if the BRT system would have validators on the platform
or in the buses. Judy McMurphy answered that she believes the validators
will be in the buses.
Director Hoy asked how a customer would add value to a card. Judy
McMurphy said that customers could go to an RTD sales outlet and load a
specific value. She said they could also use the web portal. Eventually
there will be Retail Point of Sales (RPOS) at King Soopers and Safeway. She
said the team is looking into other possible venues to place RPOS. Director
Hoy said that these questions have been brought up during his participation
at recent commuter events. He noted that commuters would have to plan
ahead with the Smart Card.
Director Folska added that thinking ahead is part of using public transit. She
asked if there would be multiple RPOS at different locations in case of
malfunction. Director Folska noted that people tend to abandon a service if
there are inconveniences. Judy McMurphy said that her team has not
thought about multiple devices at grocery stores and other location. She
noted this was a good point and that she would take it back to her team.
Director Folska asked about card security and the possibility of stealing pin
numbers as well as other personal credit information. She also asked about
the size of the RPOS. Judy McMurphy said that the financial transaction
Packet Pg. 71

occurs through the grocer, not the RPOS. The RPOS tells the card what
kind of contract/pass to load. She said the RPOS is about 12”x8”x6” with a
3”x4” touch screen. These machines are a bigger than credit card machines
because they include a printer for receipts.

Chair Sisk addressed Director Hoy’s question regarding BRT validators. He
said that his understanding was that the validators would be on the
platform. Chair Sisk asked Judy McMurphy to check with US36 on this
item. Judy McMurphy noted that she has not been informed to order
platform validators. Scott Reed said that Judy McMurphy has not received
an order because a final decision has not been made. Staff is still working
with stakeholders on this aspect.
Director Anderson recalled her recent experience with Smart Cards in
Montreal. She said that it was very easy to tap the card inside the bus. The
process added no significant wait time.
Committee Chair Lubow called for a five minute recess at 7:01 p.m.
The meeting resumed at 7:08 p.m.

• RTD Fare Study Update
Lacy Bell, Manager for Planning Projects, covered the Fare Study
Presentation included in the Operations and Customer Service Committee
Meeting Packet for September 9, 2014. The presentation included the
results from the focus groups and feedback from public engagement. The
themes that surfaced from the feedback were:
 Affordability
 Light rail zone confusion
 Transfer and fare media technology concerns
 Pass/discount programs confusion and availability
 Public education
 Bus and rail system integration
 Increasing ridership.
The next step is to work with CH2M Hill, consultants, to develop alternative
fare structures for evaluation. The team will begin planning for the next
round of public engagement to present alternatives and preliminary findings.

Director Tobiassen said he hopes the Smart Card process has integrated
Cyber Security Manager Sheri Le’s feedback. Judy McMurphy affirmed
Sheri Le’s involvement in the process. She also noted Senior Internal
Auditor Kevin Parker’s involvement. Judy McMurphy said Kevin Parker asks
difficult questions throughout the process.

6.K

Director Tobiassen said that he found the Aurora Fare Study public meeting
very interesting. He noted that he was at the Nine Mile Station as an RTD
ambassador on Sunday for the Broncos game and that the new ticket
vending machines are pretty intuitive. He asked if the Fare Study
Committee will incorporate the cost of parking availability into consideration.
Lacy Bell said that parking is incorporated into the technical analysis.

Director Hoy said that the Fare Study meeting he attended only had 10
people in attendance. He noted that a couple of groups had advocates
attending all the meetings sharing their message. He encouraged staff to
take those comments into consideration as a single instance instead of
multiples.
Director Hoy suggested clustering small businesses into utilizing EcoPasses
or other group fare media in order to increase affordability.
Director Rivera-Malpiede thanked Lacy Bell and her team for such
tremendous outreach to the community. She noted that meetings were held
in different areas, times, and days to allow for maximum participation.
Director Rivera-Malpiede said she attended three of the outreach meetings:
Transportation Management Associations/Organizations (TMA/TMOs), nonprofit sector, and public meeting. She pointed out that the conversation at
all of them was free-flowing. The main points in her opinion were the
working poor, confusing fare zones, and transfers. She noted that parking
was not brought up as an issue.
Director Solano said he attended the meeting held at Adams County High
School. This meeting had three government officials and one citizen in
attendance. He said that in his District the main issue is affordable fares.
He was glad to see it come up as a common theme.
Director Walker noted that the Fare Study Committee has a lot of work
ahead. He asked if the committee received any suggestions during this
round of public engagement, such as peak fares. Lacy Bell said that they
received a lot of comments asking RTD to do fares like another transit
system in the nation. She said this was due to a great experience this
particular person may have had in using a particular system. She noted that
informing participants of the Peer Agency Review phase was well received.
Lacy Bell added that some people brought up peak hour fares. She said that
given RTD’s history with peak hour fares she did not expect them to become
a recommendation. Director Walker pointed out that fare zones are a part of

most transit system. He is interested in what the Fare Study committee
develops.

Committee Chair Lubow agreed that the Fare Study review is a complex and
exciting process to go through. She asked regarding a letter from Boulder
County suggesting the creation of a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to
study and comment on the data throughout the process. Lacey Bell said
that a TAG would not be created but that the Committee will update those
particular government bodies throughout the Fare Study process. Committee
Chair Lubow emphasized that these governments wanted to study the data
and provide their comments. Lacey Bell said that the data will be presented
and at that time they will have an opportunity to make comments.

• 2nd Quarter 2014 Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
Dave Genova, Assistant General Manager for Safety, Security and Facilities,
said that the next 5 items are 2nd Quarter Reports. He asked that staff be
prepared to step forward when their update was called upon.
John Tarbert, Transit Police Chief, pointed the Directors to the 2nd Quarter
2014 Security Statistics and Fare Inspection Summary included in the
Operations and Customer Service Committee Meeting Packet for September
9, 2014. The update included fare enforcement statistics, light rail station
and on-board enforcement sweeps, plain clothes police officer fare
inspection, and security officer use of force incidents.
Director Hoy told Chief John Tarbert that he convinced him that the system
works. Director Hoy mentioned that his friend got asked for fare twice on
the W Line, one of them resulting on his wife getting a ticket. He said that
the real problem lies on the platform machines.
Director Tobiassen reiterated his earlier comments about the ease of use of
the platform machines. He added that he has received positive feedback
from operators and riders regarding the security efforts. He thanked Chief
John Tarbert and his team for their good work.
Director Deadwyler appreciated the positive feedback. She noted that the
feedback from her District is not as positive. She mentioned that many of
her constituent have issues with EcoPasses cards not being recorded when
Packet Pg. 74

Director James said he understands the apprehension of starting a Fare
Study as there are so many issues beyond fares. He noted this is also a
great opportunity to exercise customer service interface. He asked for more
information on how TMA/TMOs were involved in the process. Lacy Bell
replied that TMA/TMOs representatives were invited to RTD’s monthly
government representatives meeting. The conversation with this group was
delivered in a focus group setting.

tapped. These constituent will then encounter issues when asked for fares
including having to leave the train. She said she has received calls from the
Secretary of State’s office regarding the matter. Chief John Tarbert asked
Director Deadwyler to have those constituents contact him directly to
address the problem. Dave Genova said that some people are not using the
EcoPass appropriately by tapping at the validator. He noted that in some
cases the validator does not work. He pointed out that riders with an
EcoPass or similar type of fare on their possession are not asked to leave the
train because the fare is valid, just not properly used. Dave Genova said
that a full enforcement will be done when machines are at 100%
functionality. Director Deadwyler said that she hoped staff had an apology
for those that encountered issues.
Director Folska asked about the cost of college student fares as included in
their semester fees. Scott Reed said that the amount varies by campus.
Director Folska said that most of the college fares, when broken down, are
about $2 a day.
Director Menten wondered if RTD will ever get to the point where validators
are at 100% functionality. She noted that some of her constituents are
concerned that their cards will be taken away due to recurrent violations
caused by faulty validators. Dave Genova said that all validators will work
as the system matures. Chief John Tarbert reiterated that Smart Cards
violations are not enforced.

• Access-a-Ride 2nd Quarter 2014 Report
Mike Gill, Deputy Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, Larry
Buter, Manager of Paratransit Services, and Carolyn Conover, Senior
Manager for Contracted Services, pointed the Directors to the Access-a-Ride
2nd Quarter 2014 Report included in the Operations and Customer Service
Committee Meeting Packet for September 9, 2014. The report included
information on ridership, revenue hours, on-time performance, and customer
complaints.
Director James noticed a significant increase in Access-a-Cab ridership. He
asked staff to explain the data. Larry Buter said that ridership will continue
to rise as new companies join the service. Staff recently handed agreements
to a few new companies. Their lawyers are looking at the agreements.
Director Folska commended the staff on an outstanding job with so many
unique customers. She appreciates staff’s quick response to mistakes
made. She asked Larry Buter to share the experience with Fresenius Medical
Care (FMC) near the Broadway and I-25 Station. Larry Buter explained that
FMC asked to move a bus stop closer to their facility entrance. The move
was done right away. FMC also asked for a paved way from the lightrail
station to their facility. This request will take longer to fulfill. Larry Buter

Director Deadwyler said that on time service continues to be a problem. She
noted the need for more Access-a-Cabs that can transport mobility devices.
Larry Buter explained that all cab operators are independent contractors who
often purchase their own vehicles. Vehicles that can transport mobility
devices cost more, deterring drivers to acquire them. He mentioned that
there has been an increase of this type of vehicle in the fleet. Larry Buter
said that this was a slow process that is moving in the right direction.
Director Folska noted that an incentive could be provided to some cab
operators by providing funding through the Department of Vocational
Rehabilitation. Larry Buter said that this was an interesting idea. He would
continue the conversation with Director Folska offline.

• Special Services Report 2nd Quarter 2014
Mike Gill, Deputy Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, Brian
Matthews, Manager for Special Services, and Carolyn Conover, Senior
Manager for Contracted Services, pointed the Directors to the Special
Services Report 2nd Quarter 2014 Update included in the Operations and
Customer Service Committee Meeting Packet for September 9, 2014. The
update included information on preventable accidents, customer contact,
boardings, and Call-n-Ride comments.
There was no discussion on this item.

• Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 2nd Quarter 2014
Mike Gill, Deputy Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, Greg

Manager for Contracted Services, pointed the Directors to the Contracted
Fixed-Route 2nd Quarter 2014 Report included in the Operations and
Customer Service Committee Meeting Packet for September 9, 2014. The
report included information on preventable vehicle accidents per 100,000
miles, passenger accident ratio per 100,000 miles, on-time preventive
maintenance inspections, on-time performance, miles between lost service
road calls, and operator complaints per boarding.

B. Updates

• Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Update (Leeds School of Business/Howerter)
Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, introduced Robert McNown and
Brian Lewandowski from the University of Colorado Leeds School of
Business (CU Leeds). He said that they would provide the Board with an
update and then answer any questions.
Robert McNown thanked the Board for the opportunity to present this
evening. He also recognized Richard Wobbekind and Miles Light as
members of the team who were unable to attend the meeting. Robert
McNown also recognized and thanked the RTD staff for their prompt data
and reviews of CU Leeds reports. He reviewed a Power Point presentation
with the Board that is available in the September 9, 2014 Financial
Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.
Robert McNown stressed that there is a lot of uncertainty involved in
forecasting. He shared that the short-term and medium-term forecasts are
affected by employment, personal income, and retail sales and taxable sales;
the long-term forecasts focus on changes in population and age distribution
which affect savings, labor supply, productivity, output, and household
expenditures. He noted that the Denver and Boulder metro areas have
recovered much more quickly than the national U.S. economy when looking
at employment and personal income growth.

Robert McNown stated that the projected rate of revenue growth for the
short and medium-term forecasts is very strong. The economy is projected
to be fully recovered by 2018 so growth rates will begin to be more modest
at that time. He said that the long-term forecast has rates of growth that
are remarkably stable. Robert McNown stressed that the integrity of the
forecasts are very important. These are insured through:
 Forecasts being updated quarterly to reflect the most current
economic situation
 Forecasts being generated from theoretically sound economic
relations, modeled with state-of-the-art methods of modern
econometric time series analysis
 CU Leeds forecasts not incorporating “add factors” or other
subjective adjustments of model forecasts
 CU Leeds being independent from RTD with no political or financial
stake in the forecast numbers
Director Bagley thanked Robert McNown for his report. He said that he
really appreciates the distinction made that CU Leeds has no political or
financial stake in the forecasts, which is very important for RTD. Director
Bagley said that these forecasts are really a balancing act with the economic
predictions so he understands the difficulty CU Leeds has with continually
making changes.
Director Bagley stated that RTD is in a great position right now but the
Board needs to understand that things will normalize in the future. He
reiterated that one of the greatest economic development tools for the
Denver Metro region is FasTracks. He believes that this will be a factor in
future forecasts but it is hard to know to what extent. Director Bagley also
noted the fact that the Metro area is number one in attracting millennials and
fourth in creating jobs. He said this emphasizes that RTD is in a good
position as long as we continue to manage assets appropriately.
Director Folska wondered if CU Leeds could consider adding a new variable
for vehicle miles traveled into the forecasting. She commented that the
Packet Pg. 80

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 9, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Robert McNown explained that while there is always uncertainty in CU
Leeds forecasts, they make frequent revisions to reflect new information as
it becomes available. He said that although the uncertainty does mean that
the CU Leeds forecasts will have errors, there are not persistent biases in
the forecasts that are predominately positive or negative. Robert McNown
shared that overall the CU Leeds team is happy with the magnitudes of the
forecast errors. He pointed out that several complications in the Sales and
Use Tax forecasts have come from lower forecasts of key economic drivers
at the national level while at the same time having stronger forecasts for
Colorado, the change in the tax base since RTD now has tax parity with the
State, and marijuana retail sales tax.

6.L

Director Solano said that when he took statistics he realized it was a shot in
the dark. He believes that someone can make any variable appear the way
that person wants it to. Robert McNown said he respects Director Solano’s
views; however, he believes that by showing how there is uncertainty
involved, CU Leeds is trying to give an honest portrayal of the inherent
errors in forecasting.
Chair Sisk thanked Robert McNown and the CU Leeds team for their
forecasts. He noted that RTD was criticized years ago for not having an
independent forecast. He appreciates the work that goes into these
forecasts and does not take it lightly. Chair Sisk inquired why Robert
McNown did not review the forecasts that factored in HB12721. Terry
Howerter explained that the projections for HB1272 were done by the State
of Colorado Legislative Council; however, there is no way to find the Use
Tax for manufacturing equipment in the Denver area. He said that because
of this RTD staff asked CU Leeds to remove that from the forecasting so we
had a more accurate picture.
Committee Chair Walker noted the chart showing that the National
household debt has declined for home mortgages. He wonders if the trend
might be different if Colorado were isolated. He also wonders if CU Leeds
can determine how much of the Sales and Use Tax growth in Colorado is
due to the oil and gas industry. Brian Lewandowski explained that they
were unable to isolate either of those items.
Committee Chair Walker asked if CU Leeds thought immigration reform
might affect the outlook of employment and personal income for Colorado.
Robert McNown said that was very hard to predict because of the ever
changing political climate.

The Power Point presentation shown at the meeting included estimates attributable to HB1272. A
copy of this Power Point is available in the Board office.

Oregon State Legislature is conducting a pilot Road Usage Charge Program.
She asked that CU Leeds look at forecasting a similar type program for the
Denver Metro region so the Board could understand how that might impact
RTD’s revenues. Director Folska thinks that the states are often a testing
ground for what the Nation as a whole will tolerate and this type of program
could be a fix to the Highway Trust Fund issue. Robert McNown said that
his team would be happy to look into that.

C. Recommended Actions

• Contract Extension for First Southwest Financial Advisors

Motion:

Director Anderson make the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the September 16,
2014 Board meeting.
Chair Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter asked Susan Cohen, Manager of FasTracks
Program Controls, to review this item with the Board. Susan
Cohen stated that First Southwest (FSC) has done some very
good work for RTD. FSC did a great deal of financial modeling
in support of reports to DRCOG, FTA and TIFIA, and they
played a crucial role in the I-225 and North Metro unsolicited
proposals. She explained that FSC plays an even more crucial
role than RTD envisioned as the Security Exchange
Commission (SEC) imposed new rules requiring municipalities
to retain a Municipal Advisor to have any conversations with
investment banks; all FSC professionals that work with RTD
are registered Municipal Advisors with the SEC. She said this
allows RTD to legally continue to work with a variety of
investment banks to find creative and innovative methods to
efficiently finance projects.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 9, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
authorize the second option year of the contract with First Southwest (FSC)
for Financial Advisory Services, which will extend the performance period
through December 31, 2015 and increase the total contract amount from
$480,000 to $600,000. Funding for the 2015 option is included in the
FasTracks financial plan, and will be included in the 2015 expense budget
for FasTracks.

D. Updates

• Second Quarter 2014 Internal Audit Report

Director Menten noted the Cell Phone Stipends report indicated that there
were employees receiving a stipend who did not have their phone number
listed in the internal phone directory. She asked how many employees out
of the 367 receiving a stipend did not have their number listed. Director
Menten expressed concern that the average stipend was about $90 per
month. She thought that seemed high. Kevin Parker, Senior Internal
Auditor, explained that he only did a test sample; however, he found a high
enough percentage that he felt the recommendation for inclusion in the
internal phone directory to be part of the policy was warranted. Kevin
Parker said that because the stipend is included in an employee’s taxable
income it gets increased by a fair amount, as is common with many
organizations.

• 2015 Requested Budget (High Level Update)
Jannette Scarpino, Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, reviewed a
high level Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the
September 9, 2014 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda
Packet.
Director James inquired about the percentage of expense for our electrically
powered equipment versus fuel. He also asked if electricity is something
RTD can negotiate the same way we do for diesel. Jannette Scarpino said
that traction power was budgeted at $7.2 million and gas and diesel was
budgeted at $38 million for 2015. Terry Howerter stated that RTD has the
best rate available for electricity but that Director James was correct that it
is not negotiable in the same way fuel is.

• Fiscal Sustainability Committee Recommendations Update
Jannette Scarpino stated that since the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force
recommendations were made in 2011, the following have been completed:
 Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
 Service Optimization
 Fund Balance Policy
 Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
 Technology and Energy Innovation

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, stated that the
audits were available in the September 9, 2014 Financial Administration and
Audit Committee Agenda Packet. He asked if there were any questions.

Director Bagley stated that he is very pleased that RTD has taken these
Fiscal Sustainability Task Force recommendations seriously. He believes the
work of the Task Force was really critical and greatly benefits RTD. He
pointed out to the Directors that were not on the Board that the Task Force
was comprised of many experts external to RTD. Director Bagley said he
also appreciates that we are able to work with former Director Barbara Brohl
at the Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR).
Director Menten asked when staff might have the results of some of the
audits being conducted. Terry Howerter stated that it is a very lengthy
process. Doug MacLeod, Manager of Financial Reporting, explained that our
contractor, Revenue Recovery Group (RRG), must first identify vendors to
submit to the DOR. The vendors are approved by RTD to send to the DOR
who then ultimately approve the audits. He said that we initially submitted
113 vendors that were whittled down to 37 by the DOR. After the DOR
approves the vendors for audit, RRG will request various records from the
vendors which can take quite a bit of time. Doug MacLeod said that RRG
will continue to identify vendors so we have a steady stream of audits. He
stated that he anticipates having some results over the next several months.

• Second Quarter 2014 Performance Measures
There were no questions on the Second Quarter Performance Measures.

• July 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod noted that ridership and fare revenue are falling slightly short
of the budgeted increase of about 3%; however, he said that Sales and Use
tax is up and overall our financial position is good.
Director Bagley expressed a concern that the fare revenue will be down
significantly related to the budget by the end of the year. He said that this
is very important to factor in as RTD conducts its Fare Study/Task Force.
He reminded the other Directors that in 2011 there was a recommendation
to cut $10 to $11 million in service. He stated that he does not want RTD
to be in a similar position again.

CCABA Membership - Bill James
Chair Sisk indicated that the Executive Committee would be considering a request from
Director James for membership to the Cherry Creek Area Business Alliance (CCABA). He
asked Paula Perdue to provide some background on the organizational membership
process.
Paula explained that in August, 2011, the Board had approved a policy on organizational
memberships. Director James was the sponsor for this effort. The policy is broken down
by individual membership and agency membership. Under the individual membership

Packet Pg. 87

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 11, 2014 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

option contract for the annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with
Manion Construction, Inc. for $371,711.30. Funding for this contract amendment is
provided by the annual 2014 – 2015 Engineering Expense Budgets.

6.M

Director James shared that CCABA is a relatively new organization in Cherry Creek
focused on businesses in the area. The organization has expressed interest in enhanced
mobility as they are concerned about the impact of congestion and access in the area. He
thinks they are a compliment to the Cherry Creek Chamber of Commerce that focuses
more on business networking and events whereas the CCABA is more focused on
business development. He sees this organization as akin to some of the other
organizations the agency support such as SELR and ACED and thinks this organization
should be a candidate for agency membership.
Director Hoy suggested that we focus initially on this organization under the purview of
the Executive Committee for the first year. The determination of whether it should be
agency membership can be determined at that time.
Additional discussion occurred around the nature of CCABA, if there are any divisiveness
between CCABA and the Cherry Creek Chambers and if any of the services that they are
providing is redundant in that area. The committee agreed that CCABA is a good
candidate for membership under the individual membership policy.
IV.

Motion to Approve CCABA Membership
Motion:

Director Hoy made the motion to approve the request
for individual membership to CCABA in the amount of
$975 membership fees payable from the Board
organizational membership account.

Second:

Director Walker seconded this motion.

Discussion:

Director James abstained from the voting since this
was his request under consideration.

Packet Pg. 88

process, a Director may bring an organization forth that may have relevance to his/her
District but not necessarily to the agency. The Executive committee will review the
request, try to determine if it meets the criteria and make a decision for approval. The
Executive committee can only approve requests for individual memberships. Requests for
agency approval go through a different process that involves the General Manager and the
Chair of the Board. Records on the individual memberships are retained in the Board office
and these memberships will be renewed on an annual basis. The Board office has a
budget of $5000 for organizational membership.

6.M

Vote on the
Motion:

The motion passed with three of the Executive
Committee members in favor.

Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED.
Other Matters






Director Hoy expressed some concern over if the fare simplification study will
dovetail with the SMART card operation. He offered as an example that it might be
good to consider tying the fare structure with time of day discounts when the
buses are not full. Chair Sisk shared his understanding there is no peak on or peak
off service and this type of decision would require careful consideration. Director
James also expressed that becomes more of a transactional costs and staff
currently does not have the capacity to do this. Director Bagley expressed he
believes this makes the fare structure more complex and he could not support it.
Scott Reed indicated that the plans are the fare study will absolutely dovetail with
the SMART card. There are some key components from the fare study that need to
be in place early enough to be programmed in before the SMART card is in full
operation.
Director Bagley indicated he has been studying the Robert’s Rules of Order and
suggested that a copy of the manual that he has should be ordered for the full
Board.
Chair Sisk expressed that Tuesday night’s meeting was entirely too long. We need
to look for ways to consolidate or become more efficient in our meetings. He also
stated he thought it was discourteous for our presenters, Leeds School of Business
to have to wait that long to present. He called and offered his apologies to the
Leeds School.
Others expressed their concerns about the meetings as well. Director Hoy stated
the real problem is with the attention span and that the span starts to wander after
a period of time. Director James noted that one variable that we have on our
agendas is the updates. Perhaps the Committee Chairs can use more discretion in
how we address updates. Director Bagley expressed his frustration that one of the
most important roles for the Board is the budget but that five members had left by
the time it was presented. He agreed with Chair Sisk about having guest
presenters to wait and suggested that the budget/finance should have gone first.
Paula Perdue asked to respond and indicated that this issue of meetings and
schedules is quite complex and complicated. There are so many variables that go
into a meeting. Who would have known that a meeting with only two action items
would have taken 4 -1/2 hours? Nevertheless, it is incumbent on the Chair of the
respective committees to manage his/her meetings. It is not as simple as trying to

Packet Pg. 89

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 11, 2014 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

V.

move updates around on the agenda. We have tried a few things including putting
updates on the General Manager’s GMR report but few Board members seem to
read them. Sometimes updates are needed in preparation of an item that will be
coming forth for a vote. Updates need to be timely. There is no rule that says just
because an update is on the agenda that it has to be reviewed. We could have
used General Manager’s Washington process of “any questions” and moved some
of these items smartly along. Pertaining to fewer meetings, no one wants to have
a meeting if they are not needed. We are a very active agency with lots of things
going on. We try our best to be fair and equitable as we schedule meetings.
Meetings are rotated in the interest of fairness to committee chairs, staff and
everyone else involved. Sometimes Operations goes first and sometimes F&AA
goes first. It must be an equitable process for everyone. She is in the process of
preparing the 2015 calendar and can say we have a month next year where due to
conflicts with conferences, etc., we do not have enough time on the calendar in
that month for a Board meeting. She is working on a solution for this and other
factors that weigh on the calendaring process. As an example, new Board
members in the month of January are slated for 10 meetings that include the
normal committee/board meetings. The number and frequency of meetings that we
have is excessive but until we are in a maintenance mode, our options, outside of
Committee Chairs showing more diligence in managing the meetings, are limited.

Retiree Awards
Chair Sisk acknowledged the contribution of the retiring employees and how much
institutionalized knowledge that they possess. Collectively they had over 63 years of
agency knowledge and experience.
Bruce Abel, AGM Bus Operations introduced each of the retiring employees:
Dean Shaklee – General Superintendent of Maintenance – 34 years
Dean has been with this agency for 34 years, starting his career in 1984 in general
maintenance and rising through the ranks. Dean plans to focus his retirement on the 3G’s:
golfing, grandchildren and gardening. Dean enjoys woodworking and working on old tires
and automobiles.

Dean thanked the Board for supporting him and maintenance for the past 11 years. He
thanked General Manager Washington and AGM Bruce Abel for letting him do his job.
Most importantly, he thanked all the employees for doing a great job.
Robert W. Rynerson – Senior Service Planner/Scheduler – 29 years
Robert Rynerson who has served as an unofficial historian of the Denver transit system, is
also retiring with over 29 years of experience. Robert started his career over 40 years ago
in Alberta Canada. He was instrumental in developing a number of service plans, most
recently the West Corridor service plan and the Denver Union Station Plan. Robert’s
immediate plans are to travel to Europe, spend time with grandkids, one of whom is a
budding system planner at the age of 3. The job that Robert has performed over these
last years is excellent par none, and he has served as a mentor for many in the service
area. The task of synchronizing the rail schedules with the bus stations is intricate and
complicated but Robert has done an excellent job in this area.
Robert expressed that when he first came here, some of the people thought he was crazy
for going where they did not have rail. Nevertheless, he has seen this grow into fruition.
He has worked with a good team in service but feels the time is right to leave while we
are in-between of cutting over a new corridor. He knows the new team will do a great job
as well.
General Manager Washington also presented Robert with his General Manager award and
coin.
Both retirees received full applause.
Special Recognition – 2014 APTA International Rodeo
Chair Sisk indicated we had a special recognition for the employees who participated in
the international APTA rail rodeo in Montreal. Austin Jenkins provided the introductions
and stated RTD has the best employees in all North America having garnished the 3 rd place
overall in this competition. He asked Bill Bell and Phil Eberl to provide the introductions of
the teams.
Bill Bell presented the rail operators. Bryan Coy has been at RTD for only 4 years and 21/2 years in rail. He and Aaron Boettcher, who was not present, came in 7 th place in this
competition.

Public Participation
Chair Sisk opened the meeting up for public participation and asked each speaker to please
state his or her name and address. He reminded the speakers that they have a time limit
of 3 minutes. Chair Sisk recognized our elected officials in attendance as speaking first.
 Honorable Mayor Michael B. Hancock, Denver, stated that he was here this evening
to share the City of Denver’s support for making an amendment to the Regional
Transportation Plan (RTP) to include the Southeast Rail Extension. He said that as
the Board knows, General Manager Washington has done a tremendous job finding
ways to get FasTracks built. Mayor Hancock noted that this amendment allows for
tremendous creativity and for the Southeast Extension to remain eligible for federal
funding. He reiterated that his presence here tonight is to share his unequivocal
support. He thanked the Board, General Manager Washington, and RTD staff for all
their tremendous work.
 Honorable Mayor Jim Gunning, Lone Tree, thanked the Board for this extraordinary
opportunity for the Southeast. He appreciates everything the Board and staff has
done to make this project happen. He noted that he has spoken before the Board a
number of times in support of other lines or extensions. Mayor Gunning expressed
his appreciation for staff’s thinking outside the box to continue to more FasTracks
forward. While the Southeast Extension is contained in Lone Tree, it is really a
regional asset that benefits the people, employees, and companies in the area. He
said that his community is really excited to enhance their transit footprint. Mayor
Gunning shared that it is a regional consortium that has come forward with the
local cash match as well as right-of-way, which he believes makes a strong
statement about the areas commitment to transit. His community looks forward to
moving forward and appreciates the effort that has been put in by all involved.

 Chair Sisk recognized that Mayor Gunning has been a tireless supporter of regional
collaboration, benefiting the entire area. Chair Sisk thanked him for his hard work
and dedication.
 Honorable Mayor Herb Atchison, Westminster, said that he was here to express his
support, similar to Mayors Hancock and Gunning, of the Southeast Extension. He
stated that each time we get another corridor done, we get that much closer to
completing the entire FasTracks system. He noted that everyone understands the
challenges that RTD has faced, especially the Northwest Corridor, but tonight his
community is here to support a public partnership with everyone in the entire
FasTracks District. The private industry is stepping forward with private funds to
create opportunities to build the system that much faster; he anticipates there will
be additional opportunities in the future for other corridors. Mayor Atchison shared
that General Manager Washington told him that RTD would continue to move
forward with all the corridors. He said that General Manager has not promised a
date, but he plans to hold General Manager Washington accountable for moving
forward at every opportunity within the system. Mayor Atchison reiterated the
need to have a sound and solid mass transportation system in the region to be
competitive with other states.
 George Gerstle spoke on behalf of Elise Jones, Boulder County Commissioner, who
was unable to attend this evening. He read a letter from Commissioner Jones that
is available in the July 15, 2014 Board Meeting Agenda Packet in strong support
for inclusion of State Highway 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the Denver Regional
Council of Governments 2040 Regional Transportation Plan. This letter noted that
based on the results of the Northwest Area Mobility Study, transit mobility could be
significantly and cost-effectively enhanced with a capital investment of just over
$300M in six arterial BRT corridors. It also recognized the wisdom in taking
advantage of the additional funding available for the Southeast Rail Extension to
advance this element of the FasTracks plan.
 Tom Clark, Denver Metro Economic Development Corporation, said that we are
living in extraordinary times, a lot of which has to do with the vision of RTD. He
hopes that RTD can keep up the momentum of getting things built. He hopes that
the Board will approve the addition of SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit into the DRCOG
2040 Regional Transportation Plan. Tom Clarke feels that the Southeast Extension
is a testimony to the Board and RTD’s great work.
 Honorable Mayor Mike Waid, City of Parker, thanked each and every one of the
Directors for the time and commitment they give to regional transportation. He
shared that last evening at the City Council meeting, the Council voted unanimously
to support the accelerated construction of the Southeast Extension. He provided a
copy of the resolution that was passed, a full copy of which is available in the July
15, 2014 Board Meeting Agenda Packet. Mayor Waid stated that this does nothing

Packet Pg. 95

8.A

but help the Town of Parker have access to a larger community base, providing
greater access to Downtown and the entire Denver Metro area.
 Robert Partridge, Douglas County Commissioner, recognized that the Directors are
probably used to seeing someone different from Douglas County, Commissioner
Jack Hilbert. He said that Commissioner Hilbert’s last day was Sunday, but he was
a big supporter of transit. Commissioner Partridge commented that he planned to
say that all three Commissioners are fully supportive of the Southeast Extension but
technically he can only say two. He stated that Douglas County is not only ready
to partner in committing funds to the Extension, the County has also already
undergone a significant investment in the roadway system in this area.
At this time Chair Sisk read several letters into the record of individuals that were
unable to attend the meeting. These letters are from Honorable Mayor Bob Murphy,
City of Lakewood, Honorable Mayor Matthew Appelbaum, Boulder, Honorable Mayor
Dennis Coombs, Longmont, Honorable Mayor Steve Hogan, Aurora, Bruce Benson,
University of Colorado President, and Cynthia Stovall, FasTracks Citizens Advisory
Committee Co-Chair. A copy of each of these letters is available in the July 15, 2014
Board Meeting Agenda Packet.
Director Lubow indicated that she had spoken to Senator Matt Jones who was going
to be sending a letter as well. This letter was received later in the meeting and read
into the record. A copy of this letter is also available in the July 15, 2014 Board
Meeting Agenda Packet.
Chair Sisk, closing the Elected Officials portion of public participation, reminded the
remainder of the speakers that each person would have a time limit of 3 minutes.
 Bradley Cokas, Aurora, stated that this evening he wanted to discuss fare evasion.
He recognizes that this may not be important to RTD as only 20% of the operating
expense is covered by the fare box; however, he believes it is a much more serious
problem that needs to be addressed. Bradley Cokas thinks that paper transfers are
obsolete and other technologies are available to cut down on people cheating the
system. He stated that allowing people to evade fare sends a bad message to
RTD’s honest customers that pay the full fare each and every time they ride.
Bradley Cokas thanked the RTD drivers that are strict and enforce RTD’s policies.
He encouraged RTD to come up with an incentivized system, giving drivers a
portion of what they collect, to encourage proper fare enforcement.
 Zoe Williams, 9to5, shared that she was hoping one of her members, Marissa,
could come to the meeting; however, she is living in a shelter and her curfew
conflicts with RTD’s meeting schedule. Zoe Williams explained that Marissa was
living in a shelter due to fleeing her stable life due to domestic violence. Marissa
was able to get a stable job and move out of the shelter but was worried that she



would lose her job because she could not afford a transit pass. Zoe Williams stated
that was exactly what happened and Marissa is now living in a shelter again. She
expressed that there are people falling through the cracks between RTD’s non-profit
program and being able to purchase a monthly pass. She hopes that RTD will
catch all riders that are dependent on our service as part of the public engagement
process of the Fare Task Force. She asked that RTD continue to include
community feedback so there is a very robust process.
Keith Smith, Executive Vice President of Coventry Development Corporation, stated
that his company is creating RidgeGate, a mixed use development community. He
is at the meeting to speak in favor of the Southeast Rail Extension. Keith Smith
shared that in addition to the local cash match that Coventry will plan to provide,
they are also donating 23 acres estimated to be worth $10 million. He said that
this Extension will stimulate new development and job growth in a community that
is focused on transportation alternatives with a wide variety of house at various
price points.
Bill McMullen, Former RTD Director for District E, said that the last two months
have been fantastic; the opening of the Crawford Hotel was unbelievable. He said
that he was here this evening to speak in favor of the Southeast Extension. He
feels it is so critical that RTD keep FasTracks on track. He shared that he came on
the Board in 2004 when FasTracks was approved. He is so thrilled to see all the
mayors here in support of the same thing as they were with FasTracks initial
approval. He urged the Board to vote in favor of the Southeast Extension; in a
perfect would he would love to see a unanimous vote. Bill McMullen stated that
RTD has a history of success uniting the whole region; as a result when RTD
pursues Full Funding Grant Agreements that is not an unachievable goal. He
reiterated the importance of voting in favor to move this organization along.
Mike Reiser, Denver, came to the Board to speak about several accessibility
concerns with Denver Union Station, specifically for those that are blind or have
low vision. He stated that currently the brail signs are not in consistent spots.
There is no accessible way to get a ticket if someone has to use the kiosk. He
shared that if you are waiting for a bus at a gate that has more than one route,
there is no way to know what bus comes to the gate as there are no audible
announcements. He said that there is also not a way to look at a schedule
accessibly because there are no schedules in brail or some type of electronic
format.
Jawidga Brown, Denver, reiterated Mike Rieser’s accessibility concerns. She is a
certified Orientation and Mobility Instructor, helping visually impaired individuals
become independent. She stated that the people who rely on transit because of
their disability really have a hard time with accessibility. She believes that Union
Station can become accessible if RTD involves the ADA community. Jawidga

Brown said she would be more than happy to provide her help, as is the ADA
Chapter in Colorado Springs.
Felecia Gurule, 9to5, asked the Board to consider extending the time for a transfer.
She explained that sometimes her family does not have enough money to get on
RTD to return home.
Jorje Jimenez, 9to5, shared that he rides the bus for two hours each way to work.
He said that when he started using the bus he had to take his son out of after
school activities because he could not get home in time to take him. Jorje Jimenez
noted that when he drove he paid $30 to $40 every two weeks for gas; now he
buys a pass for about $80 so it costs about the same. He wishes he could bring
his family Downtown but he cannot afford it. Jorje Jimenez stated that is why he
is asking the Board to provide more affordable options like an income based pass.
Doug Gragg, Denver, shared that he is in support of pursuing a grant for the
Southeast Rail Extension. He noted that his opinion was published in an editorial
for the Denver Post. He feels a sense of urgency that RTD needs to get this as
soon as possible because of the uncertainty in Washington, D.C. Doug Gragg
reiterated his continual support of the people concerned about RTD’s high fares.
He believes RTD needs a rate reduction.
Judy Enderle, Longmont, said that she came to the Board to voice her opinion
about the Southeast Extension and the Northwest Rail Line. She noted that she
lives in the Northwest region and understands the issue with right-of-way
preventing the Northwest Line from moving forward; however she respectfully asks
that the Board look to find a more equitable solution for the Northwest Rail. She
believes it is stagnating and will not move forward without a better plan.
Karen Benker, Longmont, shared that she served on the RTD Board from 1992 to
2000. She stated that she was lucky enough to vote on the first five miles of rail
construction that went through Denver. Karen Benker said that it was very exciting
and she understands what it is like to vote for new construction; however, she
believes the Southeast Extension has an outrageous price tag. Karen Benker feels
like the Board has forgotten Boulder County. There are zero rail projects scheduled
for the County despite its 300 thousand residents. Karen Benker stated that the
people of Longmont voted for the FasTracks tax. She wonders if the people of
Lone Tree did. She suggested that the Board pass a resolution establishing a fund
dedicating any surplus funds for the Northwest Rail. Karen Benker stated that there
should be no additional extensions to other corridors until Boulder County gets its
fair share. She indicated that they are forming a citizens group promoting rail in
Boulder County.
Joan Peck, Longmont, thanked the Board for the opportunity to speak. She has
been involved in many groups supporting citizens whose voices are not heard over
the stakeholders. She headed a petition to get fracking banned in the City of
Longmont, which passed significantly. She stated that she was here to tell the

Board that even though Bus Rapid Transit is supported by the stakeholders, that I
not what the residents have voted for or want. She said that the citizens want
their voices heard over the stakeholders.
Mike Fitzgerald, Denver South Economic Development Partnership, came to speak
in support of not only the Southeast Rail Extension but also SH 119 Bus Rapid
Transit. He believes that the region will not do well long term unless everything
gets completed. Mike Fitzgerald stated that with the Board’s help and leadership,
Colorado is on its way to becoming a global crossroads of commerce and culture.
He shared that every company Denver South EDP works with tells them that their
primary workforce are 25 to 40 who do not want to own card. He reiterated his
encouragement for the Board to support these actions and pledged that his
organization will continue to work with RTD to come up with creative funding.
Anne Lemberg shared that she wrote a letter to the Board regarding the barbaric
hooliganism of RTD Security Officers who are the employees of the Denver Police
Department (DPD). She said that she has suffered personally, as well as witnessed
others suffer, from their bullying. There was a 16 year old boy who needed to get
to school but the DPD Officers bullied him off the bus and threatened criminal
action if he was even on RTD property again. She believes that criminalizing the
poor people that cannot afford to ride RTD is sheer barbarism. Anne Lemberg
stated that she has suffered a ticket that she wants expunged. A copy of the letter
is available in the Board Office.
Maureen Tarrant, CEO of SkyRidge Medical Center, said that she was advocating
for approval of the Southeast Extension. She explained that this Extension was so
important to her employees and patients. Her organization is committed to the
wonderful work that RTD has done. The Extension will allow her patients from all
throughout the Denver Metro area who are transit dependent better access to the
facility.
Brian McDonald, Charles Schwab, expressed his support of the Southeast
Extension. He believes that Denver had wonderful, cost effective public transit. He
shared that Charles Schwab is building their new location, along with a campus, at
RidgeGate. This location was selected because of light rail. He stated that access
to light rail will be an important factor in people’s decision to work for Charles
Schwab. He thanked the Board for their innovative solutions.
Bonnie Dalrymple, Denver, said that she is a real estate broker who has 4 listings
on Ogden Street near RTD’s 16th Avenue bus stop. She stated that this bus stop
is really an eye sore and is driving down the property values in the area. She
completed some comparisons between townhomes and condos near the bus stop
versus ones that are just a few blocks away. The sale price difference for
townhomes was $46250 while for condos it was $182,000. She asked that RTD
remove this bus stop. Documents for her comparisons are available in the July 15,
2014 Board Meeting Agenda Packet.

 Justin Bateman, Denver, stated that the bus stop at 16th and Ogden has become a
burden for the residents in the area. There is no system in place to keep it clean or
maintain. He shared that residents bought a trash can and take care of trash
removal but it is not enough. He asked RTD to remove the bus stop.
 Bob Hampe, Denver, also expressed his desire to have the stop at 16th and Ogden
removed. He noted that the route along Ogden appears to be one of the most
expensive routes for RTD. He feels it would be advantageous for both RTD and the
residents to have it removed. Bob Hampe commented that other routes in the area
only stop at 15th and 17th; he does not understand why this route needs a stop at
16th.
 Andrew Coonan, Helping Our People Excel, shared that he was here this evening to
support RTD’s contract award to Veolia. He said that Veolia provides his
organization, along with 9 other non-profit hunger relief organizations, an in-kind
donation of use of a warehouse in which Veolia only uses the parking lot. He
stated that this partnership really help the group serve low income families in the
Denver metro region.
 Laura Jorawsky, Denver, agreed with the people requesting removal of the bus stop
at 16th and Ogden. She commented that they really do their best to maintain it but
it is still not enough. She also supported RTD reviewing the fare structure. She
wonders if RTD looked at dropping the price there might actually be an increase in
riders, leading to more revenue.
Chair Sisk recognized that Director Lubow has some letter and emails she wanted the
Board to review. These are available in the July 15, 2014 Board Meeting Agenda

Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of June 24, 2014
Motion:

Director Rivera Malpiede made the motion to approve
the Board meeting minutes from June 24, 2014.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Folska indicated that she could not approve
these minutes. In the last FasTracks Committee
meeting, Director Anderson had read a document into
the record that she indicated was a public document
and she could provide. Director Folska has requested a
copy of this document in its entirety be provided for
transparency and be placed in the minutes especially if
it was used to make an argument. This document was
not provided and she feels the minutes should be
corrected.
Director Anderson responded she had provided the
Board office with a copy of her comments but
discovered the document she read was not a public
document. She stated the Board members can contact
the City of Arvada to see if They could obtain a copy of
the document.
Director Deadwyler commented that she shared the
same concern as Director Folska—that a document was
read into record and the request had been made to
receive the full document, not excerpts. She would
make a motion to strike everything from the minutes
pertaining to the document that Director Anderson read
into the record.
Director Lubow seconded this request.
Director Solano made a motion to table the whole
minutes until the full requested document had been
received.
Director Folska seconded this motion.
Director Anderson called for a point of privilege and
stated she had made comments and transcribed to the

Board. She has a right to do it. She felt she was being
attacked unnecessarily.
Chair Sisk responded to the question of privilege. He
said it was his understanding that Director Anderson
had been asked at the FasTracks Committee meeting if
she could provide the document and she had stated
affirmatively and indicated it was a public document.
The document had been read into the records.
Rolf Asphaug, Deputy General Counsel, stated that
what we were doing is approving minutes. The option
we have is to provide corrections to the minutes but
the recommended motions and actions do not apply.
Director Folska responded she believe that all
references to the document that Director Anderson had
read at the FasTracks committee should be stricken
from the record until the requested document had been
provided. She believes it is very important to make all
information transparent, accessible and fully disclosed.
Director Solano added it is an issue of needing to be
transparent.
Chair Sisk reiterated his understanding from Rolf
Asphaug, legal counsel, that the minutes could only be
accepted or approved and called for the question to
vote on approval of the minutes.

Award of “Group 25” Contracted Fixed-Route Services

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for the
provision of “Group 25” contracted fixed-route transit services with Veolia Transportation.
This contract is for three years for an amount not to exceed $66,874,659 with two (2)
one-year options in the amount of $24,271,326 (option year 1) and $25,140,353 (option
year 2), for a total five year not-to-exceed amount of $116,286,338. In addition, RTD will
reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be approximately
$13,799,677 for the initial three year contract term, $4,816,129 for option year 1, and
$4,929,152 for option year 2, for a total of $23,544,958 for the five year period. This
results in a total not-to-exceed contract amount of $80,674,336 for the initial three year
contract period and $139,831,296 for the five year period. This proposal represents the
most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals
(RFP) 14-DH-021, to provide “Group 25” Public Transportation Services. The contract to
provide this service is scheduled to be effective on January 4, 2015.

Approval of Construction Contract for the Central Park Station PnR & Bus Transfer
Center
It is recommend by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter
into a construction contract with M.A. Mortenson Company in the amount of
$10,899,258.23 for the construction of the Central Park Station Park-n-Ride and Bus
Transfer Center, which will serve the East Rail Line Central Park Station, regional and local
buses and the local neighborhood. Funding for this project is included in the 2014
Amended Budget for the Eagle Project and the non-FasTracks capital project for the
Stapleton Park-n-Ride replacement.

RTP/Senate Bill 208 State Highway 119

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve the attached Resolution, which will permit staff to submit to DRCOG
an SB 208 Report in early 2015 which specifies the technology and the method of
financing for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project.
Motion:

Discussion:

Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion to approve
the RTP/Senate Bill 208 State Highway 119.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.
Director Folska expressed her appreciation to staff for
the wonderful work that they had done on the NAMS
study. She appreciates the documents they have made
available on this study. However, she has still not seen
the completed NAMS Study and does not believe that it
exists. For this reason, she cannot vote on something
that does not exist. She feels it is part of her fiduciary
duty to fully understand what is in the document before
voting for this action.
Director Anderson indicated that she will support. She
saw lots of work and collaboration for this corridor to
come together. The Consensus Agreement and at least
two letters that the Board received from the US 36
Coalition and Will Toor offered the best support for this
decision. This will provide faster and better
connections between Longmont and Denver. Will
Toor’s letter pointed out the travel time of 53 minutes
via bus versus 71 minutes on rail. We need to approve
this as a way to get on the list for federal and state
dollars.
Director Solano shared that he initially opposed this
action but after he thought about the highway
congestion, etc. in that area and this is one way to
alleviate that congestion, he will be voting yes.

Director Lubow stated she will support. However, she
understands and can appreciate Director Folska’ s

8.A

Director Deadwyler stated she will not be supporting
this action. She thinks this is akin to the previous
discussion on accepting excerpts from documents that
the Board has not seen. The Board will be held
accountable for the full recommendation of that study
when it is complete and she is not comfortable voting
for this when the full scope of the recommendations
from that study has not been reviewed.
Chair Sisk urged support and approval of this action.
He expressed this sends a wrong message in terms of
regionalism. While BRT may not be a wholesale
solution, it is a chance to show regionalism. He is
concerned about the message we are sending and time
is of the essence to approve this action.
Director Hoy stated he will vote in support. We are a
region. The whole system needs to be connected. It is
imperative that we push the whole program forward.
Director Folska stated that she wholeheartedly supports
regionalism. She sits on the DRCOG Board and
understands there is an opportunity to add this to the
list when we are ready. She cannot put her name on a
document that does not exist. It is incomprehensible to
her that this Board would be OK voting on an action
where the full report has not been provided. The Board
has a fiduciary responsibility to know what they are
signing off on.
Director Walker commented that he will support. This
promotes what we do. We approve projects all the
time without having full information.
Director Solano reminded everyone that the NAMS
study was a $2M effort. The Board should know what
is provided in that full study.

Approval to submit the RTD FasTracks Projects for the DRCOG 2040 Regional
Transportation Plan (Baseline Report)
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve the attached Resolution, which will permit staff to submit to DRCOG,
by August 1, 2014, a Baseline Report on FasTracks in conformance w ith DRCOG’s
request for ongoing review of the FasTracks Plan pursuant to C.R.S. 32-9-107.7 as
outlined by DRCOG Resolution passed September 18, 2013. FasTracks projects and
project elements that will be completed by 2040, as described in this report, will be
included in the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) currently being prepared by
DRCOG.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to approve the
submittal of the RTD FasTracks Projects for the DRCOG
2040 Regional Transportation Plan.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Lubow expressed her appreciation for the
arguments that have been made for approval of this
action. She shared there has been a lot of pressure for
her to approve. She stated that monies expended for
this action would only leave people in the north further
behind. Her constituents are outraged by this,
especially since they will be paying taxes over 10 years
without realizing any benefits. She is a voice for the

Packet Pg. 107

voiceless. She had provided the Board with some
copies of comments received and has given the Board
office a full set of comments provided to her on this
issue. The comments basically express their outrage
and that it is not fair. One of the letters received was
from former Board Chair and member, Mary Blue, who
was instrumental in the passage of FasTracks. She
stated it was never intended to complete extensions
before the other corridors were complete.
Representative Polly Christman also expressed her
disappointment and that FasTracks was not getting
built out equally across the region. In addition, Brian
Bagley, the Longmont City Council, and Matt Jones
have expressed their concerns that the north is getting
left out. She would like people to understand that her
opposition is not against the people in the South but
that she must support the concerns of her constituent
base. For this matter, she will abstain.
Director Anderson stated that she respects Director
Lubow’s position. However, FasTracks was built on a
regional perspective of cooperation, collaboration and
compromise.
We need to leverage our assets for the full buildout of
FasTracks in the wake of diminishing funding. When
the Eagle project came in under budget, those funds
were reallocated for US 36, North Metro, I-225 and
station improvements in Longmont. The elected
officials in Arvada and Adams County did not object to
these funds going to another corridor. We have also
benefited from the unsolicited bid for the North Metro
Line. The Board has been supportive of a number of
processes. We approved the new starts application for
SE extension. We need to be focused regionally. It
does not make sense to postpone a financial
opportunity in the hand only to wait until, or if,
Northwest becomes a viable option. She really would
like the Board to refer back to the letter from Will Toor.
She remains optimistic that some way in the near
future, other options will open up where RTD will not

Director Folska indicated she will be providing her full
support for this action. There are three things which
she feels this action will serve as an impetus: (1)
economic development (2) enhance quality of life (3)
academic impact to our institutions. Per Andrew Getz,
this will have a full impact on this region. She also
wanted to provoke the thought that Douglas County
could use COPS in good faith to help generate some
funding that perhaps would allow us to divert some of
the requested RTD funds into other corridors.
Director Solano indicated that his constituency base is
saying no but for the sake of regionalism, he will vote
yes and bite his tongue.
Director Hoy commented that it is truly about
regionalism and providing mobility across town for
people who may live north but work in the SE corridor.
The way he sees it, we can pay $207M or we can pay
$65M for the project. Make your choice. By not
taking this opportunity, we are squandering money—we
can spend $1 and get someone else to spend $2.
Director Bagley commented this is not even his district.
It has already been stated most eloquently by the many
elected officials and others who have spoken in favor
of this motion as well as the letters that have been read
into record. He believes we need to move forward with
this corridor and he wholeheartedly supports this
action.
Chair Sisk read into record an email opposing this
action from Representative Matt Jones. Mr. Jones
stated the $76M could be used to advance Northwest.
This is not fair or right. RTD needs to focus on the
future. This is the kind of action that makes the people
in the northwest angry and cynical. A copy of this

make good policy decision and vote for this action.

Packet Pg. 109

8.A

Chair Sisk expressed his opinion this is a tremendous
opportunity to advance FasTracks and it is not good
policy to throw funding sources out of the window. He
is opposed to pitting the north against the south. It is
just good business sense to pay $65M for a $207M
project. This action tonight is a first step to get us into
the RTP Plan. There are still lots of work to be done.
Chair Sisk also expressed his appreciation to Director
Solano for his vote change. He knows how difficult a
choice this was for him.
Director Menten expressed that she had voted yes from
the committee to get this on the table for discussion.
She stated tonight she will be voting no. She asked
what guarantees do we have that the $25M in cash
from the stakeholders will come through? How much
debt, creation of special districts, etc. will funding for
this item require? We have no contract with the
County or anyone else. We do not know their finances.
The projected ridership has been decreased about 23%.
For her, it is all about the dollars and riderships. We
have no guarantees on the table to rest our hats. She
will vote no.
Director Folska responded this is not about the
constituents. It is the law that was passed in 2004.
The taxpayers voted.
Chair Sisk called for the question.

Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to approve the
General Manager’s 2015 goals.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Bagley, Chair of the General Manager
Oversight and Performance Management Committee,
provided this overview. The committee had met to
review the GM Task goals for 2015. The General
Manager has core goals and task goals. The core goals
do not change and are based on his job description.
The tasks goals came from the strategic joint Boardstaff planning advance held in March 2014. He wanted
to review the overall ranking and discussion of the
tasks goals.
Task Goal 1: Further advance the FasTracks Program
toward completion
The committee agreed on the achieved goals. Under
the “exceed expectations” the committee had some
disagreement. There was a proposal to change the
language to state the GM should achieve 1% above the
standard 2-1/2%. The committee did not agree on this
and was voted to leave as is 3-2.
Task Goal 2: Maintain fiscally sustainable posture and
further develop financial plans
The committee agreed on this goal as drafted.
Task Goal 3: Improve Service Delivery
The committee agreed to add language under “achieve
goal” to “design/implement public process for
involvement in a study of fare rates/structure that is
inclusive of all RTD districts.” The simplification of fare
structure was actually a garden item from the joint
Board-staff advance with 6 green dots and 6 reds.
Staff has already initiated action in 2014 to address
this item. The committee did not alter anything under
“exceed expectations.”

F.
Approval of General Manager's 2015 Goals
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management
Committee that the Board of Directors approve the General Manager’s goals for 2015 as
defined in the attached General Manager’s Performance Evaluation Form.

Packet Pg. 112

Task Goal 4: Implement Technological Advancements
Under “achieve Goals”, the GM consented to move the
language for SMART card implementation,
“SMARTCard implementation is operational and
performs as designed”. Under “exceeds expectation”,
it was added “information will be made available in a
generic format such as application programming
interface (API) to enable outside developers and
companies to register and obtain access to the APIs in
development of their own applications development
efforts, such as phone applications.”
These overall tasks goals were approved at the GM
Oversight Committee 4-1.
Amendment to
The Motion:

Director Deadwyler thanked Director Bagley for this
overview. She wanted to make an amendment to task
goal 1 under exceed expectations. Her reason is
because goals are supposed to be SMART (specific,
measurable, aligned, realistic and timely) but she did
not feel the language “above the normal 2-1/2%”to be
definitive. It is not measurable or quantifiable. She
would like to make a motion to add 1% above the
normal 2-1/2% match.
Director Folska seconded this motion.
Director Lubow stated her support of this motion.
Director Folska thanked Director Bagley for the
fantastic work he has done with this committee. We
have come a long way from when the state auditor
expressed the lack of governance and oversight of the
GM. The GM has done an excellent job, par none.
However, she does not feel it is unreasonable to add a
stretch to his goal. The GM makes things look too
easy. It is reasonable to ask for a more measurable
goal.

Director Anderson indicated she will vote against this
amendment. As she stated in committee, this is a
game changer. The Board is trying to change the rules
of the game and sending the wrong message to our
stakeholders and partners. It is also important to
remember that this committee will be doing the
evaluation of his performance. This committee can
hold his feet to the fire and will judge whether he
accomplished the goal. It does not need to be totally
spelled out.
Director Bagley stated that since 2004, we have looked
at a 2-1/2% match. This is like moving the goalpost.
We are sending the wrong message. Anyone who
understands this knows how difficult it is to obtain the
2-1/2% match.
Director Deadwyler stated the 2-1/2% is standard.
These are the GM’s goals. What does “beyond” or
“above” mean? We need to define these terms. Is it a
penny more or a dime more? The goals should be
measurable and attainable. We already know with the
SE corridor that this is 16%. Surely adding a 1%
objective is neither outside the scope of the Board nor
difficult for the GM to attain.
Chair Sisk called the question and asked for a vote on
the amendment.

The amendment failed with 5 in favor (Deadwyler,

Date: August 27, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

Date:

August 27, 2014

Board Meeting Date: September 16, 2014

Subject:

Contract Amendment; 2nd year 2014 option
2013-2015 Street Improvements & Shelter
Installations Contract # 33DM005

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract amendment to
initiate the second year of a three-year option contract for the annual Street Improvements & Shelter
Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $371,711.30. Funding for this contract amendment
is provided by the annual 2014 – 2015 Engineering Expense Budgets.
BACKGROUND
This action will address the General Manager’s 2015 goal of improving service delivery including
developing a cost-loaded, multi-year maintenance, repair and replacement schedule. This contract is an
on-call contract that performs street improvements, installs bus shelters and is available to perform
emergency repairs on short notice.
Due to the repetitive nature of this contract, a three-year option contract was determined to be an
effective way to manage this work for the District. Bids were received and a contract was awarded to
Manion Construction, Inc. as the lowest responsive and responsible bidder in September of 2013. The
current base contract value and amendment are as follows:
Amount
Amendments
Total
first year (base year), 2013
$ 354,061.25
$150,000.00
$504,061.25
second year, 2014 (option)
$ 371,711.30
0.00
$371,711.30
Grand Total: Base Year, Amendments, and 2nd year option =
$875,772.55
DISCUSSION
This second year amendment option would increase the contract by $371,711.30, creating a total
contract amount, including this amendment, of $875,772.55.
RTD Engineering develops a specific list of street improvements and shelter installations for the year.
Street improvements are related to specific locations where repairs are related to bus traffic. Locations
are determined through inspections by Engineering, reports from Bus Operations or input from local
jurisdictions. This input is evaluated and a priority list is developed.
Bus shelters are installed consistent with the program presented to the Board in August 2014. It is also
desirable to have an on-call contractor available when an unexpected emergency repair needs to be
performed on an immediate basis.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Estimated $371,711.30 budget shall come from the 2014 and 2015 Engineering Expense Budgets
dependent on the calendar year in which the work is performed.

Construction, Inc. for $371,711.30. Funding for this contract amendment is provided by the

Transfer Funds to Support the Light Rail
Gearbox Overhaul Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to transfer $676,745 from the event recorder capital
project (10360) to the Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance campaign expense line item.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Rail Operations has been in the process of
overhauling the gearboxes on the existing fleet for several years in order to maintain the cars in the
proper manner. We have determined that additional funds are needed in order to keep this process going
for the remainder of 2014.
The event recorder project was budgeted as a capital item and it was determined that this project did
not meet the criteria for a capital project. As a result, we are requesting authorization to transfer the
capital funds to the appropriate expense line.
DISCUSSION
The gearbox overhaul program ensures that the Light Rail Vehicles are kept in good repair by
following OEM and accepted industry guidelines that dictate when this process should take place.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This is simply a transfer from capital to expense so there is no financial impact.
DBE PARTICIPATION
DBE requirements do not apply in the case of a funds transfer.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to request the funds transfer. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the transfer as requested. This will cause work to stop on the gearbox
overhaul program for the remainder of 2014.

Subject:

Contract Extension
Financial Advisors

for

First

Southwest

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to authorize the second option year of the contract with
First Southwest (FSC) for Financial Advisory Services, which will extend the performance period through
December 31, 2015 and increase the total contract amount from $480,000 to $600,000. Funding for
the 2015 option is included in the FasTracks financial plan, and will be included in the 2015 expense
budget for FasTracks.
BACKGROUND
In August 2010, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for financial advisory services. Six proposals were
received, and First Southwest was selected as the most qualified proposer. The contract was structured
as a three-year contract with two one-year options to be exercised at RTD’s discretion, at a price of
$120,000 per year. The original period of performance ended on December 31, 2013. RTD exercised
the first option to extend the performance period through December 31, 2014. The original contract
and the first option were awarded within the General Manager’s contract authority of $500,000.
Exercising the second option will increase the contract amount above the General Manager’s authority.
DISCUSSION
Over the first four years of this contract, FSC has performed extensive financial modeling and analysis
for the FasTracks program. FSC provided the financial modeling in support of awarding the contracts to
complete the I-225 Rail Line and the North Metro Rail Line to 124th Avenue. FSC also supported the
delivery of the 2011, 2012, and 2014 Annual Program Evaluations, SB208 submittals to DRCOG in
2011 and 2012, Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) amendments in 2012 and 2013, and the 2014
Baseline Report approved by the Board at the July meeting. FSC also supported the annual financial
plan updates required by the terms of the TIFIA loan for the Eagle project. Through all of these projects,
FSC has provided RTD with high-quality, timely work product. FSC staff has been proactive and
responsive to RTD questions and concerns, and has helped RTD respond to comments from DRCOG,
TIFIA, and corridor stakeholders.
FSC also has played a significant role in RTD debt issuances and refundings over the same time period.
FSC brought forward the three debt refundings that were executed in early 2013 to provide the capacity
to extend the North Metro Rail Line to 72nd Avenue, and structured the COP issuance that allowed RTD
to extend the line to 124th Avenue. FSC also acted as financial advisor for the two sales tax bond
refundings in 2013, and structured the COPs issued by RTD in 2013 to give RTD the lowest cost of
capital through combining a refunding with a new issuance to fund buses and other capital equipment.
Under new rules imposed by the Securities Exchange Commission in 2014 and as required by the 2010
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, municipalities that wish to have open and
productive conversations with investment banks must now retain a Municipal Advisor who is a qualified
financial professional such as an investment banker or financial consultant who counsels municipalities

Packet Pg. 122

11.C

on financial transactions such as bond offerings. The Municipal Advisor must be registered with the
SEC and must have a fiduciary responsibility to the municipality. The FSC professionals that work with
RTD are registered Municipal Advisors with the SEC. This allows RTD to legally continue to work with a
variety investment banks to find creative and innovative methods to efficiently finance projects.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the 2015 contract amount of $120,000 is included in the FasTracks financial plan for 2015,
and will be included in the 2015 expense budget for FasTracks.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
authorize the second option year of the contract with First Southwest for Financial Advisory
Services, which will extend the performance period through December 31, 2015 and increase the
total contract amount from $480,000 to $600,000. Funding for the 2015 option is included in
the FasTracks financial plan, and will be included in the 2015 expense budget for FasTracks.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead, issue a new Request for Proposals for financial
advisory services. This is not recommended because First Southwest has performed its work
well and has provided value to RTD in excess of its contract amount.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead, use in-house staff to perform all necessary
financial modeling and debt services. This is not recommended because of the new SEC
Municipal Advisor rule and would hinder RTD’s ability to communicate with investment banks and
to continue to find creative and innovative ways to efficiently finance projects.

Budget Transfer for Contribution to RTD/ATU
1001 Health & Welfare Trust

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors authorize a budget transfer of $675,000 from the
unrestricted fund balance to fund the RTD contribution to the RTD/ATU 1001 Health & Welfare Trust
beginning October 1 through December 31, 2014.
DISCUSSION
The 2013-2018 Collective Bargaining Agreement between RTD and ATU 1001 Health & Welfare Trust
includes a provision that the employer (RTD) and employee (ATU represented employees) agree to pay
50% (equal split) of the monthly premium increases or decreases to the H&W Trust over the duration of
the agreement. The Trustees of the H&W Trust have requested an increase in the employee and
employer contribution effective October 1, 2014 for a premium increase. RTD and the ATU, and the
RTD Trustees and ATU Trustees have scheduled an arbitration commencing September 22, 2014
regarding ongoing contributions and premiums and have not agreed that $125 from RTD is the
appropriate amount beyond 2015. RTD has agreed to this minimum amount for 2015 based on the
need to assure health coverage for employees and meet required notice Provisions to employees for their
cost increases.
The Trustees requested an increase in the monthly contribution of $125 for RTD (per full-time employee
and participating part-time employees) and $125 from each participating full-time employee beginning
October 1. RTD’s share of the total contribution amounts to $675,000 over the 3-month time period in
2014.
It is necessary to fund the increased contribution by RTD through use of the unrestricted fund balance
because the amount was not budgeted in the 2014 Amended Budget. For 2015, the full-year
contribution amount of approximately $2.7 million will be included in the 2015 Recommended Budget to
be approved by the Board. All future contribution increases or decreases authorized by the H&W
Trustees will be presented to the RTD Board for approval.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This action will decrease the unrestricted fund balance by $675,000. At 7/31/14, the unaudited
unrestricted fund balance is reported at $27.2 million on a combined basis, with $21.7 million attributed
to the Base System and $5.5 million attributed to FasTracks.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended action to authorize a budget transfer of $675,000 from the unrestricted
fund balance to fund the RTD contribution to the RTD/ATU 1001 Health & Welfare Trust for the
period October 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014. This is the recommended action.

Packet Pg. 124

2. Do not authorize the budget transfer. This is not recommended because it may leave employees
without required notification for health coverage increases and may impact the availability of their
coverage.
