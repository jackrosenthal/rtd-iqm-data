## IV. Retiree Awards

Chair Sisk acknowledged there were three retirees this month.  He asked General Manager Washington to introduce the two who were present.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations and Mike Gil, Deputy AGM for Bus Operations presented Allan Hill, a street supervisor with over 35 years of service with RTD.  Bruce shared that during Allan’s extensive years with RTD, he has served in a number of capacities (i.e. bus ops, dispatch, emergency service, street supervisor).  Allan has been a dedicated employee during this time.

Mike Gil added that Allan is one of those seasoned employees who has been an integral part of the operations team.  He characterized Allan as a very diligent, prepared person who was “Johnny on the spot.”  Allan loves photography and has an image of everything that has happened on the job.  He even has black and white picture of Director Daly when he was a driver.  Allan catalogues his photos and in one month, covered 43 accidents.  Allan is always there with his camera and taking photos.  He also credited Allan with bringing us up to date with technology.  Allan mapped every intersection for RTD so we would have good information in our database for the drivers.

Allan acknowledged his wife Amy, his daughter Stacy and husband Jack in the audience.  He stated his life will be full with them and his grandkids.  He started his career in 1978 and is proud of his legend of having driven with his father.  At the time, buses were manual with no power steering or anything.  They did have windows that could open wide and he shared a story of one unfortunate experience.  He plans to retire to a little traveled area about 100 miles from Denver with lots of acreage and few neighbors.  He considers RTD part of his family and wants to thank RTD for his many years of service.

Assistant General Manager Austin Jenkins with rail operations and Phil Eberl, General Superintendent of light rail, introduced David Lockwood who was retiring with 36 years of experience.  David has also had a very extensive career with RTD starting first in bus operations and moving over to the light rail division.  Dave is the type of person who gets along with everyone and is well liked.

Dave complimented the leadership for the fine job they are doing at RTD.  It was a pleasure to work for them and he is thankful for his time at RTD.

Pat Sisk, customer care sales representative with over 23 years was not present to receive her plaque.

Chair Sisk acknowledged what a fine job each of these employees do and what they have done to make RTD one of the best agencies in the industry.  We know that it is the work of the employees who make all of us look good.  Thanks for a job well done.

Special Recognition-GFOA Distinguished Budget Presentation Award

General Manager Washington recognized the finance department for being the recipient of the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) award.  This team has won this honor for the last 4 or 5 years and it is what makes our finance and budgeting department tops in what they do.  He acknowledged Jannette Scarpino, Finance Manager, Todd Nikkel, Senior Budget Analyst, and Doug McLeod, Manager of Financial Reporting for their contributions.  Terry Howerter, CFO, was not present.

Director Anderson commented she is very aware of this aware and knows it is no small feat to achieve.

## V. Public Participation

- Andrea Chiriboga-Flor, Denver, CO, spoke on behalf of the people who could not be at the meeting.  She is a member of the 9-5 group.  She wanted to relay how the costs of transportation affect residents.  There are a group of residents who use the Denver Indian Center.  This is part of their heritage and sacred grounds.  Families congregate there as part of communal connections and the children play and learn about their culture.  They have been unable to go or send their children because they cannot afford to pay the bus fare.  This community is being cut off from their culture.

- Lorena Limón who lives in the vicinity of Mississippi and Lipan, spoke with an interpreter.  She stated it is difficult for her to get around due to the poor public transportation.   The bus comes infrequently, there are few bus stops and the roads are not paved.  Financially it is very costly for her to travel with her three kids which cost her $9.00 each time.  This is a major hardship on her family and she is looking for affordable transportation options.

- Andres Guerrero spoke on behalf of the re-entry population. Good transportation access is vital, even life changing, for this population who must use public transportation to look for jobs, visit their parole officers, and comply with testing requirements. RTD is the last resort and the lifeblood for these individuals who are trying to turn their lives around and become producing members of society.  Transportation must be affordable.

- Zoë Williams, 9-5, commented on the public process for the fare study.  She stated that the overwhelming comment from the public is the desire to make public transit more affordable.  The low-income already spend a large amount of their income on transportation which keeps them in the spiral cycle of poverty.  She would ask RTD to listen to the voices of the public.

- Dana Nobles, Denver shared her personal story around public transportation.  She was six months pregnant when she graduated from college.  Since that time, she has been on a path where it has become difficult to dig her way out.  She lived in transitional housing but found it difficult to get to job interviews because of transportation issues and at some point had to drop out of the market.  She is trying to find a job close to home but even that proves difficult.  She is concerned about her ability to find a job along a path where transit is accessible and affordable.  She sees this as the “slip effect.”  If she is successful in getting a job, she will lose her current benefits now, which will drive her cost of living higher.  She needs affordable transportable to even make this a viable option.  She does not want to choose between a job or her child.

- Fadumo Adan, Aurora, spoke on behalf of the refugee community. She stated she is a student and works two jobs; yet wages are stagnant and it is hard to make ends meet. She needs sustainable work and pay.  The refugee community which lives along the Colfax line are seeing less and less of the American dream.  These days the focus is just on trying to pay all the bills, rising student debt and less than affordable transportation.  Making transportation affordable is a lifeline to her community.

- Robert Lopez indicated that he was homeless and just trying to make it.  He stated the cost of housing, and transportation are becoming unaffordable in this city.  He believes the cost of bus passes needs to be made similar to the ECO Pass for the transit dependents and poor in this city.  He also shared an experience with fare reinforcement and asked for information on how to make a complaint.

- Scott Kerr, Denver, thanked RTD for its service.  He noted there has been community dialogue over the last year about affordable transportation but he has not seen any change.  He has witnessed the community solidarity grow on the issue of affordable transportation. Means based fares, expansion of the non-profit program or expansion of the ECO Pass programs are options that can be considered. He works at Bayaud Enterprises where he witnesses people not being able to get or keep a job because of transportation issues. He offers up his service and the service of many in the room in coming up with solutions on this problem.  Let’s build a bridge to the solution. Right now, there are various fare structures where everyone on the bus are paying different fares; there is a bubbling up of a sense of injustice.  Please look for ways to make transportation affordable for the working and non-working poor.

## X. General Manager's Report

General Manager Washington shared these updates:

- White House Infrastructure Investment Summit—He was invited to be a participant in this summit that occurred on September 9, 2014.  This summit was hosted by the US DOT Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, and included Secretary of Commerce, Penny Pritzker, and Secretary of Treasury, Jacob Lew.  The focus was on ways to get more funds for infrastructure.  He sat on a panel that was moderated by USDOT Foxx and had a chance to tell the RTD story of using P3 for the Eagle project.  He referenced the Lessons Learned document that RTD produced on the Eagle procurement in 2011, as did several others on the panel and at this summit.  This document is becoming a Bible on how to do a successful P3 project. RTD has the only successful P3 project in the country.  What he garnered from the summit is there are private investors out there who may want to play but without some national standards, this becomes challenging for them.  The Secretary plans to present recommendations to the President around November 16th.

- Meeting with USDOT Under Secretary for Policy, Peter Rogoff—While in Washington, he met with Under Secretary Peter Rogoff to discuss issues on Buy America.  This is becoming more of a challenge for many transit agencies today.  The process to get waivers is long and arduous and delays projects.

- 2014 Security Operations Peer Review in Sacramento, CA—The Sacramento office requested Chief Tarbert to participate on a peer review of the Sacramento agency.  They have subsequently called and told him what a good job that Chief Tarbert did.  He also received notification today that Chief Tarbert has been selected as Chair of the Transit Policing and Security Peer Advisory Group to the TSA.

- General Manager announced that RTD did not win a TIGER grant for the Central Corridor or the US HWY 119 submission; He understands there were $9B submission for the $300M grant; Colorado did receive two grants for other projects.

- National Transit Institute Model Program Award—the MAX program which consists of Dart Dallas, Marta-Atlanta, Los Angeles-LAX and Denver is the recipient of the National Transit Institute Model program Award for its focus on innovative workforce.

- RTD received Leeds Certification for Denver Union Station—this is a great feat with focus on sustainability and efficiency.

- Denver Union Station was named by the American Public Works as project of the year.

- Jerry Nery, Project Manager for the Denver Union Station, was the recipient of the Denver Business Journal PowerBook award.

Several Board members expressed congratulations and asked for more clarification around the Buy America issue.  Marla Lien provided clarification.
