BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Paul J. Ballard, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: May 27, 2020

From:

William C. Van Meter,
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

May 26, 2020

Subject:

RTD Boundary Certification & Director District
Designation

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: June 2, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the Board Secretary to certify the boundary map and description to reflect three new
annexations in the Town of Erie. It is further recommended that all three of these newly annexed parcels
be assigned to District I (Director Lubow).
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals for 2020:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
HB 1295-07 requires that the District revise its boundary map and legal description following any
changes to the District’s boundary. Further, pursuant to CRS 32-9-106.6 (b), any area annexed by an inDistrict municipality on or after May 25, 1994, is automatically included in the District. In this particular
case, the Town of Erie has annexed three parcels into the Town. Since parts of the Town are in the
District, any annexations by the Town automatically become included in RTD. The Board is not being
asked to approve the annexations, but to authorize the Board Secretary to certify the boundary map and
description to reflect the new annexations, and to assign the newly annexed areas to a specific Director
District.
The Town of Erie annexations are as follows.
Annexation
I-25 North Parcel
I-25 South Parcel
Swink

Acreage
99.83
155.29
150.29

Adjacent Director District
I
I
I

The land involved in all three annexations encompasses approximately 405 acres or approximately 0.63
square miles. All of the properties are undeveloped or farmland. All three parcels are adjacent to Director
District I (Director Lubow).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact is associated with this action. It should be noted, however, that as these properties
develop, depending on the mix of uses, they will generate sales tax revenue for the District.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Paul J. Ballard, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: May 27, 2020

From:

William C. Van Meter,
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

May 26, 2020

Subject:

Parking Structure Management Agreement at
Olde Town Arvada Station

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: June 2, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute an
Intergovernmental Agreement (the “IGA”) with the City of Arvada (the “City” or “Arvada”) to govern
parking management at the Olde Town Transit Hub (the “Hub”), the parking garage at Olde Town
Arvada Station (the “Station”).
This action addresses the following General Manager’s goals for 2020:
• Task Goal #3: Enhance Current and Future Transportation Methods
• Task Goal #5: Increase Ridership
BACKGROUND
This topic was mostly recently discussed with the Board at the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks
Committee meeting on April 7, 2020.
In 2007, in anticipation of the construction of the G Line, the City of Arvada released the Arvada Transit
Station Framework Plan, highlighting Olde Town Arvada Station as the most prominent station along the
G Line. The plan foresaw the “character of the Olde Town Station area [as] a vibrant urban village that
preserves its historic fabric and also allows new opportunities for living, employment, shopping, dining,
and cultural experiences.” In order to move that vision forward, the City of Arvada and the Arvada
Urban Renewal Authority (AURA) sought RTD’s support in aligning RTD’s G Line corridor planning with
local goals. Specifically, Arvada suggested that, rather than expand the existing RTD surface parking lot,
RTD work with the City and private partners to accommodate bus and rail parking in a garage; this
strategy would open up land for development adjacent to the Station.
In 2014, RTD, the City, and AURA released a Request for Proposals for the development of a 9-acre site
southeast of the Station, which included an existing RTD Park-n-Ride. The group’s intent was for the
privately developed project to include a mix of uses that would complement and enhance the existing
character of Olde Town. Trammell Crow was selected as the developer, and planning and design began
on what has become the Olde Town Transit Hub. The Hub is owned by Arvada and includes an RTD bus
transit facility on the ground floor and 600 parking spaces on the floors above. The Hub was funded by
Arvada/AURA, RTD, and a CDOT Faster Grant. Arvada contributed more than $24 million, the Faster
Grant totaled $1.5 million, and RTD allocated the $7 million it would have spent on a new surface lot, as
well as $3.4 million in land value. RTD’s contribution included FTA funds from the New Starts grant for
the Eagle project and federal funds that were used in the original purchase of the surface parking lot.

Packet Pg. 8

1.B.2

The Hub opened in fall 2016 and began serving RTD rail patrons in the spring of 2019 with the opening
of the G Line. Bus operations moved into the ground-floor facility in August 2019.
When the Hub opened to RTD patrons, Arvada granted RTD a Permanent and Nonexclusive Easement to
the bus facility and 400 spaces in the garage; the remaining 200 spaces are reserved for Olde Town
employees and visitors. The parties also agreed to an Operation and Maintenance Intergovernmental
Agreement, which makes Arvada responsible for the upkeep of the garage, with an annual $44,000
payment from RTD to Arvada to cover some of the costs. In 2019, the cost to manage and maintain the
Hub was approximately $415,000. Lastly, Arvada and RTD committed to a Memorandum of
Understanding (the “MOU”) that established an 18-month, Preliminary Parking Management Plan to
regulate parking in the Hub. Under the MOU, the Hub’s parking spaces are segregated pursuant to the
easement and Arvada is not permitted to charge parking fees. Arvada and RTD agreed to use the 18
months of the MOU to gather and analyze parking data and develop a permanent parking plan that
would be formalized in the IGA that is now under consideration.
Arvada contracted with Walker Consultants to complete a parking study in the Hub and recommend
parking-management strategies based on industry best practices. Based on data collected by manual
counts in the Hub, Walker determined that the average peak utilization on weekdays from August to
December 2019 was approximately 63%. RTD’s spaces were far more highly utilized on weekdays than
Arvada’s, 85% and 17% respectively. On weekends, overall utilization was lower, at only 20%, or 23%
of RTD’s spaces and 13% of Arvada’s. Walker cross-checked the manual data with users’ selfidentification via a cellphone app and kiosks, as well as with bus and rail ridership. The consultants
determined that, although it was not possible to verify that all the users parking in RTD spaces were in
fact using RTD, users were generally following the Hub’s rules and generating accurate data.
Given that weekday peak utilization stood at approximately 63% at the end of 2019 and was dominated
by RTD patrons, Arvada and RTD, with input from Walker Consultants, have tentatively agreed that if
utilization reaches 85% Arvada has the right to charge all users parking fees in order to manage parking
demand. In other words, Arvada will use parking charges to ensure that there are always some open
spaces in the garage. In exchange, parking will no longer be segregated under the easement, giving RTD
patrons access to more parking spaces within the garage. However, the easement will remain in place to
protect the interests of RTD and the FTA in the Hub.
COVID-19 has caused precipitous declines in utilization at the Hub as ridership has dropped and Olde
Town businesses have temporarily closed. At the beginning of 2020, it seemed possible that utilization
at the garage would reach 85% and Arvada would be able to start charging soon; now, it seems more
likely that it will be years before the combined use generated by RTD ridership and Olde Town
employees and businesses will hit the 85% milestone.
DISCUSSION
This action would give the General Manager and/or his designee the authority to negotiate and
execute the IGA with Arvada to govern parking management at the Hub. RTD’s execution of the IGA
will only be authorized to take place if the following conditions are met:
1. There will be no segregation of parking spaces in the Hub between the 400 spaces for which
RTD holds an easement and Arvada’s 200 spaces. As such, RTD customers will have
unimpeded access to all 600 spaces, including at peak times.
2. Arvada will use all revenue generated at the Hub for the management and maintenance of the
Hub or, alternatively, transit-supportive uses approved by RTD.

Packet Pg. 9

1.B.2

3. All customers will be required to self-identify as RTD or Arvada users by cellphone app or at a
kiosk in the Hub.
4. Arvada will report utilization rates and customers’ self-identified user type to RTD on a
monthly basis. Additionally, RTD may perform its own audits and will have access to Arvada’s
records related to the Hub.
5. Arvada will be permitted to charge all users to park in the Hub if the average weekday peak
utilization rate reaches or exceeds 85%. Arvada will be permitted to charge each vehicle up to
$2/day for the stabilization period.
6. At the end of the stabilization period, and at regular intervals thereafter, Arvada will analyze
utilization rates and notify RTD if Arvada intends to raise or lower the parking rate:
a. If the average weekday peak utilization rate reaches or exceeds 85%, Arvada may raise
the fee in 50-cent increments to manage parking demand.
b. If the average weekday peak utilization rate falls below 55%, Arvada will decrease the
fee in 50-cent increments to promote utilization.
7. The maximum daily fee allowed under this IGA will be $5.
8. For special events after 5pm on weekdays, or on weekends and holidays, Arvada may
designate special rates in order to manage parking availability. RTD users will be exempt from
special rates.
9. Overnight, multi-day parking up to 30 days will be allowed.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Accepting the Recommended Action would have no impact on RTD’s ongoing operations and
maintenance costs for the Hub, which are governed by a separate agreement.

RTD's Fixing America’s Surface Transportation
(FAST) Act Reauthorization Priorities

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: June 2, 2020
Information

Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act expires on September 30, 2020. The FAST Act
reflects the ongoing federal commitment and investment in the nation’s surface transportation system.
Ongoing and sustainable investment in high capacity transit is clearly tied to the ability of metropolitan
areas to attract employers and retain workers.
RTD has been an active participant in the array of formula and grant programs enabled through the FAST
Act. These programs, however, require a combination of local and federal funding for implementation
and success. Recently, RTD’s local funding has been severely impacted by COVID-19 and the resulting
economic shutdown. The damage to these revenue sources is unprecedented and unanticipated. The
impact is deep and will ripple well into the future. It will take many months, if not years, for the
economy to rebound as social distancing is gradually relaxed throughout the United States.
RTD has identified several top FAST Act reauthorization priorities, which are listed immediately below
and detailed in the recent letter to our congressional delegation (attached). These are:
•
•
•

Return the Credit Risk Premium on RTD’s Repaid RRIF Loan
Greater Bus Formula Funding to Maximize Benefits of Asset Management
Robust Funding for Small Starts Projects

In addition to these top priorities, RTD also endorses and supports national FAST Act reauthorization
priorities which are explained here. While RTD may not be able to take advantage of all the programs
inherent in these priorities in the short term, we may be positioned to do so during the forthcoming
reauthorization period.
Adjust the federal/local share of Capital Investment Grant (CIG) program projects. The CIG percentage
share of the total capital cost of projects has declined over the past two decades as federal funding has
not kept pace with the demand of citizens and businesses in metropolitan areas to invest in transit. This
demand combined with insufficient federal funding has led to the rationing of federal funding to allow
more projects to be built and has significantly increased the financial burden on states and local areas.
The CIG program can be part of an economic stimulus program. In light of the devastating impact on
State and local revenue sources and the permanent loss of cumulative State and local revenues, we call
on FTA to increase the CIG percentage contribution to 60 percent for New Starts and Core Capacity and
Small Starts projects to 80 percent consistent with 49 U.S.C. §5309(l). Raising the federal share will
both level the playing field between highway and transit investments as regions seek to expand capacity
in a project corridor and also mitigate a likely delay in building projects due to the permanent loss of
revenues as the economy seeks to recover from the economic shutdown.

Packet Pg. 29

1.D.1

Amend the list of eligible expenses under 49 U.S.C. 4903 to include equity dividends in the case of P3
projects. P3 projects have some costs and revenues that are fundamentally different from those of
traditionally delivered projects. FTA’s list of eligible expenses does not include some of the project costs
associated with P3s, therefore limiting the extent to which an agency can utilize its New Starts funding
to fund P3s. This is particularly the case with respect to equity dividends, which are not currently
considered an eligible expense.
Small Starts Eligibility. Congress established the thresholds for Small Starts at total cost of less than
$300 million and a CIG share of less than $100 million in the FAST Act in 2015. Since establishing
these thresholds, there have been significant increases in the cost of construction. Moreover, by setting
the thresholds at these levels, Congress is requiring overmatch exceeding 50 percent for projects that
currently exceed $200 million in project cost. RTD supports increasing the federal share to $200 million;
and, increasing the total cost of projects to $400 million. This change could be beneficial to Bus Rapid
Transit projects in the region such as Colfax BRT and State Highway 119 BRT if they were to achieve
eligibility for federal funding.
Core Capacity Funding Eligibility. Expand the list of considerations to include the extent to which a
project will overcome physical or other barriers to service increases, such as system bottlenecks, or train
control limitations that must be addressed on system-wide basis, not solely on a corridor basis. RTD
could potentially benefit from this program, particularly for long-term capacity constraints anticipated
between I-25/Broadway and downtown Denver.
Enhance Technological Development. The transit industry is in the midst of substantial technological
change. The FAST Act promoted technological change by promoting innovation in section 5312, by
creating the No and Low Emission Bus Program in section 5339(c) and section 5319(c)(3) which allows
a zero-emission power source to be leased and treated apart from the useful life of a rolling stock. This
change in the useful life of the zero-emission source of power was due to concern that manufacturers
could not yet warrant that the power source would last 12 years for a bus or 25 years for a rail car.
Congress should grant FTA broad authority to waive procurement requirements that constrain the
introduction of innovative technology. RTD is now subject to ambitious state-wide fleet electrification
targets.
Value Capture. The Administration promotes “value capture” for transit projects which RTD supports.
This takes many different forms, including tax increment financing (“TIF”), creation of benefit
assessment districts, developers building transit stations or joint development.
Joint development is overseen by the FTA where federal funds have been used for the acquisition of
property that is later used for “associated transit improvements” that enhances the use of transit or is
physically or functionally related to transit. Many transit agencies have utilized the joint development
authority but usually after a transit capital project is completed. The benefit of this authority is that the
revenues generated can be used for both capital and operating purposes by a transit agency.
To enhance value capture we request that CIG projects that can document a revenue stream or capital
funding from “value capture” be able to improve the rating of their Financial Plan by a half step which
would allow, for example, a “Medium-Low” rating be raised to a “Medium” overall rating. RTD also
requests the use of station area “value capture” be added to the suite of tools available to increase land
use and the economic development measures ratings as it can both raise revenue and motivate truly
transit-supportive development. As RTD pursues an array of options to complete the FasTracks program,
value capture could be one piece of the financing puzzle.

The Honorable Ed Perlmutter
U.S. House of Representatives
Dear Senators Gardner and Bennet, and Representatives DeGette, Neguse, Buck, Crow,
and Perlmutter:
Should Congress craft a surface transportation infrastructure package in your work to help
spur our economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, RTD seeks your strong
support and advocacy for our priorities in that legislation.
First, please know we are grateful for your successful efforts to secure $25 billion in the
CARES Act to address the direct impacts on RTD and transit agencies nationwide from
social distancing and work-from-home mandates to combat the pandemic. By our latest
figures, RTD struggles under fare box revenue losses from a 66 percent drop in ridership
and suspension of fare collection due to rear-door boarding to limit contact with operators.
Additionally, we face looming declines in dedicated sales/use tax revenues as many
businesses remain shuttered. Together, farebox and sales/use tax revenues comprise 71
percent of our budget. For the three month period of March - May, RTD anticipates fare
box revenue losses of $30 million.
While the pandemic's impacts to our public transportation systems are unprecedented, we
continue to operate core routes to serve those who, like our bus and rail operators, are
essential to keeping our communities functioning. And we know from past economic
downturns that our transportation and infrastructure networks remain essential to virtually
all aspects of daily life and thus can serve as catalysts for economic recovery. Accordingly,
in advancing the following requests, Congress can help ensure RTD has the resources
needed to invest in cost-effective, sustainable public transportation service for the entire
Denver region, now and in the years ahead.
Return the Credit Risk Premium on RTD's Repaid RRIF Loan: We seek the return of our
$28.9 million credit risk premium (CRP) on our long-repaid RRIF loan for the Denver Union

Station redevelopment project. We appreciate the support of the entire delegation for this effort, including the
recent introduction of H.R. 6452. Both H.R. 6452 and the Senate companion bill introduced last July, S. 2213,
direct US DOT to promptly return the CRPs of all repaid RRIF loans in our cohort (cohort 3 (2009 - 2015))
upon repayment of each individual loan. Under both bills, RTD and Denver would promptly receive the $28.9
million (plus interest) we paid US DOT in 2010 on the DUS loan. Without this fix, our repaid loan - and our
$28.9 million - remain tethered to a group of other, still-active cohort 3 loans for decades to come, as several
of these loans have 35-year repayment periods.
Greater Bus Formula Funding to Maximize Benefits of Asset Management: Under our asset management plan,
RTD has been able to strategically and systematically procure, operate, maintain, and replace transit assets to
manage performance and costs over asset lifecycles. Key to realizing the full potential of asset management is
reliable funding streams available to make appropriate investments where and when condition and
performance data direct us. To date, the potential gains from RTD's asset management program have been
constrained by the lack of such reliable funding sources. Accordingly, RTD requests that Congress authorize
increased funding for the Buses and Bus Facilities formula program under 49 U.S.C. 5339(a). By prioritizing
funding best suited to serve data-driven repair and maintenance decisions, Congress can help RTD and transit
agencies nationwide make meaningful progress in bringing our transit systems into a state of good repair.
Accordingly, we seek sufficient additional funding to meet the pressing state-of-good-repair needs transit
agencies across the US face, particularly for aging maintenance facilities.
Robust Funding for Small Starts Projects: With a long pipeline of planned BRT projects, RTD seeks increased
funding for the Small Starts component of the Capital Investment Grant program at 49 U.S.C. 5309. The Small
Starts program should receive sufficient additional funding to ensure that all projects meeting FTA's project
justification and financial commitment criteria can receive Federal funds before their project costs increase.
Additionally, we support the proposal of the American Public Transportation Association to increase the
maximum Federal share of each Small Start project from $100 million to $200 million and to increase the total
estimated net capital costs cap from $300 million to $400 million.
We are eager to work with you to realize these important improvements in transit funding and finance
programs. With your help, we can better serve our riders, weather the impacts of coronavirus, and make
meaningful, long-term investments in infrastructure that move our economy forward.

Ridership – Preliminary Baseline Results
§ Preliminary modeling has been completed for six baseline

scenarios, five passenger rail scenarios and a best bus scenario
o Results are favorable and have room for improvement
o Ridership is expected to increase under all Rail Scenarios
o Ridership may increase under Best Bus scenario also but not as much

room for improvement
§ Refinements will improve ridership
o Engineering improvements to changes in horizontal and vertical geometry

to increase speeds and travel times
o Refinements to operating characteristics, such as improved connections
or station locations
o Mix and match best performing segments with hybrid
corridors/alternatives
§ Rail is projected to have higher ridership than bus
§ Rail ridership projections (even these conservative early forecasts)

compare favorably to existing passenger rail services around the
United States".
