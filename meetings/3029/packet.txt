TOUGH TIMES.
TOUGH DECISIONS.
• Like much of the rest of the world, RTD is facing a new financial reality due to the
COVID-19 induced economic slowdown.
• We’ve already implemented a number of cost saving measures in 2020.
• RTD began the 2021-2026 Mid-Term Financial Plan (MTFP) process anticipating a
$166 million shortfall for 2021 due to reduced sales tax and farebox revenues.
• COVID Fiscal Response Task Force was created to identify cost savings and budget
reduction strategies to address the financial impacts of COVID-19.
• Each department AGM submitted a plan to align budget and staffing levels with the
much-reduced level of service that will continue in the foreseeable future.

DRAFT COVID-19 BUDGET REDUCTION
PRINCIPLES
#1
Keeping riders, employees and the region healthy and safe: We will
strive to keep our communities connected and our riders,
employees and region healthy and safe.

#2
Service reductions should not be our primary response.
We’ll be creative: We will take a balanced approach to
budget reductions and do so in such a way as to align with
our mission. Accordingly, service reductions should be
minimized so as to minimize the impact to our customers.
We will strive for a well-rounded approach by incorporating
reductions in overhead, breaking down silos and engaging
partners, and seeking creative approaches to service
delivery.

#3
We’ll prioritize mobility for people who most depend on
transit during the pandemic: We will strive to maximize
mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most
depend upon our services to access essential jobs and other
necessities, while also keeping our communities and activity
centers appropriately connected.

#4
We will support and value all of our employees. We acknowledge
our frontline employees who directly promote our mission to the
public and who have borne the brunt of mandating in the past. We
also acknowledge those fulltime employees in the lower wage
categories, because a humane work environment is valued by
RTD.
#5
Being data-driven and informed by collective wisdom and
expertise: We will use a thoughtful, responsible approach to
decision-making for the COVID period, while planning for the midterm financial period and post-pandemic future, by incorporating
the best available data, expertise, and wisdom, including through
the Re-Imagine project, the accountability committee, and
stakeholders.

#6
We’ll be actively transparent and seek input: We will take active
measures to be transparent and seek input regarding our use of
CARES Act money as well as in the decision-making process for
measures we adopt to respond to ongoing COVID financial
impacts.
