BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 GM/CEO Performance Appraisal and Related
Compensation Change

November 21, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
December 3, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson’s attached
performance appraisal for the 2024 calendar year performance cycle, and in connection therewith, to
approve a 4.86 percentage increase to the GM/CEO’s current Annual Base Salary.
BOARD REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Performance Committee Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Performance Committee (PC) is responsible for oversight and management of the GM/CEO’s
employment contract, compensation package, and annual comprehensive performance appraisal.
Following the PC’s consideration, the GM/CEO’s performance appraisal and any corresponding incentive
and adjusted base compensation are reviewed and approved by the Board.
On September 20, 2020, RTD and the GM/CEO entered into a five-year employment agreement
(Agreement). The Agreement sets forth her compensation and benefits, as well as a program by which
the Board, in consultation with the GM/CEO, establishes performance goals and metrics, annually
evaluates her performance, and utilizes a framework for determining future incentive awards and
increases to base salary subject to her meeting or exceeding these goals. The Agreement has been
amended by the parties seven times, with the most recent amendment adopted by the Board on January
30, 2024. The Board adopted the 2024 GM/CEO Performance Assessment Framework on January 30,
2024.
On March 26, 2024, the Board approved a summary scope of work for consulting services related to the
development and execution of a total Compensation Study, 360° assessment instrument, and final
assessment tool and authorized the GM/CEO to enter into a contract for such services.
DISCUSSION
Consistent with the Third and Fourth Amendments to the Agreement, on October 18, 2024, GM/CEO
Johnson submitted a self-evaluation for the Board’s consideration. All Directors were provided the 360°
assessment results and given the opportunity to submit ratings and comments on the GM/CEO’s
performance during the performance period. The attached appraisal reflects the Board’s assessment that
GM/CEO Johnson meets expectations with respect to the 2024 Performance Assessment Framework.

This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the GM/CEO’s performance is reflective of the overall performance
of the agency as a whole.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
In accordance with the 2024 Performance Assessment Framework and as a result of the GM/CEO
Performance Appraisal score, the GM/CEO will receive a 4.86 percent merit increase, increasing her
Adjusted Base Salary from $402,325 to $421,878, effective January 1, 2025.
