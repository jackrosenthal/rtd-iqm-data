III.

Motion:
The motion passed unanimously.
Third Quarter Internal Audit
Bill Holmes, Audit Manager, referred the Board to the audit summary report
provided in their packet and asked for questions or comments. Director Tayer
complimented the team for having zero items that carried forward as open.
There were no other comments.

IV.

Third Quarter Investment Report
Teresa Sedmak referred the Board to the summary report provided in their Board
packets and asked if there were any questions. Director Bagley asked Teresa how
comfortable was she with our current financial investment status. Teresa responded
we are relatively OK.

V.

September 2010 Financial Status Report
Todd Nikkel noted our sales and use tax will probably end up relatively flat in
2010 after adjustments from the vendor allowance.

VI.

Unemployment, gas price and Ridership trends
The finance staff indicated this was a request from Director Tayer to provide this
analysis to see if there was a correlation between the ridership, employment and gas
prices. There was no noted correlation.

VII.

RFP Update-Sales and Use Tax Forecasting
Susan Cohen introduced this as an informational item. They had submitted the RFP.
The best response came from DU and is within budget. This effort should start the
first of the year. Director Tayer expressed appreciation for the effort. Director
Christopher noted that two years ago, two “stellar “Directors by the names of
Christopher and Tayer had made such a request.
Director Tayer requested that a scorecard or some form of documentation be
maintained to keep track of historical and future effects. Phil Washington indicated
this is the plan.

VIII.

Other Matters
 Teresa Sedmak provided an update on COP credit downgrade. RTD received recent
ratings from Fitch, S&P and Moody. Our ratings with Fitch and Moody remained
basically the same. However, S&P downgraded our COPS rating two levels to an
A-. Teresa read some excerpts from the letter from S&P indicating their reasoning
and also stated RTD had provided some correspondence around our concern. They
are not sure of the impact this drop in rating will have on the sell but is optimistic it
will not be major.
 Chair Kemp shared that Director Busck had intended to be at this meeting but
received a call that his son-in law had to be rushed to the emergency. Director
Busck has been spending significant time providing support to his family during this
period while his son recovers from an unfortunate accident.
