GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT

VIII.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT
A.

Salaried Employee Insured Benefits
It is recommended by the Financial/Administration Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the 2008 Plan Year Salaried Employee Insured Benefits Budget and
authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement with the Insurance Carriers.
The total estimated cost for the 2008 Salaried Employee Insured Benefits is
$6,147,641, of which the District will pay $5,138,097 (83.6%) and our salaried
employees will contribute the remaining $1,009,543 (16.4%).
The District
contribution to the salaried insured benefits budget is included in the 2008 Requested
Budget.

B.

Exclusion of January 2007 Data from the 2007 Performance Indicator Report
It is recommended by the Financial/Administration Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the exclusion of January 2007 data from the 2007 Performance
Indicator Report.

C.

Free Rides for Members of the Military
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that free rides on
RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should be extended from the
presently approved date of December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008. Utilization has
been minimal to date and this extension will have minimal impact on RTD.

D.

Approval of January 2008 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the January 13, 2008 Service Change package as revised and
summarized on Attachment A resulting in a net annual savings of approximately
$108,100, and, further, to authorize the General Manager to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these
changes.

E.

IX.

Award Contract to provide and install Fuel & Fluid Management and Vehicle Data
Acquisition Systems
It is recommended by the Operations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to award a contract to S&A Systems, Inc. (Fleetwatch)
of Rockwall, Texas, a RTD certified SBE, the low cost, most responsive, responsible
and qualified proposer for the purchase of the Fuel & Fluid Management and Vehicle
Data Acquisition Systems (“Systems”) to be installed in RTD bus maintenance facilities
and buses. The Systems are comprised of sensors and controllers, which automatically
collect the vehicle number and mileage, control and report the flow of fuel and
consumable fluids (engine oil, antifreeze, etc) into the buses. The Systems also collect
bus operating and diagnostic data generated by bus components such as engines and
transmissions. The collected data will be sent to the new Maximus maintenance
reporting system to generate preventive maintenance actions. The total cost for the
project is $669,500. The funding for this contract is approved and available in the
District’s 2007 Capital Budget.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
F.

Purchase twenty-five 40 foot and thirteen 30 foot ultra-low sulfur diesel heavy duty
transit buses and five hybrid 40 heavy duty transit buses
It is recommended by the Operations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to exercise the option included in Contract 13DK005
with Gillig Corporation for 25 heavy duty ultra-low sulfur diesel low-floor 40 foot
transit buses, 13 heavy duty ultra-low sulfur diesel low-floor 30 foot transit buses
and 5 heavy duty 40 foot hybrid low-floor transit buses at a total cost not to
exceed $14,852,436. It is also recommended that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to transfer $1,090,285 from the Transit
Development Reserve Fund to cover the increased cost for the 5 heavy duty lowfloor 40 foot transit buses. With the approved transfer from the Transit
Development Reserve Fund, funding for the purchase of these buses will be
available in the 2007 amended capital and expense budget. It is also recommended
that the District continue to seek additional funding sources for the purchase of
additional hybrid buses.

G.

Northwest Rail Technology Recommendation
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve Diesel Multiple Units (DMU) as the preferred technology for the
Northwest Rail Corridor Environmental Evaluation.

Directors approve the preferred alternative for the North Metro Draft Environmental
Impact Statement (DEIS). The preferred Alternative for the North Metro includes
evaluating four “Build” alignments in the DEIS in the southern piece of the corridor
around Sand Creek Junction. The DEIS will also evaluate 18 station options for 8
stations along the corridor. The technology is Diesel Multiple Units.
