DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Incorporation of Land Acknowledgement During Monthly
Board Meetings

Committee Meeting Date:
July 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
July 20, 2021

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to incorporate a Land Acknowledgement during its monthly Board Meetings.
BOARD REPRESENTATIVE
Chair Rivera-Malpiede
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
According to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian, “land acknowledgment is a
traditional custom that dates back centuries in many Native nations and communities. Today, land
acknowledgments are used by Native Peoples and non-Natives to recognize Indigenous Peoples who are
the original stewards of the lands on which we now live.”
DISCUSSION
By adopting this recommended action, the Board acknowledges its intent to include a Land
Acknowledgement at the beginning of each monthly Board Meeting, immediately following the Pledge of
Allegiance in the order of business, in order to:
•

Honor the many indigenous peoples who have made the land now known as “Colorado”
home, from the time long before its establishment as a state to the present day;

•

Protect the history and heritage of Colorado’s indigenous peoples by recognizing them as
the traditional stewards of the land now served by the Regional Transportation District;

•

Begin to right the wrongs of the past by acknowledging the exclusions and erasures that
have been visited upon indigenous peoples.

The text of the land acknowledgement is as follows, though the Chair of the Board may choose to revise
this text from time to time as appropriate:
The RTD Board of Directors acknowledges that the land on which our buses and trains
operate is the traditional territory of the Ute, Cheyenne, Arapaho and other contemporary
tribal nations that are historically tied to these lands. We honor our Indigenous elders who
have traveled, inhabited, and stewarded these mountains, hills, and plains throughout
generations. May this acknowledgment demonstrate a commitment to working to dismantle
the ongoing legacies of inequity of the native and all historically oppressed peoples, and
recognize their current and future contributions in the district as we move forward.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
September 2021 Proposed Service Change

Committee Meeting Date:
July 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
July 20, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors approve the September 2021 Service Change package as revised and
summarized in Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager or her designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Acting Senior Manager of Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargain Agreement
shared between RTD and ATU 1001, the September Service Change Proposal facilitates both an
opportunity for RTD bus and rail operators to vote new work assignments and the opportunity for
Service Development staff to make adjustments to the operations plan for RTD’s transit network. A vital
part of the development of the service plan, involves stakeholder and customer input processes. The
stakeholder listening phase is in addition to the public listening phase, which will begin this month as
part of the September service change process. Both the stakeholder feedback and customer input will
help inform RTD’s future service plans.
DISCUSSION
With public health restrictions on building capacity and public gatherings lifting there has been an
increase in requests for a return to normal service levels. Though current ridership levels indicate modest
increases, the return to school and work planned for the September 2021 timeframe support the need
for increased commuter service. The proposals herein, contain a mix of service enhancements and
adjustments that address commuter/school service patterns and contract compliance, leveraging the
resources previously dedicated to supporting social distancing.
It is intended that the proposed service changes to the current COVID 19 service plan be adopted as
further modification to the initial COVID service plan implemented April 19, 2020 and modified in both
January and June of 2021. The route services contained in this proposal are a mix of formerly
suspended commuter routes and routes with educational institutions as major ridership generators. The
projected school attendance and the number of requests received for additional commuter services align
this proposal with RTD’s service guidelines.

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.2

The Board adopted guidance for proposed service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected customers;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Given the current economic conditions due to the COVID induced economic slowdown, the overarching
guidance for the proposed September 2021 service changes come from the Board adopted guidance for
COVID-19 Budget Reductions, especially Principle number three (3):
“We will prioritize mobility for people who must depend on transit during the pandemic: we will strive to
maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services to
access essential jobs and their necessities, while also keeping our community activity centers
appropriately connected.”
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
There were 3 public meetings conducted virtually via Microsoft Teams on June 28, July 1 and July 7
with 138 public participants. These meetings have been recorded and are available for review.

report.

We are keeping track of current ridership and the increase that is occurring as people are returning

For the J bus I'm commuting to town more now and the J would greatly help my
commute since I wouldn't have to do a transfer when travelling from Gunbarrel to East
Boulder (38th and Arapahoe). With all the CU students coming back in the fall (as
mentioned earlier) who could use the J, I wonder how long you anticipate the COVID-19
Service Change to be in place? Could an exception be made for the J (since it's a limited
route and not too much impact on RTD resources)? This helps commuters from
Longmont and Gunbarrel to East Boulder.

Route GS; we have demand from pre-COVID19 as well as are aware of the schools and other
businesses in Boulder going back to in-class and/or in-office work schedules; hence we can assume
an anticipated demand.

Hi Elaine - that depends on what 100% increase is - is it from 1 to 2 or from 25 to 50? , so it depends
on more specifics and of course on the resources we have at hand to as best as possible meet the
demand from all through the district.

per Union Agreement the next service change would be in January 2022; we will monitor and then

Regarding the GS bus: at the beginning of the pandemic you reduced it to a couple of runs in the am
and a couple in the pm. Could you please at least do that in September? So many people in our

[5:43 PM] Nataly Handlos
Thank you for your input in regard to Route GS. We are monitoring the demand and keeping an eye
on which businesses/schools etc. are going back to 'in-office' or 'in-classroom'. The more
information you can give us about what your offices/businesses/schools basic demands might be as
of September 2021, the better we can evaluate what service might be warranted. If you could also
tell us what trip times would be of most purpose, as well as how many days per week, that would be
of help also. Thank you.

we know what the demand was pre-COVID19, so have an idea as to what the demand would be, if
everything were to return to 'all normal per pre-COVID19'; the more information we can get from
our customers, such as yourself, as to what the demand might be come September (see my post
above), the better we can calculate what the need/demand might be; we are also in touch with the
communities and school districts to get a better idea as to who/ how many people are expected

SERVICE CHANGE COMMENTS SUMMARY
The summary highlights the increased frustration of the unsatisfactory service provided by
RTD.

To present information on complaints received about RTD proposed September Service changes.
Use the feedback to improve services.

KEY POINTS:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

People do not find their complaints are acknowledged. They want service to return to
the pre-COVID schedule. Reinstate discontinued and suspended routes.
Service Planning and Scheduling received more than 280 complaints about the
proposed September Change.
The complainants reflect on their general dissatisfaction with RTD, particularly with
the COVID service changes.
Many complaints include Service Planning Concerns such as part of their routes being
full or discontinued, and bus stop placement of suspended/discontinued routes.
People find the current Saturday and Sunday schedule unacceptable, especially for
workers who work late nights. Several have called to have later departure times in the
schedules. As well as requests for earlier departures.
Complaints are often related to many issues or concerns about the COVID Service Plan.
The lack of frequency of the buses and trains. Complainants cite issues about
returning to work while RTD services remain scarce.
Parents are concerned about the lack of available public transit options for students.
Fares are a component of many complaints. Complainants associate COVID service plan
as a factor to increase expenses. They cite the lack of frequency should equal a
decrease in fares. If they must wait hours to board due limited services, then the fares
are absurd.
People will soon be returning to work and school. Passengers are skeptical of the
efficiency of using RTD given current challenges.

MOST FREQUENT REQUESTS:
•
•
•
•
•

Over 60 requests were received for the return of the GS.
The complainants expressed the need for pre-covid schedules to return.
Many complaints include Service Planning Concerns such as reinstating routes (C and
F), scheduling later times for events, and adding cars for events. The consensus is
providing more reliable service.
Regular requests were received to reinstate the 205 to the Heatherwood loop and the
NB. Route 21 to continue to Federal Station. Also, for the return of the 116x, Free
Metro Ride, the FF branches (FF2 – FF7), the Y, P, 122x, Dash, 225, 10, CV, and EV.
Riders would like to see better connection amongst buses and trains.

There was an RTD

said there was no
more E-line trains
going Sought to
Arapahoe where
we needed to go.
Then we took a the Closed Standard KDoub

because this is a

there is more

Austin Ward
220 Summit Blvd. Unit 220
Broomfield, CO 80021

Board of Directors
1660 Blake Street
Denver, CO 80202
Dear board members and CEO Debra Johnson,
My name is Austin Ward I am a current RTD operator out of the Boulder Division, a
graduate from CU Boulder, a former candidate to represent District I, and I am a transit
advocate. With COVID-19 restrictions being lifted, vaccination rates increasing in the Denver
region, and people beginning to return to a version of life as we knew prior to this public health
crisis, I am delighted to see that some routes are getting increased service levels. While the
return to some level of pre-pandemic frequency on the SKIP, JUMP, BOLT, and 225 is critical,
service and planning is ignoring other routes that are just as critical to the Northwest region.
The University of Colorado Boulder will be returning to mostly in person classes this fall
(at least 95% of learning will occur in person) and will see and the largest incoming freshman
class in their history, between 6,500 and 8,000 students. I have heard that the number will be
closer to 8,000. The return of students will also mean a return of hundreds of employees
ranging from professors and dining hall staff to janitors and facility maintenance personnel.
Many of these employees do not use the services that are scheduled for frequency increases
because they live in areas that are not served by the SKIP, BOLT, DASH, 225, 204, and 206.
Many commute along the US 36 corridor from Broomfield, Westminster, and Denver,
Lakewood/Golden, or the eastern and northern parts of Longmont not serviced by the BOLT.
FF1 service needs to be restored to pre-pandemic levels, while FF2, FF4, GS, and J routes need
to be reinstated.
RTD’s mission is to “meet our constituents’ present and future public transit needs by
providing safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective service throughout the
District”. Part of our responsibility is to anticipate where service will be needed. While I strongly
support the use of data collected from our automatic passenger count systems (APC) to assist in
determining service levels, those numbers serve no purpose for routes that are not even
running or when a large increase in ridership will occur within a short period of time. Common
sense and an analysis of historical ridership data (pre-pandemic) would be far more helpful in
this situation. I have driven each of these routes and can attest that the ridership consists
predominantly of students and/or faculty. Should RTD not return these routes, we will have
failed to meet our mission and it will be another mark in the books showing how inept we are
at conducting our own affairs. Public trust is not something we are in excess supply of, and we
should be doing everything our power to regain that trust.

Representative Marjorie Sloan

Dear Representative Sloan,
I am writing this letter in support of reinstating the GS line reconnecting Golden to Boulder. This line was
suspended following the changes in ridership caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and is needed as we move
into a strong recovery. Its return would help Golden commuters move more easily throughout the Front Range
region, provide a connection between the Colorado School of Mines and the University of Colorado Boulder,
and connect residents north of Golden to the metro area through existing RTD routes. The return of the GS line
could help the recovery in the foothills.
The City of Golden has prioritized developing multi-modal transportation options in our Strategic Action Plan
and Transportation Master Plan. The GS line helps the City achieve its goals of having a variety of transit
options. Currently without the GS line, there is no transit connection between Golden and Boulder. The GS line
helps reduce commuter traffic along a busy highway and provides options for individuals without vehicles. The
GS line would increase alternative means of mobility and reduce the environmental impact to the region.
Thank you for your consideration of returning the GS Line into service. Expanded transit routes will help
commuters and community members by providing convenient multi-modal options for the Golden community
and broader region. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Sincerely,

Mayor Laura Weinberg

Regional Transportation District Board of Directors
Subject: RTD GS Regional Route – Letter of Support for Service Return
Dear Ms. Marjorie Sloan:
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) enthusiastically supports including the RTD GS Regional
Route in the September service additions. NREL has aggressive goals to reduce vehicle commuting trips and
convenient transit service is one of the ways that we can achieve these goals.
Prior to the COVID-19 service reductions, NREL had three RTD routes that stopped adjacent to our campus:
RTD Route 20, 125 and the GS Route. In the Spring 2020, Routes 20 and 125 were discontinued and in
January 2021, the GS Route was discontinued. The closest bus stop is currently the RTD Route 16 stop at
S Golden Road and Moss Street/Research Road (which is more than a quarter mile from our campus
entrance and more than half-mile from our closest building). NREL has continued to invest in the EcoPass for
all employees, we currently have 2,190 active EcoPass card holders.
As we are planning for employees to return to campus, we are receiving numerous calls/emails about when
the GS Route will return to service and how we (NREL) are going to accommodate those staff in the interim.
We have more than 200 employees at NREL that work in Boulder County; many of these staff relied on the
GS Route for one or more days a week and are now left with fewer options to commute to campus. PreCOVID-19, on average 30-35 NREL staff per day used the GS Route to commute to/from NREL. The
discontinuation of the GS Route is a gap in the transit network that served the NREL/Boulder/Golden
community.
We strongly urge you to reconsider adding the RTD GS Route to the September service additions as this
route is critical to our employee commuting needs.
Sincerely,

Nick Haynes
Human Resource Director of Operations and
Acting Chief Human Resource Officer

RE: Question on Important RTD Route for NCAR|UCAR Commuters

Hi Chelsea.
Good to hear from you.
Thank you for your email in regard to the proposed September 2021 service changes and Route GS.
We did receive several requests for Route GS to return, at our first public meeting for the proposed September 2021
service changes, on Monday night as well.
At this time, we are not considering to reinstate Route GS; however, we are monitoring closely as to what the ridership
demand might be, as we move into fall and people returning back into the ‘in-classroom’ and ‘in-office’ environment.
Also, we have to very carefully weigh as to where to apply our resources, as our operator shortage is significant and we
need to address routes which are experiencing overloads and standing room only, before we can reinstate routes which
pre-COVID19 already had low ridership and which also, if reinstated take up a lot of our resources in the AM and PM
peaks (such as Route GS trippers would do). We need to balance equitably, effectively and efficiently for the entire
District as we move forward, with the resources we have at hand.
So, again, we will continue to monitor and should things change to where we are in a position that would allow us to
reinstate route GS, we will see what we can do, to do so, as well as evaluate the level of reinstatement at that time.
Your request has been officially noted and will be added to the public comments for September 2021 proposed service
changes. Feel free to join for the public hearings still to take place and voice your feedback/comments/input in this
regard at either, or both of them, also.
Have a wonderful afternoon.
Cheers.

Subject: Question on Important RTD Route for NCAR|UCAR Commuters
Hello Nataly,
I hope you are doing well!
As I imagine is the case with many employers, UCAR|NCAR is beginning to bring people back to the office.
Because we have historically offered a robust suite of transportation services and benefits to our employees,
many staff are reliant on transit services in order to commute to their office. We were excited to see that RTD is
starting to increase service frequency and bring a few routes back, but as you know, some areas are still
without service. Specifically, the cancellation of the GS route between Golden and Boulder is of major concern
for a group of our employees who relied on that route to get to work.
I'm planning to attend one of the upcoming public meetings that RTD is hosting on service changes, although I
noticed the GS is not on the list of routes being considered for changes. Do you have a sense if the GS has a
chance of coming back in the near future or at all?
Thank you for your help and any information on the GS you can provide!

June 14, 2021
Dear RTD Board of Directors,
As you plan for September 2021 service changes, the Colorado School of Mines (Mines) asks
you to consider the transit needs of our students, faculty, and staff. Emerging from COVID-19
restrictions and beginning our fall semester (August 23, 2021), Mines anticipates a full return to
in-person classes and on-campus living. The demand for transit travel between Golden and
Boulder (through Arvada and to NREL) will definitely increase. However, the GS bus, which
serves the daily needs of the Mines community, has been suspended since implementation of the
RTD COVID-19 Service Plan in April 2020.
Moreover, transportation is our State’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Mines, a topranked research university, is committed to the responsible stewardship of the earth and its
resources and has developed a campus culture of sustainability. Accordingly, it is invested in the
use of alternative transportation. As an example, Mines has long been a participant in the RTD
EcoPass program. Reinstatement of GS bus route can make a major contribution to the reduction
of single-occupancy-vehicle trips along Highway 93.
We thank you for dedication to public transportation in our region and appreciate RTC’s postCOVID-19 budgetary constraints. At this time, we respectfully ask you to work with us in
addressing service on the GS route.

DATE: July 8, 2021
RE: Aug/ Sept 2021 Service Changes

RTD Service Planning Staff,
As always, thank you for the opportunity to comment on the tri-annual service change process, and
thank you for hosting public meetings to receive comments from the public. We were pleased to see
the robust participation at several of the online meetings throughout this process.
We would like to thank RTD for the service that is planned to be restored in the fall of 2021, including
within Boulder County. As our region, state, and country emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic,
people are increasingly returning to the office, school, university, errands, social activities, and all
other destinations in person, which is increasing demand for travel and public transit accordingly.
We are encouraged by the public comments from people seeking to have their bus service restored
so that they can once again resume riding RTD’s services.
We are pleased to see the Aug/Sept runboard change includes additional service in Boulder County,
including the local 200-series (204, 206, 225), the local CTN routes (DASH, JUMP, SKIP) and several
regional routes (BOLT, LD). We are also very appreciative of our recent receipt of a draft IGA for RTD
to co-fund Boulder County and Lyons’ interim transportation service for the Lyons community.
We recognize that RTD is facing a challenging labor shortage, which makes restoring additional
service a difficult balancing act. We would, however, like to highlight several travel needs not
currently met in fall 2021 staff proposal:
•

•

Service to Boulder Junction/Civic Center via FF4
o As multiple constituents noted during public comment, the FF4 served a different
market than the FF1, and relying on the FF1 to serve both greatly increases trip times
for people travelling to either Boulder Junction or Civic Center. We also remain very
concerned about capacity on the FF1 this coming fall, given CU’s anticipated record
enrollment and the continued suspension of other FF branches.
o Restoration of regional transit service to and from the Boulder Junction
neighborhood continues to be a high priority request from Boulder County and the
City of Boulder. Given that this neighborhood continues to tax itself through a special
district to pay for EcoPasses for all residents and employees, it is frustrating that it
will remain unserved by regional transit for the remainder of 2021.

While the Heatherwood extension of the 205 never had outstanding ridership, we
have heard that there is likely to be more demand than ever from BVSD students
seeking to ride from Heatherwood to high school in Boulder.
Early morning service between Nederland and Boulder via the NB
o One additional earlier weekday NB trip would allow students and employees who
need to be at school or work by 8am to ride the NB route, which would also increase
afternoon/ PM ridership in a market where all residents have EcoPasses.
Service between Boulder and Golden/Lakewood via GS
o As multiple constituents have noted in public comment, this was a long-standing
route that provided a crucial connection for both Boulder County residents working
at NREL, the Federal Center, and other employers, as well as JeffCo residents working
in Boulder. Even limited restoration (a handful of trips in the AM and PM peak)
would be much appreciated.

With RTD’s labor shortage in mind, we encourage RTD to look at creative partnerships that do not
rely on RTD operators for service delivery for as many travel markets as possible. Opportunities for
such partnerships include our requests for restoration of the HOP route funding, co-funding an ondemand service for east Gunbarrel/Heatherwood, and co-funding an expansion of the Ride Free
Lafayette program, all of which would help build back ridership.
We look forward to continuing our work with RTD to serve the travel needs of our community, and
are happy to meet at any time to discuss these requests and ideas in further detail.
