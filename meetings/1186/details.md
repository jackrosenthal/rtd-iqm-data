## IV. Retiree Awards

There was no one present for retiree awards.  However, the Board congratulated David Maestas for his 23 years as a bus operator.

## V. Public Participation

Chair Anderson shared that we had planned to have a special performance by the Sound Wave Signing Choir, a nonprofit youth group that works with people with hearing disabilities.  They had a last minute change.

Bruce Benson, President of the University of Colorado (CU), spoke in favor of the I-225 alignment change.  He stated this change is critical to the future of the Anschutz campus which includes the Fitzsimons Redevelopment Authority, the Children’s Hospital and the University of Colorado Hospital. Mr. Benson stated he understands RTD’s concern about not wanting to provide additional monies to fund this alignment change.  He stated that CU is committed to providing shuttle service on the campus and RTD will not have to spend over and beyond what has already been budgeted on the I-225 project.   Mr. Benson provided talking points and a letter which was sent to the campus leadership outlining the need for change.  A copy of those two letters can be found in the Board office file for the June 25, 2013 Board meeting.

Honorable Mayor Steve Hogan of Aurora also stated the City’s support for the I-225 alignment change. He shared this was a difficult decision with lots of questions but not necessarily all of the answers. The City and RTD have evaluated this request and are in support of this change.  The City of Aurora is committed to working with the RTD staff to make sure these changes bring about operational improvements.  We believe it will allow the system to run at higher speeds along Colfax to Peoria; this will also allow better management of the construction traffic, as the City cannot absorb having simultaneous construction for street and light rail maintenance.

John Torres, representing the Golden West Retirement Community in Boulder, spoke about the negative effect that changing the 209G route near the center will have on the senior citizens.  The average age of the residents is 84 and they are no longer able to drive.  He explained that the impact of the change in route to them will leave the seniors without transportation options.  He stated he had a petition from 151 residents.  He also stated he had asked how many of them were users of public transit and approximately 40 people indicated they use the service.

Joseph Stukes spoke about the Fitzsimons alignment change proposal.  He stated some of the information about the impact of EMI is overrated at best and that there are other variables such as buildings with solar panels, etc., which can create interference.  He raised the question if the equipment is so sensitive, the noise levels from planes, etc. should create interference.  He talked about the DC levels and how this works.  He believes not all cards have been laid on the table.

Tom Grushka, RTD Watch, posed a number of questions to Chair Anderson around decisions that have been made. He stated the Board needs to learn how to respect people, the public and people with disabilities. He believes his name has been tarnished and he expects more respect from the Board.

Ricky Martinez, Rocky Mountain Reinforcement (RMR), shared his experiences in working for RMR.  He talked about concerns over workers’ safety and stated that he wants to see the RTD lines where RMR is a subcontractor be built with fairness for the workers.

Nghia Nguien from Commerce City asked for help from RTD where he believes RMR has consistently violated the laws. We keep “passing the buck”. Even as RMR worked on the DUS project, they had to pay restitution because of prevailing wages; they were awarded a $10M contract on Eagle P-3.  RTD did some limited compliance checking; the Federal Department of Labor also did some compliance checking and determined that RMR needed to pay each worker an additional $1400.  He has a concern for the I-225 project as well.  RTD cannot continue to take a hands-off approach.  RTD needs to operate with integrity and do the right thing.

Jim Toweill, with the ironworkers of Commerce City, also spoke on the issue of RMR.  RTD has heard but not acted on the concerns.  This is actually RTD’s problem. The problem is not going away.  He hopes that RTD will begin addressing these issues.

Francisco Nunez with the Ironworkers shared his concerns and frustration in working with RMR.  It was very difficult work; the job was dangerous; the company did not worry about safety or fairness to the employees.  He is asking RTD to listen to the workers so their voices can be heard.

Louis Apolinar, RMR, shared what it was like to work for RMR.  They did not provide water for the workers; they did not pay prevailing wages; they verbally abused the workers.

Chair Anderson requested General Manager Washington to provide an update to the Board on this issue.

Doug Grass who lives in Director James’ District expressed that he listens to the media and does not share their perspective about RTD.

Zoe Williams with the 9 to 5 organization, shared that they work with women in low paying jobs.   They have been engaged with the community along the 16L route to understand their challenges of getting to work, school, childcare, etc.  She has worked with Directors Rivera-Malpiede and Menten and appreciates all the hard work that has gone into coming up with a solution.  She thanked the service team staff, especially Rob Rynerson, Jessie Carter and Bruce Abel.  She appreciates the collaboration and believes they have come up with a solution that is workable for this community.

Isatu Friedman spoke about the challenges of getting to work since the 16L was removed.

## VII. General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Update

Director Kent Bagley, Chair of the GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee provided this update.  The committee had met last Tuesday, June 18, 2013 to discuss the 4 key items for focus that came from the1Q’2013 GM survey comments.  The committee members are Directors Bagley, Daly, Lasater, Rivera-Malpiede, Solano and Tobiassen.  Other Board members in attendance included Directors Deadwyler, Folska, Lubow, Hoy and Chair Anderson.  This was a very robust discussion.  They also started the discussion on the 5 strategic goals from the March 2 strategic planning session that will be part of the General Manager’s tactical plans.  Lots of questions and comments were provided.

The next step will be a committee meeting on July 9 at 3:30 p.m.  The strategic goals drive the 2014 budget and the GM will take his tactical plans to implement the goals and transfer them to the performance review form that is used by the rest of the agency. These goals become his task goals for 2014.  Some of the input provided by Board members will be reviewed to see if it can be incorporated into the task or core goals.  If there is any budgetary impact, it will be brought back to the full Board for consideration.  The GM 2014 goals will be approved by the full Board at the July 16, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Bagley thanked all of the Board members who participated in this discussion.

## IX. Chair's Report

Chair Anderson shared that she and Director Rivera-Malpiede had attended the APTA Rail conference, where she participated in a discussion on elected boards versus appointed boards.  There are only three elected boards in the country.

Chair Anderson shared that on June 5, Director Hoy represented the Board at the North Metro golf outing.

Chair Anderson shared that in May & June, RTD celebrated Accident Free Days.  Safety is the number one priority for RTD and as stated by General Manager Washington, it is a good day when we can transport our customers safely to and from their destination.

Three Board members, Directors Folska, Rivera-Malpiede and Tobiassen attended the Armed Services Luncheon.

On June 19, we had our first town hall meeting on the Northwest Mobility Study.  We reached out to over 48,000 people with response from 5,300.  However, due to an error in transposing the call-in number, some of the key people were not able to dial in.  We have scheduled another town hall for Thursday, June 27 to hopefully capture some of these people.

Director Deadwyler, along with our public information staff manned a RTD booth at the Juneteenth festival.  Approximately 300 people visited the booth.

Director Walker and eight of the CDOT Commissioners took a tour of Denver Union Station.  This was a great tour and the Commissioners were amazed at the transformation that is taking place around the Denver Union Station.

Director Lasater will host a town hall meeting in Parker on June 26 to provide an update on RTD.

## X. General Manager's Report

General Manager Washington reported that he had participated in the Transportation Research Board (TRB) and the Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) Oversight and Project Section (TOPS) Committees from June 20-22, 2013. The TRB is a national organization of scientists engaged in various research topics.  This was a very productive meeting.  One of the items they looked at was fuel and fuel alternatives.  TOPS select projects which will be researched.  GM Washington sits on the TRB Executive Committee.  They have produced national documents around subjects like freight, aviation and transportation maintenance.

On Wednesday, June 26, RTD will have a day-long FTA quarterly review.  They will go through everything on items or contracts that have federal funds.

On June 27, 2013, the General Manager will host his annual RTD Employee Awards Recognition event.  This is an event where we recognize employees for their achievements and contribution either individually or as a team.  RTD is honored to have such a high performance group of employees.  This is another aspect of how we invest in human capital.

The FTA final drug and alcohol audit report for RTD went well and no deficiencies were found.

Staff plans to release the Request for Proposal (RFP) for North Metro on June 28.  They are hoping for a NTP before the end of the year.  The SBE/DBE office had a special meeting yesterday where they sought input and suggestions from the SBE community.  This was well attended.

As stated by the Chair, we had the first town hall meeting on Wednesday, June 19 for the Northwest Mobility Study.  Unfortunately, we had a problem with the call-in number so we have scheduled another one for this Thursday.  We are moving forward on this study and we are interested in hearing from our public about this issue.

Before we open up any rail line, we stand up our activation team about 2 years out.  We hope in the next couple of weeks to tell the Board about our projected opening date for DUS.

Director Rivera-Malpiede commented on the DBEAC meeting for SBEs that was referenced earlier.  She stated it was well-attended and had good participation and good questions and comments.  We had a cross-representation of the community.  She thinks Helga Grunerad is doing a good job as co-chair of DBEAC.

Director Menten inquired for more information concerning RMR.  She would like information on the restitutions that were discussed during public participation.

## XI. Public Hearing for 2013 Amended Budget

Chair Anderson opened up the public hearing on the 2013 amended budget at 6:35 p.m.  After reading the script, she asked if there was anyone in the audience who would like to speak directly to the 2013 amended budget.

Tom Grushka stated that he has a concern that previous budgets have allowed funds for staff and Board members to travel to conferences and conduct the strategic planning retreat that they held in March.  He thinks this is a poor use of taxpayers’ funds and no more trips should be taken from this budget.  He also thinks this should be an itemized item on the budget.

### A. 2013-007 : Approval of 2013 Amended Budget

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2013 to amend and appropriate funds for the proposed 2013 Amended Budget, to increase the appropriation by $13.302 million to $1,584.563 million as detailed below in the overview of the 2013 Amended Budget, and to decrease the appropriation of Capital Carryforward (previously approved capital funds) by $247.879 million to $1,003.434 million due to primarily planned expenditures.

### B. 2013 - 008 : North Metro Segment 2, Phase 1 Commuter Rail Project Property Acquisition

RECOMMENDED ACTION

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the North Metro Segment 2 (Stock Show to 72nd Avenue), Phase 1 Commuter Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law and to provide the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts necessary to consummate real property transactions.

##### a. North Metro Segment 2 Phase 1 attachment

### C. Easement for Brainard Drive Relocation Project

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all documents necessary to convey a non-exclusive drainage easement over 10,881 square feet (0.249 acres), more or less in Section 28, Township 1 South, Range 69 West, City and County of Broomfield, State of Colorado.

##### a. US 36 Brainard Drive Relocation final

##### b. FasTracks US 36 Brainard Drive Detail final

##### c. Brainard Drive PE -1 Signed 3-4-2013

### D. State Legislative Liaison Services Contract

It is recommended by the Regional Transportation District’s Executive Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into Contract No. 13DX001 with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs, which is an agreement for state legislative liaison services for one year (July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014) at a cost of $107,000 and four (4) additional one-year options to renew at prices specified in the Contract, each option period contingent upon approval by the Board of Directors.

### E. Approval of I-225 Alignment Changes

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors approve a change in alignment and station location on the I-225 corridor.  This change would move the alignment along Montview Avenue at the Anschutz/ Fitzsimons Medical Campus to a new alignment in the general vicinity along Fitzsimons Parkway.  The station location will also change from Montview to along Fitzsimons Parkway.  The exact location will be defined as part of a collaborative effort with the City of Aurora, the University of Colorado stakeholders as well as public input, and also to include a transportation plan that will accommodate the needs of persons who are transit dependent to access the Anschutz Campus.  A general depiction of the changes is shown in Exhibit 1.

All changes will be made within the originally approved I-225 Project budget.

Motion:              Director Deadwyler made the motion to approve the I-225 alignment changes.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:                General Manager Washington outlined some of the elements of concern for the proposed I-225 alignment:

1)      Shuttle—He referred to the comments (and talking points) from CU President Benson regarding CU’s commitment to create and fund a shuttle for the Anschutz campus.

2)      Execute within I-225 budget—General Manager stated they have put the item to not exceed the I-225 budget into the Recommended Action.  He feels the RTD track record should speak for itself in terms of bringing in projects on time and within budget.  He asked the Board to trust staff in this delivery.

3)      Environmental re-evaluation—Staff has provided a statement to the Board which outlines their plan to perform a re-evaluation.  This has identified timelines to perform this work.

4)      Effect on wildlife—This question was asked and they have responded this will not have an effect on wildlife.

5)      What did CU know regarding EMI—As CU President Benson noted, they had some previous discussions about EMI but this unsolicited proposal came sooner than they had expected and the aggressive posture of RTD took them by surprise.

6)      Reconstruction of Montview—The first bullet by CU President Benson indicated they do not have funding to reconstruct Montview.

7)      The Mayor of Aurora indicated there are some operational benefits in moving this alignment.

8)      Mitigation will create delay—Staff estimates for every month of delay, there is an associated $1.5-2M loss.

Staff has provided their recommendation to change this alignment and continue the momentum that has been started on the FasTracks program.  A no vote on this issue will stalemate progress.

Director Hoy stated he is as excited as everyone else about this project.  We are building trains.  He recalls a few short months ago when CU President Benson stood before the Board and encouraged the building of trains. This happened in August and here we are being asked to make a significant change and no one can tell us the cost.  We only have a promise it will not exceed our budget.  He would like the Board to consider changing the language to read “…All changes will be made within the originally approved I-225 contract.”

Director Solano commented we were changing horses in the middle of the stream.  He wants his corridor finalized. We should have seen these issues before now.  We should not be putting the cart before the horse.  He will support the motion.

Director Lasater stated that in his 17+ years as an elected official, he has never seen such turbulence as was created by this last minute change.  There is a lot of analyzing and missing information.  In the words of an old farmer, it does not matter how much air freshener you spray around; if it is a pig, it still stinks.  His understanding is CU initially wanted Montview. Other people favored Fitzsimons Parkway but there was concern over parking.  In his estimation, CU was caught off guard.  As it says in the bio about CU, this is a preeminent research center.  Yet somehow, they failed to do their own research. There is a plethora of information available about EMI if one cares to do the research. Logically, it makes more sense to run the alignment up Fitzsimons Parkway.  He is concerned about how all this came down but in the end, for the greater good, he will vote for the alignment change. He wants to make sure that RTD does not get caught with the alignment change costs.

Director Lubow commented she can live with either alignment.  She would like to see cost protection around this issue. She referenced the environment memo which talked about Phase 2 and used the term “it is unlikely.” She is not clear on what that means and mistrusts the use of this word.  Rick Clarke commented that we can do the evaluation up to a certain point.  They plan to present to the Board in November but they still have final design of the alignment as well as identifying the exact location for the station.  Only after some of this work is done can they give greater assurances.  Director Lubow inquired as to whether construction happen after the re-evaluation is complete.  General Manager Washington responded that anything over project budget will come back to the Board for approval.  We have never had to do this.  This has led to the success of this agency.  Credence goes to the RTD track record.  The safeguard we can provide is to come back to the Board for additional funding.

Director Rivera-Malpiede stated she has had the chance to tour the new proposed line and feels things will move more smoothly for her.  This could actually be an asset for the NE community.  However, she would like to see some language added under “…to include a transportation plan and implementation plan that will accommodate the needs of persons who are transit dependent to access the Anschutz Campus….”

Director Folska stated this is all good and interesting conversation.  She asked what the new revised estimates for ridership were for this alignment change.  Rick Clarke responded they have only preliminary data but estimate an approximate 5% drop with this new alignment.  This has not factored in any new development or station planning.  They are assuming more people might be interested in riding because of higher speed.  Director Folska complimented the team for all of their hard work.

Director Walker asked if we have any written contract agreements with partners regarding this alignment.  There is about 30% of the engineering on Montview completed.  Rick Clarke indicated they had asked Kiewit to stop some of their design work pending these changes.  Director Walker commented he will be supporting this motion.  He also does not feel an amendment to change the word budget to contract is needed nor does he want to tie the hands of a 3rd party on something we cannot control; for these reasons he will not approve the implementation plan request.

Director Sisk thanked staff and the City of Aurora for responding so quickly.  This is big time. Since we talked about needing ten votes for this to pass two weeks ago, people have been asking the tough questions.  There is a question of economics.  He is concerned that RTD will have to use our contingency fund for this issue.  He is OK with the understanding that if an excessive amount is required, staff will come back to the Board.  There is no need for micromanagement.  However, whatever precedent gets set by this, he wants us to keep the same standard for other corridors.

Director James thanked staff and the Directors for these well thought out discussions.  He is familiar with the area and likes the commitment from CU; he thinks it is adequate.  The change can be good.  He questions the need for an amendment to change budget to contract; he also does not feel we need to tie their hands with an implementation plan.  All things considered, he will vote in favor of the alignment.

Director Deadwyler read these remarks into the record:

As the Board member for District B, which includes the Anschutz and Fitzsimons Campus, I have been in a dilemma ever since staff brought the proposal to change the I-225 alignment along Montview to another site along Fitzsimons Parkway before this Board.  I say a dilemma because on one hand, I well understand the strategic and economic importance of CU Anschutz campus as one of the largest employers in this region, but I can also empathize with constituents who are concerned about connectivity and mobility access to the other facilities on that campus such as the Veterans, Children’s and University Hospitals. I have given this a lot of thought including taking several tours of the current alignment and future alignment if this proposal is approved. I can see both the challenges and benefits of either position.

When I was elected to this Board, I was elected to represent a constituency base who felt their voices were not being heard. It is important to me that whatever decision we make, we remain true to our mission.  To meet our constituents present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible and cost effective service throughout the district.  Here the operative word is Accessible.  As I toured the routes with Director Tobiassen, I acquired a greater understanding of access options that are being planned by CU and how the newly proposed route along Fitzsimons Parkway can open up even more access for future community and development use. There are currently over 22,000 employees and residents and in the future build out of the area, that number is expected to grow to over 50,000. I believe this focus includes accessibility and I trust that the transportation plan under consideration will be totally inclusive across the full campus environment, as well as providing more accessibility to North Aurora. I am trusting CU to deliver on their promise to provide shuttle access on the campus without additional cost to RTD. While there are many questions that remain unanswered as it relates to CU, I also believe that supporting this proposal for an alignment change will be a win-win not only for my constituency base but also for the region as a whole.

I therefore will be supporting this proposed change to the I-225 alignment.

Director Bagley commented this is an issue of trust for the staff.  He trusts staff based on their history with other corridors.  This is an issue with our partners.  All of us are in this together.  From his previous experience as Planning Director for the City of Aurora as well as a neighborhood planner for the area north of I-225, he is intimately familiar with the area.  He has no doubt the EA will be done and speeds will pick up due to the shorter distances.  This will have a big impact on ridership and he will approve as it stands.

Chair Anderson stated it is all about the partnership. She has worked on transit issues for a number of years. Partnerships are very important. It is a give and take between the RTD staff and the staff of the City of Aurora. She is satisfied with the motion as it is.  We need to give the people who are involved a chance to work out the details without restrictions by the RTD Board. The budget is most appropriate. She is concerned about changing the word to contract.  This is a partnership.  We need to leave the wording as is.

Director Hoy stated that we have had a good relationship with the City of Aurora.  He has some discomfort with our stakeholder, CU, who has made this big alignment change request but is not willing to come up with the finances to help if this increases our cost.  He will make an amendment to the motion.

Primary Amendment 1

To the Main Motion:              Director Hoy made the motion to amend the main motion as follows:”…The exact location will be defined as part of a collaborative effort with the City of Aurora, the University of Colorado stakeholders as well as public input, and also to include implementation of a transportation plan whose cost shall not be paid for by RTD and will accommodate the needs of persons who are transit dependent to access the Anschutz campus.  A general depiction of the changes is shown in Exhibit 1.  All changes will be made within the originally approved I-225 contract.”

Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Walker stated we cannot require a 3rd party to pay for something.  We need to trust our partners.  He cannot support this amendment.

Director Rivera-Malpiede stated she understands some of the comments made and withdraws her implementation plan request.  She does want Anschutz to provide a shuttle.

Point of Order:  Legal Counsel Rolf Asphaug explained Director Rivera-Malpiede could not withdraw her request in this form.

Director Tobiassen commented this is why we pay staff to negotiate and do what they do.  We need to press on.  There will be other challenges on this and any other construction.

Director Lasater expressed concern that in the end, this will fall on the back of RTD.  The public will not go to CU or the City of Aurora demanding shuttle service.  They will come to RTD demanding we provide this service. At a minimum, we need some form of IGA with CU stating their commitment.

Director Daly stated he will support the staff.  He has trust in the staff.

Rick Clarke made several comments.  If this gets tied to a contract, there can be numerous delays in the project as staff will have to come back to the Board numerous times.  Each time could put a delay of 30 days into the process.  Right now, the contractors are willing to work with staff but there will be some hesitation if they know every item needs to be approved by the Board. When he looks at the number of sequential changes this will require, at a minimum he can see six separate times they will have to come back to the Board.  He is concerned about what this amendment can do to the schedule.  General Manager Washington added that RTD will be left holding the bag.  Another way to look at this is if the Board approves the change in alignment, they may be applauded for their vision when  new development comes with along the new alignment.

Director Sisk called for the question.

##### a. June 2013 Letter to RTD re Montview 5 28 13 (2)

##### b. I-225 Fitzsimons Previous and Re-route final

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors approve a change in alignment and station location on the I-225 corridor.  This change would move the alignment along Montview Avenue at the Anschutz/ Fitzsimons Medical Campus to a new alignment in the general vicinity along Fitzsimons Parkway.  The station location will also change from Montview to along Fitzsimons Parkway.  The exact location will be defined as part of a collaborative effort with the City of Aurora, the University of Colorado stakeholders as well as public input, and also to include a transportation plan that will accommodate the needs of persons who are transit dependent to access the Anschutz Campus.  A general depiction of the changes is shown in Exhibit 1.

All changes will be made within the originally approved I-225 Project budget.

### F. Board Report August 2013 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the proposed August 2013 Service Change as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost increase of $1,108,900 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose services are impacted by these changes.

Motion for a

Recess:              Director Lasater requested a recess.

Director Sisk seconded.

The Board recessed from 7:55 p.m. to 8:05 p.m.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to approve item F, August 2013 Service Changes.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:               AGM Bruce Abel shared with the Board that staff had indicated they were working on the issue of the 16L and would bring any changes back to the Board if they could reach an agreement prior to the approval of this action.  He is happy to inform the Board that his staff, along with Directors Rivera-Malpiede and Menten had worked with the 9 to 5 organization and other organizations in the area to arrive at an agreement. This additional recommendation was included in their packet for tonight but he wanted to make sure everyone understands this change.  The essence of it will be to reinstate the 16L.  The proposed changes to expand the 16 will not occur so the net result is a wash.  The 16 bus will be an articulated bus to handle the large volume of users; the 16L will run during the week, but on weekends and nights, the 16 will be expanded to go into Golden.  Because of this change, they will have to fine-tune the route 100W on Quail/Simms streets.

Director Rivera-Malpiede applauded the team for this collaborative effort.  This was an example of the community coming forward and being adamant about their bus service.  This is her district and represents the transit dependent who must rely on public transportation.  The staff did a yeomen job in turning this around so quickly and she thanks Rob Rynerson, Jessie Carter and Bruce Abel for their hard work.

Director Daly echoed his thanks to the team for their flexibility on this change.  He asked for clarification on where the articulated bus would be.  Bruce Abel replied the route 16.

Director Tobiassen echoed the thanks.  He asked Jessie Carter to clarify the change that was being made to route 130.

Director Walker echoed the thanks on staff’s responsiveness.

Director Sisk asked for a stay of execution for the residents on route 209G.  We need to keep this route in place.

Motion:              Director Folska made a motion to keep route 209G in place until the next planning cycle for service changes.  We should be able to evaluate the use during this period.

Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Chair Anderson asked if anyone on the Board had an exception.  Seeing none, this change to retain the route 209G as is was amended to the action item.

Vote on Motion:              The motion passed 15 in favor and 0 against.

Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

(Formerly ACS Transportation Solutions, Inc.). The total new contract not-to-exceed amount, for contract # 19FH005, is $17,381,470.23.

Motion:              Director Sisk made the motion to approve item G, approval for increase in contract not-to-exceed amount for the Smart Card program.

Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Deadwyler expressed concern over the amount of items staff purchases and discards.  She stated with the technological changes occurring so fast she is reluctant to approve the purchase of equipment for spares.  She stated we have a lot of equipment and software that has not been used and is hanging around somewhere.

Director Menten asked if we have equipment sitting in warehouses and where.  Bruce Abel indicated that we did not and shared that any excess inventory is handled through our auction company.

Vote on the

Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

## XV. New Business

Director Menten requested an update on parking changes.  General Manager Washington said they will look at the calendar to schedule a discussion.

Director Malpiede shared that former Director Cohen has been diagnosed with multiple myeloma and has taken his first chemo treatment.  He is in good spirits and “love rocks”.  A friend of theirs has set up a rotational meal schedule for those who can participate.  There is also a caring bridge website where you can keep up-to-date with his progress.  Matt and his family appreciate all the support and phone calls he has received.  He is determined to get back on his feet.

Director Deadwyler invited the full Board to go with her on a tour of the East corridor.  The construction is coming along and the corridor is making significant progress.

Director Folska asked that when the General Manager initiates his fare taskforce, they may consider looking at the parking structure as well.
