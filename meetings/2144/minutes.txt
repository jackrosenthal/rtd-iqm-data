II. Board Members Attendance at APTA Annual
Chair Kemp turned the meeting over to 1 st Vice-Chair Tayer for discussion of
these items. Director Tayer explained that due to the current Board policy, a
Director serving his last term in office must receive special permission to travel in
the last 6 months of the year. This applies to Chair Kemp and Director McMullen
who are term limited. However, Chair Kemp has been selected as APTA Board
member of the year so it is appropriate that the Executive committee approves his
travel to APTA annual in Seattle to receive his award.
Additionally, since this is a special honor for the RTD District and Board as a
whole, he would like to entertain a motion that would approve not only the travel
for the term limited members but also for any of the other Board members who
may have already attended two conferences as long as they have available funds
in their travel budget.
MOTION: Director Cohen made the
motion to approve the term limited
Directors as well as the other
Directors, who will exceed
attending two conferences as long
as they have available funds in
their budget, to attend the APTA
annual in October, 2012.
Director Malpiede seconded the
motion.

VOTE ON
THE MOTION: The Motion passed.

III. TRB Bus Rapid Transit Conference
1st Vice-Chair Tayer shared that this was a very important conference hosted by
the TRB who are associated with the National Academy of Sciences. This will
provide the Board members who attend a chance to enhance their knowledge of
BRT and help them to make better decisions on this technology. Although Chair
Kemp is term limited, he has a vested interest as a representative of the
Northwest corridor.
Director Bagley added it is important not only for the Northwest Corridor but for
Directors in the SE to understand this new technology. He plans also to attend.
MOTION: Director Bagley made the
motion to approve Chair Kemp to
attend the TRB Bus Rapid Transit
Conference in August, 2012 based
on his capacity as current Chair of
the Board and the importance of
staying informed as a
representative of the US 36
corridor.
The motion was seconded by
Director Malpiede.
VOTE ON
THE MOTION: The Motion passed.
Director Tayer disclosed that should he elect to go to APTA annual, this will be
his 3rd conference as approved in the action above.
A copy of the approval by members of the Executive Committee for travel to
APTA annual and to the TRB conference is located in the Board office.
IV. Other Matters

Director Bagley requested to see the collective Board member’s travel
budget.

General Manager Washington shared that he had met with Mayor McNally
and others related to their concerns on the DRCOG Amendment from RTD
in August and on the prioritization process for projects. He shared the
meeting went well and he believes Mayor McNally understands the
proposed process.

Director Bagley emphasized that RTD will continue to look for other
sources such as grants to fund activities in the unfunded corridors.

Director Cohen stated it is important that we continue this process and
RTD need to remain agile when considering how we prioritize and move
ahead. He anticipates challenges in August when we begin the
prioritization process.

Director Malpiede stated her commitment and willingness to work within
the guidelines of what RTD can do; however, she is not an advocate for
utilizing resources for further exploration of options especially in light of

Summary of the Executive Committee Meeting held on June 21, 2012, at 12:00




the fact that the citizens rejected our proposal and there are no funds that
exists outside of what has been approved for FasTracks.
Director Bagley indicated that he attended the CAC meeting in Aurora.
People are interested in what the impact from this decision is and how it
affects their respective corridors.
Director Tayer shared that as he has attended some of the public
processes in Adams County, tension is running high and a lot of residents
are angry at RTD about what happened. This is a great opportunity to
focus on relationship building.
