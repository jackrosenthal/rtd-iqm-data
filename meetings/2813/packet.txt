Quarterly Performance Report -2nd Quarter
2018

INFORMATION
Please find the RTD Quarterly Performance Report for the 2nd Quarter of 2018 below.
DISCUSSION
The following is an overview of the performance measures of RTD operations for the 2nd Quarter of
2018. Specific information regarding RTD fixed route contracted bus service, Special Service and
Access-A-Ride is contained in a separate report in this month’s board packet.


PREVENTABLE ACCIDENTS
o Bus Operations – RTD Bus Operations met the goal of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle Accidents
per 100,000 miles through the 2nd Quarter of 2018
o Rail Operations – RTD Rail Operations met the goal of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle Accidents
per 100,000 miles through the 2nd Quarter of 2018



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
o Bus Operations – RTD Bus Operations met the goal of ≤ .06 Passenger Accidents per
100,000 miles through the 2nd Quarter of 2018



PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS

Maintenance inspections through the 2nd Quarter of 2018.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE

performance through the 2nd Quarter of 2018. RTD Bus Operations did not meet the goal of
92% on-time performance for on our regional service. Traffic delays, road construction,
service frequency and other delays outside of RTD’s control did impact our ability to meet this
goal. RTD Bus Operations continues to work on strategies to improve reliability on our
regional service.

2nd Quarter of 2018.

While meeting the goal RTD Bus Operations continues to strive to improve service availability
and reliability throughout the District.



MILEAGE BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
o Bus Operations - RTD Bus Operations met the goal of 30,000 miles between lost service road
calls through the 2nd Quarter of 2018.



PASSENGER COMPLAINTS AND COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
o Bus Operations - RTD Bus Operations met the goals of ≤10-day response time to customer
complaints and the .0004 complaints per boarding through the 2nd Quarter of 2018.



RESPONSE TIME TO EMERGENCY DISPATCH CALLS
o Bus Operations - RTD Bus Operations met the goal of ≤20-seconds average response time to
Emergency Dispatch Calls through the 2nd Quarter of 2018.



MAINTAIN BUS OPERATOR/MECHANIC HEADCOUNT WITHIN AUTHORIZATION
o Bus Operations - RTD Bus Operations did not meet goal of ≤ 5.0% vacancy rate in bus
operator positions or the ≤ 7.5% vacancy rate for bus mechanic positions. The competitive
employment market and low unemployment has created a challenge in both
recruiting/retaining. RTD continues our initiatives toward enhancing our recruiting and work
environment. The board approved the new Collective Bargaining Agreement and RTD began
seeing an increase in the number of recruits and in improved retention in the 2nd Quarter of
2018. RTD hired 147 new bus operations through the 2nd Quarter of 2018. There were 108
separations. 17 of those operators retired after 20+ years of service to the District. Six
operators were promoted to other positions in the District; and 13 went to other Union
positions in the District to include becoming rail operators.



ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
- The impact from the new CBA Agreement
 Work condition improvements in the area of increased number of straight runs to
60% on weekdays and 75% on weekends, 13-hour maximum spread time and
improvements in recovery time for operators creates a demand for more operators.
While total service hours for May and August are lower than 2017 – we have 19
additional runs to fill.
 Salary and work environment improvements have improved both recruitment and
retention.
- Mandates
 RTD continues to request volunteers or mandate operators for a sixth day of work
on a consistent basis. The numbers through the 2nd Quarter of 2018 are trending
down from last year – both in the month-to-month and year comparison.
 Special events and bus bridge support do impact our need to mandate.
- Recruiting and Retention
 RTD has experienced an increase in class sizes (new class sized range from 10-20
students per class).
 Since the new pay increase, graduation rates have improved to 90% in bus
operations. HR has improved the screening process and increased applications has
expanded our employee options.
 The number of operators hired to operators separating is the best mid-year number
in recent history.
- Efforts underway to improve workforce stability and continue to reduce service loss
 RTD Operations continues to work with our partners throughout RTD to recruit and
retain employees. RTD staff (operations, communications, and HR) have attended




numerous job fairs and RTD employment promotion events. This included special
events such as Juneteenth, People’s Fair, Pride Fest and various county programs.
RTD maintenance continues to serve as expert advisors to various technical school
boards and conducts recruiting seminars throughout the region.
Retention: Improved pay, work schedules and reduction of mandating has improved
both morale and retention. Continuing commitment to better internal
communication through the following initiatives: Represented employee email;
improved mentor programs; buddy system programs; “Welcome to the Division”
programs for new or transferring staff members; “Behind the Radio” radio
dispatcher visits to the division to meet with employees; improved employee
recognition programs and celebrating success with staff.

Attachment: Service Loss Memo 9 11 18 (3558 : Service Availability 9 11 18)

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.53% of all scheduled hours of
bus service in August 2018. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons showed a
slight decrease for the month of August over the same time last year. The overall year to
date number shows an increase over last year. Details as follows:
August 2018 – 163.00 hours
August 2017 – 774.81 hours
Year to date number 2017 – 2,511.84 hours
Year to date number 2018 - 9,155.01 hours

While RTD did provide in excess of 99.53% of all scheduled hours of service in the
month, it was necessary to cover 2,743 shifts by operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 21,944 hours of service being
provided by a “6th day” RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours
provided by our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev.

ways to continue to improve recruitment and retention among bus operators.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: September 5, 2018

From:

Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations

GM

Date:

September 4, 2018

Board Meeting Date: September 11, 2018

Subject:

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 2nd
Quarter 2018

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the 2nd Quarter of 2018 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 2nd Quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to utilize
bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators.
The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety meetings,
through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles in
the 2nd Quarter. Transdev did not meet the goal but improved to 0.27 Passenger Accidents per
100,000 miles compared to 0.31 during the 1st Quarter. Three of the eleven Passenger
Accidents that occurred through the 2nd Quarter were classified preventable. All of the bus
operators involved in Passenger Accidents were provided retraining on the proper procedures for
boarding and alighting passenger safely. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness
of passenger safety through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of Passenger
Accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance Inspections
completed as scheduled in the 2nd Quarter. Transdev did not meet the goal with 94.6% of
Preventive Maintenance Inspections completed through the 2nd Quarter 2018. Deficiencies were
identified in Transdev’s Preventive Maintenance Inspection (PMI) and Quality Control (QC)
practices. Revised procedures have been implemented to address these issues. Transdev’s PMI
compliance during July 2018 was 100%. Competitive Services staff will continue to monitor the
contractor operations to ensure PMIs are completed on time.

1.C.3



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
Transdev, First Transit Longmont and First Transit Denver met the target of 88% local on-time
service with 87.4%, 89.6% and 86.8% on-time performance in the 2nd Quarter. First Transit
Commerce City (84.4%) did not meet the goal due, in part, to the high number of new operators,
unexpected detours, and traffic. RTD and the private contractors continue to campaign routes
and operators with low on-time performance with a strong focus on first-time point departures.
On a monthly basis contractors review the OTP report and meet with operators of low performing
routes to discuss factors that are impacting their ability to reach 88% on-time performance.
Running time issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, as a group, exceeded the target of 30,000 miles between lost service
maintenance road calls in the 2nd Quarter. Transdev did not meet the goal during the 2nd
Quarter 2018. Deficiencies were identified in Transdev’s Preventive Maintenance Inspection
(PMI) and Quality Control (QC) practices. Revised procedures have been implemented to address
these issues. Competitive Services staff continue to monitor the contractor operations to ensure
Transdev is addressing this area by completing PMIs on-time; working off defects in a timely
manner; monitoring repeat issues; providing additional training for mechanics; and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleet.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
First Transit Longmont met the target of .0004 Complaints per Boarding with .0003 Complaints per
Boarding in the 2nd Quarter. First Transit Denver (.0005), First Transit Commerce City (.0006) and
Transdev (.0007) did not meet the goal. Complaints per Boarding continue to reflect the difficulties
experienced due to operator shortages which resulted in a high number of bus late and bus no show
complaints. The contractors continue to investigate and address customer complaints with operators.
The contractors utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist operators in improving
customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted above regarding on-time performance should help
address some customer complaints. The contractors also continue to address complaint trends with all
operators at monthly safety meetings.
The contractors have implemented bus operator wage increases and continue to take a variety of
additional actions over and above contract requirements to address their operator hiring/retention
challenges which include hiring bonuses, incentives to take on additional work, employing a fulltime recruiter, and mentoring programs.

Subject:

Customer Complaint Analysis - 2nd Quarter
2018

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 2nd Quarter of 2018.
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2017.

Also

As noted in previous reports, over the past few years the implementation and enforcement of a variety
of policies and operating requirements have impacted the number of customer complaints received.
Examples of the policies and operating requirements that have impacted customer complaints include
securement area/priority seating issues, fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability, introduction of
SmartCards and day passes, and changes to bus service associated with the implementation of the
University of Colorado A Line and B Line commuter rail service and the W Line and R Line light rail
service.
Accordingly, based upon recommendations from RTD staff, the Board of Directors has made
modifications to the performance goal for customer complaints to account for these factors. In 2014,
the performance goal was set at .0004 complaints per passenger boarding and has remained at that
level since then.
The “Complaints per Passenger Boarding” for the District as a whole (local bus operations) for the 2nd
Quarter of 2018 was .0005. The “Complaints per Passenger Boarding” for the same period in 2017
was .0004. The RTD operating divisions (Boulder, East Metro and Platte) combined and First Transit
Longmont met the goal for the 2nd Quarter of 2018. First Transit Commerce City, First Transit Denver,
and Transdev did not. The primary generator for increases in customer complaints during this time
period was the lack of operators which led to dropped service and buses running late.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
 Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
 Operator followed proper procedure
 Passenger presented insufficient fare
 Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
 Passenger presented an expired transfer
 Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
 Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
 There was no video evidence to support the complaint
RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.

Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
RTD conducts refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the training
is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings wherein they
discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger interactions.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station the
first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some refreshers on
station procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado Cross Disability Coalition, Colorado
School of the Blind, Atlantis, DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to
improve RTD service for passengers with disabilities.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post commendations
on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of recognition.
RTD increased operator wages effective March 1, 2018, and the Contractors increased operator wages
effective April 1, 2018. Both RTD and the Contractors have seen an increase in applicants and
employee retention. Hopefully, the increases in headcount will help reduce the amount of dropped
service and the associated complaints.

Historically, and in 2018, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:








Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop

All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 2nd Quarter 2018: The complaints in this category increased 77.6% compared to
the same period in 2017. RTD and the private contractors continue to struggle with operator shortages
and the resulting impact on service delivery. RTD and the private contractors are maintaining their focus
on reducing operator vacancies, ensuring timely pull-outs and providing service per published schedules.
The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 9.5 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017
was 5.35 complaints per day.
Bus Early – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category decreased 2.8% compared to the same
period in 2017. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The

Packet Pg. 27

1.C.6

YTD average in this category for 2018 is 4.47 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017
was 4.6 complaints per day.
Bus Late – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 7.6% compared to the same period
in 2017. This category has also been impacted by the operator shortages. However, occasional
improvements to staffing have resulted in periodic improvements in this category. Improving on-time
performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; and service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 7.64 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2017 was 7.09 complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 6.7% compared to
the same period in 2017. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride checks
are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In addition,
RTD and the private contractors have “G-Force Activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam, Smart
Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to
be counseled and retrained, as needed, to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety campaigns
are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 3.68
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017 was 3.45 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 7.0% compared to the
same period in 2017. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 7.72 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2017 was 7.22 complaints per day.
Discrimination – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 26.2% compared to the same
period in 2017 (from 42 complaints to 53 complaints). Investigation into discrimination-related
complaints usually shows the operator not at fault. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 0.29
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017 was 0.23 complaints per day.
Fare Dispute – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category decreased 9.5% compared to the same
period in 2017. The implementation of the new fares and fare equipment presented challenges for some
customers. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The
YTD average in this category for 2018 is 0.94 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017
was 1.04 complaints per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 20.1%
compared to the same period in 2017. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held
at the private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of
RTD passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not
following proper procedures, appropriate coaching activities are taken. The YTD average in this category
for 2018 is 6.96 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017 was 5.8 complaints per day.

Packet Pg. 28

1.C.6

Incorrect Info/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 1.5% compared to
the same period in 2017 (from 65 complaints to 66 complaints). The combined efforts of the General
Superintendent of Transportation, Operations Managers, the Bus Operator Training teams, Street
Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to provide operators with up-to-date information to answer
customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average in the category for 2018 is 0.36
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017 was 0.36 complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 19.7%
compared to the same period in 2017. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop
as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be
waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (93 of the total 2,099 = 4.4%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjusted, as needed, and as resources will
allow. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 11.6 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2017 was 9.69 complaints per day.
Customer Satisfaction Survey
Customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can continue to
improve the quality of service provided. Additionally, the results of the 2014 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(very poor) to 5 (excellent), RTD bus service received high ratings in the following operator-related
categories:








Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
Second Quarter ~ April 1 through June 30, 2018

Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection on-board buses
and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then to issue a citation if
that person is contacted a second time without fare. The chart below shows the actual number of patrons
without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers from month to month may be due
to several factors, including special events or other security security-related incidents.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection

Bus Operations/Bus Stops

The following chart lists the number arrests made on buses by police officers by month. Arrests include citations
issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion. This is an additional advantage to
the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have the authority to check for warrants and
take the appropriate law enforcement action. There have been a total of 406 arrests made on buses in 2018.

Light Rail Operations

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a slightly
higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps and bus
enforcement because of the following factors:
Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all patrons to
have fare before boarding vehicles
Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they inherently
find more violations of fare evasion.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the recommended fare policy changes, as outlined in Attachment A.




Core Goal #3 - Strong Financial Management
Core Goal #5 - Effective Communications & Community Outreach
Task Goal #1 - Fiscal Sustainability

Background
In September of 2015 the Board of Directors instructed Staff to form a Pass Program Working Group
(PPWG) to help comprehensively review and recommend changes to pass programs in collaboration with
the Affordable Fares Taskforce. The working group included members of RTD staff and external
stakeholders representing schools, businesses, municipalities, neighborhood groups and advocacy
organizations. The board approved the following guiding principles to focus the working group: brand
loyalty, convenience, cost-effectiveness, equitable access, increased ridership, an ability to meet
strategic budget plan targets, revenue certainty and simplifying rider-operator interactions.
Staff convened 12 full working group meetings in twelve months. Staff advertised each working group
meeting to the public, inviting public comment at the beginning of each meeting to help inform the
working group as they developed their recommendations.
The group formulated several options, all of which were modeled by a consultant for their impact on
total fare revenue and ridership. After the working group reached consensus, staff provided an overview
of the group’s recommendation to the Board in March of this year. Staff has since conducted an
operational analysis of the PPWG recommendation and at the direction of the Board, developed a draft
fare change proposal that included two additional options.
Discussion
In May and June, staff presented the Board with three alternatives that staff presented to the public for
feedback. Included in each of the options were the following elements as recommended by the working
group:
 3-Hour Pass - Replaces current One-Way Trip with 3-Hour transfer


EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass - Price based upon the previous year’s
utilization



FlexPass - Retain without discount



MyRide - Retain without $0.25 discount

Packet Pg. 36

2.B.1



10-Ride Ticket Book - Retain without 10% discount



ValuPass - Discontinue (purchase 12 individual monthly passes instead)

The three options primarily differed in base fares, discounts for youth, discounts for low-income
individuals and the administration of the Nonprofit Program.
Option 1. No Increase – Option 1 did not increase the base fare. Option 1 did not meet the fare
revenue targets, kept the current 50% discount for youth and kept the current Nonprofit
Program in place.
Option 2. Regularly Scheduled Fare Change – Option 2 increased the Local fare to $2.90, Regional
fare to $5.00 and the Airport fare to 10.00. Option 2 did meet the fare revenue targets,
included the 70% youth discount and kept the current Nonprofit Program in place.
Option 3. PPWG Recommendation – Option 3 increased the Local fare to $3.00, Regional fare to
$5.25 and the Airport fare to 10.50. Option 3 did meet the fare revenue targets, included
the 70% youth discount and the proposed 40% discount for low-income individuals at
185% of the federal poverty level.
In July and August, Staff used various tactics to engage the public regarding the Draft Fare Change
Proposal to include a Telephone Town Hall, eight open house meetings, the RTD webpage, meetings
with RTD advisory committees, a meeting with Neighborhood EcoPass coordinators and a districtwide
telephone survey to identify the public’s preferred option.
As reported to the Board in August, staff received numerous comments. The districtwide telephone
survey identified that residents of the district generally prefer Option 3, the PPWG recommendation. The
qualitative public feedback showed enthusiastic support for the proposed 3-hour pass, low-income
discounts and youth discounts. Those supporting Option 3 like the concept of paying for time rather
than trips, lower fares for low-income people and promoting transit use among youth.
Public feedback also reflected concerns and offerings of caution. Many commenters expressed concern
that the proposed Local and Airport 3-Hour Passes may be among the highest in the country. Similar
concerns were expressed regarding Access-A-Ride fares being too high. Others expressed concern about
the loss of the MyRide and 10 Ride Ticket Book discounts. Many commenters felt fare increases are
unwelcome given current service levels and some missed trips.
Staff used public comment to inform the development of the final recommendation summarized in
Attachment A.
As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), a Title VI equity analysis has been completed
for the fare changes outlined in Attachment A. No Title VI equity concerns were found with the
recommended changes per the RTD Board adopted Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy.
A summary of the key findings are included in Attachment B.
Financial Impact
The 2019 fare policy changes outlined in Attachment A are forecasted to reach the fare revenue target
levels over the three years (2019-2021).
Alternatives

Packet Pg. 37

2.B.1

1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the recommended fare policy changes, as outlined in Attachment A.
2. Adopt alternative fare policy changes for 2019. This is not recommended as an extensive
analysis was conducted to develop these policies that will meet the objectives of this pass
program study and achieve the fare revenue targets.
3. Do not adopt any fare policy changes for 2019. This is not recommended as our current policies
do not achieve the fare revenue targets and would require reductions in service levels.

Recommended Changes - Pass Programs
Staff recommends the following changes to the EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, CollegePass, FlexPass
and the Nonprofit programs.

EcoPass
Below are the recommended changes to EcoPass:


Annually update the EcoPass Pricing Matrix to reflect the utilization in each Service Level Area
(SLA) group from a full year of smart card tap data. The cash value of all trips (local, regional,
and airport) taken by each SLA group are totaled to determine the new per person rate. 2017
utilization data was used to determine the rates in the matrices for 2019.



Review and update SLA map with every fare adjustment proposed by staff.



Employers with over 3,000 employees are priced based upon the utilization of their individual
organization. The cash value of all trips, local, regional, and airport, are totaled at the applicable
3-Hour Pass rate to determine the next year’s price. First year pricing for employers over 3,000
will be based upon the applicable SLA pricing in group-4.



Contract minimums for SLAs A & B are set at $1,368 (12 times the Local Monthly price), SLAs C &
D are set at $2,394 (12 times the Regional Monthly price).



Price increases for each SLA group and large employer due to utilization-based pricing are to be
capped 20% in 2019 and 2020.



Below are the 2019 EcoPass Pricing Matrix. The pricing matrix for 2020 and 2021 will be updated
to reflect the most recent full year of utilization data.



Master EcoPass Contracts can pass the cost on to employers and employees.

Summary of Key Findings from the Title VI Equity
Analysis Regarding Proposed 2019 Fare Changes
The recommended fare changes did not result in any Title VI equity concerns per the RTD
Board adopted Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy. To complete the fare
equity analysis, the average fare per trip was calculated for each type of fare media,
including pass programs, for all RTD passengers (overall population) and those average fares
were compared to the average fares for low-income and minority riders. It should be noted
that for fare products that are not currently available, the proposed scenario was compared
to existing fares of similar nature (e.g. MyRide/Stored Value, Cash, etc.). The key findings
are described below and a table showing a summary of the results is also provided.
1. When viewing the fare change from a total system perspective, the average fare for the
proposed change for the overall riders is $3.15, for low-income riders it is $2.43 (23%
lower), and for minority riders it is $2.76 (12% lower).
2. Forty five percent of minority riders experience the same increase as the overall rider
population. About 36% of low-Income populations experience the same increase as the
overall rider population.
3. As a whole, low-income and minority populations experienced a significantly lower
increase than the overall rider population. Low-income riders would experience a 9%
increase and minority riders would experience a 15% increase in their average fare per
trip, compared with a 17% increase experienced by the overall rider population.
4. Low-income riders would experience slightly higher increases compared the overall rider
population in several fare categories: Full Fare Monthly, Youth MyRide/Stored Value,
Youth 10-Ride Ticket Book, Senior-Disabled MyRide/Stored Value, and Senior-Disabled
10-Ride Ticket Book, which accounts for about 14% of the low-income population.
5. Minority riders experience slightly higher increases compared to the overall rider
population in several of the fare categories: Full Fare Monthly, Youth 10-Ride Ticket
Book, Senior-Disabled 10-Ride Ticket Book and Ecopass (Neighborhood) which accounts
for 13% of the minority population. However, all of the increases other than the Ecopass
(Neighborhood) are only about 1% higher than overall riders.
6. Minority riders experience smaller increases in some fare categories compared to overall
riders: Full Fare Cash, Full Fare MyRide/Stored Value, Full Fare 10-Ride Ticket Book,
Low-income MyRide/Stored Value, Low-income Day Pass, Youth MyRide/Stored Value,
Senior-Disabled Cash, Senior Disabled MyRide/Stored Value and EcoPass (Business),
which accounts for 43% of the minority population.
7. No fare category resulted in the overall riders experiencing a significantly better outcome
(+5% difference) than minority populations.

2.B.1.b

8. As highlighted in dark red on the table below, two fare categories resulted in overall
riders experiencing a much better outcome than low-income populations.
a. Senior Disabled MyRide/Stored Value fares resulted in a 6% increase for overall
riders, but a 31% increase for low-income populations. Part of this change is due
to the proposed elimination of some discounts in the Nonprofit program for Senior
Disabled riders, and the removal of the pass products. The actual impact of this
change on riders is difficult to assess, as some portion of Senior Disabled riders
receive their fare product for free or at a reduced cost through the Nonprofit
program. Institutional decision making on the part of participating Nonprofit
institutions on how to respond to the discontinuation of discounts and products
would be speculation.
b. Youth MyRide/Stored Value fares resulted in a 38% decrease for the overall rider
population compared to an 18% decrease for low-income riders. However, this
would impact less than 1% of the low-income riders, who would still experience
an overall reduction in their fares

Attachment: SLA Map Explanation (3572 : Adoption of the Preferred Alternative for the 2019-2021 Fare Structure)

2.B.1.c

For EcoPass pricing purposes, the RTD district is broken down into four SLAs: A, B, C,
and D. The SLA areas are determined by the following:


SLA-A: Areas with 1-24 trips between the peak hours of 7:00 am-8:00 am
o Everything on the map that is not coded in blue or red is in SLA-A



SLA-B: Areas with 25-64 trips between the peak hours of 7:00 am and 8:00 am
o There is a 1/3 of a mile buffer around each stop/station
o SLA-B areas are coded in blue



SLA-C: Areas with 65 or more trips between the peak hours of 7:00 am and
8:00 am.
o There is a 1/3 of a mile buffer around each stop/station
o SLA-C areas are coded in red
o Downtown Denver is in SLA-C



SLA-D: DIA airport terminal only

In addition, to updating the map based on the information above, the following changes
were also made.




We removed the call-n-ride boundaries which resulted in some areas being
moved from SLA-B to SLA-A
We updated the map to include information regarding new rail stations
We removed old corridors which didn’t follow the standards above such as:
o Colfax
o Broadway in Denver
o Broadway in Boulder
o Colorado Blvd.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Heather McKillop,

Date:

September 5, 2018

Subject:

Sheridan Garage Unsolicited Proposal

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 5, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 18, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager
or his designee to negotiate and execute one or more agreements with Urban Land Conservancy (ULC)
or its designee concerning the lease of parking spaces in the Sheridan Station Garage according to the
“Agreement Parameters” listed in the Discussion section of this report.
This recommendation addresses one of the General Manager’s 2018 Goals: Strategic Goal #1 – Fiscal
Sustainability.
BACKGROUND
RTD opened the Sheridan Station Garage on the W Line in 2013 with 800 spaces. Actual average
weekday utilization for April 2017-March 2018 stood at 167 spaces, or 21%. On June 22, 2018, RTD
received an Unsolicited Proposal for Joint Development of Real Property from Aaron Miripol of the Urban
Land Conservancy (ULC). The proposal seeks to lease up to 120 spaces in the W Line’s Sheridan Station
Garage. The spaces would be used by residents of a new, 100% affordable housing development to be
constructed to the west of the garage on privately owned land.
Per the procedure governing RTD’s response to unsolicited proposals, the proposal was deemed legally
feasible by the RTD legal department and was subsequently distributed to a staff review committee, the
members of which were nominated by the Senior Leadership Team. The committee found that the
proposal had technical and financial merit and adhered to the TOD Evaluation Guidelines, which were
approved by the RTD Board in February 2018. Having determined that the proposal had potential, RTD
solicited alternate proposals for use of the garage. During the 30-day notice period, no alternate
proposals were submitted. The review committee therefore found that the original proposer was the
preferred developer and recommended to the General Manager that he seek authorization from the RTD
Board to enter into exclusive negotiations with ULC.
DISCUSSION
In determining whether the proposal to lease spaces in the Sheridan Station Garage had merit, the
review committee employed the principles and factors laid out in the TOD Evaluation Guidelines. The
findings were as follows:
TOD Evaluation Guidelines Principles
 The project would be budget positive, as ULC would pay rent for the spaces.

Packet Pg. 70

2.B.2








The project is likely to increase ridership at the station by enabling a higher number of residents
directly adjacent to the station.
The project is a lease, not a sale.
The project abides by the Parking Guiding Principles (PGP). Specifically, the PGP require RTD to
evaluate all decisions on parking based on the impacts to ridership and the financial, operational,
and capital benefits to RTD, which is accomplished through the TOD Evaluation Guidelines.
The project has at least a neutral effect on Safety/Security, and may have a positive effect by
providing more activation and “eyes on the street.”
The project has jurisdictional support.

TOD Evaluation Guidelines Factors
 The project will provide a limited amount of revenue to RTD.
 The project is expected to have a positive effect on ridership, particularly because residents of
affordable housing tend to use transit more than residents of market-rate housing, and because
the leased spaces will be confined to the top level of the garage where they will not
inconvenience RTD patrons.
 The project will have minimal effect on transit facility infrastructure.
 The project reduces RTD maintenance expenditures as the lessee would take on snow removal on
the top floor of the garage.
 The project has strong jurisdictional support by the City and County of Denver and the City of
Lakewood due to the creation of affordable housing.
 The project has no effect on RTD operations.
 The project has a neutral or positive effect on Safety/Security, as described above.
 The project has a limited positive effect on Amenities/Access as the lessee is expected to install
sidewalks and landscaping on private land adjacent to the garage.
 The project has a very positive effect on community facilities and affordable housing by enabling
more affordable housing to be constructed adjacent to transit.
 The project has a positive impact on RTD’s brand image, showing RTD to be a partner in the
community.
Given that the project meets all the requirements of the TOD Evaluation Principles, and its effects on the
Factors are either positive or neutral, the review committee found that the proposal had merit and would
be beneficial to RTD.
Agreement Parameters
Therefore, understanding the position of RTD as described in this Board Report, the Board authorizes the
General Manager to negotiate and execute one or more agreements with ULC concerning the lease of
spaces in the Sheridan Station Garage within the following parameters:




The initial term of the lease will be up to 19 years with options to renew.
The lease must contain amendment and termination provisions in the event that RTD needs the
spaces for transit purposes.
The parking spaces must be leased for at least the greater of Fair Market Value or RTD’s current
maintenance costs.

Packet Pg. 71

2.B.2





RTD bond counsel must approve the final terms of the lease to ensure the terms comply with
federal tax law and any other requirements of the Certificates of Participation that financed the
construction of the garage.
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) must concur with the terms of the lease.

In conclusion, of utmost consideration is that RTD maintains control of the garage and protects its use
by RTD patrons. Further, the direction regarding RTD revenues and expenses laid out in this report
assures that RTD will benefit financially from this agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial cost to RTD for this agreement with ULC. Any financial impact to RTD from this
agreement will be positive.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Finance Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute one or more
agreements with Urban Land Conservancy (ULC) or its designee concerning the lease of parking
spaces in the Sheridan Station Garage according to the “Agreement Parameters” listed in the
Discussion section of this report.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee
to negotiate and execute one or more agreements with Urban Land Conservancy (ULC) or its
designee concerning the lease of parking spaces in the Sheridan Station Garage according to the
“Agreement Parameters” listed in the Discussion section of this report.
This action is not recommended because it will deprive RTD of revenues and create barriers for
the development of affordable housing in the District. Accepting the Recommended Action holds
minimal risk for RTD.

Approval of Budget Transfer

CFO/AGM,

Board Meeting Date: September 18, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the transfer of $420,140 from the Railway Worker Protection project (10470 to the PLC
Upgrade project (10426).
General Manager’s Goal - Core Goal #3 - Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #3 – Asset Management/ State of Good Repair
BACKGROUND
The Railway Worker Protection and Early Warning System project was funded in 2016 to 2017. Early
warning systems are currently the most effective means of protecting right of way workers from trains.
This is an electronic system mounted on all Light Rail trains that in conjunction with the hand held
devices carried by any railway workers will warn both the train operator and the railway worker well in
advance of each other. This project is now complete and ready for closure. There is a little over
$420,000 remaining in this project. The original project budget of $1,546,650 was based on 2 quotes
received for $1.3M and $2.8M. Ultimately the contract was awarded to Protran Technology for
$1,126,510, leaving $420K remaining in this project.
DISCUSSION
The Program Logic Controller (PLC) project was budgeted in 2015 and was intended to purchase
controllers for 17 substations on the Southeast Corridor. The controllers have reached the end of their
useful life, are obsolete, and are no longer available.
The project was delayed because during the R line construction of the substations, new controllers were
being installed as part of the project. Since these were new controllers, RTD wanted to see how they
would work and determine if these were the best controllers to install on the Southeast Corridor.
Ultimately, it was determined that the new controllers would be cost prohibitive due to the amount of
rewiring that is required.
Since estimating the cost in 2015 there has been a price increase for controller boards, therefore
requiring the budget transfer to fully fund the PLC upgrade project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds are available from the Railway Worker project.

Packet Pg. 79

2.B.3

ALTERNATIVES
 It is recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $420,140 from the
Railway Worker Protection project (10470 to the PLC Upgrade project (10426).


Don’t approve the transfer. This is not recommended as there will be a shortfall of funds in the
PLC project and not all of the controllers on the Southeast Corridor will be able to be replaced nor
will there be any spare parts.

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Second Quarter of 2018. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and the
citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 41 performance measures tracked
for the GM, RTD met 34 of the goals in the first quarter. The following is a discussion of the
exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – Maintain System-Wide On-Time Performance
Regional on-time service at 87.9% did not meet goal of 92.0% but was improved over 2017 and only
slightly down from the first quarter.
Goal 4.2 – Reduce Level of Customer Complaints
Complaints per boardings on a system-wide basis were slightly above goal in the second quarter. All
carriers except RTD and First Transit-Longmont exceeded goal.
Goal 6.2 – Increase in Ridership
Ridership for the second quarter of 2018 was down 1.2%. In 2017, ridership was down 1.9% for
the year. This mirrors the national trend. The goal for 2018 is an annual measure and the target is
positive ridership growth for the year. We will continue to monitor ridership.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
Second quarter fare revenue and total operating revenue were up 2.1% and 2.2%, respectively, but
are currently short of the budgeted annual goals of 3.0% and 2.6%. The goal for 2018 is an annual
measure and we will continue to monitor this revenue.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
Both bus operator vacancies and mechanic vacancies exceeded their goals at in the second quarter due
to attrition, retirements, system growth, and full employment in the strong local economy.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required. For information only.
DISCUSSION
Smart Media Technology
The Smart Card Program is an Electronic Fare Collection and Payment System designed to increase fare
payment convenience for our customers, reduce and optimize fare collection costs for the agency and
reduce fraud associated with paper based fare media. The contract was signed with Xerox Transport
Solutions, Inc. (now Conduent) in mid-2010. A smart card is a plastic card onto which customers load
and reload RTD fare products. There are currently 4 products; EcoPass, CollegePass, Neighborhood
EcoPass and MyRide Stored Value available on the smart card.
All bus and rail validator installations are complete. Additional validators will be installed as new buses
and rail stations are commissioned into service.
The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass and Neighborhood EcoPass customers on
January 1, 2013. There are approximately 330,330 active cards in circulation. During the month of
July 2018, 1.35M taps were recorded.
Starting the morning of January 4, 2016 MyRide Stored Value cards were dispersed to the public pilot
program participants at the RTD retail outlets. On Wednesday May 17, 2017, the MyRide web portal
went live to the pilot participants and on May 24, 2017, the MyRide web portal was launched to the
public. As of July 2018, approximately 27,330 cards were issued, of which 20,460 (75%) were full
fare cards and 6,870 (25%) were discounted cards. The average stored value loaded (initial purchases
and reloads) was $38.35, with a total value loaded of $3,724,400. There were nearly 1,146,200 trips
taken using these MyRide cards, with a fare payment value of $3,054,900. Of these trips: 77% were
local, 20% regional and 3% airport.
Additional value can be loaded onto the card online, at RTD sales outlets and at retail outlets (Safeway
and King Soopers). As of June 1, 2017, customers can load cash value onto their MyRide cards at 47
Safeway retail stores. Since launch, Safeway has processed $35,200 in cash value loads. As of July 1,
2017, customers can load cash value onto MyRide cards at 86 King Soopers retail stores. Since launch,
King Soopers has processed $47,790 in cash value reloads.
On February 23, 2018, the MyRide program was expanded by offering customers the option to get a
new MyRide card and load initial cash value at Safeway locations. Since go-live, Safeway has loaded
691 new MyRide cards, totaling $23,310 in sales. There are active discussions to expand the program
at King Soopers locations.
