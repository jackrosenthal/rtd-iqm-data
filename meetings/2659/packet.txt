Approval of Wagon Road Park-n-Ride Pavilion
and Plaza Improvements Contract

General

Board Meeting Date: April 18, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to execute the
contract for Wagon Road Park-n-Ride Pavilion and Plaza Improvements with T-Bone Construction, Inc., in
the dollar amount of $1,270,874.94. Funding of this action is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget.
BACKGROUND

Wagon Road Park-n-Ride is RTD’s second-highest capacity Park-n-Ride. The facility was initially
constructed in 1978, and it was expanded in 1992 as part of the North I-25 Bus/HOV project. This PnR
is served by the 120X & 122X Express routes, the 8, 12,120 & 128 Local routes and the AA Denver
Airport route, and it will continue to play a key transit role in the future I-25 HOV lane projects ongoing
with CDOT. In 2016, 1,451 cars were parked there on an average weekday, making it the most heavily
used Park-n-Ride facility on the RTD system.
Over the last 15+years this PnR has experienced many minor maintenance issues that have driven the
need for the requested improvements from accessibility, functionality, security, and state of good repair.
In early 2016, LED light fixtures were purchased & installed throughout the overall parking area bringing
the light levels up to RTD current standards.
The construction effort is planned to minimize impact to the traveling public. Over the past couple of
years Capital Programs’ Engineering team has collaborated with our Facilities Maintenance and Budget
staff to combine portions of multiple expense budgets to provide sufficient funding to initiate this multifaceted project in a single effort, so to minimize the disruption to our patrons.
DISCUSSION:
The Wagon Road Park-n-Ride Pavilion and Plaza Improvements project will improve safety, accessibility,
lighting and security, Kiss-n-Ride functionality, ease of maintenance, energy efficiency, and appearance
within this heavily used plaza. The major improvements include:
 Refurbishing the existing pavilion structure with new paint, refurbished seating, and new windscreens.
 Replacing the aging driver’s relief building.
 Replacing pedestrian plaza area paving to eliminate tripping hazards.
 Replacing light fixtures within the bus plaza area with LED fixtures.
 Relocating the north Kiss-n-Ride area to the west to lessen vehicle congestion.
 Reconfiguring the north and south Kiss-n-Ride walk areas.

• Goal of the Free MetroRide is to provide faster service through downtown
than the Free MallRide
• With increased congestion, the Free MetroRide is often no faster or more
reliable than Free MallRide especially during the PM peak
• With 2 additional FasTracks commuter rail lines coming on board by 2018
(G Line and N Line), even greater need to circulate those passengers and
relieve pressure from the mall shuttle

Need For Improvement

Funding

• The capital project was completed significantly
under budget due to cost savings from the bus
purchase

• The potential for additional dedicated space allows buses to
operate more reliably – not as constrained by congestion. This
also decreases bus travel time.
• Potential signal improvements prioritize buses – decreased
travel time and increased reliability.
• Potential separation of bike/bus facilities allow for both to
operate more efficiently/safely.
• Potential stop improvements decrease dwell time –
decreasing overall travel time.
