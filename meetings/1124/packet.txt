BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: January 10, 2013

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

January 8, 2013

Board Meeting Date: January 15, 2013

Subject:

Purchase of Up to 34 Mall Shuttle Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of Contract 19FK001 with
DesignLine USA for the purchase of up to 34, 45-foot mall shuttle buses to replace the existing
TransTeq mall buses at a price not to exceed $24,147,350.
BACKGROUND
The RTD Board of Directors approved the purchase of two (2) DesignLine mall buses on March 23, 2010
to accommodate the changes to the operation of the Free Mall Ride Shuttle resulting from the
construction and reconfiguration of the Denver Union Station. The original procurement was the result of
RTD Request for Proposals (RFP), for which proposals were received on September 10, 2009.
DesignLine was determined the most responsive and responsible proposer. The RFP allowed RTD to
purchase up to 57 additional buses for a five year period with pricing for additional buses being based on
the initial base pricing plus a price adjustment set by the US Department of Labor Producer Price Index
(PPI).
The mall buses are unique because of their length, number of doors, completely low floor and highly
demanding service. Industry standard bus manufacturers do not produce the mall bus type and do not
want to expend their resources in the engineering and manufacture of the buses because of their low
sales volume. Currently, there may be only two specialty bus manufacturers that are interested in the
production of these buses.
The new DesignLine buses will replace the existing TransTeq mall buses. The TransTeq mall buses are
currently 12 to 13 years old. By the time the new buses arrive, the current mall buses will be more than
13 and 14 years old. The bus manufacturer, TransTeq, went out of business several years ago. Many
components of the buses have become obsolete and there are no replacement parts. The lack of support
and replacement parts have caused extreme difficulty in keeping the buses in service.
DISCUSSION
The DesignLine mall buses are low floor buses, 45’ long with three wide passenger doors for fast and
easy passenger ingress and egress. The buses are powered by a hybrid electric system driven by a
micro-turbine engine. When the batteries are fully charged, the engine shuts down and the bus runs on
full electric mode. In normal operation, the buses operate in full electric mode about half of the time. To
comply with ADA, the buses have a wheel chair ramp and two wheelchair tiedown positions.
The first two DesignLine mall buses, Bus #1640 and #1641, were received and put into service in
November 2011 and April 2012, respectively. The buses have received positive acceptance from the
riding public and the Denver Downtown Partnership. The Partnership has endorsed the purchase of
additional DesignLine buses for the replacement of the existing buses. Passengers have given the buses
mostly positive reception. In term of mechanical performance, the buses have performed better and
more reliably in initial service than the previous two generations of mall buses. With the knowledge from

Packet Pg. 3

B.1

the bus evaluation service, we are including a number of improvements to the buses in the manufacture
of additional buses to allow better maintenance service accessibility and passenger comfort.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The requested approval is for the change order to exercise the purchase option for a guaranteed quantity
of 32 mall shuttle buses in the amount not to exceed $24,147,350. The quantity may be increased up
to 34 buses depending on the final price negotiation with DesignLine. The purchase is funded partially in
the amount of $6,500,000 by the State of Good Repair Grant from the Federal Government. The
remaining funding is in the District’s 2013 Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, DesignLine has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA's approval of its
DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager to issue a change order to DesignLine for the purchase of thirtytwo (32) additional mall buses. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the change order and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would result, at
the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the project.

Date:

January 9, 2013

Board Meeting Date: January 15, 2013

Subject:

April 2013 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve
moving the proposed April 2013 Service Change on to public review and comment.
DISCUSSION
With the completion of construction of the West Light Rail Line and Board adoption of the West Corridor
Service Plan on October 23, 2012, significant changes in bus and light service are slated to begin April
28, 2013. Additional routine service changes not associated with or included in the West Corridor
Service Plan are also necessary to maintain system on-time performance and provide the appropriate
level of service according to customer demand. For this year we will continue to focus on adjusting
services in response to the January 2012 service revisions and changes in ridership and operational
performance.
The proposed April 2013 Service Changes contained herein reflect the continued budgetary challenges
faced by RTD. The guiding principles for service changes continue to be:
•
Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards
•
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
•
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
•
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services
•
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin
•
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES
Routine Service Adjustments
205/225 – split the interline to establish correct recovery amount
SKIP – adjust PM peak and evening schedule

FINANCIAL IMPACT

PUBLIC HEARINGS
Two public meetings have been scheduled for January 2013 in Downtown Denver. These hearings are
designed to inform the public of the proposed service changes and to obtain public input which will be
summarized and reported to the Board at its February meeting, when final service change proposals will
be presented and final approval will be requested.

Smart Card Project Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
The RTD Smart Media fare collection system went live for Eco Pass Program and College pass program
participants as of January 1, 2013. RTD employees serving as “Ambassadors” have been assigned to
staff all RTD light rail platforms beginning on December 27, 2012 and will continue to staff all platforms
until January 11, 2013. Various individual platforms associated with area colleges will be staffed until
January 24, 2013.
The installation of bus validators is complete except for 5 buses that are in heavy maintenance. There
are approximately 100 buses that are still going through the RTD QC inspection process to accept them.
All remaining work is being done by Linkmont as a DBE subcontractor to Xerox.
There have been reports of some problems with bus validators not working correctly. Customers have
experienced some “Red” validations. The causes for the malfunctions include parameter configurations
that were not properly updated on some buses and some improper bus operator procedure. Corrections
to the parameters are being implemented by ACS/Xerox personnel and Bus Operations continues to reiterate information to the Bus Operators through every communication channel available. We are
monitoring the entire system and responding accordingly to issues as they arise.
All Light Rail validators have been installed and are operational. Additional (over and above the original
plan) validators are in the process of being installed at the following locations:
 16th/Stout (2)
 18th/Stout (2)
 16th/California (1)
 18th/California (1)
The RTD Network Team and SCADA Team are working together to connect the validators to the existing
network for the Ticket Vending Machines (TVM) to accept credit cards by 2nd Quarter 2013. Validators
for West Corridor and expansion of existing stations, as needed, have been ordered and are expected to
be delivered in March, 2013. An RFP will be going out to bring on a workorder contractor to be on-call
to install additional validators or relocate any validators as needed.
Printing and distribution of the EcoPass, CollegePass, and NeighborhoodPass cards began the week of
October 8th. Ecopass Employers had the option of printing their own cards (Self-Administration) or
submitting photos to RTD and having the cards produced and mailed back. All employers who
submitted their photos by the initial deadline have received their cards. Some companies are still
submitting their photos and those cards are in the process of being printed and distributed. Complete
distribution of all cards will occur by the end of January. 2012 EcoPass and CollegePass decals were
extended through January 31, 2013 to assist customers in making the transition as easy as possible.
The software for Fare Inspectors has been approved and is in the process of being installed. Fare
inspectors are operating in an “educate & inform” mode currently and will transition to enforcement of
the smart card tapping in the near future.
Xerox and INIT have been working together to finalize a single driver control. The INIT CAD/AVL
interface will contain the screens needed to control the Smart Card Equipment. This integration will
offer the driver a simpler and more streamlined approach to CAD/AVL and Smart Card. This successful

Packet Pg. 10

C.2

integration reduces overall operating and maintenance expenses and increases the driver convenience
with the completion of a true “smart bus”.
The Board has previously approved several fare changes and administrative policies regarding the
implementation of Smart Card. The Smart Card Program Team will continue to add policy and
procedures to this list and distribute to The Board as needed (no updates this month)
