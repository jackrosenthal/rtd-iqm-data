Background
RTD continues to lead the Denver metro region in transportation transformation, which has come
with its challenges. While implementing the FasTracks program, the agency has faced funding
challenges to complete four rail extensions: Northwest Rail (B Line) from Westminster to
Longmont, North Metro (N Line) from 125th to 162nd, Southwest Rail (D and C lines) from Mineral
to Lucent Blvd., and Central Rail (L Line) from 30th and Downing to 38th. Constituents from those
areas are understandably frustrated at the delay in delivering those rail projects. Another
challenge has been implementing a new state-of-the-art positive train control (PTC) system into
the commuter rail system from the ground up. Issues with the wireless software that controls the
deployment of the crossing gates and signals at grade crossings have caused significant delays
in the establishment of quiet zones along the University of Colorado A Line from Denver Union
Station to Denver International Airport and the G Line from Union Station to Wheat Ridge. In
addition, the issues have caused a two-and-a-half year delay in the opening of the G Line and
have been the impetus behind lawsuits between RTD and its commuter rail operator, Denver
Transit Partners. These challenges have contributed to public scrutiny of RTD, which have
negatively impacted the agency’s public image.
During this time, RTD has had much transition in the Communications Department, including
changes in leadership and several position vacancies. The retirement of the Assistant General
Manager of Communications in fall 2018 led to the recruitment for a new leader of the
department. Upon arrival, the new AGM established three overarching goals as an initial
leadership approach:


Build an image of trust, transparency and accountability to position RTD as an industry
leader, instigator and integrator



Establish a strategic communications roadmap for the agency



Focus the Communications Department to optimize its role as a collaborative, dynamic,
accountable, high-performing team committed to delivering communications excellence
to internal and external customers

RTD Board’s Strategic Priorities for 2020
During the RTD Board/Senior Leadership Team Retreat in March 2019, the Board established five
strategic priorities to guide the agency’s strategic planning for 2020. One of the priorities has a
communications focus: Strengthen communications, collaboration and transparency.
As RTD embraces its role as the mobility integrator, innovator and instigator for the Denver metro
region, strong internal and external communications, engagement, collaboration and
transparency will be essential in tying the transit needs of the public to RTD’s current and future
implementation of service. These will also contribute to enhancing the agency’s image and role
as a leader in the transit industry.
Communications Strategies and Tactics
The agency will utilize several strategies to strengthen communications and foster collaboration
and transparency.

GM TACTICAL PLAN FOR 2020
Strategic Priority
Strengthen Transparent Public Communication/Collaboration

2.1.c

Communicate in a proactive and transparent manner
When RTD has progress or news to share – whether information, good news or bad news – the
agency will develop a communications work plan to ensure that audiences are notified in a timely
and proactive manner. The plan will also outline a hierarchy or order of communications to ensure
that information is prioritized and shared with tiers of stakeholders in strategic fashion.
Stakeholders are categorized in the following tiers:
Tier 1
o
o


Tier 2
o
o



RTD Board and Senior Leadership Team
RTD staff

Local, state and federal elected officials and staff
Area business and community stakeholders

Tier 3
o

o
o

Customers
General public
Media
Special interest groups

Speaking in a unified voice and with one message is another way the agency strengthens
communications and brand (one voice, one message). Developing key messages and fact sheets
on topic areas or issues helps guide RTD Board members, staff and key stakeholders share
consistent information. When addressing challenging issues, speaking in one voice and being
upfront and accountable influences the public’s perception of agency transparency.
Tactics
 Develop communications work plans for events, developments and issues


Develop topic-area or issue-specific key messages and fact sheets

Enhance Engagement Opportunities to Diverse Audiences
With an eight-county service area that spans 2,400 square miles, RTD has a widespread and
diverse array of stakeholders. Among them are current riders; occasional riders; non-riders; local,
state and federal elected officials and staff; corridor/project residents; older adults and youth;
large and small business partners; industry partners; community and social service organizations;
special interest groups; ethnic groups; local, national and trade media; and the general public.
Establishing both widespread, overarching engagement and customized or targeted engagement
opportunities that are easy, convenient and safe for specific groups will ensure that the agency
conducts comprehensive and authentic engagement across the region.
Tactics
 Target engagement to include small-scale and large-scale, in-person and digital activities


Incorporate Board members into community events in their Districts



Utilize Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) for T2 and service change engagement efforts



Include older adults, persons with disabilities and youth into T2 engagement process



Conduct widespread public opinion survey across the District

2.1.c

Foster Community Partnerships
RTD has a history of strong collaboration with its local, regional, state and federal partners. As
the agency leads the way in exploring and implementing future mobility, collaboration will have
many layers. Among the partnerships that will be crucial to success are cities and counties across
the region in determining how to best serve local communities; local, state, federal and private
partners to optimize funding opportunities; and all public and community partners to engage with
and educate the public about RTD’s projects and programs.



Develop regional stakeholder newsletter



Broaden periodic meetings with RTD and Denver staff



Expand outreach for Eco Pass and LiVE Programs



Repurpose LiVE Marketing and Outreach Advisory Committee for other engagement
efforts

Expand Internal Communications
RTD’s employees are among the most important ambassadors to share information and be
storytellers about the agency’s service, programs and progress. Employees are also brand
ambassadors, showcasing the agency’s values and personality.
Tactics
 Streamline RTD road shows across the divisions to share various news items and updates


Establish periodic managers’ messages so that managers and supervisors can share the
latest news and information in a unified voice



Get the Senior Leadership Team out in the field and having “face time” with different work
groups

Establish a Proactive Media Strategy
Another component of proactive and transparent communications is creating an RTD newsroom.
This allows the agency to develop its own narrative and share relevant news and information with
the public instead of allowing the news and social media to set the narrative for and about RTD.
The agency also has an opportunity to anticipate and respond to developments and evolving
situations that will generate media interest in a rapid manner. Development and execution of a
Rapid Response Plan will strategically guide the agency through these situations.
Tactics
 Create an RTD newsroom (optimize blog; develop video news releases, podcasts, thought
leadership articles; encourage RTD Board and staff to share social media posts within
established agency policy)


Develop a Rapid Response Plan for emerging news



Hold periodic media visits

Expand Marketing and Customer Information Programs
RTD launches numerous individual marketing campaigns each year to educate and inform the
public about ridership, projects, service changes, pass programs, safety, workforce development
and events. The agency also has several customer service functions to assist riders with

information in a quick and easy manner. But there are ways the agency can be proactive as it
looks to enhance the customer experience.



Begin implementation of digital customer information displays



Create a “frequent rider” or “destinations promotion” program



Transition to Salesforce as a consolidated and multi-functional customer relationship
management (CRM) system



Modify website to enhance navigation and availability of most relevant customer
information



Enhance Rider Alerts to include more detailed/route-specific information

2.1.c

Background
An equitable public transit system is a fair transit system, where services, resources, benefits,
and impacts are distributed with respect to transit demand, not race, color, national origin or
income status. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order 12898 - Federal Actions to
Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, Colorado
Revised Statutes § 24-34-601 and related guidance specify how transit agencies must ensure
their policies and practices are equitable. At the Board of Directors’ instruction, staff will not only
comply with these civil rights laws, but enhance efforts to guarantee fairness in the delivery of
the RTD transit system.
Below are the key initiatives to commence in 2020:


Equity Training Program



Inclusive Decision-Making Framework



Internal Equity Taskforce



Safety and Security Community Relations Plan

Equity Training Program
The equity training initiative intends to foster an inclusive environment for the public and
employees, while mitigating the risk of discrimination lawsuits and complaints (e.g. Title VI, EEO,
and ADA). The training will aim to provide RTD employees and applicable contractors with cultural
competency, implicit bias management, de-escalation tactics and a basic understanding of civil
rights requirements. The Civil Rights and Transit Equity offices will collaborate to develop the
training program, prioritizing customer facing (security officers, operators, sales outlets, etc…),
senior, and executive level employees.
Inclusive Decision-Making Framework
It is an exciting time for RTD as we pursue new and innovative transportation solutions to meet
the needs of the region. New long-range planning initiatives (Transportation Transformation),
adaptations to FlexRide operations, and partnerships with private and public transportation
interests are great initiatives catalyzing major changes for RTD. These initiatives also come with
the risk of unintentionally and unjustifiably, excluding populations based on race, color, national
origin and income status. RTD will mitigate this risk by developing a practice of inclusive decisionmaking.
The planning department will lead the development of an Inclusive Decision-Making Framework.
This framework will establish a policy and set of practices that seek to include and consult the full
spectrum of the public before the District makes critical decisions. Critical decisions include
policies, projects, and any activity that has the potential to significantly impact (beneficially or
adversely) the communities we serve.

2.1.c



Collective Understanding – The community and RTD empathize with one another,
understanding an initiative from both perspectives, beyond the limitations of quantitative
data



Managed Expectations – The community learns the limitations of RTD and understands
how well specific solutions may address community needs



Better Decisions – Collective understanding allows RTD to better tailor actions to the exact
needs of the community



Community Buy-In – Communities can support, promote, defend, and fund solutions they
took part in developing



Legal Risk Mitigation – We limit the opportunity for unintended discriminatory actions
when vulnerable communities participate in the decision-making process.



Increased Public Satisfaction – The public can find satisfaction with actions they help tailor
to their needs

Most immediately, this framework will aid RTD’s decision-making in the following initiatives:


Transportation Transformation/Systems Optimization Plan



Ongoing Service Changes



2022 Fare Change Assessment

Internal Equity Working Group
The promotion of an equitable transit system is the responsibility of every department and District
employee. Promoting equity effectively requires internal coordination. As the District has
expanded so has the need for coordination. For the District to enhance responsiveness to equity
concerns, the Planning Department will convene an Internal Equity Working Group. The Internal
Equity Working Group will be a cross-departmental assembly of internal leaders, focused on
identifying and responding to opportunities to promote equitable transit.
Safety and Security Community Relations Plan
Communities trust RTD with their lives and the lives of their loved ones as we connect the region.
Thus guaranteeing the safety and security of our region is a top priority for RTD. However,
guaranteeing the safety and security of the region is expanding in scope and complexity as the
region’s population increases and our operations evolve. As we adapt our safety and security
measures to meet those evolving needs, it is important that all communities feel safe when
accessing our transit system.
RTD recognizes the potential for inequity in the operation of safety and security measures. To
ensure all feel safe when encountering our system, the Planning, Communications, Safety,
Security and Asset Management Departments will collaborate to develop a comprehensive
community relations plan.
This community relations plan aims to:


Connect with the community

Background
The transportation and public transit sectors in the U.S. are experiencing many challenges and
changes in service delivery, including: staffing in a competitive economy, introduction of new
transportation service providers and increased customer expectations and options. In recognition
that accelerating changes will transform how RTD serves the citizens of the District, the Board of
Directors has identified addressing current and future transportation methods as an RTD Strategic
Priority for 2020. In the past few years, RTD has taken a leadership role as the region’s Mobility
Integrator and the actions identified in this plan will help RTD strengthen and retain this position.
The following actions constitute key opportunities for RTD in 2020:
Improving Current Methods
 Bus Stop Consolidation: To improve the quality and reliability of bus service, RTD will
continue to systemically analyze bus stops by route based on usage, spacing and access
for our riders, resulting in faster trip times, less dwell times, and more satisfied customers.


FlexRide / Using Other Service Provider Vehicles Together with FlexRide Fleet: RTD will
demonstrate a new service delivery model that integrates the vehicles of other on-demand
service providers, like taxis, with FlexRide’s fleet to increase ridership and improve costeffectiveness.



Transit Priority: RTD has identified opportunities for transit priority to enhance the transit
experience through faster travel times, reduced delay, better access to service, increased
reliability, and an improved wait environment. These actions also reduce resource
requirements for RTD while providing customers a more attractive service. RTD is
partnering with metro cities to identify and implement a variety of priority measures.



Fleet Electrification: RTD’s current fleet of electric vehicles, operated on the 16th Street
Mall, will expand in the near future. Grant opportunities afforded through the VW
settlement will facilitate the addition of up to 15 electric 40-transit coaches.



Bus Rapid Transit: In 2019, RTD will finalize the Regional Arterial BRT Feasibility and SH
119 BRT Studies. In 2020, RTD will have the opportunity to identify one or more BRT
corridors as candidates for the FTA Small Starts Program. In 2019, RTD will also finish the
SH 119 BRT planning, and with $30 million identified in 2023 in the current RTD mid-term
financial plan, we will collaborate with local governments and CDOT to leverage committed
investments towards implementing transit investments for the corridor.

Addressing Challenges with Current Methods
Current transportation methods face many challenges including attracting and retaining
employees. These challenges are especially difficult regarding Represented employees who are
required to drive and maintain our vehicles, the foundation of our primary service offering. RTD
will continue to develop and implement changes to address recruitment and retention.


Recruitment: Test and expand marketing and sourcing partnerships to increase our
outreach to candidates.



Retention: We are continuing the progress made from the CBA to retain employees with
three general categories of improvements.

o

Mandates: Mandates are a primary contributor to employee dissatisfaction and
turnover. RTD is committed to reducing levels of mandates for operators.

o

Communications: We have implemented a Communications Committee and formal
Communications Process and are working on several elements to improve two-way
communications with employees. We are investing in focus groups and a regular
survey to understand how employees want to receive information and provide
feedback. We are also improving our ability to provide coordinated, consistent
information through multiple channels, including updated internal Public Information
Displays (PIDs), emails for all employees, text-type applications and supervisor
training to support daily interactions.

o

Support programs: Based on challenges represented employees face regarding worklife balance, RTD is exploring options to support employees who work challenging
schedules.

Developing Future Methods
 Intermodal Trip Planning: RTD’s Open Trip Planner uses fixed route bus and rail data to
plan a customer’s itinerary, but does not currently incorporate the on-demand service,
FlexRide. The new version will enhance the algorithms and datasets and allow intermodal
trip planning between fixed route and FlexRide, and other services in the future.


Trip Exchange: RTD is participating in this effort led by DRCOG. This automated system
will enable human services transportation providers to post and claim trip requests,
leading each to be more cost-effective and support more customers.



Mobility Hub & First/Last Mile Transit Improvements: RTD’s First and Last Mile Strategic
Plan and Mobility Hub Guidelines reports identify multiple opportunities to respond to the
changing transportation landscape, and make access to transit easier and more seamless.



Mobility Choice Blueprint (MCB): Completed in early 2019, the MCB laid out a plan for
collaboration between RTD, DRCOG, CDOT, local governments and the private sector that
can result in a “Mobility Bold” scenario with coordinated transportation technology
development. By implementing or supporting tactical actions laid out in the MCB, RTD will
continue to be the region’s Mobility Integrator.



Transportation Transformation Comprehensive Plan (T2 Comp Plan): Through 2020, the
T2 Comp Plan team will complete the Comprehensive Assessment of RTD Services. The
team will also make progress on the System Optimization Plan, the Fiscal and Financial
Stability Plan, the Fleet Electrification Plan and the Bus and Rail Facilities Plan. This work
will be accomplished utilizing a robust stakeholder, employee and citizen engagement
effort and with close oversight and policy direction from the RTD Board of Directors.

2.1.c

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) mission is to provide safe, secure, reliable and
effective transportation services to our customers. Safety and Security are the primary concerns
that affect all RTD activities and transportation modes. Therefore, all RTD personnel and
appropriate contractors are charged with the responsibility of promoting the safety and security
of customers, employees, property and the public. Employees and our customers are RTD’s most
important assets, and their safety and security are RTD’s greatest responsibilities.
Safety Management, System Security, and Asset Management are all management systems that
complement each other. These management system frameworks support and dovetail into RTD’s
larger plan to have an integrated management system. Together these approaches allow the
balancing of costs, opportunities and risks against the desired performance of people and assets,
to achieve the organizational objectives.
Safety
The purpose of RTD’s Safety Division is to fulfill the responsibility to provide transit services that
are safe for the public and safe for employees. RTD is committed to maximizing safety by
implementing the Safety Management System (SMS) framework contained in the Federal
legislation and required by law. The purpose of the Safety Division is to manage the path to
improved safety, SMS implementation and thereafter, ensure the SMS is functioning as intended
to provide continuous improvement and compliance with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission
and the Federal Transit Administration requirements.
Security
The purpose of RTD’s Transit Police Division is to aid in the secure and reliable movement of
passengers throughout the transit system and to ensure that all customers and employees
perceive the system is secure by maintaining a robust security model comparable to other transit
systems. The Transit Police Division also collaborates and coordinates with local and federal law
enforcement agencies to be most effective. RTD security has a layered security approach using
a variety of security systems and methods. All projects are built according to a comprehensive
safety and security design criteria, and certified to the criteria prior to revenue service.
Asset Management
The purpose of RTD’s Asset Management Divisions is to allow RTD to translate their top-level
priorities and goals into the appropriate strategies, plans and on-the-ground activities for their
assets. MAP 21 and FAST Act Legislation require transit agencies to adopt Asset Management
good practices, including collecting asset inventory and condition information, prioritizing asset
investments and developing a Transit Asset Management Plan. RTD has played a leadership role
at the national level in helping to shape this Legislation and is now well on its way to meeting the
requirements
This effort is required for RTD to achieve ISO 55000 and fully aligns with the requirements set
out in MAP-21. It is for these and other reasons that an increasing number of transportation
agencies are adopting similar principles to ensure the right investment decisions surrounding
transportation projects are made and delivered in order to produce the outcomes desired by the
agency and the public.

Strengthen Safety and Security

2020 Strategic Safety Tactical Plan
The Safety Division’s blueprint for 2020 is that of SMS implementation and maturity. In 2019 the
Safety Division awarded work to two consulting firms to aid in our development of and
implementation of a Safety Management System. The gap analysis will be conducted and the
required components of a SMS that were established in 2018 will be strengthened. Additionally,
a roadmap has been established to continue to address other components and initiatives of the
SMS as identified in the SMS project. These components/initiatives have been validated by
operations and prioritized by RTD leadership. Application of SMS within the agency is congruent
with the Board of Directors and Senior Staff’s goal of enhancing safety. RTD will integrate the
SMS into the business cycle so that the PUC/FTA requirement for having a process and timeline
for the annual review of the SMS becomes seamless. SMS must be implemented and functioning
as designed in order to continue receiving federal funding.
In order to ensure successful SMS roadmap implementation and to enhance the safety of our
employees, customers and the communities we serve, RTD will also place its focus on the
following areas:


Enhancing Leadership Engagement and Accountability



Employee Safety



SMS Implementation



Enhanced, Efficient Safety data collection



Enhanced Audits and Inspections



Cybersecurity

Safety Policy—Enhancing Leadership Engagement and Accountability
RTD Leaders have an impact on the safety for our employees and customers. As part of the
implementation of the SMS, Leadership Accountability and Engagement are required by the
regulations and are integral to success.


Leaders at all levels and functions will be regularly visible in the areas where the work is
being done having discussions with the employees focused on employee safety.

Safety Risk Management—Employee Safety
Employee Safety is a core value of RTD and is the cornerstone that allows RTD to provide safe,
secure, reliable and effective transportation services to our customers. Our employees are the
face of RTD to the customers and public. Every effort should be taken to ensure that they have
a safe work environment and go home safely at the end of every shift. The efforts to collect data
on employee injuries in 2019 were successful and provided data from the risk management
systems that allows us to focus on key areas to work to prevent employee injuries. To achieve
this, the following action will be taken.


Employee injury data will be analyzed to prioritize actions for prevention.



Develop Policy and Procedures for greater collection of facts and information on employee
injuries to include determination of causal factors and corrective actions. This will also
provide more accurate data to focus our prevention efforts.

Safety Risk Management—Enhanced Efficient Safety Data Collection
In order to achieve the intended outcomes of the SMS, the processes should be monitored,
measured, and analyzed. This requires the collection and sharing of information to be

causal factors of events, and corrective actions necessary to reduce or eliminate systemic
causes and to prevent future incidents at RTD.



Create SMS dashboard for tracking progress on initiatives and both leading and lagging
indicators that drives accountability at all levels



Work with Operations, Risk Management, IT and Safety, to obtain a cloud based
Event/Incident Management platform that meets everyone’s needs and the regulatory
requirements to collect and analyze all event data.

Safety Management System Implementation Roadmap
As stated earlier, a Safety Management System (SMS) is a comprehensive, collaborative approach
that brings management and labor together to build on RTD’s existing safety foundation. Its
purpose is to better control risk, detect and correct safety problems earlier, share and analyze
safety data more effectively, and measure safety performance more carefully. SMS is about
applying resources to risk, and is based on ensuring that RTD has the organizational infrastructure
to support decision-making at all levels regarding the assignment of resources. The work that
has been completed in 2019 for the SMS Implementation project identified several areas for
enhancement within our organization. The core components of a SMS are in place and
functioning. All management systems are designed to be dynamic and to drive continuous
improvements year after year. With that we have developed a roadmap that recognizes that
everything cannot be done at once and, to be sustainable, each initiative must be fully
implemented to habit strength so it becomes how we do what we do at RTD. The roadmap
reflects prioritization of operationally validated, data driven initiatives.


Working with Communications, provide and communicate the Safety Management
Systems effort with a common, consistent message at all levels, building on the existing
Safety icon and branding.



Create an active, dynamic RTD wide Safety Risk Register



Policy/Procedure/Individual Work Instruction (IWI) and Standard Operating Procedures
(SOP) development, simplification, and alignment

Safety Assurance—Enhanced Audits and Inspections
Safety Assurance ensures the performance and effectiveness of safety risk controls established
under safety risk management. Safety assurance is also designed to ensure that the organization
meets or exceeds its safety objectives through the collection, analysis, and assessment of data
regarding the organization's performance. Safety assurance also includes inspection activities to
support oversight and performance monitoring. RTD currently has well-established audit
programs for Rail certifications, design, and operations. FTA Regulations and Public Utilities
Commission’s State Safety Oversight Requirements mandate these audit programs for light rail.
The FTA does not require these for Bus Operations at this time. All modes of transportation are
now a part of our Public Transit Agency Safety Plan and SMS framework. To ensure this
consistency RTD will do the following:

comprehensive, complete and valid. RTD safety data is limited and collection, measurement and
analysis is manual, paper or fillable pdfs and Excel spreadsheets which is vulnerable to error,
incomplete, and inefficient at best. Management systems require complete and reliable data to
make sound business decisions. To achieve the level necessary for reliable safety data the
following action will be taken:



Develop and implement a change management/configuration modification process



Implement a Bus Operations safety audit process similar to that of light rail



Establish Audit protocol for Commuter Rail and perform audits.

2020 Strategic Security Tactical Plan
The Transit Police Division will enhance the delivery of improved security in 2020 through
continued governance via the System Security Plan (SSP) that encompasses all of RTD’s modes
of transportation. The document identifies tasks and requirements applied at all levels of the RTD
organization and functional departments. The (SSP) itself is a Security Sensitive Plan and is
reviewed annually by the RTD Chief Safety Officer. It is also evaluated by the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS). There are several areas associated with enhanced security in 2020.


Rail Security Measure Enhancements



Internal Security Education, Training and Marketing Programs



Emergency Management Procedures Enhancement



Increased security measures for Bus Operations as this division represents the majority of
our services



Increased capability and use of data analysis for allocation of police/security resources.

Rail Security Enhancements
RTD Transit Security Officers (TSO) are primarily responsible for security of our rail system, which
includes vehicles, stations, and infrastructure. We have TSO’s assigned to ride trains for security
and fare inspection presence. All commuter rail trains have an officer assigned to them at all
times, acting as a second crewmember and performing 100% fare inspection. We also have TSO’s
stationed at Union Station, Civic Center Station and surrounding areas, all RTD rail facilities; and
both automobile and bicycle patrols along all rail corridors and stations on a 24 hour basis. Despite
this coverage, as the Denver Metro Area and RTD continue to grow we have seen an increase in
violent crime, theft, homeless concerns, and suspicious activity/packages, etc. RTD has developed
a more data driven approach to security resource allocation but due to the increased security
concerns , when we reduce in one location, we see an increase in another – we are somewhat
constrained. To address these concerns we will consider the following.


Utilize a task force approach to fare inspection and high activity crime hotspots



Coordinate station patrols with law enforcement officers in our communities based upon
shared crime statistic data.

Internal Security Education/Training and Marketing Programs
As Safety and Security spends more time speaking with our employee operators and supervisors
in the field, it has become very clear that there is a perception of a need for additional security
throughout our system. While there is a finite number of resources to provide that security, the
concerns especially high in bus operations, RTD actually has police and security resources
patrolling troublesome routes including plain-clothes police on some buses and trains.
Unfortunately, our employees and customers are not aware of all of these security activities. We
recognize the need to develop better awareness, education and marketing campaigns. In order
to facilitate this awareness and education RTD plans the following.


Surveys to gauge perceptions

13

Packet Pg. 24

Attachment: 2020 Tactical Plan Final (3808 : General Manager's 2020 Tactical Plan)

2.1.c



Establish a Security & Safety Continuous Improvement Committee that includes Union
representatives, security team members and RTD management to meet on a regular basis
to discuss solutions.



Continue to enhance semiannual “Security Roadshow” and visit all RTD divisions to make
introductions, share our security efforts, explain the employee’s role in reporting and solicit
feedback.

Advancement in Emergency Management Programs
Emergency Management Planning is crucial, first, to ensuring the safety and security of our
employees/customers, and then to the continuity of our operations. While our Continuity of
Operations Plan (COOP) is up to date and processes are now in place to ensure currency and
training on its use by COOP administrators, RTD will enhance the Emergency Management Plan
and training program. RTD does not have a dedicated Emergency Manager to coordinate plans
with safety, security and our Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) Partners. This function is
spread across a number of current employees. All of our peer transit agencies have an Emergency
Manager and a permanent Emergency Operations Center (EOC), RTD does not. In order to
develop and enhance our Emergency Management programs RTD intends to do the following.


Develop a mass notification protocol for specific employee groups and the entire
organization utilizing Ready Op



Pursue FTA and TSA grant funding for the creation of a permanent Emergency Operations
Center to be housed at the Security Command Center or other designated RTD facility.



Utilize resources in Safety and Security division to develop Incident Action Plans (IAP’s)
for the most common eventualities as well as planned events that will impact RTD
operations (weather events, power outages, bomb threats, evacuations, active attackers,
July 4th, etc. Requires procurement of software known as “Complete EM” which will include
modules to develop Incident Action Plans. (IAP’s)

Increased Security Measures for Bus Operations
Bus Operations represents the majority of the services RTD provides to the Denver community.
RTD operates over 1000 buses on a daily basis across one of the largest geographical areas of
any transit agency. It would take a significant security force to cover every bus on every route,
every day. Even focusing on having a presence on high crime activity routes is an insurmountable
problem with the constrained resource levels we have. Crimes on buses have increased by 100%
in the last 4 years and we have seen an increase in operator assaults. Despite our increased use
of focused crime data, we are seeing a widening of the gap in our security coverage. One option
is doubling the size of our security and police forces; however, that is not realistic in the current
financial environment. A compromise has been developed that includes additional internal
strategic funding and the reallocation of existing funding that is currently used to fund contracted
police. This is to be redirected for the addition of internal Transit Police Officers. This in
combination of new programs such as “high visibility” marked patrol vehicles and other programs
designed demonstrate a greater security presence. RTD is focusing its efforts in the following
areas.


Reinforce de-escalation culture amongst our operators with regular training and bulletins.



More uniformed contracted police and transit police presence instead of plainclothes police
on bus routes.

Increased Capability and use of Data Analysis for allocation of police/security
resources.
Data and Trend information is critical to understand problem areas, times of day, types of crimes
and potential threats. RTD has begun capturing data in a more useful format by working with our
police partners in the District to have a better understanding of district-wide crime and this has
enabled us to focus our security resources on problem areas at certain times. RTD also procured
new crime data software (Lexis-Nexis) that has regional connections to outside law enforcement
agencies for crime data sharing. Although RTD has developed a more data driven approach to
security resource allocation we find when we reduce in one location, we see an increase in another
– we are somewhat constrained. We believe that better data, including a clear understanding of
what is going on near our system, will help us better prepare for and combat that crime. In
addition, it will enable RTD to develop more targeted awareness campaigns to hopefully reduce
the growth we are seeing. RTD will consider the following:


Evaluate and incorporate into our analysis, low cost security information services that
provide trending security data in our communities



Evaluate the possibility of hiring a crime data analyst that could provide tremendous value
for both safety and security – full time or part time.

Asset Management Division Continuing along Path to ISO 55000 Certification
supports safety
RTD’s accountable executive and Board of Directors has committed to maximizing value from its
assets by implementing International Standards Organization’s ISO 55000 asset management
framework. One function of the Asset Management Division is to manage the path to certification
and thereafter, ensure continued compliance to the standard.
RTD will continue with a Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP), an Asset Management Plan
(AMP), and other supporting documents. These artifacts are the backbone of an ISO 55000
certified business and deliver the 9 elements of the FTA final rule.
The journey to ISO certification demonstrates to both regulators and other stakeholders that
assets are being appropriately maintained while addressing short, medium and long-term risks.
Setting in place the key components for FTA compliance at the same time as ISO certification will
bring the greatest value and allow systems to be set up and utilized for the required time prior to
assessment. In addition, the independent certification provides evidence of fiscal sustainability
and compliance to safety critical systems and procedures. The objective of RTD’s Asset
Management system is to optimize the value of assets while managing risks.
Asset Management, consistently applied throughout the organization, enables RTD to work
collectively and more effectively in realizing value from physical assets. An asset’s value is
determined by its ability to further the agency purpose of moving people. The SAMP, AMP, Policy
and other framework documents are the tools that enable the entire organization to work
collectively toward this ultimate goal of achieving alignment to our common purpose, moving
people.
Enhance Safety and Security
The Asset Management Division (AMD) supports the enhancement of Safety and Security in
multiple ways. Asset Management, Safety Management, and System Security are all management

systems that complement each other. These management frameworks support and dovetail into
RTD’s larger plan to have an integrated management system. Together these approaches allow
the balancing of costs, opportunities and risks against the desired performance of people and
assets, to achieve the organizational objectives.
AMD will develop and implement an asset Information Management framework and
associated sub-documents and processes in alignment with ISO 55000 Clause 7.5 and
7.6. This will be a cross functional effort including key staff from IGM, Asset Stewards,
and Safety Division.

GM TACTICAL PLAN FOR 2020
Strategic Goal
Increase Ridership

Background
RTD’s function is to move people. As is reflected in our mission statement, RTD strives to do that
in a way that is safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost effective.
RTD covers 2,340 square miles and serves 40 cities and 8 counties. The population is 3.1 million,
approximately 57% of Colorado’s total population. According to the 2017 APTA Fact Book, RTD
ranks 15th as the largest transit agency based on unlinked passenger trips, ranks 14th based on
most transit travel, ranks 15th based on transit travel per capita, and 12th largest bus agency
based on unlinked passenger trips.1
Current State
RTD is experiencing similar ridership trends as seen in the industry nationally. Generally, light rail
and commuter rail ridership are increasing, bus rapid transit ridership is increasing, and overall
bus ridership is decreasing. The below chart shows annual revenue ridership for the last ten (10)
years but doesn’t tell the whole story. The chart shows that between 2015 and 2018 ridership
declined 2.2%; however, during 2016 and early 2017, RTD opened four (4) new lines: the Flatiron
Flyer US 36 BRT, the University of Colorado A line, the B line, and the R line. In 2016, the A, B,
and BRT lines accounted for 9% of total revenue ridership. In 2017 and 2018, the A, B, BRT, and
R lines accounted for 15% of total revenue ridership. At the same time, fixed route bus revenue
ridership declined 7.5% in 2016, 6% in 2017, and 3.6% in 2018 for an overall decrease in revenue
ridership between 2015 and 2018 of 16.2%. As light rail and commuter lines have opened, bus
service is intentionally re-routed or substituted by the new rail service.
The 12th annual Downtown Denver Commuter Survey conducted by the Downtown Denver
Partnership indicates that 39.9% of downtown Denver employees commute by public transit. This
is the largest share of all other modes with driving alone at 34.5% followed by bike at 9.0%, walk
at 6.9%, carpool/vanpool at 4.1%, telework at 2.4%, scooter at 1.7% and Lyft/Uber/Taxi at
1.5%. A Visit Denver survey indicates that approximately 29% of visitors utilize the University of
Colorado A Line for transportation between Denver International Airport and downtown. This is
the largest market share for all other modes.

Mission
To meet our constituents’ present and future public transportation needs by providing safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the District.

The next chart shows the annual revenue ridership forecast for 2019-2030. Most of the ridership
gains are assumed to come from FasTracks with growth in existing corridors, but also includes
the opening of the G line in 2019 and the opening of the N line in early 2020. In 2025, on the
base system, we assume that ridership will increase slightly due to population growth, but no
additional funds are included in the long range financial plan for service increases on the base
system except for SH 119 in 2023.

Fuel Prices
The impact of fuel prices on transit ridership is widely debated. Various articles and papers have
been written about whether fluctuations in gas prices cause fluctuations in transit ridership. In
2014, the then President and CEO of APTA, Michael Melaniphy said, “Despite the steep decline in
gas prices at the end of last year (2014), public transit ridership increased. This shows that once
people start riding public transit, they discover that there are additional benefits besides saving
money.”2
The following chart depicts regional conventional retail gasoline prices from 2008-2018 in the
Denver Metro area. If you compare gas prices to ridership on RTD during the same time period,
there seems to be some correlation between increases in gas prices and increases in ridership,
however there doesn’t seem to be a direct cause and effect.

Factors Contributing to Ridership
There are many factors that contribute to ridership both negatively and positively. Many of those
factors are listed below.

‘* Source: eia, U.S. Energy Information Administration

Car Ownership
Another factor contributing to decreases in ridership within the District is the increase in car
ownership, which is increasing at a greater rate than population. In 2015, vehicle registration in
Colorado totaled 5.5 million. By the end of State Fiscal Year 2018, vehicles registrations had
jumped to 5.9 million or a 7% increase over that three (3) year period of time. By comparison,
the state demographer estimates that the population of the State of Colorado increased from 5.4
million to 5.6 million between 2015 and 2017 or a 3% increase. The population of the sevencounty region that includes the RTD District increased by 2.7% over the same period of time. As
the accessibility of the automobile increases due to good economy, low unemployment and lower
cost of operation, car ownership has increased and has led to fewer transit trips.
Ride Hailing
A more recent phenomenon potential affecting transit ridership is ride hailing companies. A recent
Transportation Research Board paper submitted by Michael Graehler, Richard Mucci, and Gregory
Erhardt, states, “TNCs reduce transit ridership, specifically on heavy rail and bus. Further we find
that the effect increases as TNCs become more established in a market.”3 In addition, they state,
“Our research also suggests that past research findings that TNCs and other emerging modes
either increase or do not affect transit ridership are likely incorrect. Our results show that the
introduction of bike share in a city is associated with an increase in light and heavy rail ridership,
but a 1.8% decrease in bus ridership. Our results also suggest that for each year after TNCs enter
a market, heavy rail ridership can be expected to decrease by 1.3% and bus ridership can be
expected to decrease by 1.7%.” 4 The exact impact of ride hailing on ridership in the Denver
metro area is unknown, and RTD continues to collaborate with TNCs to improve first and last mile

Teleworking
While it is difficult to measure the impacts of telecommuting on ridership, the 12th annual
Downtown Denver Commuter Survey indicates approximately 2.4% of the downtown Denver
workforce utilizes telework for their commute. General trends tell us that telecommuting is on the
rise. According to Governing magazine, approximately 8 million workers primarily work from
home. That makes telework now second behind only driving as the most common means of
getting to work, exceeding public transportation for the first time.5 A 2017 survey by the society
for Human Resource Management found that 62% of organizations allowed telecommuting. In
addition, FlexJobs a job site for telecommuters found that the number of people who work from
home has skyrocketed 115% over the past decade, and some experts predict that half of all fulltime workers could be working remotely by 2020.6
Service
Among the factors that affect public transportation ridership, service supply variables are typically
some of the most important. These include factors such as frequency, hours of service, urban vs.
suburban, reliability and trip time, coordination with municipalities, land use and design, safety,
and geographic coverage.7
According to 2018 NTD data, of the top 35 regions for transit usage, ridership is rising in Seattle,
Pittsburgh, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Detroit, and Las Vegas. Three of the seven cities with
growing transit ridership have recently re-oriented their bus networks to meet changing demand:
Seattle, Houston, and Austin restructured service to provide more frequency. Another three- San
Antonio, Las Vegas, and Pittsburgh – have substantially increased service since 2013. Outside of
the 35 biggest transit regions, Columbus, Richmond, and Indianapolis are also gaining ridership
after revamping their bus networks.8 Ridership gains can be made through service and system
optimization and working with municipalities on land use and design that is friendly to transit and
connectivity.
Fares
The RTD Board of Directors has a fiscal policy that states the following: Staff will plan fare
adjustments every three years in the mid and long-term budgets to adjust for inflation. The Board
of Directors may consider potential fare adjustments annually at the time of the development of
the Mid-Term Financial Plan. As part of this process, staff will review potential fare adjustments
to establish a fare structure to ensure that it:


is understandable



is implementable



is equitable



achieves revenue levels established in the Mid-Term Financial Plan9

As we modeled a fare increase for 2019, it was clear that fare increases have an impact on
ridership. For example, the model we presented to the Board in 2018 showed that if the fares
were kept at the same as 2018, ridership was projected to be about 1.7% higher over the 3 year
period (2019-2021) than it would have been with the fare increase. However, without a fare
increase, there would have been a drop in projected revenue between 2019 - 2021 of
approximately $35 million which equates to 7%. In order to make up $35 million in fare revenue
with ridership, boardings would need to increase by approximately 11.6 million boardings or 12%.
Reducing the fares, depending on the reduction, could result in an increase in ridership but most
likely would result in a significant decrease in revenues and an increased demand on routes that
are already at or near capacity. The key is finding the right balance between fares and ridership.
Focus Areas for 2020
Comprehensive Service Review
Bus ridership accounted for 62% of RTD’s total annual revenue ridership in 2018. As was
mentioned above, one of the factors that may contribute to decreasing ridership is not responding
to changes in demographics, geographical trends, and travel patterns. Although bus service is
reviewed and adjusted during the run board process which occurs three times per year and is
reviewed and adjusted every time a new rail line opens, a comprehensive review of these
changing markets has not been done in more than 15 years. Through 2019 and 2020, we will be
conducting a comprehensive assessment of RTD’s services. The products will be:


The identification of changes in the market and opportunities to accommodate them with
new and revised transit services.



Preparation of a comprehensive vision for the bus network to support the existing and
planned rapid transit corridors and promote mobility throughout the region.



Establish a vision for rail services offered on the existing and planned rail network.

New Service
Currently the only anticipated increase in service will be as a result of the two new FasTracks
lines opening in 2019 and 2020 and improvements on SH 119 which are not expected to be
implemented until 2025. The G line is now scheduled to open on April 26, 2019. The N Line is
scheduled to open in 2020. Ridership on the G-line is anticipated to be 2.9 million boardings in
2020 and the N line is 2020.
Service Standards
There are two primary applications for the ongoing use of the service standards. These are the
use of standards to evaluate existing services, and use of standards to evaluate proposals for
new service. The application of standards to existing routes is a flexible process. To help identify
routes which are most in need of service changes, such as restructuring lower productivity
segments or branches, adjusting service frequency to better reflect the demand, recommending
promotion of less patronized routes or increasing service on high productivity routes. Elimination
of routes is only intended as a last resort, when it has been determined that no cost-effective
actions are available to improve the productivity of the route. In many cases, it may be possible

to improve the productivity of routes that meet the minimum standards by making changes to
headways or trip times.10

Reliability - Dropped Service
One of the biggest influencers of ridership is reliability. Researchers at the University of California,
Berkeley found that some riders would switch modes if they can’t count on their bus or train.
They surveyed 123 current and 15 former San Francisco Muni riders about their perceptions of
unreliability and whether they changed their travel patterns in response. Many said they had
strategies for coping with delays, but just over half (52%) said they reduced their use of Muni.12
RTD is experiencing reliability issues particularly on fixed route bus. Although traffic congestion
plays a role through increased trip time, one of the biggest issues facing RTD is dropped service
due to labor availability. The biggest driver of dropped service is due to a lack of personnel. This
occurs because run boards are developed based on service that is desired to be delivered versus
the headcount that is available to operate the service. This has become an increasing problem
for the last several years as RTD services have greatly expanded with the opening of seven
FasTracks projects in seven years. Between 2016 and 2018, the number of lost service hours
doubled from 5,184 hours to 10,100 hours. Even with this doubling RTD still delivered over 99%
of scheduled bus service. This level of service comes at a cost both in dollars and the toll it takes
on our employees. Since 2016, RTD has been covering shifts by requiring bus operators to work
a 6th day, i.e. one of their scheduled days off. This has contributed to turnover rates and difficulty
in recruiting. In 2018, through the negotiation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement with the
union, RTD was able to increase starting bus and light rail operator salaries by 10% and provide
an 8% raise for all union employees in 2018, a 3% raise in 2019, and a 3% raise in 2020. In
addition, some working conditions have improved. However, in order to deliver the scheduled
service, we are still requiring employees to work on their sixth day. Some progress has been
made. In 2018 we hired 309 new bus operators and lost 239 which is a net increase of 69
operators. This is significantly better than 2017 where we hired 261 new operators and lost 286
for a net decrease of 25 operators. There is opportunity to continue to optimize service and
continue strong recruitment and retention efforts to maximize headcount. We will also initiate
preparation for and begin labor negotiations in 2020.
Reliability - Transit Priority
In 2015, Denver Regional Transportation District (RTD) completed the Network Analysis of
Potential Improvements to Bus Speed, Delay, & Access Study to identify corridors throughout the
region where transit enhancement investments would have the greatest impact on operating
performance and customer satisfaction. RTD utilized a multi-tier screening methodology based
on passenger loads, route and network performance, and network connectivity to establish the

The RTD’s approach is to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel markets.
All services are designed to match the level of service with demand, thus improving performance
and sustainability. This results in multiple domains of acceptable performance for the various
classes of service. Standards are best set by first determining measures of performance and
objectives. The core objective is to maximize overall ridership, to the extent allowed by the
available resources.11

2.1.c



Reduce bus travel time to reduce transit passenger travel time.



Reduce the variability of bus travel time to improve schedule reliability and the consumer
experience.



Improve bus stop siting, security, and amenities to reduce dwell and increase
attractiveness for passengers.



Integrate transit stops into the adjacent urban form for better accessibility.13

As a result of the study, RTD identified a network of 24 high priority corridors throughout the
region. Several of these corridors are currently being addressed as part of other studies. RTD
consulted with the cities of Denver, Aurora, and Boulder to narrow the list of remaining corridors
to the following seven, which are currently being addressed:


Havana Street – from Dartmouth Ave. to Montview Blvd. (Aurora)



Broadway Street – from Baseline Rd. to Iris Ave. (Boulder)



Federal Boulevard – from W Evans Ave. to W 38th Ave. (Denver)



W Colfax Avenue – from Oak St to N. Broadway (Denver/Lakewood)



Downing Street – from E Colfax Ave to E 38th Ave. (Denver)



E 17th and 18th Avenues – from N. Broadway to Colorado Blvd. (Denver)



E 12th Avenue – from N. Broadway to Colorado Blvd. (Denver)

In addition, the Mobility Choice Blueprint includes tactical objective 2.4: Implement transit priority
on all major bus corridors. We will continue to work with Denver, Aurora, and Boulder to
implement recommendations of the Network Analysis Study.
Ticketing and Collaborations
One of the things that helps to attract and keep riders is convenience. RTD has been working
with several partners to improve the way customers can interact with RTD.
In 2017, RTD implemented the Mobile Ticketing app through a contract with mobile ticketing
vendor Masabi. The mobile ticketing app, which received high customer satisfaction rating, has
sold over 1.5 million tickets and represents 8% of total fare revenue. In 2019, RTD entered into
a collaboration with Uber. In the Uber app, you can view transit options along with Uber options
and compare prices and length of time to reach your destination. In early summer, you will also
be able to purchase an RTD ticket on the Uber app.
RTD just recently collaborated with Lyft for trip planning. Lyft is also interested in collaborating
with RTD to expand the Lyft app to include ticketing. RTD is also working with public organizations
such as the Colorado Department of Transportation’s intercity bus service, Bustang, to allow joint
purchase of tickets.

corridors with the highest potential to benefit from transit-priority treatments. Recommended
improvements range from stop consolidation, bus bulbs, transit signal priority, bus lanes, all door
boarding, to bus stop enhancements. We anticipate that some of these improvements will be
partially funded through the DRCOG 2020-2023 Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP)
supplemented by local match funds.

RTD implemented its SmartCard system in 2013 with the EcoPass, NecoPass, and CollegePass.
In 2017, we went live with the MyRide card for the general public. The SmartCard system is a
card based system where the information about the rider and the fare resides on the card. For
example, if a customer is eligible for a discount the customer has to buy a card that is programed
with a discount. They can’t buy a regular MyRide card and get the discount. In addition, when
value is loaded on the card via the internet, it can take days before the value is loaded and days
before the value is deducted when a ride is taken Changing fares or fare structure is very tedious
and costly. However, most recently RTD applied for and received a grant from DRCOG, to convert
to an account based system. This account based system would utilize more up to date technology
that allow the information to be stored in a “back office.” This means better options for the
customer on how they pay, how discounts are applied, speed at processing transactions, and
most importantly convenience. We will continue to explore new partnership with public and
private partners to improve trip planning and ticketing options; and work on implementation of
the new account based ticketing system.
