BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

From:

William C. Van Meter,

Subject:

Approval of On-to-Off and Onboard Passenger
Surveys Consultant Selection

Assistant

Date: November 25, 2014
General

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 16, 2014

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to ETC Institute for
the completion of an on-to-off and onboard passenger surveys project for an amount not to exceed
$1,435,000. Funding is included in the FasTracks 2015 budget.
BACKGROUND
This action supports and fulfills the General Manager Goals of Grow riders and engage customers
across the region because it will collect relevant data for the understanding of RTD passengers; and
Continue advancement of FasTracks because it moves RTD further toward completion of the full
FasTracks Plan.
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires recipients of Full Funding Grant Agreements
(FFGAs) to complete “Before and After” studies and regularly update travel forecasting models for
the projects receiving grants. On-to-off and onboard passenger surveys collect important data for
understanding the context in which RTD passengers make their travel decisions. The data from these
surveys will be used in the development of the required “Before and After” studies of the West Rail
Line and Eagle project and for travel model updates used to develop RTD ridership forecasts.
DISCUSSION
The Civil Rights Division set a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goal of 15% of the contract
value and a Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) requirement of 20% of the personnel. Four teams submitted
proposals. The prime contractors were Dikita, ETC Institute, NuStats, and OGx. The evaluation team
consisted of four RTD staff members and one staff member from the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG). ETC Institute is committed to meeting the DBE goal and WIN requirement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project will come from a combination of local FasTracks funds from the West Rail
Line and a mix of federal and local FasTracks funds from the Eagle Project. Funding is included in
the FasTracks 2015 budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents
necessary to award a contract to ETC Institute for the completion of an on-to-off and onboard
passenger surveys project for an amount not to exceed $1,435,000. Funding is included in
the FasTracks 2015 budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because it would violate

the Full Funding Grant Agreement requirement for passenger surveys as part of the Before and
After Studies for the West Rail Line and Eagle project.

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors reappoint
three members of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee to
an additional three-year term and appoint three new members to the Committee to a three-year term.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the General Manager’s goal to continue advancement of FasTracks. The

relating to the implementation of the voter approved FasTracks program, and performs such additional

Five current members’ terms expire on December 31, 2014.

local publications and stakeholder e-mail distributions beginning September 15, 2014. Applicants were
asked to submit a one-page letter stating their interest in serving on the CAC along with specific
qualifications, highlights of related experience and expertise and a resume if available. A total of 14
applications were received by the October 27, 2014 deadline. Four current members are eligible for
reappointment and three of the four expressed an interest in continuing to serve on the Committee.
The Nominating Committee decided, based on attendance, participation at meetings and Committee
consistency to recommend reappointment of the three current members who requested reappointment.
The Nominating Committee then carefully reviewed each application received in order to fill the final
position, considering criteria outlined in the Committee Structure adopted by the Board in 2005,
including:
