#### 1. Approval of On-to-Off and Onboard Passenger Surveys Consultant Selection

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to ETC Institute for the completion of an on-to-off and onboard passenger surveys project for an amount not to exceed $1,435,000. Funding is included in the FasTracks 2015 budget.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 16, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Lee Cryer, Planning Project Manager, explained that this contract would cover two types of surveys: on-to-off and onboard passenger surveys.  He noted that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires recipients of Full Funding Grant Agreements (FFGAs) to complete “Before and After” studies as well as regularly updating travel forecasting models for projects receiving grants.  The data from the surveys will be used in the development of the required “Before and After” studies for the West Rail Line (“After” portion) and the Eagle Project (“before” portion).

Lee Cryer shared that for an on-to-off study, each passenger is handed a card as they board that shows where they got on.  These cards are collected as they get off with the surveyors noting the destination.  He said that onboard surveys are more complex.  Passengers are randomly selected and the surveyor will not only attempt to get detail trip information but also important demographic data as well.

Director Tobiassen asked for further information about the company that would be conducting the surveys, ETC Institute.  Lee Cryer stated that they are a small Market Research Firm out of suburban Kansas City.  He said they do many transportation surveys for similar peer agencies around the country.

Chair Sisk commented that when he read the recommended action it gave him heartburn related to the cost of $1.435 million and what RTD would get in return.  He understands that RTD needs to comply with the FTA’s requirements but wonders if this is something RTD could do internally.  Chair Sisk believes there are better things RTD could be doing with this money.  Lee Cryer noted that these surveys also benefit RTD as they will be an excellent supplement to the data that we already collect.

Director Walker asked what response rate is expected or how many surveys we hope to collect.  Lee Cryer stated that the goal is to get a response rate from about 10% of our boardings.

Director Folska reiterated Chair Sisk’s concerns that we were not doing these surveys in house.  She thinks this is a large amount of money for something that RTD has the facilities to do.  She noted the great work done in-house by Dennis Yaklich, Manager of Market Research.  Lee Cryer pointed out that most of RTD’s data collection is contracted out as well.

Director Anderson believes these kinds of studies are always important because RTD finds out where our riders are going and where they are coming from.  She stated that she will support this recommendation as she thinks this will give RTD valuable information for the future.

Director Menten thanked Lee Cryer for his responsiveness in answering her questions earlier.  She said that she still had several questions as follows:

- How often is RTD required to conduct District wide surveys?

- When was the last time RTD conducted a District wide survey?

- How many people does RTD need to sample in a survey?

- Where can she read the FTA’s requirements regarding a District wide survey?

Lee Cryer explained that as it relates to District wide surveys the FTA does not have specific requirements, just general guidelines.  He said the last time RTD did a complete District survey was in 2008.  The guidelines recommend doing this type of survey every 5 to 10 years.  In terms of requirements for the “Before and After” studies, this recommendations meets and supports those requirements.  He said he would work with Director Menten to help her get further information on the FTA guidelines relating to the District wide surveys.

Director Menten inquired if there would be a penalty if RTD did not comply with the “Before and After” studies.  Brian Welch, Planning Technical Services Manager, explained that this was something mandated by Congress as a way to track how these project receiving tax dollars have performed.  He believes this type of information has and will benefit other projects and transit agencies.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, pointed out that RTD has already received the money so there is very little the FTA could to do to get it back; however, the biggest issue is that RTD applies for federal grants all the time.  If RTD starts violating the terms of our grant contracts any new applications will not go well in the future.

General Manager Washington stated that this is really about RTD’s track record of doing things right, start to finish.  He said that regardless of the penalty, completing the “Before and After” studies just further shows RTD’s credibility by doing everything right.  General Manager Washington recognized the comments made by several Directors about doing the surveys in-house; however, RTD does not have the expertise to do these surveys internally.  He explained that staff always evaluates the benefit of hiring someone for a specific task or working with a consultant, and in this case working with a consultant was the best option.

Director Menten indicated that she still had additional questions that she would take offline; therefore, she will be voting ‘no’ until she gets the answers.

Director James wonders if there is an opportunity for RTD to work with the FTA on the “how” of conducting these surveys.  He wonders if there are more cost effective options for completing the surveys that are not allowed because of the FTA’s requirements.  He asked if it would be possible to use smartphone data as a way of gathering this kind of data in a more effective manner.  Lee Cryer pointed out that while this would be a way to learn about people’s trip origin and destination, it would not provide the further in-depth demographic information that we need.

Director Deadwyler noted Brian Welch’s comment that the data being collected helps other agencies.  She wonders how the study data collected so far has benefitted RTD.  Lee Cryer stated that staff has coordinated with the FTA and other similar agencies on the components of the Request for Proposal.  Director Deadwyler asked if we are paying a comparable amount for these surveys when looking at similar agencies.  Lee Cryer stated that it was comparable.

Director Solano inquired how many employees ETC Institute has and as to their qualifications.  Lee Cryer said that he did not know the exact number of employees; however, he explained that they would be using local subcontractors to do the surveying.  He stated that the individuals working for ETC Institute are market research experts with backgrounds in analysis, statistics, etc.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED.

#### 2. FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee Appointments

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors reappoint three members of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee to an additional three-year term and appoint three new members to the Committee to a three-year term.

Motion:              Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 16, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, asked Roger Sherman, CRL Associates and Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Liaison, to review the appointments with the Board.

Roger Sherman shared that three of the four members eligible for reappointment asked the Nominating Committee to do so.  In addition, there were 14 applicants for the openings.  The Nominating Committee selected five for interviews.  He said that they were impressed with all five and have even talked to the two who were not selected about being alternates.  He pointed out that all five of the finalists were graduates of the Transit Alliance’s Citizen Academy.  Roger Sherman recognized Heather Cronenberg who was in the audience.  He noted that Bill Maestas attended the Commuter Rail Car unveiling but was not able to attend the meeting due to a prior commitment.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

##### a. CAC Demographics 12-16-14

#### 1. Eagle P3 Project Update

Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, thanked everyone who attended the Commuter Rail Car unveiling.  He stated that receiving the vehicles is really a huge milestone for RTD.  He said Hyundai Rotem has been great to work with and the cars really are incredible machines.

Brian Middleton, Program Manager for Eagle P3, reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the December 2, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.  He stated that everything is progressing very well with civil design work almost 100% complete and construction at 67% complete; this means the project is on schedule for revenue service in 2016.  He reminded the Board that in September staff advised them of the issue with the Jersey Cutoff Bridge.  He said that the reconstruction is going very well and should not impact the schedule.  He reiterated that RTD is not incurring any costs for replacing the bridge.

Brian Middleton shared that an Independent Design Check (IDC) has been done on all structures and reviewed by RTD staff.  He stated that through the IDC a number of design deficiencies were identified; DTP is developing fixes that will be approved by RTD before they are implemented.  He stressed that these deficiencies do not affect the safety of the general public.  The issues really affect the durability of the structures, not the capacity.  Brian Middleton explained that, similar to the Jersey Cutoff Bridge, RTD is not responsible for any costs associated with correcting the design deficiencies.  He commented that while this is a very significant issue, the approach that DTP has adopted is very positive.

Committee Chair Hoy stated that the Commuter Rail Car unveiling was very exciting.  He thinks that for many people this makes the project feel like a reality.

Director Bagley thought it was great to be able to view the new vehicles.  He commented that recently there have been many news stories about the issues regarding the hotel and station at DIA.  He wonders if there is any validity to these concerns.  Brian Middleton stated that DIA’s challenges were not affecting RTD at all.  The airport station is largely complete and the coordination between our contractor and DIA has been amazing.  Rick Clarke noted that early in the project it was identified that one of the biggest risks would be DIA not finishing their work on-time, therefore interfering with our schedule; however, DIA finished their commitments as planned.

Director Bagley inquired about the two potential stations that were part of our Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with DIA and the City and County of Denver (CCD), one at the Fulenwider property and one around 64th and Tower.  Brian Middleton stated that the station at the Fulenwider property is under construction.  It is a matter of determining if there is a need for the station on opening day based on the maturity of development in the area.  Rick Clarke noted that it is good that platforms are complete because it would be very difficult to construct them under revenue service.  Brian Middleton shared that there are continuing conversations about the station at 64th and Tower, but staff has been very clear that construction on this station will not begin until after revenue service has begun.

Director Bagley said that it was his understanding that the station addition policy in reference to the 64th and Tower station had not yet been passed by the Board.  He wondered what Board action was required to build this station.  Brian Middleton pointed out that the IGA with CCD and DIA contained a provision for two additional stations.  Marla Lien explained that the Board had already given its approval through approval of the IGA.

Director Lubow asked if the number of design deficiencies identified through the IDC was in line with, more than, or less than staff would expect for a project this size.  Brian Middleton stated that the magnitude of the deficiencies is abnormal.  Director Lubow expressed concern that there might have been a lapse in oversight.  Brian Middleton reiterated that none of the defects affect safety; they are really related to the required lifespan of 60 years.  Rick Clarke reminded the Board that due to the structure of a P3 RTD is held harmless.  If RTD was working directly with the designer we could be in big trouble.  Director Lubow asked if DTP has explained why the errors occurred.  Brian Middleton said that staff had been focused on getting they errors fixed but would do a thorough investigation once that process was complete.

Director Walker shared that he has been part of several construction projects and he has yet to see one without errors.  The important thing is that they are caught and fixed now rather than later.  He expressed how impressed he is with the team hanging 47,900 door hangers.  Director Walker believes that person to person contact is invaluable; this is the kind of contact that really counts when it comes to public perception.

Director Deadwyler inquired if Smith Road was in fact fully open.  She thought Brian Middleton mentioned that as part of the presentation but when she drove through several days before and it was not fully open.  Brian Middleton said he would look into it further and get back to Director Deadwyler.

Director Solano wondered why the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CMRF) was only given a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO).  Brian Middleton explained that was the normal process. The TCO is issued so that people may work in the building and finish the inside.  Once that is complete the building will be issued the final Certificate of Occupancy.

Committee Chair Hoy asked if the Commuter Rail Cars will be stored at the CRMF as they arrive.  Brian Middleton stated that was correct.

General Manager Washington stressed the beauty in the P3 delivery model.  This method requires that the private sector has “skin in the game”.  He reiterated that it is the in the best interest of DTP to repair, replace, etc. the bridges now rather than once the line is in revenue services due to the terms of the availability payments.  He believes in a straight design-build the contractor would be trying to walk away and give us the keys to a bad bridge.

##### a. Eagle P3 Update December 2014 compliant final

### D. Other Matters

Director Walker reminded the Board that the Approval of the Investment Policy was postponed at the last Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting to the December 9, 2014 Meeting.  He said that a summary of changes will be included in this weeks’ packet.  Director Walker noted that as of yet no one has called Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, or staff to discuss the revisions.  He encouraged the Board to meet with staff before Tuesday should they need clarification.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Hoy declared the meeting adjourned at 8:10 p.m. to the Planning and Development Committee Meeting.
