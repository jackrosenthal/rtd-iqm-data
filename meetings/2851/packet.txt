Subject:

Board Meeting Date:
Revised Board Expense Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Chair of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the revised RTD Board of Directors Expense Policy and Procedures Manual (expense
policy), as presented to the Finance, Administration, & Audit Committee, and that the Board Office staff
be permitted to incorporate additional non-substantive ministerial or grammatical changes or conforming
amendments as necessary without the need for further Board approval following the Board’s adoption of
the recommended action.
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2019 Core Goal #2 – Strong & Ethical
Leadership.
BACKGROUND
The expense policy is a Board-approved document that governs the process for the reimbursement of
expenses incurred by Directors pursuant to §§32-9-114 (1) (d) and 32-9-117, Colorado Revised
Statutes. The policy was last reviewed and approved by the Board in November 2016.
DISCUSSION
The proposed non-substantive revisions to the policy are an effort to:
 Employ a uniform system of punctuation, capitalization, and wording;
 Eliminate obsolete, inaccurate, or redundant references;
 Correct obvious errors and inconsistencies;
 Clarify existing policy and modernize terminology.
Also attached to this recommended action, though not included in the proposed revisions to the draft
expense policy, is a separate amendment from Director Walker concerning a change regarding the
submittal of itemized receipts for incurred expenses totaling less than $10.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of the revised expense policy.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To adopt the proposed revisions to the expense policy.
2. To reject by way of amendment some of the proposed revisions.
3. To reject all revisions to the expense policy. This is not the preferred alternative.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The Regional Transportation District Act, specifically in sections 32-9-114 (d) and
32-9-117, establishes the authority for reimbursement of necessary expenses
pertaining to the activities of the District.
1.0.

General Policy

Directors are eligible for reimbursement from the District for reasonable expenses
incurred that are necessary to the transaction of official District business. Each
Director must, at all times, exercise sound judgment when incurring and submitting
such expenses, in keeping within the standards and proprieties of an agency
supported by public tax dollars.
Each Director’s annual budget is as follows:
Travel Expense and
Conferences Annually
$6000.00

Local Expense Annually

IT Expenses Annually

$4000.00

1680.00

At the discretion of the Chair, the Board Office may transfer monies between a
Director’s Travel and Local budget accounts to cover expenses incurred or anticipated
to be incurred by the Director. IT expenses eligible for reimbursement are outlined in
Section 5.0, Business Communications. Directors may not transfer monies from their
IT expense budgets to either Local or Travel budgets. A Director may not transfer
expense monies to another Director. The Chair may, at his or her discretion, utilize
monies from the Chair’s discretionary funds to pay for another Director’s travel or
local expenses.
The Board of Directors may choose to periodically limit by way of resolution the
amount annually allocated to the Directors’ expense accounts as the economy and
the fiscal sustainability of the District dictate.
The Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District has taken formal action
to delegate authorization for travel necessary to the transaction of official business
as follows:
1. The Chair may authorize, within budget limitations, business travel expenses
for Directors to consult with Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Federal
Railroad Administration (FRA), other federal agencies, or the Congressional
Delegation in Washington, D.C., on matters pertaining to RTD activities.
2. The Chair may authorize, within budget limitations, conference travel
expenses for Directors to attend transit industry related conferences.
3. The Chair may authorize, within budget limitations, training travel expenses
for Directors to attend educational workshops.
4. The Chair may authorize, within budget limitations, business travel expenses
for Directors to visit other transit properties.

and related expenses.
6. The allowable expenses contained in this document include air travel, food,
lodging, business communications, gratuities, and other such reimbursable
expenses detailed in Section 2.0, Reimbursable Expenses.
The Chair may choose to deny a request from a Director for travel not covered by
items 1-6 above, refer the request to the Executive Committee, or both. The Chair
may refer any travel request to the Executive Committee without the Chair’s prior
determination on the request.
A Director whose request for travel has been denied by the Chair or the Executive
Committee may appeal for reconsideration of the denial by the full Board. Unless the
travel request is subsequently approved, the Board Office cannot make further travel
arrangements related to the denied trip. A Director is not eligible for reimbursement
for the cost of any unapproved travel costs or arrangements booked by the Director.
The Chair must deny the travel request of any Director who has expended or will
have expended prior to the trip all monies from the Director’s travel budget, unless
the Chair elects to pay for the Director’s trip expenses using the Chair’s discretionary
funds.
The Board of Directors may not incur expenses to any RTD departmental (except
Board Office) or non-departmental budget code. All incurred travel related-expenses
eligible for reimbursement by a Director must be charged to the Director’s travel
Budget.
For any travel in the last three months of service of a Director’s term, the District
cannot reimburse expenses for transit conferences to Directors who have not met
the statutory requirements to be placed on the ballot for re-election or who are term
limited. Special travel requests by these Directors to complete special projects or
those who have been approved to speak on behalf of the agency can be reviewed
for approval by the full Board, within budget limitations.
A Director is eligible for reimbursement for normal, customary event expenses
incurred by the Director and a spouse, significant other, or guest if the event is a
local, transit-related event sponsored by RTD. The expenses of the Director and the
Director’s spouse, significant other, or invited guest, are paid from the Director’s
local expense fund. (Resolution __ Series of 2019).
While the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission has ruled that Article XXIX of
the State Constitution (also referred to as Amendment 41) pertaining to ethics in
government does not specifically apply to the RTD Board, the recommendation from
RTD’s General Counsel is for Directors to refrain from accepting anything of greater
than nominal value in the exercise of their official duties. A Director who attends,
as a function of his or her official duties, a meal or event for which the expected
value of attendance exceeds $50.00is responsible for the cost of the Director’s
attendance. Directors may submit itemized receipts for reimbursement, or the Board

Reimbursable Expenses

To protect the interest of the District and to provide guidelines for the Directors to
follow, the following provisions govern allowances for out of town and local business
related expenses within established budget limits. Only business expenses may be
claimed. The purchase of alcohol is not reimbursable and should not be reflected on
submitted receipts.
In order to be eligible for reimbursement for an ordinary and necessary RTD business
related expense, the Director must submit a proper itemized receipt showing the cost,
time, date, business purpose, and the name and title of any qualifying attendee, if
applicable. An ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in one’s field
of trade, business or profession. Examples of ordinary and necessary local expenses
include mileage reimbursement, conference or seminar registration fees, parking,
business meeting expenses, and attendance at transit-related or community events
that are considered a necessary part of conducting District business. Political
meetings partisan conferences or political group activities cannot be covered as an
RTD expense.
In order to be reimbursed for meals and event expenses, Directors must submit an
itemized receipt. If meetings between Directors and either employees or business
contacts take place outside of the District office, the meal costs are equally divided
among the Directors attending and charged to each Director’s local expense account
accordingly. Directors are not eligible for reimbursement for meals or event fees
incurred by spouses, significant others, or guests except as described in Section 1.0,
General Policy.
In the event that RTD purchases a table for an event for which not all seats are
claimed by Directors and staff, a Director may request additional seats on a firstcome, first-served basis and may invite a guest at no cost to the Director’s local
expense account.
Expenses for meals submitted without a proper itemized receipt and documentation
of time, place and purpose will only be reimbursed $10.00 at the discretion of the
Chair.
Board or Committee Meetings are typically arranged at the convenience of Directors
to coincide with meal times and are considered a District expense. If meetings
between Directors and employees or business contacts take place outside of the
District offices, the meal cost will be equally divided among the Directors attending
and charged to their local expense accounts accordingly. In order to be reimbursed
for these meal costs, Directors must provide an itemized receipt.

the Board Office, the Director cannot be reimbursed for meals or lodging fees for the
day or days of the early departure or late stay. For any additional airline fees or
charges incurred as the result of a flight change due to an early departure or late
stay, the Director must bear the cost as a personal expense.
The following expense categories may be claimed as a necessary part of
conducting District business:
 Registration fees (with approval and receipt only)
 Air transportation
 Ground transportation and tolls
 Mileage for personal vehicles
 Parking fees
 Lodging and travel internet expenses
 Personal meals for out-of-town travel or approved local conferences, as
outlined in section 4
 Business meeting expenses, both local and travel
 Gratuities – housekeeping, transportation and restaurant with receipts
 Cell phone fees associated with travel
 Rental car
 Postage for District business only
 Toner cartridges
 Other expenses identified for the benefit of the District.
The following expenses are not authorized for reimbursement unless approved by the
Chair:
 Personal expenses such as personal hygiene items, magazines, in-room

pet care, etc.
 Travel insurance (note:
All Directors receive Travel and Accident
Insurance, which covers the Director while traveling on district business.
 Alcohol (Reference RTD Drug and Alcohol policy)

The Chair has discretion in approving Director expenses. If requested expenses do
not fall within the expense guidelines, the Chair must seek advice and
recommendations from the Executive Committee.
The Chair may authorize Director travel to locations for the purpose of coordinating
with governmental agencies, consultants, contractors, or for participation in
professional meetings deemed in RTD’s best interest. Attendance will be authorized
if the meeting offers a substantial benefit to the conduct of District business or
enhancing professional advancement of the Director.

Travel Request Process
3.1. Reservations

Travel arrangements for the RTD Directors are typically handled by the Board Office.
Travel authorizations signed by the Chair are required for all travel. Directors should
contact the office at least 30 days in advance and provide all information needed to
complete the airline and hotel accommodations. If a Director chooses to make his or
her own travel arrangements, all travel confirmations are to be provided to the Board
Office at the time of booking for the purpose of providing travel packets.
When requesting travel arrangements, Directors should provide the following
information to the Board Office:
 Purpose of the trip
 Destination
 Requested arrival and departure time
 Preferred airline and frequent flyer number (if applicable)
 Any applicable discounts, credits or travel miles to be utilized
 Special considerations
 Travel advance required
Unless prior approval is obtained, the Board Office arranges Directors’ travel on the
most economical fare for the required journey and makes every effort to book the
Directors their desired flights and host hotel accommodations. The Board Office
provides travel packets to each Director with the flight and hotel confirmation,
transportation information, a copy of the event registration and agenda, and other
pertinent travel materials, including an envelope for receipts and travel advance, if
requested, as described in Section 3.2, Travel Advance.
Travel requests received less than seven business days before the scheduled trip are
processed based on the most current rates and availability. A travel approval must
be submitted prior to booking any travel, and a travel advance cannot be issued due
to such short notice.
3.2.

Travel Advance

Directors may request a travel advance up to the amount of the $200.00 for
estimated out-of-pocket expense that will be incurred, less any expenses paid directly
by RTD. Advances should be limited to expenses such as registration fees and
lodging (if not pre-paid by RTD), ground transportation, meals, and gratuities.
A Director seeking a travel advance must request the advance for anticipated travel
expenses at least three weeks prior to the expected departure. Cash advances
cannot be granted unless sufficient funds are available in the requesting Director’s
budget account and are issued through General Accounting approximately five days
prior to departure. The Director is responsible for submitting the final expense form
within 30 days after return to the District and must remit any unused cash advance

Travel Arrangements
4.1.

Transportation
4.1.1. Air Transportation
Air transportation for travel to out-of-District conferences and events is typically
arranged by the RTD Board Office. Travel by indirect routes, or inclusion of side-trips
for personal reasons, must be approved by the Chair. Reimbursement for travel
expenses in a host city is allowed one day before the start of a conference or one
day following scheduled conference events where travel scheduling provisions or
same day flight times are not available or convenient, such as when a Director would
need to fly from Denver to Washington, D.C., on Saturday to arrive in time for a
conference with a start day of Sunday, and no flights are available for the Director
to arrive in time for the Sunday meeting start time.
Directors are responsible for any portion of ticket costs resulting from personal side
trips (including hotel, food, ground transportation, and parking). Airfare is calculated
on a pro-rated basis, but under no circumstance is RTD’s expense to exceed the
economy class or equivalent direct-route pricing.
If the RTD air travel is a portion of another planned flight that has been arranged
directly by the Director, a copy of the itinerary and ticket claiming reimbursement
must be provided to the Board Office at the time of booking and with the expense
report form.
A Director is responsible for any first-class, business class, stretch seating, and prorata boarding expenses.
Directors who wish to use their frequent flyer miles (if applicable) must provide the
Board Office with the frequent flyer number at the time of the booking. The Board
Office requests this information in advance, but it is the sole responsibility of the
Director to ensure his or her account has been credited with the frequent flyer mileage
information.
All air transportation credits paid for by RTD are to be utilized in the booking of future
Director travel only and are not for personal use.
4.1.2. Ground Transportation
Directors are eligible for reimbursement for the actual expense of ground
transportation necessary to conduct official business. As a representative for the
transit agency, Directors are expected to utilize the most efficient, timely, and costeffective ground transportation when traveling locally or out of town, namely public
transit, shuttlebus service, transportation network company such as UBER or LYFT,
taxi, or rental car, in this order of preference. If a Director pays for the transportation

monies to RTD in the form of a check at the time of submitting the final expense
form.

1.B.1.b

4.1.3. Car Rental
Car rental expenses are permitted only with prior approval of the RTD Board Chair
and only when absolutely necessary in the event that another means of transportation
is not feasible. Rental car arrangements should be made by the Board Office staff.
Travel between the airport and the hotel or conference center by rental car or other
means are eligible for reimbursement with receipts provided that the Chair has
authorized the rental.
The rental car should be contracted for a size appropriate for the number of
passengers. The Director must include a copy of the rental contract when submitting
the expense report. Reasonable parking and storage fees for rental cars may be
claimed for reimbursement. Note: Travelers must ensure that adequate insurance
coverage is in place by purchasing optional insurance coverage as part of the rental
agreement. Cars are to be refueled before returning to the rental agency.
4.1.4. Personal Vehicles and Travel Outside the District Other Than
by Air
The use of personal vehicles outside of the District is not encouraged. Directors must
have the Chair’s approval prior to using a personal vehicle for official business outside
the boundaries of the District. This includes local conferences covered in Section
4.6, In-State Travel.
If a Director chooses to travel by car or long distance rail rather than by air, the Board
Office staff will follow established guidelines to determine the lowest available flight
cost to and from the destination. If use of a personal vehicle is requested, the
Director is eligible for reimbursement for the cost of mileage up to the maximum
allowable under the Internal Revenue Service guidelines but not to exceed the cost
of air travel to the destination. The cost of the air travel is to be determined by the
Board Office staff prior to the date of travel to determine the amount that may be
reimbursed for mileage. The determination is established by example of other
Director’s airfare for the same trip or by research of the lowest fares. All supporting
documentation must be submitted by the Board Office staff along with the Director’s
expense form.
4.1.5. Mileage Reimbursement
The standard vehicle mileage allowance is determined annually by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Board Office verifies with the RTD Accounts Payable
Supervisor the most current rates at the start of each calendar year and includes this
amount in each Director’s local and travel expense spreadsheet.
All local mileage incurred by a Director is paid through the local expense cost code
to the Director on all submitted travel expense forms. Round-trip travel to the airport
locally is included in this expense if agency-issued transit passes are unable to be
used.

of other Directors or staff, all names are to be documented on the receipt and expense
report for reimbursement.

4.2. Lodging (Hotel Accommodations)
The Board Office typically books lodging accommodations via P-Card for each
Director attending an out-of-District event. In the event these fees are not pre-paid,
the Director must submit a copy of the official hotel bill with the expense report when
claiming reimbursement.
The Board Office makes reasonable arrangements at the single occupancy rate for
hotel accommodations in accordance with acceptable standards for that location.
For APTA conferences, hotel reservations cannot be booked until the attendee is
registered for the conference. Directors should inform the Board Office staff in a
timely manner they wish to attend a conference, otherwise the conference hotel
could fill up.
Hotels typically require a personal credit card for the person staying at the hotel for
purpose of incidental expenditures. Arrangements made via RTD P-Card only cover
room and tax. Upon check in, the Directors will need to provide the front desk with
their own personal credit cards for miscellaneous expenses. When checking out,
Directors must ensure that their personal credit cards were not charged for room and
tax.
Note* For Directors using a debit or bank card to cover miscellaneous expenses, the
hotel may place a hold on the card in a set amount for the duration of the stay.
Directors are eligible for reimbursement for the actual cost of lodging, including room
charges and taxes. Charges other than room charges or taxes appearing on the hotel
bill may be reimbursable upon submittal of a completed, signed expense report
accompanied by itemized receipts. Directors must use sound judgment in the
selection of lodging in keeping with the purpose of the travel so as to minimize the
cost to the District. Lodging or hotel accommodations billed to a P-Card require
itemized receipts to match to the actual incurred amount.
When a Director is accompanied by another individual, the District is to be billed only
for the single-occupancy rate for lodging. The Director must pay for the difference
between single- and double-occupancy rate for the room, if applicable.
4.3. Meals
Directors are eligible for reimbursement for daily personal meals and gratuities with
the submittal of an itemized receipt and documentation that identifies the time, place,
and business purpose.
Directors may claim reimbursement for travel expenses, including meals and
gratuities, incurred one day before the start of a conference or one day following a
conference where travel scheduling provisions or same-day flight times are not
available or convenient, such as when a Director would need to fly from Denver to
Washington, D.C., on Saturday to arrive in time for a conference with a start day of
Sunday, and no flights are available for the Director to arrive in time for the Sunday

1.B.1.b

1.B.1.b

When attending an out-of-District event or conference for which meals are provided,
Directors are expected to reduce the number of meals for which they intend to be
reimbursed by the number of meals that are provided at the event or conference.
However, a Director is eligible for reimbursement for a meal purchased outside of the
conference if the Director submits an itemized receipt explaining the business purpose
for the meal.
4.4. Miscellaneous Expenses
Miscellaneous expenses such as meal gratuities are to be included with each meal
and indicated on the receipt submitted with the expense report. Reasonable gratuities
for baggage handling at airports or the place of lodging upon arrival and departure
are allowable and must be shown as a separate item under “miscellaneous expense”
on the expense report. Baggage fees paid to airlines for travel must be accompanied
with a receipt. Gratuity for housekeeping during lodging is an allowable expense.
Directors are not eligible for reimbursement for personal calls. Calls for District
business are fully reimbursable as long as documentation related to the person called
and the subject of the call is included with the expense report. A Director who claims
reimbursement for monthly cell phone service may not claim a business call as a
separate, additional expense if the call is also included in the monthly service.
Directors traveling out of the country should coordinate with the Board Office to
determine the most cost-effective means of carrying out RTD-related communications
during the time the Director is traveling.
4.5.

In State Travel

Directors travelling within the state but outside the District to attend seminars,
conferences, or transit-related meetings are eligible for reimbursement for travel
expenses so long as the location is more than two-hours’ driving distance each way
or greater than 160 miles from the point of origin. Covered expenses include
registration fees, lodging, standard mileage, and food when accompanied with valid
itemized receipts and expense reports showing time, place, and purpose. Directors
are not eligible for reimbursement for lodging expenses without the prior approval of
the Chair if the location of an event is within two-hours’ driving distance or less than
160 miles from the point of origin. For additional information regarding in state travel
see section 4.1.4 Personal Vehicles and Travel outside the District other than Air.
(Approved Travel and Local policy, November 20, 2007)

Business Communications (cell phone, internet)

Within the first three months after being elected/appointed and subsequently sworn
in, Directors are eligible for reimbursement for an initial home office setup package.
Eligible equipment includes a smart phone, high-speed internet equipment such as a

go early or stay late for personal reasons. (See Section 2.0, Reimbursable Expenss.)
Directors must provide itemized receipts for incurred travel-related expenses.

cable modem and router, fax machine, and printer. The Director is responsible for
selection, use, ownership, loss, and replacement of all equipment after initial
reimbursement by the District. Directors may opt to purchase the equipment or utilize
RTD-owned equipment. Equipment purchased by Directors and reimbursed as part
of the initial $700 set up fee is considered RTD property. All equipment provided by
the District remains the property of the District and must be returned upon the
Director’s departure from office. RTD-owned equipment is subject to RTD rules for
the use and handling of agency-owned equipment, including but not limited to policies
governing the type of information permitted to be stored or accessed on the computer
or smart phone. The total package selected is subject to the $700 initial setup limit.
(Added per the changes in travel and local policy approved November 20, 2007)
In the alternative, Directors may use their existing equipment or may acquire their
own equipment for use in conducting their official duties. To be eligible for
reimbursement for recurring IT expenses, a Director must submit on a monthly basis
documentary evidence such as a telephone bill indicating the time, place, amount,
and business purpose, which is sufficient to meet the IRS requirement for time, place
and business purpose for equipment purchase or usage. The first land-line telephone
into a home is considered personal and cannot be reimbursed as a business expense.
Monthly reimbursement claims that are not accompanied by supporting
documentation are not eligible for reimbursement.
RTD IT covers the cost of each Director’s first technical home visit each year, for the
purpose of providing IT consultation and verification that the Director’s personal or
agency-provided hardware and equipment is in good working order. An outside
vendor, rather than an RTD staff member, is responsible for the technical home visit.
6.0.

Publications

Directors are eligible for an annual allowance of up to $95 for local publications.
Directors should identify, on an annual basis, publications to which they subscribe
and submit their subscription costs on their monthly local expense report.
(Added per the changes in travel and local policy approved November 14, 2006)
7.0.

Conference Registrations

Registration fees for conferences, workshops, or other approved events are typically
pre-paid directly by the Board Office. In circumstances where a Director pays for his
or her own registration fees, the Director is eligible for reimbursement and must
submit with the expense report when claiming reimbursement a receipt or proof of
fee and a copy of the program setting forth any fees for registration.
The Board cannot exceed its budget allocations for conferences, seminars, and other
such events. Out-of-District registration fees for the first two sanctioned events for
each Director are not charged against the Director’s expenses, subject to the
limitations indicated below. Local registration fees are charged to the Directors’ local
expenses. The Chair monitors the Board expenditures on a quarterly basis.

Local Conferences/Seminars

Directors are eligible for reimbursement for expenditures or fees incurred while
attending local seminars, technical meetings, or meetings related to professional
development upon submittal of a local expense report along with appropriate receipts.
Such fees are charged to the Director’s local expense budget.
7.2.

Out of Town Conferences

The Chair is responsible for reviewing Directors’ travel authorization requests to
attend out-of-District conferences, such as APTA conferences and Rail~Volution.
Each Director is permitted to attend up to two such sanctioned out-of-District
conferences each year. Budget permitting, the Chair may choose to permit individual
Directors to attend additional transit industry-related conferences. The Board Office
is responsible for registering attending Directors, and the office pays the registration
fees for the first two sanctioned conferences using the office’s general budget rather
than the Directors’ individual travel expense budgets.
8.0.

Professional Affiliations/Membership Subscriptions

The Regional Transportation District encourages development of Directors through
active membership in professional organizations.
Although membership in
professional affiliations can be an indirect benefit to RTD as an organization, the main
benefit is the development of the Director, by allowing the Director to keep abreast
of trends in their transportation or technology, cultivate networks with other
professionals, and develop skills and ideas to become more effective in their policymaking at RTD. Any memberships that are of an extraordinary cost or that require
approval will go before the Executive Committee for approval.
Membership subscriptions in local chambers or approved organizations are processed
through the RTD Public Relations Office. Directors should submit their membership
requests through the Board office who will track and coordinate with the RTD staff
responsible for payment. Organizations must meet the criteria of being transit-related
and/or necessary to the conduct of business and local community involvement.
Membership requests that do not fit this criterion must be approved through the
General Manager’s budget. The Board policy on Organizational Memberships was
passed in August of 2011.
For budgeted events only, such as the Board Member/Board Support conference
hosted by the Board in 2015, the budget allocations for specific events serve as the
official authorization for the Chair to approve. For out-of-District budgeted events
only, the “RTD Travel Request and Authorization” form and the expense report
require approval from the Chair.

A Director is eligible for reimbursement for normal, customary expenses associated
with attending an event for the Director and one guest, along with other approved
attendees as approved by the Chair, so long as the event is transit related. The
expenses of the Director and one guest are paid from the Director’s local expense
fund. The approved attendees will come from the general Board Office budget.
10.0. Participation in Community Non-Transit Related Events
Participation in community non-transit related events is supported by RTD with
approval of the benefit to the agency. Such events are essential in getting the
community involved in the mission and vision of RTD. At times the General Manager
or RTD outreach departments purchase a table at a community event and invite
Directors as ambassadors for RTD at no cost to the Director; any other approved
events are paid for out of the Director’s local expense budget. Should a Director
decide to purchase a table for an event in the Director’s community with local
expense funds, any unused seats are to be paid for out of the Director’s local budget
as well.
At no time can a Director’s expense funds or RTD funds be used for any event or
expenditure that is political in nature. For guidance on determining whether an
event or expenditure is political in nature, Directors should consult with RTD
General Counsel.
11.0. Travel Insurance
RTD has in force a special Travel and Accident Policy for Directors while on official
business; therefore, additional travel insurance is not eligible for reimbursement.
12.0. Expense Reports
12.1. Travel Expense Reports
Pursuant to IRS guidelines, a Director must submit a completed expense report to the
Board Office no later than the end of the month following the Director’s return to the
District. (e.g., If the trip was taken in October, the expense report is due no later
than by November 30th). The Executive Committee reserves the right to suspend the
provision of travel arrangements for any Director who is delinquent in submitting an
expense report. If extra time is needed to complete the expense report or the Director
has a valid reason for the delay, the Chair should be notified to make the decision to
extend this timeline.
The Board Office processes an expense report for each Director traveling to an outof-District conference or event. In order to provide processing time for the staff to
meet the deadline for submitting the reports to the Chair, the Directors must submit
original copies of all receipts, invoices, travel itineraries, hotel bills, and associated
documentation for expense reimbursement. Directors should submit a signed expense
report to the Board Office within two weeks after returning from the trip.

expenses are incurred or in which the Director does not wish to claim any expense,
the Director must still submit a signed report for the reporting month with zero
balance.
12.3. Expense Records
The Board Office keeps records of each Director’s submitted local and travel
expenses and provides to the Chair a quarterly summary report of all expenses
incurred by the Directors. The Board Office retains a copy of the report for audit
purposes. The Chair may request a written explanation for any outstanding expense
reports.

Board Policy Regarding Reimbursement for
Sponsored Events

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Chair of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee that the Board of
Directors approve Resolution No. ____, Series of 2019, Regarding Reimbursement for Expenses Incurred
in Order to Attend RTD-Sponsored Transit-Related Group Events, as presented to the Finance,
Administration, & Audit Committee.
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2019 Core Goal #2 – Strong & Ethical
Leadership.
BACKGROUND
In 2009 the Board adopted a resolution to allow a Director to claim reimbursement for expenses incurred
by such Director’s spouse or invited guest while accompanying the Director to certain approved local,
transit-related events. The resolution did not describe the process by which such events were approved,
thus allowing such Director to be eligible for reimbursement for the expenses so incurred.

DISCUSSION
The current resolution clarifies that a Director is eligible for reimbursement for normal, customary
event expenses incurred by the Director’s spouse, significant other, or invited guest while
accompanying the Director to a local, transit-related event that is sponsored by RTD.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To adopt the attached resolution.
2. To reject the resolution, in which case Resolution 006, Series of 2009, would remain in full force
and effect.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of the resolution.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

RESOLUTION NO. -________, SERIES OF 2019
Regarding Reimbursement for Expenses Incurred in
Order to Attend Transit-Related Group Events

WHEREAS, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) sponsors a few events per year to
which lobbyists, legislators, and other elected officials are invited; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors finds that these sponsored events are necessary to create
an informal atmosphere of cooperation where many ideas can be exchanged; and
WHEREAS, the current travel and expense policy allows for a Director to be reimbursed for
normal and customary expenses incurred by the Director and the Director’s spouse or invited
guest when attending local transit-related group events; and
WHEREAS, the current travel and expense policy further states that “RTD will not reimburse
meals for spouses unless the local event is an approved transit related event”; and
WHEREAS, the policy does not clearly define how a local transit-related event is approved,
thereby making expenses incurred by Directors eligible for reimbursement; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Directors of the Regional
Transportation District revise the Board’s travel and expense policy to state clearly that a
Director may be reimbursed for normal, customary event expenses incurred by the Director’s
accompanying spouse, significant other, or invited guest so long as the event is a local,
transit-related event sponsored by RTD.
Be it further resolved that any expenses so incurred are to be paid from such Director’s local
expense fund.
Passed and adopted by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date:

From:

John McKay, Adminstrator

GM

Date:
Subject:

Board Meeting Date:
Revised Board Bylaws

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Executive Committee and General Counsel that the Board of Directors approve
the attached resolution and the associated revised Board Bylaws, as presented to the Finance,
Administration, & Audit Committee, and that the Board Office staff be permitted to incorporate
additional non-substantive ministerial or grammatical changes or conforming amendments as necessary,
without the need for further Board approval following the Board’s adoption of the recommended action.
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2019 Core Goal #2 - Strong & Ethical
Leadership.
BACKGROUND
The Board Bylaws govern the internal affairs of the Board of Directors pursuant to the authority granted
to the Board in §32-9-114, Colorado Revised Statutes.
DISCUSSION
The proposed amendments to the Bylaws have been reviewed by General Counsel and are an effort to:
 Employ a uniform system of punctuation, capitalization, and wording;
 Eliminate obsolete, inaccurate, or redundant references;
 Correct obvious errors and inconsistencies;
 Clarify existing policy and modernize terminology.
Additionally, the proposed amendments incorporate changes to the descriptions of each of the Board’s
standing committees in order to reflect revisions to the committee’s charters recently adopted by the
Board.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To adopt the attached resolution and proposed revisions to the Board Bylaws and to allow
Board Office staff to incorporate any additional non-substantive ministerial or grammatical
changes or conforming amendments as necessary without the need for further Board
approval.
2. To reject by way of amendment some of the proposed revisions.
3. To reject the resolution and all revisions to the Bylaws. This is not the preferred
alternative.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of the resolution or the revised Board Bylaws.

 There has been no change in the Board’s funding policy since 2016 – the contribution
continues to be determined as an amount to keep the Trust “actuarially sound” based
on the recommendations of the Actuary and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer

 Last year, based on January 1, 2017 actuarial valuation results and an estimated
2017 net investment return of 14.2%, the Plan was projected to reach 100% funding in

2031 with a $5.1M contribution each year (or the recommended contribution if lower) if
all assumptions were met in the future, including a net investment return of 7.5% per
year beginning in 2018

 What changed since last year?
 The actual net investment return for 2017 was 14.2% based on the 12/31/2017 Plan audit
 The Plan experienced an asset gain of $3.1M and a liability gain of $1.1M during 2017
 The interest assumption was decreased from 7.5% to 7.0% and the demographic
assumptions were updated to reflect expected experience
 These assumption changes increased the Actuarial Accrued Liability by approximately $7.0M and the
recommended contribution by about $1.0M

 Reflecting January 1, 2018 valuation results, the Plan is projected to reach 100%
funding in 2038 (7 years later) with a $5.1M contribution each year if all actuarial

assumptions are met in the future, including a net investment return of 7.0% per year
beginning in 2018

 What happened since the final January 1, 2018 valuation results were issued?
 The Board approved a $5.6M contribution for the 2019 Fiscal Year; the actuary’s
recommended contribution was $8.0M

 The investment return in 2018 was less than the 7.0% assumption – the preliminary 2018
return is -5.2%, net of investment expenses

 Reflecting January 1, 2018 valuation results, a $5.6M contribution in 2019, a
-5.2% preliminary net return on assets in 2018, and assuming all actuarial
assumptions are realized, including a 7.0% net investment return per year beginning
in 2019:

 If future contributions are equal to $5.6M, the Plan is not expected to achieve 100% funding
 The recommended contribution ranges from $8.3M in 2020 up to $52.8M in 2031 and decreases
gradually thereafter

 If the recommended contribution is made beginning in 2020, the Plan is expected to achieve
100% funding in 2031 (end of the 13-year amortization period) and the recommended
amount is projected to drop below $5.6M in 2032
 The recommended contribution ranges from $8.3M in 2020 up to $9.2M in 2024 and down to $0.9M in
2032

 Due to the Plan’s size and nature, future investment returns have a significant impact
on projected liabilities – we will keep the Board apprised of the impact of the Plan’s
investment performance on future costs

• Pension reform (Amendment #22) is working but
the unfunded liability is “outrunning” the
solution
– Decreasing normal cost vs. increasing unfunded

• Trust no longer has depletion date

– one year of poor returns could change outlook

• Asset gains affect this year and future

– There are $2.9 million in deferred market gains still to
be recognized

• Additional contributions will likely be needed

BACKGROUND
The 2019 Budget Calendar is structured to provide the Board the opportunity to offer early, substantive
input into the development of the RTD Annual Budget and financial plans. The purpose of the attached
calendar is to assist Board members in anticipating and planning their input into the development of
specifically the 2019 Amended Budget, 2020-2025 Mid-term Financial Plan [formerly known as the
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation (APE)], the Long Range Financial
Plan, and 2020 Budget. The GM’s strategic goals developed by the Board at the March2nd Board
Advance will be incorporated into the 2020 Budget plans.
DISCUSSION
In the course of the development of the financial plans mentioned above, staff will look to the Board
to provide guidance in:
(1) 2019 Amended Budget
(2) Determining the objectives of the 2020 Budget
(3) Understanding the key cost elements in the District’s annual budget
(4) Determining the required adjustments to RTD programs and fund balance levels
(5) Developing an understanding of departmental operating expenses and capital projects
(6) Establishing and adhering to a calendar of critical milestones that make it possible for the
District to satisfy State Statutes relative to budget formation and monitoring
The suggested topics and timing in the accompanying calendar are proposed with the intent of keeping
the Board informed on critical budget information as it becomes available and allowing the Board to
develop an understanding of the key financial plans. Staff is seeking the support of the Board in moving
ahead with this plan.

Information

BACKGROUND
RTD commits to reviewing its Fare Structure and Fare Programs every three years to determine
if any additions or changes are required to provide the best options for RTD ridership and meet
RTD’s revenue targets. Over 20 months ending in mid-2018, the Pass Working Group and RTD
staff reviewed all fares and fare programs to define potential fare changes and improvements.
RTD staff presented a recommendation to the RTD Board of Directors and received approval
mid-September 2018. The goal of this project is to implement changes to the RTD Fares, Fare
Structure, and changes and additions to the Fare Programs as approved by the RTD Board of
Directors.
DISCUSSION
The 2019 fare changes were implemented as scheduled and we are now focusing on the low
income fare program development.
RTD is working with the State’s Office of Information Technology (OIT) to implement a program
for evaluating RTD riders’ eligibility for the low income program using the State’s public benefits
application system, PEAK.
RTD staff has been meeting with employees from various
departments and OIT every week for several months.
The following has been completed:





The Business Requirements Document (BRD) has been finalized. The BRD provides the
requirements necessary for OIT to develop the RTD application within the PEAK system.
The Marketing and Outreach Advisory Group held another meeting on March 7th. The
recommendations from this group are currently being considered by the Communications
Department.
Marketing has completed the MyRide card design which will be provided to the smart card
vendor in mid-March for card production.

Next Steps


Finalize the intergovernmental agreement between the State and RTD for development,
