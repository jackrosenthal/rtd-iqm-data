Packet Pg. 12

1.C.1.a

Attachment: RTD PPT Accessible 12-13 Patton Boggs (1779 : Government Relations Update)

FFGA Funding for the EAGLE P3
• FTA’s FY2014 New Starts / Small Starts budget
includes $2.1 billion in project commitments
• Absent a budget deal that replaces
sequestration, the FY2014 funding level will
be approximately $1.86 billion
• This means FTA is $240 million short of its
commitments
Packet Pg. 13

1.C.1.a

Attachment: RTD PPT Accessible 12-13 Patton Boggs (1779 : Government Relations Update)

FFGA Funding for the EAGLE P3
• FTA is proposing to use $151 million from
various pools of unobligated and recovered
funding to help close this gap
– At least part of this requires Congressional action

• Even with these funds, there would still be a
gap of almost $100 million

Packet Pg. 14

1.C.1.a

Attachment: RTD PPT Accessible 12-13 Patton Boggs (1779 : Government Relations Update)

FFGA Funding for the EAGLE P3
• The House and Senate are currently negotiating on the
budget through a conference committee
• These negotiations were set up in the legislation that
ended the government shutdown/debt ceiling standoff
• There will not be a “grand bargain.” The hope is for a
small deal that offsets sequestration for at least FY2014
• Key Deadlines:
– December 13th: Deadline for the conference committee
to reach an agreement
– January 15th: Deadline to enact spending legislation for
the rest of FY2014 before government funding expires
Packet Pg. 15

FFGA Funding for the EAGLE P3
• Our Agenda:

– Press for increased funding for New Starts if there is a
budget deal that replaces sequestration
– Work with our delegation to support FTA’s request to
utilize unobligated funds
– Fight for RTD to receive full funding (including prior
shortfalls) before new projects are funded
• Especially new Core Capacity Improvement projects for
which FTA reserves $120 million
• There will be a natural coalition of similarly situated agencies
with this position

MAP-21 Reauthorization
• The current transportation authorization law (MAP-21) expires
September 30, 2014 and will have to be extended or
reauthorized
• The fundamental question: how do we pay for it?
– As cars have become more fuel efficient, gas tax receipts into
the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) have continued to decline
– At the same time, costs for building transportation projects
have increased
– Approximately $15 billion in new revenue per year is needed
beginning in FY2015 to maintain current spending levels

Highway Trust Fund Shortfall

These charts show the substantial annual shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund
beginning in FY2015 – a total deficit of approximately $15 billion per year.
Packet Pg. 19

1.C.1.a

• The Optimistic Take
– Congressional transportation
leaders, Democratic and Republican,
are committed to putting the HTF
on sound footing and are actively
discussing the need for revenue
– Chairman Boxer (D-CA) and
Chairman Shuster (R-PA) have
proven their desire to work in a bipartisan way
– Infrastructure has been a lone
bright spot where this Congress has
been getting things done

MAP-21 Reauthorization

Chairman Barbara Boxer

Chairman Bill Shuster

Packet Pg. 20

MAP-21 Reauthorization
• The Reality Check
– Solving the revenue question is extremely challenging
– Congress has not increased the gas tax since 1993 – over
20 years ago

Congress increased the gas tax in 1983, 1990, and 1993 – but not since then. It
remains at 18.4 cents per gallon, where it has been for 20 years.
Packet Pg. 21

Attachment: RTD PPT Accessible 12-13 Patton Boggs (1779 : Government Relations Update)

1.C.1.a

Financing Options
• Raise New Long-Term Revenue
– Move towards Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) tax?
• Not on the table as deep privacy, technological and
implementation concerns remain

– Raise money from new energy exploration?
• Could be part of an eventual deal, but CBO does not score it
as raising much revenue

– Increase /index the gas tax, switch to sales tax on
gasoline, or raise non-transportation revenue?
• Very hard to see in the short-term. Greater potential as part
of larger budget deal, but no such deal is in sight
• However, if anything is going to happen, lame duck session
in late 2014 is a potential time for a deal

Packet Pg. 22

Attachment: RTD PPT Accessible 12-13 Patton Boggs (1779 : Government Relations Update)

1.C.1.a

Financing Options
• Cut The Program
– Extremely deep cuts would be required
– Proponents of devolution remain
– While cuts are always on the table, Congress has
repeatedly shown it is not willing to cut the surface
transportation program
• Another Short-term Patch
– Since 2008, Congress has kept the program at current
levels through short-term patches and $54 billion in
General Fund transfers into the HTF
– Remains the likeliest scenario at this point
– However, any transfers will almost certainly have to be
offset, making even a short-term patch a challenging issue

Packet Pg. 23

Attachment: RTD PPT Accessible 12-13 Patton Boggs (1779 : Government Relations Update)

1.C.1.a

MAP-21 Reauthorization
• Hearings will ramp up quickly in 2014 as we move into
the reauthorization cycle
– Primary focus will be on financing, especially given recent
policy overhaul in MAP-21
– Will also focus on how MAP-21 changes are being
implemented

• Other key reauthorization issues for RTD:

– Ensure RTD continues to get its fair share of federal transit
funding
– Maintain flexibility in the definition of BRT projects eligible
for New Starts funding
– Consider addressing emergent New Starts policy issues
such as FTA’s use of the horizon year for project benefits

1.C.1.a

Packet Pg. 25

Keeping Federal Stakeholders
Informed and On-Board
• One of our key focus areas is making sure that
RTD’s stakeholders in Washington, DC are
informed and up to date.
– We believe it is critical that Congressional offices
receive regular briefings on the Northwest Area
Mobility Study, North Metro proposal, US 36 BRT
progress, Southeast Corridor Extension, etc.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: November 26, 2013

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 26, 2013

Board Meeting Date: December 3, 2013

Subject:

Disposition of Surplus Property Pilot Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager and/or his designee to market and to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary to dispose of real property owned by RTD in the vicinity of WCR 27 and WCR #6 and #8, Lot
1, Block 1, Aurora Highline Subdivision, Filing No. 4 (Alameda/Havana park-n-Ride), remnants associated
with the West Corridor Rail Line at 1395 South Zuni, and vacant land at 104 th and Riverdale, Thornton,
Colorado to at least 90% of the current fair market value as determined by appraisal.
BACKGROUND
In April, 2013, staff presented to the Board an Overview of Real Property and Transit Oriented
Development, including a discussion of regulations governing real property owned by the District and
other policy and operation considerations, including Federal State and RTD regulations, financial, current
and future operational needs, and transit-oriented development opportunities and goals to consider in the
management and disposition of RTD property.
A subsequent presentation to the Board in August, 2013 proposed a Pilot Program involving the four
properties that are subject of the recommended action of this Board Report. The Pilot Program allowed
for a diverse set of disposal considerations providing an opportunity to evaluate and review the process,
review lessons learned and propose any policy changes.
An Interdisciplinary Task Force was convened including representatives from Planning, Bus Operations,
Rail Operations, Capital Programs, Finance, Facilities, Transit Oriented Development and Real Property.
The four properties included in the Pilot Program were reviewed, discussed and studied by the Task
Force for a recommendation to dispose of the property and a plan for marketing the property.
DISCUSSION
1. Property located in the vicinity of WCR27 and WCR #6 and #8, Weld County, Colorado containing
approximately 243 acres was determined to be surplus by the Task Force with no foreseeable future
need by the District. The recommended marketing plan for this property is to post with FOR SALE
signs, develop a marketing brochure for mail and on-line marketing. On-line marketing will include
the use of on-line brokerage sites such as LoopNet.com. The property will be sold with water rights.
It is recommended that the property be sold for at least 90% of fair market value as determined by
appraisal.
2. Vacant land adjacent to the Alameda/Havana park-n-Ride also known as Lot 1, Block 1, Aurora
Highline Subdivision, Filing No. 4 consisting of approximately 2.3 acres was also determined to be
surplus. The recommended marketing plans for this property is to market to adjacent property owner
including a car dealership at this location. The City of Aurora is supportive of this approach by RTD
and has suggested that the expansion of car dealership use at that site is appropriate. It is

Packet Pg. 67

2.C.1

recommended that the property be sold for at least 90% of fair market value as determined by
appraisal.
3. Remnants of vacant land acquired as a result of West Corridor Light Rail acquisition program in the
vicinity of 14th and Zuni containing approximately 1.6 acres have also been determined to be surplus.
RTD will be required to seek Federal Transit Administration concurrence in the disposition of this
property. It is recommended based on multiple inquiries related to this property, that a request for
proposal (RFP) for the sale of this property be issued with a minimum bid based on the fair market
value of the property as determined by appraisal. The RFP for this property will include incentives to
support transit-oriented, mixed-use development at this site as identified in the recently adopted
Federal Decatur Station Area Plan by the City and County of Denver.
4. The North Metro Rail project and station at 104th and Colorado will eliminate any need for a park-nRide at 104th and Riverdale as originally envisioned when this property was acquired. The plan for
marketing the approximately 8.74 RTD owned acres at this location is to pursue joint marketing
opportunities with the adjacent property owner. It is recommended that the property be sold for at
least 90% of fair market value as determined by appraisal. Any joint marketing effort agreements
will be reviewed by legal to ensure RTD is able to participate fully in all joint efforts.
Staff will evaluate each process, review and recommend changes to process and or policies based on
results of the four anticipated sales. Staff will review any recommended changes to the process and or
policies with the Board and will seek Board approval on changes to existing Board approved policies and
procedures.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
It is anticipated that the disposition of all four properties subject to this report could total $5-10 million.
Proceeds will be added to the appropriate account – either the base general fund or the FasTracks
Internal Savings Account (FISA).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to market and to
negotiate and execute all documents necessary to dispose of real property owned by RTD in the
vicinity of WCR 27 and WCR #6 and #8, Lot 1, Block 1, Aurora Highline Subdivision, Filing No. 4
(Alameda/Havana park-n-Ride), remnants associated with the West Corridor Rail Line at 1395 South
Zuni, and vacant land at 104th and Riverdale, Thornton, Colorado to at least 90% of the current fair
market value as determined by appraisal.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to market and to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to dispose of real property owned
by RTD in the vicinity of WCR 27 and WCR #6 and #8, Lot 1, Block 1, Aurora Highline Subdivision,
Filing No. 4 (Alameda/Havana park-n-Ride), remnants associated with the West Corridor Rail Line at
1395 South Zuni, and vacant land at 104th and Riverdale, Thornton, Colorado to at least 90% of the
current fair market value as determined by appraisal.

RTD Real Property White Paper

Introduction
The intent of this white paper is to describe the real property management and disposition process at
RTD including how real property management interfaces with the TOD function at RTD. This white
paper outlines all existing RTD, state and federal regulations that govern RTD’s acquisition and
disposition of real property and identifies other policy (including TOD) and operational considerations
that need to be taken into account in this process. Also, this paper summarizes how other similar public
agencies approach real property management. Finally, this paper identifies some steps RTD may
consider to more proactively manage its real property assets.

Regulations Governing RTD Real Property
There are several state, federal and RTD laws, regulations and policies which govern the acquisitions and
disposition of properties. RTD must maintain compliance with these requirements.
RTD’s legal authority to acquire property is established in Colorado Revised Statutes C.R.S. 32-9-101 et
seq. “Regional Transportation Act” as amended. This legislation empowers the Board to acquire,
manage, and dispose of property in furtherance of the authorization of planning, building, operating and
maintaining a mass transportation system. This authority includes the power to condemn property for
public use. It is important to note that the authority granted to RTD by the state specifically defines
that RTD can only acquire property for the purposes of mass transit. Different regulations apply to the
disposition of property acquired by RTD depending on the funding source. The disposition of properties
acquired with local funding only are subject to the legal authority above and the Regional
Transportation District Resolution No. 10 Series of 1984 (Resolution Regarding Joint Development and
Disposition of Property Rights) attached as Exhibit A. Disposition of property requires RTD Board
approval.
The acquisition and disposition of property acquired by RTD for federally assisted programs and projects
are subject to acquisition and relocation policies and provisions contained in the government-wide rule
published in the Federal Register on January 4, 2005. The rules are reprinted each year in the Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 49, Part 24. All Federal, State, local government agencies, and others
receiving Federal financial assistance for public programs and projects that require the acquisition of
real property must comply with the policies and provisions set forth in the Uniform Act and the
regulation. The acquisition itself does not need to be federally funded for the rules to apply. If Federal
funds are used in any phase of the program or project, the rules of the Uniform Act apply.

April 3, 2013

In addition to the Uniform Act, the Federal Transit Administration requires Grantees to be familiar with
other regulations that specifically address the disposition of property, especially U.S. Department of
Transportation, Federal Transit Administration Circular FTA C 5010.1D Grant Management Requirements
dated November 1, 2008, Rev 1, August 27, 2012. The Circular establishes procedures to be followed by
grantees for the disposition of properties, including (1.) selling property (competitively to the extent
practicable) and reimbursing FTA its share of the fair market value, and (2) selling real property and
using the proceeds to reduce the cost of the grant if it is still open or of other FTA funded capital
projects.
A list of properties, vacant and/or underutilized originally acquired without federal funding assistance is
attached as Exhibit B and a list of properties, vacant and/or underutilized originally acquired as part of a
federally funded project is attached as Exhibit C.
As a general rule, property acquired for a construction project is not considered for disposition until
after the construction contract is complete. RTD construction contracts generally make property
acquired for the project available to the construction contractor for construction installation, access to
the site or storage.

Other Policy and Operational Considerations for RTD Real Property Management
There are multiple additional policy and operational considerations that need to be evaluated in the
context of the management, acquisition and disposition of RTD real property. These considerations
should be evaluated in the context of overriding rules and regulations on real property discussed in the
previous section.
Key considerations beyond the existing regulations that govern real property management include:


Financial – management decisions including the acquisition, disposition or transfer of some
other form of property rights are influenced by the general financial conditions of the district
and the financial status of individual capital improvement projects. Examples of this kind of
influence include:
o RTD’s Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) – the RTD Board approved the potential to sell
selected excess properties for the purpose of adding revenues to the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA). This consideration requires RTD staff to look proactively at
selling selected parcels no longer needed for transit purposes to raise revenues to pay
for FasTracks related improvements.
o Engineering decisions on capital improvement projects – financial considerations are
taken into account in acquisition of property for RTD facilities. Budget limitations on
projects often require creative thinking and design to minimize or avoid acquiring
property for RTD rail and bus facilities. RTD staff work very hard to take only property
that is absolutely required for construction and operation of RTD facilities.

Packet Pg. 71

Attachment: Real Property White Paper April 3 2013 (1785 : Disposition of Surplus Property Pilot Program)

2.C.1.a

o

o

Fair Market Value – RTD establishes the value of a property for disposal through a fair
market appraisal. An offer significantly below the appraised fair market value would not
be approved.
Certificates of Participation (COPs) – COPs are used frequently by RTD to leverage
existing RTD assets, including property, for the purposes of financing other RTD
obligations such as capital improvements. The utilization of COPs on RTD real property
must be considered since the disposition of property which is encumbered by a COP will
require that the COP obligation be paid off or transferred to another RTD asset.



Current and Future Operational Needs – RTD’s current and future operational needs are always
evaluated in RTD’s property management process. There are some parcels in RTD’s property
inventory that are underutilized and/or are no longer required for its original intended purpose.
In these situations, it is incumbent on RTD staff to evaluate not only the current utilization of the
property, but the potential for future RTD use. This is extremely important because disposing of
property should only be done in cases where there is no foreseeable transit need for the
property. RTD does not want to be in the situation where it sells an underutilized property and
then determines two or three years later that it did need the property after all.



Transit Oriented Development Opportunities – the opportunity for TOD is an additional
consideration in the acquisition and disposition of property. First and foremost, RTD can only
purchase property for mass transit and cannot purchase property for development. That being
said, RTD does want to encourage the development of transit oriented communities around its
stations and does proactively look for partnership opportunities with local jurisdictions and
private developers to implement TOD at stations. Forming partnerships with others may allow
RTD to avoid acquiring property for RTD’s exclusive use. Examples of this type of partnership
include the Olde Town Arvada station and the Westminster station where the local jurisdictions
acquired property to promote the integration of RTD bus and parking facilities into a larger plan
for transit oriented development.
Additional consideration may be given to TOD in the land disposition process. When certain
conditions are present including local jurisdiction support and commitment for TOD
implementation (the presence of an adopted station area plan, TOD supportive zoning and
commitment of funding for public infrastructure) and private developer commitment and
resources (ownership of land and expenditure of resources on design and entitlements) RTD
may consider reinvesting land proceeds for the purposes of enhancing the station environment
through the implementation of TOD. Examples of this include the Boulder Junction bus transfer
facility and the Alameda TOD Pilot Project where the RTD Board chose to reinvest land sale
proceeds back into the transit facilities that are being built or being reconfigured associated
with the implementation of TOD.

A review of procedures of other public agencies, including General Services Administration (GSA),
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA),
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) and
various municipalities within the RTD district was done. All emphasize obtaining the fair market value,
as determined by appraisal of the property to be disposed of and most dispose of surplus property via a
competitive sale to the public generally through a sealed bid or auction. No marketing efforts are a part
of the disposition procedures.

Potential Modifications to RTD’s Real Property Management Approach
As RTD moves forward with the build out of FasTracks and the ongoing operation of its existing bus and
light rail system, modifications to RTD’s Real Property management could be considered. The
modifications would focus on being proactive where appropriate, but understanding that RTD is only in
the business of buying and selling real estate for constructing and operating a mass transit system.
RTD staff proposes the following steps in an effort to more proactively management its real property
assets:
1. Review and Refine Inventory of Surplus and Underutilized Property. Inventories of surplus and
underutilized real properties are attached. RTD staff will evaluate all properties contained in
either inventory, federally funded and/or locally funded and will focus on larger, possibly more
marketable parcels. Small/sliver parcels and other nonmarketable parcels will not be included
in the revised inventory.
2. Conduct an Assessment of Excess and Underutilized Real Property. RTD staff will form a
multidisciplinary committee to assess the potential disposition of parcels within the inventory of
surplus and underutilized parcels. In evaluating the inventory of parcels, RTD will consider all
the factors discussed in this white paper including regulations governing RTD property
disposition and other policy and operational considerations. Following the completion of this
evaluation, RTD staff will consult with select local subject matter experts to get their
perspectives on RTD’s real property inventory in the context of the factors governing RTD’s real
property disposition. RTD staff will then inform the Board of its assessment of the inventory of
parcels. If staff were to move forward with any property disposition, the RTD Board would have
to approve the final negotiated business terms unless the Board had previously delegated that
authority to the General Manager.
3. Develop a Marketing Plan for Select Surplus and Underutilized Property. RTD staff will also
determine if there is a need to market the surplus or underutilized property. Marketing efforts
could include the development of a Request for Proposals (RFP), the installation of for sale signs
on the property to be disposed of, communication with local commercial, industrial and/or
residential property brokers who sell property in the vicinity, or other efforts to be determined.
RTD staff does not feel it would be advantageous to hire a real estate broker to market

Packet Pg. 73

Attachment: Real Property White Paper April 3 2013 (1785 : Disposition of Surplus Property Pilot Program)

Peer Agency Approaches to Real Property Management

individual properties. Hiring a broker would reduce the amount of funds that RTD could receive
on the property because of the need to pay a commission to the broker. It would also require a
competitive solicitation each time a need for representation was identified, adding additional
time and cost to any disposition. In addition, none of the peer public agencies we surveyed
utilized a separate, private real estate broker in the disposition of real property.
4. Ongoing Process to Evaluate TOD Opportunities – RTD TOD staff will continue to proactively
pursue TOD opportunities where appropriate. As identified earlier, RTD will seek out
opportunities for partnerships with local jurisdictions and/or private developers where RTD can
leverage other resources to enhance our bus and rail stations and integrate transit more
seamlessly with development.
Other factors including market viability for TOD and
opportunities to encourage affordable housing as identified by RTD Board policy will also be
considered in the pursuit of TOD. When necessary, RTD staff will engage outside real estate
experts, on-call consultants and others to help evaluate TOD opportunities and negotiate with
private developers (RTD staff has utilized this approach for multiple projects including the DUS
Historic Building, the Alameda TOD Pilot and the Arvada TOD Pilot). RTD staff may engage
additional, outside experts on TOD under the following conditions:





The outside party has agreed to not compete or bid for the TOD opportunity for which
they are being consulted
Each individual TOD opportunity should be evaluated independently on a case by case
basis to determine the type of outside expertise needed since every project has unique
characteristics
Outside experts advising RTD should have a local understanding of the Denver real
estate market

Summary
In conclusion, the sale of surplus property can provide needed revenue to RTD and relieve the District of
the cost to maintain these properties. RTD will take additional steps to inventory, access and market
surplus properties. However, as described in this paper, the disposition of property is a complex
endeavor that must take into account legal, financial, contractual, and future operational requirements
while also considering transit oriented development opportunities where applicable. As we continue to
improve our processes in this area, we will schedule a study session to gather input from the RTD Board
on this very important item.

Renaming of I-225 Rail Line City Center Station

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the Aurora
Metro Center Station name for the station on the I-225 Rail Line currently referred to as the Aurora City
Center Station in the Environmental Evaluation document. This recommendation is consistent with the
current Board policy on station naming. It is also recommended that the existing Centrepoint/Sable bus
transfer facility located at the station area also be renamed to be consistent with the light rail station.
BACKGROUND
During the Environmental Evaluation process it was determined that a light rail Park-n-Ride station at
Sable Boulevard and Centerpoint Drive would be an appropriate location because of the existing bus
transfer facility. Proximity to the facility would provide efficient connections between multiple bus routes
and the future light rail route. The City of Aurora has expressed an interest in renaming the station the
Aurora Metro Center Station and on September 9, 2013, Aurora City Council passed a resolution
supporting the change of the name.
DISCUSSION
The City of Aurora Council supports this change because they believe it better reflects the station that
will serve Aurora citizens and visitors. The City envisions the station to be a vital element of the future
main street area of Aurora. The City also believes the name change will fit better with the future
development plans for the area around the station.
There currently is a bus transfer station adjacent to the future light rail station and since it is integral to
connectivity to RTD services including light rail and bus, it is important the name represent both the rail
and bus components.
The May 2011 Board Station Naming Policy revision grants the Board flexibility in allowing station
naming and the proposed station name fits the general criteria established by the Board as follows:
a. The proposed name is recognizable as a general geographic area to the public;
b. The name does not incorporate any trademark name;
c. The station is not set to open until 2016 (which is more than two years away); and
d. The name does not violate any existing naming agreement.
Consequently, the proposed station name is consistent with the Board station naming policy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This recommendation would have no immediate financial impact on RTD.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors adopt the Aurora Metro Center Station name for the station on the I-225 Rail
Line currently referred to as the Aurora City Center Station in the Environmental Evaluation

document. This recommendation is consistent with the current Board policy on station naming. It is
also recommended that the existing Centrepoint/Sable bus transfer facility located at the station area
also be renamed to be consistent with the light rail station.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action and request the City of Aurora to consider further
alternatives. This action is not recommended since this name no longer reflects the plans of the City
or adjacent property holder.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and keep the station name as identified in the I-225
Environmental Evaluation. This action is not recommended since this name no longer reflects the
plans of the City of Aurora or adjacent property owner.

Station Names for Eagle P3 Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
following station name changes for the Eagle P3 Project. For comparison, the current station names in
use are shown in parentheses.
Gold Line:
Pecos Junction (change from Pecos)
Clear Creek • Federal (change from Federal)
60th & Sheridan • Arvada Gold Strike (change from Sheridan)
Wheat Ridge • Ward (change from Ward Road)
East Corridor:
40th Ave. & Airport Blvd. • Gateway Park (change from 40th Ave. & Airport Blvd)
Denver Airport (change from Denver International Airport)
BACKGROUND:
Station names were originally assigned during the Gold Line Corridor and East Corridor Environmental
Impact Statements, both completed in 2009, and the Northwest Rail Corridor Environmental Evaluation
completed in 2010. These initial names were based on geographic locations and have been used on
plans, fact sheets and the website. Denver Transit Partners, the concessionaire on the Eagle P3 Project,
has given the Eagle Design Team a deadline of December 31, 2013, to confirm the official station names
in order for it to integrate the names into the signage design package, systems packages for LED and
LCD monitor displays, and audio announcements; and operations documents.
The Board previously voted to change the names of two stations on the Eagle P3 Project. On September
20, 2011, the Board approved changing the name of the East Corridor’s Colorado Station to 40th &
Colorado, based on Denver Fire’s request to differentiate the location from the existing Colorado Station
on the Southeast light rail corridor. Subsequently, on November 22, 2011, the Board approved changing
the name of the Northwest Rail Corridor’s South Westminster Station to Westminster Station, based on
a formal request from the City of Westminster to better fit into its land use planning in that area.
In order to respond to DTP’s deadline, Eagle Project staff met in early September with RTD Marketing to
apply RTD’s station naming policy to the station names on the project. Following that discussion, the
staff recommended these names, with three of them changed from their current names:
Northwest Rail Corridor:
Westminster (no change)
Gold Line Corridor:
41st & Fox (no change)
Pecos (no change)
60th & Federal

Packet Pg. 103

3.C.2

60th & Sheridan
Olde Town Arvada (no change)
Arvada Ridge (no change)
Wheat Ridge • Ward
East Corridor:
38th & Blake (no change)
40th & Colorado (no change)
Central Park (no change)
Peoria (no change)
40th & Airport (no change)
Denver International Airport (no change)
In Mid-September, the Eagle Design Team issued official letters to the six local governments on the
project to advise them of the proposed station names and provide them with the opportunity to request
alternate station names, if deemed appropriate and conforming to all the requirements of the RTD
Station Naming Policy. Local governments also would have to submit a completed RTD Station Naming
Form. The goal was to avoid later requests from stakeholders after DTP’s deadline.
DISCUSSION:
After RTD notified the local governments of the RTD recommended station names, RTD received the
following change requests:
Adams County requested the station at Pecos be changed to Pecos Junction.
Staff Recommendation: Change to Pecos Junction
This proposal supports Adams County’s land use planning for the southwest portion of the county along
the Gold Line and Northwest Rail, and takes its name from the geographical location of the physical
track interlock – or junction – where the Northwest Rail and Gold Line diverge from their shared
alignment south to Union Station.
Adams County requested the station at 60th & Federal be changed to Clear Creek • Federal.
Staff Recommendation: Change to Clear Creek • Federal
This proposal also supports Adams County’s land use planning for the southwest portion of the county.
It resolves the issue of multiple stations containing “Federal.” For fire and life safety reasons, it is
important to eliminate duplicate station names in the system and distinguish this station from West
Corridor’s Federal Center and Decatur • Federal stations. It adds a geographical identifier to the name,
including Clear Creek and the Clear Creek Trail, which can be accessed across 60th Avenue from this
station.
The City of Arvada requested the station at 60th & Sheridan be changed to 60th & Sheridan • Arvada
Gold Strike.
Staff Recommendation: Change to 60th Ave & Sheridan • Arvada Gold Strike
The proposal resolves the issue of multiple stations starting with “Sheridan” while also including a
geographical and historical identifier that is important to the City of Arvada. It is important to distinguish
this station from Sheridan Station on the West Corridor. The station is located less than a half mile from
the site of the first gold strike in what was to become the state of Colorado, in 1850 at Ralston Creek’s

Packet Pg. 104

3.C.2

confluence with Clear Creek. Arvada’s Gold Strike Park is located there. The Gold Line takes its name
from this historical point of fact.
The City of Aurora requested the station at 40th Ave & Airport Blvd be changed to 40th Ave & Airport
Blvd • Gateway Park.
Staff Recommendation: Change to 40th Ave & Airport Blvd • Gateway Park
The proposal includes the Gateway Park neighborhood in the station name while adhering to RTD policy
of listing street location identification. It also follows the precedent set at several stations including
Stapleton park-n-Ride, Southmoor Station and Arapahoe at Village Center Station. The 40th & Airport
Blvd park-n-Ride is an existing RTD facility, and under RTD policy third parties are to be responsible for
costs of changing the name. The master developer of the Gateway Park area has agreed to cover the
costs of updating station signage.
The City and County of Denver requested the station at Denver International Airport be changed to
Denver Airport.
Staff Recommendation: Change to Denver International Airport to Denver Airport
The proposal retains the most important element, that of the prominent destination. Airport managers
prefer the shorter name to facilitate designation on maps, signs and Ticket Vending Machines. More
importantly, airport managers have undertaken a marketing effort to reduce the use of the term “DIA,”
which is not the Airport Code known to most travelers. The Denver airport’s code is DEN. Airport
managers are concerned that visitors to Denver, who will make up a higher percentage of riders on the
East Corridor than other RTD rail lines, not face confusion when looking at maps or schedules by seeing
“DIA” as shorthand for the DEN rail station. It is likely that going forward, there will be more effort to
reduce the use of the word “International” in the airport’s name as well, so changing this station’s name
now eliminates the potential need to go through the expense of changing it later. RTD staff concurs with
the reasoning of airport managers for removing “International” from the station name and reducing the
likelihood of use of “DIA Station.” Clarity and consistency are important elements in communicating with
visitors to DEN and our new rail station there.
Staff Recommendation: Change to Ward Road to Wheat Ridge • Ward
In addition to changes requested by local governments, RTD staff recommends changing the name of
the Ward Road Station on the Gold Line to Wheat Ridge • Ward. This change is consistent with current
RTD policy. With only one exception, RTD does not use street name suffixes such as “St,” “Ave” or
“Blvd” as part of the station name. In addition to dropping “Road,” the recommendation adds the city’s
name, more consistent with the West Corridor’s “Lakewood • Wadsworth” and Southwest Corridor’s
“Littleton • Downtown” and “Littleton • Mineral.”
No Board action is required for the remaining Eagle P3 Project station names, which are unchanged.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no negative financial impact to the project at this time. DTP is requiring RTD confirmation of the
official Station Names prior to December 31, 2013, in order to avoid costs that would be incurred with
changing station names after DTP commences with station signage and systems packages. RTD sought
local government input now in order to avoid redesign costs later. Any station name changes after
December 31, 2013, would have cost implications to either RTD or stakeholders.

ALTERNATIVES:
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the following station name changes for the Eagle P3 Project. For
comparison, the current station names in use are shown in parentheses.
Gold Line:
Pecos Junction (change from Pecos)
Clear Creek • Federal (change from Federal)
60th & Sheridan • Arvada Gold Strike (change from Sheridan)
Wheat Ridge • Ward (change from Ward Road)
East Corridor:
40th Ave. & Airport Blvd. • Gateway Park (change from 40th Ave. & Airport Blvd)
Denver Airport (change from Denver International Airport)
2. Accept the initial RTD staff recommended three station name changes, not including the key
stakeholder requested changes: 60th & Federal, 60th & Sheridan, and Wheat Ridge • Ward. This is
not recommended as it is not responsive to key stakeholders’ land use planning and marketing
strategies around RTD rail stations, and invites renewed attempts to revisit station names after DTP’s
deadline, which would incur costs.
3. Do not accept the recommended action. Instead leave the names as currently defined. This is not
recommended as it would not be responsive to key stakeholders making the request. In addition, it
would leave in place several duplicate or similar rail station names in the RTD system at the risk of
fire and life safety response in emergency dispatch situations. The Board already has changed the
Colorado Station name to 40th & Colorado based on this reasoning.
