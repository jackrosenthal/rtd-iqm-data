Main
Motion:

Director Whitmore seconded the motion.

Motion
to Amend:

Director Guissinger moved to amend the
recommended action to include the following
statement:
“The January 2021 service changes are pandemic
plan 2, intended to be temporary. The cuts and
changes in this plan and the original pandemic
plan will be revisited by the board no later than
September 2021. In the meanwhile, RTD will
establish, in coordination with local jurisdictions,
a documented process for restoring or
restructuring suspended and reduced services.
This process will use the January 2020 run board
as a baseline, also considering the changes in
transit use and lessons learned in Reimagine and
during the pandemic.”
Director Whitmore seconded the motion.
