Report

BBMK met with Board Chair Sisk and Government Relations Chair Folska as well as Board
Directors Francone and Bagley to discuss legislative relationship building. In an effort to
continue to think of new and innovative ways to keep improving Board relationships with state
legislative leaders, we purpose hosting a legislative reception in the early weeks of the
session. The reception would be Amendment 41 compliant and include all members of the
Colorado General Assembly. This would provide Board Directors/Executive Staff and
legislators an opportunity to highlight RTD’s accomplishments.
BBMK continues to monitor the Transportation Legislation Review Committee. The committee
is taking a tour of the Southwest Corridor in September and will host two additional meetings at
the Capitol to discuss potential legislation.
BBMK has been asked by the Legislative Council Transportation Caucus to provide a tour of the
East Line and Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility. This tour would not include legislators
however we are happy to extend the invite to any Board Members who would like to attend once
details are finalized.

1.C.3.a

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: SEPTEMBER 1, 2015


Both the House and Senate plan to return from their 5-week August Recess and resume work in
Washington next Tuesday, September 8.



Before leaving town at the end of July, the Senate passed a comprehensive surface transportation
bill that increased transit funding by 25 percent over the 6-year life of the bill.
o The bill increases New Starts funding by 36 percent over 6 years, and boosts Bus and
Bus Facilities funding (including a reestablished discretionary grant component) by
almost 43 percent over 6 years.
o But the bill is only partially paid for; it includes funding offsets for the first 3 years only.



While we await House action on a multi-year bill, surface transportation programs are currently
operating under a 3-month policy extension that expires October 29. This extension provides
General Fund revenues to the Highway Trust Fund sufficient to sustain the programs until the
end of the calendar year, enabling yet another short-term policy extension in the highly
foreseeable event that a multi-year bill is not in place by October 29.



Enactment of a surface transportation bill – be it another extension or a multi-year bill – by late
October therefore remains another must-pass item on an already crowded and conflict-laden
agenda awaiting Congress when it returns, including:
o Passage of a short-term spending patch – a Continuing Resolution (“CR”) – by
September 30 to avoid a government shutdown;
o Extension of the debt limit by late October/early November to avoid U.S. default;
o Approval of the Iran nuclear deal; and
o Negotiation of a budget deal that would provide federal discretionary programs with
some relief from sequestration spending limits, enabling bipartisan support for a full-year
omnibus spending bill.
 This budget deal is the most promising option for increasing New Starts funding
to the level needed to fully fund all projects in the President’s budget.


FTA likely will not allocate New Starts grants under a CR; the agency would
instead wait for a full-year spending bill.



The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is expected to begin consideration of
its multi-year surface transportation bill in the next few weeks, potentially in time to meet the
October 29 deadline.
o To pay for the Transportation Committee’s multi-year bill, the Ways and Means
Committee still plans to use repatriated revenues achieved through international tax
reform.
o However, tax reform is advancing on a much slower timeline, with even the most
optimistic supporters of this approach predicting that Ways and Means won’t move tax
reform legislation until December.



Without the political support to raise the Federal gas tax, paying for $50+ billion in annual
transit and highway authorizations has become an enormously complicated task of crafting
budget gimmicks and searching for funding offsets from programs across the entire Federal
budget, many of which are wholly unrelated to transportation. This severely encumbers the
process for achieving what many in Congress believe is an essential function of government –
funding infrastructure – and makes enactment of a multi-year bill this year an uncertainty.
