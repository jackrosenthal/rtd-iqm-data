Board Meeting Date: November 28, 2017

Subject:

Longmont Fare Buy Up

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the City of Longmont to buy up fares on all four of the Longmont local fixed route
services herein referenced as “the 300 series.” Specifically the 300 series are routes 323, 324, 326 and
327 and complementary Access-a-Ride services for a period of two years.
BACKGROUND
Boulder County entered into an agreement with the RTD in 2014 to “buy up” all fares on the 300 series
routes in Longmont. Boulder County received funding from the City of Longmont to assist in the buy up
program. The Boulder County contract to buy up service will expire in December 2017. The City of
Longmont would like to continue the Longmont Free Fare program for a period of two years. This
contract would be in effect January 2018 – December 2019.
DISCUSSION
Boulder County and the City of Longmont feel that one of the major reasons that ridership has declined
in Longmont over the years is due to high fares. The objective of this action is to continue to build
ridership and increase mobility options for low income riders.
Under this program all passengers will continue to be allowed unlimited boardings on all 300 series
routes, in both directions, throughout the day. All RTD rules, regulations, and codes of conduct will be
the same as if passengers were paying fares. Transit operators, other RTD staff and members of law
enforcement will continue to have the discretion to refuse boarding to any passenger they deem will
compromise the safety of others. Transfers will be issued to any passengers requesting a transfer. This
program will not include the Call-n-Ride or Regional routes operating within Longmont. The purpose of
the program is to focus on fixed route local ridership. The local agencies, specifically Boulder County
and City of Longmont, have performed the majority of the marketing and publicity for this program with
the approval of RTD Marketing. Boulder County, City of Longmont and RTD will hold meetings to
discuss any issues that need to be addressed with the Buy Up program.
During this 24 month period, the City of Longmont has agreed to reimburse the RTD $130,602 in
advance in 6 month periods. Additionally, the city has agreed to reimburse the RTD fares for all Accessa-Ride trips that fall within the ADA service area boundaries of the 300 series routes. The City also
agreed that if the RTD has a fare increase, all dollars amounts will be adjusted to reflect any fare
increases. There will be an escape clause in the contract that will allow either the City or RTD to
discontinue the program with 60 days’ notice.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Overall the program has been doing very well in terms of increased boardings. RTD survey results
reflected that approximately 8% of the increased boardings were “new” riders. 2013 boardings for the
Longmont local routes were 156,863 boardings (weekday and Saturdays). By the end of 2016,
boardings increased to 373,204.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no financial impact to the RTD.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the Agreement with the City of Longmont for the 300 series buy up.
2. Do not approve the Agreement with the City of Longmont for the 300 series buy up. This course of
action is not recommended, as it will result in a loss of a program valuable to the City of Longmont
and Boulder County. Additionally, this program provides transportation access to the low-income
population. Local ridership will be reduced as customers are charged a fare and lose the ability to
travel at any time.

Subject:

TMD Contract Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee to approve an amendment to the Transportation
Management & Design, Inc. (TMD) Contract 14DO009, awarded in March 2015, to exercise the two
remaining one-year option periods thereby extending the Contract period of performance to December
31, 2019 and to increase the contract amount by $650,000 from $500,000 to a new Not to Exceed
(NTE) total of $1,150,000.
BACKGROUND
Transportation Management & Design, Inc. (TMD) currently provides on-call service planning assistance
to RTD under the terms of Contract 14DO009. TMD has been selected on three different occasions
through RTD’s Request for Proposal (RFP) process over the last 15 years to perform a variety of service
planning studies for projects which require more time or specific expertise than RTD Service
Development staff have available. Previous projects have included the restructuring of bus services
associated with the opening of the A-Line rail service, the B-Line rail service, the R-Line rail service, and
the planned opening of the G-Line rail service. TMD is currently working with RTD to provide assistance
in the restructuring of bus service associated with the planned opening of the N-Line rail service. In
addition, TMD has provided assistance with various transit priority studies.
DISCUSSION
RTD has found TMD’s analysis and recommendations to be thorough and well documented, allowing
RTD staff to propose appropriate changes through a timely and responsive process we would otherwise
not be able to accomplish in a timely manner. TMD is currently working with RTD on the restructuring
of bus service to accompany the planned opening of the N-Line rail service. Additional future projects
include: analysis of potential transit priority applications, transfer analysis, analysis of ridership patterns,
analysis of potential bus stop consolidation activities, streamlining routes and frequent route network
analysis. TMD planning assistance is provided to RTD on an on-call basis through the issuance of
specific task orders for each specific project/task.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD has approved an additional $50,000 in the adopted 2017 Budget as amended. $300,00 is included
in the 2018 RTD budget request currently under consideration by the RTD Board of Directors. Future
funding requests will be included in future year’s budget requests.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager to approve the exercise of the two one-year option periods with TDM
and increase the contract Not to Exceed (NTE) by $650,000. Individual task orders, each with a
specific NTE amount will be released for each project. The total Contract NTE amount will not
exceed $1,150,000.
2. Further modify the NTE increase. This is not recommended because it will delay the implementation

1.B.2

of these services.
3. Do not authorize the General Manager to exercise the two one-year option periods or to increase the
NTE dollar amount with TDM. This is not the recommended action because RTD would not have the
opportunity to continue with these important service-related studies.

Board Meeting Date: November 28, 2017

Subject:

Free Rides for Members of the Military

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free rides on RTD for active
duty members of the United States Military should be extended from the presently approved date of
December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. Utilization has been minimal to date and this extension will
have minimal impact on RTD.
BACKGROUND
At the October 30, 2006 Special Board Meeting, the RTD Board of Directors approved a resolution
allowing active duty U.S. Military personnel to ride free on all RTD services through the end of 2006.
This offer has been extended annually by the Board since that time and is now valid through December
31, 2017. As a result of these actions, all active duty members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines,
Coast Guard, National Guard, and Reserves are entitled to ride free on any RTD service including special
services such as SkyRide and BroncosRide. To be eligible to ride for free, active duty military personnel
must either be in uniform or present an active duty military ID card.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the RTD Board of Directors extend this offer beyond the current expiration date
of December 31, 2017 and that the expiration date be extended by one year at this time and revisited
again next year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The exact financial impact of this action is not known, but is expected to be minimal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Extend free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should from the
presently approved date of December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. This is the staff
recommendation.
2. Do not extend RTD’s program offering free rides for active duty members of the United States
Military.

Service Performance 2016
Networked Family of Services
Overview

RTD service standards are depicted in the charts to help
make judgments about performance. Each rectangle
labeled by service type represents the domain for routes
that meet or exceed the 10% minimum/maximum
performance requirements for that service class. So this
is a case where it’s bad to be “outside the box.”

Subsidy per Boarding or Effectiveness

Performance is a term often used interchangeably with effectiveness and efficiency. The effectivenessproductivity charts in this report present these measures for all RTD services. Effectiveness measures

the budget—and is presented on the y-axis as subsidy

per boarding. Efficiency—productivity or output/input—
Lower
is presented on the x-axis as boardings/vehicle hour.
Same boardings,
The charts offer a convenient, comparative analysis of all
less subsidy
classes of services, illustrating both absolute and relative
performance.
Better

Same subsidy,
more boardings

Boardings per Vehicle Hour or Productivity

Higher

Routes that perform minimally get minimum service frequency, typically every 30 minutes during peak periods
and 60 minutes off-peak. The charts also depict guidelines for routes where ridership significantly exceeds the
minimum, and passenger loads justify more frequent service. The orange, dotted, vertical line at 25 boardings
per hour represents the typical minimum productivity for a route to justify 15-minute frequency, and the
green line at 40 boardings per hour for 10-minute frequency.
Please note that these are true apples-to-apples comparisons of performance: all fare revenues, boardings
and costs—both operating and amortized capital—are included. For complete, detailed information see RTD’s
Transit Service Policies & Standards (under Reports).
NOTE
For 2016 fare revenue was not allocated by route. Last year the fare zone structure was changed and Service
Standards revised to combine the Express, SkyRide and Regional routes into one Regional class. We also
discovered some issues with the revenue allocation method in use for many years that will be addressed with
a new model now under development to improve revenue allocation and provide better inputs into service
performance evaluation. Due to all these changes, we did not have the resources to prepare accurate subsidy

Attachment: 2016 Performance Review (3310 : 2016 Performance Review)

RTD’s Mission is: "To meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the district." Service development and
performance analysis require that we ask several questions. What are the markets or demand? Should service
be provided and how much? What type of service should be provided? RTD’s general approach is as follows.
Develop a family of services suited to a variety of markets. Connect all the services together in a network to
accommodate today’s dispersed travel patterns. Match the level-of-service with demand, thus improving
performance and sustainability.

1.C.1.a

Definitions
 Boardings: Unlinked passenger trips; includes transfers as boardings.
 Hours: In-service vehicle hours, not including dead head garage time or layover/recovery.
 Fare Revenues: Cash, ticket, and tokens allocated by route by farebox recorded boardings. Monthly pass
revenues are allocated by class of pass and the number of uses by route. Revenue from Eco, CU, and Auraria
passes are allocated individually by the counts for each route weighted by the ratio of the class of service
fare to the local fare.
 Costs: All operating, maintenance and administrative costs for providing current service, plus depreciation
on all RTD assets. Excludes interest and any costs attributed to future projects. RTD’s cost allocation model
allocates costs to each route based on its miles, hours, and peak vehicles; accounting line items are assigned
to the most relevant variable.
 Subsidy: Costs minus Fare Revenues.
Standards
RTD has established guidelines in its Transit Service Policies & Standards that the least productive 10% of
routes based on either subsidy per boarding or boardings per hour need to be evaluated for marketing,
revision or elimination, or if both measures fall below 25% for a route. The performance charts illustrate the
acceptable performance domain containing all routes meeting the 10% minimum/maximum for each class of
service. The calculation of the 10% and 25% standards are made from the annual, un-weighted data, assuming
the data have a normal distribution and using the appropriate formulas for standard deviation and confidence
intervals; however, the standard deviation is applied to the weighted average. The following table gives the
current year weighted averages and standards by class of service.

Regional Transportation District

Notes on Routes Outside Their Acceptable Performance Domain
The following provides the status of these routes as of October, 2017 listed in route number order.
Route 9 West 10th Ave – Restructured April 2013 with the West Corridor opening. Current ridership productivity slipped
below standard this year and this route will be monitored for further action.

Route 33 Platte Valley — This service was restructured from the Route 34 in August 2015 in hopes of gaining ridership
with a new routing. We will continue to monitor for further action and possible discontinuance.
Route 36L Fort Logan Ltd — The Route 36L was linked to and classified with Routes 29 and 36 in the Urban Local
category. The service will be monitored, though a Federal Boulevard service restructure is planned that would impact
the Route 36 if implemented.
Route 48 East 48th Ave/Commerce City — This service currently meets the ridership standard and narrowly misses the
cost per boarding standard, it will be monitored for further action. It is likely that the route will be impacted in the N
Line bus and rail service plan.
Route 72L Quaker St via Ward Ltd — The route currently meets the ridership standard, though it is outside of the cost
per boarding standard. The route will be replaced in the implementation of the G Line bus and rail service plan.
Route 85 Chatfield Avenue — Formerly a part of the Route 401, the Route 85 was created in August 2015 to provide
clarity as to where buses are traveling and allow better monitoring of the route.
Route 89 Stapleton/Anschutz Campus – This route was started January 2013 to serve new transitional housing and in
anticipation of the opening of the East Corridor rail services in 2016. In 2014 service was reduced by half due to poor
performance and ridership fell precipitously. This service has been proposed for discontinuance in January 2018.
Route 100L South Kipling Ltd — This service meets the ridership standard, but falls short of the cost per rider standard.
We will continue to monitor its performance for further action.
Route 116L Ken Caryl Limited – This route was discontinued January 2017.
Route 157 CCA/Buckley — This route was newly implemented in April 2016, formed from former segments of Routes 10,
130 and 169. Current ridership does show improvement this year (13 passengers/hour) and will be monitored closely.
Route 403 Lucent Blvd — Service realigned and retimed for January 2014 and performance improved somewhat. It is
now below subsidy and productivity standards and will be monitored.
Route 410 Franktown/Parker — This route was substantially revised with the reinstatement of Route P Parker/Denver
Spring 2007. Service was reduced to every 30 minutes peak and every two hours midday. Service was reduced to peak
period only May 2009. Additional trips added January 2014 in response to public meetings where constituents noted
that this would make the route more attractive. In 2016 this route was combined with a portion of the Route 153 to
form the new Route 483 Lincoln/Parker/Nine Mile.
Route 483 — This service was implemented in April 2016 with the University of Colorado A Line bus and rail service plan.
The route is a combination of a segment formerly on the Route 153 in Southeast Arapahoe and the Route 410 in Parker.

Route AA Wagon Road/DIA — Performance is just below service standards. Considering potential restructuring with the
North Metro Corridor service plan.
Route CV Pine Junction/Conifer/Denver – This route is slightly below subsidy standard, but above productivity standard.
Route EV Evergreen/Aspen Park/Denver – This route is just below subsidy and just above productivity standards and will
be monitored.

Route J Longmont/Gunbarrel Boulder — This route is just below cost per boarding/subsidy standard. We will continue to
monitor before taking further action.
Route L Longmont/Denver — This route is just below cost per boarding/subsidy standard. We will continue to monitor
before taking further action.
Route R/RC Brighton/Denver —Service was added in January 2011 and ridership has increased modestly, but it still does
not meet service standards. Will need to evaluate service options with the opening of North Metro rail in 2018.
Jeffco Call-n-Ride — Marketing assistance requested for 2017.
Evergreen Call-n-Ride – Ridership fell due to discontinuation of two local programs. A Transportation Advisory
Committee was formed to increase ridership. It is just below service standards and will be monitored.
Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride — This service was discontinued January, 2017.
Lone Tree Call-n-Ride — Marketing assistance requested for 2017.
Thornton Call-n-Ride — Service design changes and marketing assistance requested for 2017.
A Line — The newly implemented rail line meets the ridership standard, but cost per boardings is short of the standard
and will be monitored.
B Line — The newly implemented rail line meets the ridership standard, but cost per boardings is short of the standard
and will be monitored.
