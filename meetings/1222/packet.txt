Subject:

16th Street Mall Reconstruction Project
Funding Intergovernmental Agreement with the
City and County of Denver

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager, or designee, to execute an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA)
between the City and County of Denver (CCD) and the Regional Transportation District. The
purpose of the IGA is to set forth the rights, duties and obligations of CCD and RTD to mutually fund
a portion of the project costs to design and reconstruct up to 3.5 blocks of the 16 th Street Mall
(Blocks 1, 2, 12 and 13) within the CCD Right of Way. This IGA commits both RTD and CCD to
provide matching local funds necessary to receive FTA Grant Funding. Funding for this project is
included in the 2013 Amended Budget
BACKGROUND
This IGA formalizes a local matching fund cost sharing requirement needed to secure an FTA “Bus &
Bus Facilities Livability Grant” that will be used to reconstruct a portion of the Mall. The Mall
reconstruction is needed because the current granite pavers and infrastructure have been used since its
October 1982 opening. RTD began maintaining the transit lane portion of the Mall within a few years of
its opening. Maintenance costs have steadily risen from under $100,000 per year to a current value of
approximately $1Million per year. Recent repair trends indicate that this value will increase if
reconstruction does not occur. The granite, other than its friction and color loss, generally is still sturdy
and durable. The paver setting bed and grout need continuous maintenance and repairs.
DISCUSSION
A recent pilot paver reconstruction program had tested alternative grouts and setting bed
applications. Lessons learned from that program have been applied to ongoing maintenance
activities and will be considered for the upcoming reconstruction project referenced herein. The three
and 1/2 block reconstruction project grant request was estimated at $16M. It included granite
transit paver reconstruction, walkway refurbishment and urban design upgrades, as itemized from
the grant application and shown below.
1. Transitway Paver Removal, Rehabilitation and Replacement.
2. Sub-Base Reconstruction for Transit Way Only.
3. Pedestrian Walk Way In-Situ Paver Resurfacing.
4. Intersection Bulb-outs for Pedestrian Safety. (Traffic signalization, camera’s, etc. not
Included)
5. Wet and Dry Utility Upgrade.
6. Urban Design, Trees, Water Features and Irrigation Improvements
7. Mall Livability Furnishing Element Upgrades.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

The FTA grant plus local match was approved for approximately 2/3 of the requested value. The
final project scope and limits will be refined during the current design process. The required local
match is 20%. The approved FTA value is $7,978,998.00 and the local match is $1,994,749.50.
The total grant and local match are $9,973,747.50.
The local match was to be shared by three parties: RTD, CCD and the DDP/BID with an equal cost
sharing of $664,915.50 per party. The City and County of Denver has agreed to provide DDP/BID’s
1/3 part plus their 1/3 share for a total obligation to CCD of $1,329,831.00. RTD’s sh are is the
remaining 1/3 - $664,915.50, which brings the collective agencies’ contributions to $1,994,749.50.
The IGA also addresses the design and construction management for the project and identifies RTD
as the managing entity. RTD will lead the design and construction management of this project with
support from stakeholder agencies. All agency direct costs with the exception of management time
will be reimbursable.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the total project, RTD’s local match of $664,915.50 and the CCD contribution of
$1,329,831 toward the local match, is included in the 2013 Amended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager, or designee, to
execute an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the City and County of Denver (CCD)
and the Regional Transportation District. The purpose of the IGA is to set forth the rights, duties
and obligations of CCD and RTD to mutually fund a portion of the project costs to design and
reconstruct up to 3.5 blocks of the 16 th Street Mall (Blocks 1, 2, 12 and 13) within the CCD
Right of Way. This IGA commits both RTD and CCD to provide matching local funds necessary to
receive FTA Grant Funding. Funding for this project is included in the 2013 Amended Budget.
2. Delay implementing the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because delaying the
implementation of the IGA has serious impact to the schedule and budget and ability t o utilize
approved grant funds that would cause an extended delay or possible cancellation of the project.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because this would cause
major delays in project implementation and budget impacts resulting from the loss of
$7,978,998.00 in grant funding plus local stakeholder shares. The result would be escalating
maintenance costs for the proposed blocks.

Status of Key Tasks
• Northwest Rail phasing assumptions:

– Requires 10,000’ of unobstructed ‘chambering’
track (approx. 2 miles north of end of line station)
– ‘Chambering’ track would be incorporated into
future segments of commuter rail
– Requested additional clarification/information from
BNSF; BNSF indicated a willingness to work with
RTD when funding for the corridor is identified
