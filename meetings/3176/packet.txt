BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Approval of Contract to Purchase Validators for AccountBased Ticketing

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager or her designee to enter into a contract with
Masabi to purchase new bus and rail platform fare validators for the Account-Based Ticketing (ABT)
system.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer
Tonya Anderson, Senior Project Manager
Paul Snyder, Senior Project Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In November 2020, the RTD Board of Directors approved the funding needed to advance the AccountBased Ticketing (ABT) system forward with the goal of replacing the cumbersome and obsolete existing
Smart Card fare technology and equipment used for the MyRide card and College and Eco Passes.
The existing Smart Card system is card-based, in which customer balances and transactions are stored
on individual cards. This causes several issues: delays of 24 to 72 hours for customers and RTD in
managing card balances; hampers the ability to perform stored value transactions; limits locations for
card management; limits the types of fares available; and requires more intensive ongoing system
maintenance, coding, and Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance activities. In contrast, account-based
fare systems, such as ABT, store information by account, allowing for such benefits as real-time
information, the ability for more widespread and varied means of loading fare value, more fare offerings
and flexibility in changing fares, and less maintenance through utilization of hosted environment, all
while also ensuring PCI compliance.
In considering the replacement of the Smart Card system with ABT, RTD has contracted with Masabi to
provide the “back office” technology to be consistent and compatible with RTD’s existing mobile
ticketing platform that is also provided by Masabi. The current target date for completion of this portion
of the ABT implementation is December 31, 2021.
DISCUSSION
A second component of the ABT implementation is the replacement of existing fare validators that were
purchased in 2010 for RTD’s Smart Card fare system. The existing validators have obsolete and
proprietary technology specific to the existing Smart Card system which necessitates replacement with
validators that are ABT compatible.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

These new ABT validators will bring RTD into the modern age of transit payment systems while
providing RTD customers with an improved and easier method for transit payments. Additionally, these
new ABT fare validators will be capable of processing open payments, thereby providing additional fare
payment options to RTD’s customers. Installation of the ABT fare validators is planned with a phased
approach as the legacy Smart Card fare validators are removed.
In order to acquire ABT fare validators, RTD issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) separate from the “back
office” ABT software procurement. This RFP was separate in order to ensure a competitive process and
because these fare validators will be acquired to be compatible with most ABT systems. In addition,
federal grant funding has been awarded to RTD for the ABT fare validator purchase.
After a thorough RFP evaluation and scoring procurement process, Masabi was selected as the preferred
validator vendor and negotiations were completed. The funds needed to complete this work are
$4,054,505, of which $1,813,084 comes from federal funding and, if approved, will allow RTD to work
towards achieving the planned ABT system go-live date December 31, 2021 with a phased-in fare
validator replacement. The period of performance for fare validator replacement is tentatively planned
for October 2021 through December 2021.
The validator vendor was evaluated and selected on a best value basis with the following scoring
criteria:
•
•
•
•
•

40% technical specifications and ability to meet stated requirements
20% overall cost
20% experience of the vendor and project team
10% timeline and ability to meet deadlines
10% DBE (Disadvantaged Business Enterprises) evaluation

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of contracting the replacement ABT fare validators is $4,054,505. Funding will be
provided by RTD in the amount of $2,241,421 plus federal grant funding in the amount of $1,813,084
both of which were included in the 2021 budget. This contract will have five one-year options for
extended hardware and firmware support in the amount of $29,946 annually. If all five options are
exercised, this will result in an additional cost of $149,730.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Budget Transfer for Railroad Liability Insurance Premiums

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager or her designee to authorize a budget
transfer of $400,000 to fund increased commuter rail liability insurance coverage and premiums for
the N-line.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Melanie J. Snyder, General Counsel
Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Section 24-10-115(7), C.R.S., requires a public entity that obtains insurance for claims arising from
passenger rail operations to insure against the federal liability cap set forth in 49 U.S.C. § 28103. RTD
maintains insurance for the N-line consistent with contractual requirements for easements from BNSF
and Suncor. Pursuant to the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, on February 26, 2021,
the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a notice of adjustment to the Rail Passenger
Transportation Liability Cap from $294,278,983 to $322,864,228. In order to increase its insurance
limits to meet this increased cap, RTD has identified insurance providers to provide this increased
coverage which has resulted in higher insurance premiums that were not budgeted.
DISCUSSION
RTD is seeking Board approval to transfer funds from the General Manager’s Contingency Fund to fund
the increased insurance premiums since the amount of the transfer exceeds the General Manager’s
authority. The increased premiums total $362,597 for the insurance coverage period of March 26,
2021 – September 30, 2021. This request seeks a transfer of $400,000 to allow for foreign currency
translation adjustments since the insurance providers are domiciled in Bermuda and any unencumbered
funds will be used for the next renewal period beginning October 1, 2021 or returned to the General
Manager Contingency Fund.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The General Manager Contingency Fund was appropriated by the Board with the approval of the 2021
Budget. Therefore, there is no net financial impact to the 2021 Budget, however, the financial impact to
RTD annually will be increased premiums of approximately $800,000.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Request for Budget Transfer Paratransit Software
Replacement

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager or her designee to authorize a budget
transfer of up to $4,000,000 to fund activities for the upcoming Paratransit Software Replacement
contract.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Paul Hamilton, Senior Manager, Paratransit Services
Eric Farrington, Senior Project Manager, Information Technology
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2008, RTD began using Routematch software to schedule paratransit service. This software, still in
use, is costly and outdated. RTD needs a new software system. The software does not offer mobile or
web portal trip booking and management for customers. IT staff developed portals to address this
shortcoming. As it stands, the software lacks basic modern functionality needed to optimize and fully
support the Agency’s paratransit customer base. Additionally, Routematch has developed a new cloudbased product and will cease to support RTD’s current system. Thus, the system requires replacement
due to obsolescence.
DISCUSSION
RTD needs a new software system which would improve productivity over the current system, thereby
saving RTD approximately between $2,000,000 and $4,000,000 annually. These savings can be
leveraged to offset the costs for a vendor to implement new technology savings to pay the selected
contractor. RTD is asking proposers to work at risk, based on confidence that they will be able to
improve productivity and be paid from the productivity savings. Due to the budget forecasting in 2020
for 2021, whereby budget savings were identified, staff is now seeking authorization to provide funding
through a budget transfer of up to $4,000,000 to fund this work.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated unfunded cost of contracting the replacement software and onboard hardware is less than
$4,000,000. Funding is available from existing operating funds currently designated for Access-a-Ride
fuel and transportation. This is in anticipation that those proceeds will not be needed for their original
intent due to reductions in fuel and operating costs due to increased Access-a-Ride productivity.
Therefore, there would be no budgetary impact, rather a transfer of funds would be completed from
Operating Funds into Capital Projects.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
COVID-19 Relief Funding and RTD Financial Update

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD has received notice of three COVID-19 relief federal funding grant apportionments. Each of those
apportionments are in various stages of having been drawn or RTD is awaiting further guidance from the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) regarding allowable expenditures. It is clear from the preliminary
guidance provided by the FTA that these apportionments must be used to maintain the core business of
transit agencies which is service delivery.
DISCUSSION
The financial impact to RTD from the COVID-19 Pandemic began in March 2020 and had the impact of
reducing fare revenue by $81.9 million and sales and use tax revenue by $32.1 million in 2020. This
adverse impact to RTD’s revenues is expected to continue during 2021 and beyond. A great deal of
uncertainty remains regarding RTD’s financial outlook, particularly during the six-year Mid-term Financial
Plan (MTFP) timeframe through 2026.
This uncertainty stems from an inability to determine if or when there may be a return to normalcy for
transit or what the future state of transit will be.
In regard to expected timing of the emergence from the COVID-19 Pandemic, in mid-February 2021, Dr.
Anthony Fauci, Chief Medical Advisor to the President, said “Hopefully by the time we start entering
2022, we really will have a degree of normality that will approximate the kind of normality we’ve been
used to.” Jen Psaki, White House Press Secretary followed by saying “We are not in a place where we
can predict exactly when everybody will feel normal again.”
As such, staff continues to closely monitor RTD’s financial results and outlook and will continue to
provide information to the RTD Board of Directors as events develop. The intent of this Discussion item
is to provide a current update of financial activities since the MTFP was approved in November 2020
and to provide information on the remaining financial challenges ahead.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

Sales and Use Tax Forecast Presentation

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Fiscal Policy requires that:
RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use tax forecasting containing
projections for the short-term (one year by quarter), mid-term (six-year Mid-Term Financial Plan period)
and long-term (30-year Long Range Financial Plan period). The purpose is to provide RTD with expert
economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using sophisticated financial modeling techniques not
available internally.
As such, RTD has contracted with the Business Research Division of the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business (CU Leeds) to provide semi-annual sales and use tax forecast model reports in March
and September to coincide with the development of RTD’s annual budget and six-year Mid-term
Financial Plan (MTFP). The provision of the forecast model report is followed by a presentation to the
RTD Board by CU Leeds in April and October.
DISCUSSION
RTD utilized the September 2020 sales and use tax forecast in the 2021-2026 MTFP of which the Board
approved years of 2021-2022 while declining to approve years 2023-2026 due to the uncertainty
resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic.
The March 2021 Forecast Model Report reflects a projected improvement from the September forecast
in RTD’s sales and use taxes through 2029 and a reduction in years 2030-2050.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The March 2021 Forecast Model Report results in the following changes to the sales and use tax
forecast from the September 2020 Forecast Model Report:

2021-2026 MTFP
2021-2050 Long-range Financial Plan

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Colorado recorded its first COVID-19 case on March 5, 2020. One week later, school districts began
to announce closures, followed by ski resorts on March 15th; the statewide stay-at-home orders took
effect March 25. The pandemic-induced recession had a swift, negative impact on RTD sales and use
taxes in 2020. While January and February recorded moderate year-over-year growth of 4.9% and
4%, respectively, March gave way to a 17% decline in year-over-year revenue as consumers became
cautious with the unknowns about the spread of the virus and the government instituted the
temporary closure of businesses. RTD sales and use tax revenue declined 4.1% in 2020. A revenue
recovery is projected for RTD in 2021, with forecasted growth of 8% that will push revenue to a new
record level.
Figure 1

RTD revenues are collected primarily within seven metropolitan counties (the “district”): Adams,
Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson, as well as a portion of Weld County.
Colorado and the Denver Metro region posted strong, above average economic growth following the
2007-2009 “Great Recession.” RTD recorded 10 consecutive years of sales and use tax growth
averaging 5.9% between 2010 and 2019. The pandemic recession created a drop in GDP, led to an
unprecedented decline in employment, and caused a sharp decrease in RTD revenue. The economy,
labor market, and RTD revenue are all showing signs of recovery.
A model was developed to examine fundamental relationships between U.S. and Colorado economic
growth, and between Colorado and the district. It forecasts short-term, medium-term, and longterm RTD sales and use tax revenue, and accounts for economic and demographic (e.g., population
age) shifts over time.
Economic Update
•
•

The COVID-19 pandemic created a sharp and profound negative impact upon the economy.
Real (inflation-adjusted) U.S. GDP in Q2 2020 decreased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
(SAAR) of 31.4% (9% year-over-year), but rebounded 33.4% (SAAR) in Q3 2020 (-2.8% yearover-year) and 4.1% in Q4 2020 (-2.4% year-over-year). Real GDP in 2021 is projected to
increase 4.9%, reaching a new record high, but remaining below potential GDP.

Executive Summary

1.C.2.b

•

•
•

•

Despite the recession and record losses in employment and wage and salary income,
personal income posted strong gains in 2020 due to a record increase in government
transfer receipts (e.g., unemployment benefits, household stimulus checks).
The increase in personal income and the lack of spending on services shifted personal
consumption to goods, which softened the recession’s impact on taxable goods in Colorado.
Nationally, 22.2 million jobs were lost in March and April (-14.5%). From May 2020 through
February 2021, the nation added back 12.9 million jobs, but total employment remained
down 6.2% from the peak.
Consumer and business sentiment both dropped significantly since the onset of the
pandemic on the U.S. economy, but confidence has rebounded as the economy reopened.

Short-Term Outlook
•

•

•

•

•
•
•

•
•
•

RTD sales and use tax revenue increased 6% in 2018 and 4% in 2019. Revenue subsequently
declined by 4.1% in 2020, due to the pandemic. Revenue is projected to rebound in 2021,
growing 8% to a record-high $683 million.
Coming off a recession year, employment is projected to increase 1.8% in 2021 and 4.2% in
2022. Statewide total personal income was unaffected by the recession due to government
assistance; personal income growth accelerated an estimated 6.4% in 2020 and is projected
to increase 5.3% in 2021. The unemployment rate is projected to average 6.5% in 2021 and
to improve further to 4.5% in 2022.
The Governor’s Executive Order that extended the retail sales tax filing deadline and waived
penalties caused a delay in the RTD’s sales and use tax collections early in the pandemic.
This suggested a more pronounced decline in RTD revenue than actually occurred as delayed
revenue showed up as late payments.
The forecasting model also provides information on uncertainty that is inherent in any
forecast through construction of confidence bounds on total RTD revenues. The mean
forecast for 2021 of $683 million is bracketed by 67% confidence bounds of $666 million on
the low side and $700 million for the upper bound.
The mean forecast for 2022 is $726 million, bound by a lower bound of $701 million and an
upper bound of $751 million.
The 67% upper- and lower-bound estimates illustrate the broad uncertainty behind
economic conditions that pose upside opportunities and downside risks to the forecast.
Quarterly growth exhibits more volatility than annual growth, and use taxes are more
volatile than sales taxes. The third and fourth quarters tend to be the largest revenue
quarters for RTD.
Forecasts of national indicators that are used to drive state and district forecasts come from
Moody’s Analytics.
The September 2020 revenue forecasts for Q3 and Q4 2020 were low by 2.8% and 4.1%,
respectively, illustrating the rapid recovery of revenue in the second half of 2020.
The government response to this pandemic reversed the usual paradigm. Instead of
declining income, the direct government transfers resulted in sharply higher household
income and spending than the model predicted. Thus, sales tax revenue outperformed
expectations.

For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have been above the actual revenue 73
times and below the actual revenue 84 times, and a simple average of the error has been 0.8%, with a 4.4% standard deviation (including the rapid revenue swings during the
pandemic recession).

The impact of COVID-19 on the retail and restaurant industries, employment, income, and
tourism weighed heavily on retail sales activity.
The past two post-recession recovery periods lasted 4.5 years and 4.75 years, before RTD
revenues returned to their previous revenue peaks. However, RTD will likely surpass the
prior revenue peak after just two years (2020 and 2021) from the onset of the current
recession due to both the nature of the recession and the government response.
Modeling three economic scenarios helps to accommodate the broad uncertainty
surrounding the U.S. economy. These scenarios may be taken as plausible bounds on RTD
revenue growth over the medium-term period; the greatest variation in forecasts occurs
during the first three years.
Under the baseline scenario, RTD total tax revenues are projected to grow by 41% between
2020 and 2027, reaching $892 million by the end of the medium-term horizon.
A more optimistic scenario under which the national economy experiences a faster rebound
yields cumulative revenues 3.2% higher than the baseline scenario over the seven-year
horizon; however, the 2027 total is 4% above the baseline forecast, illustrating the value of a
faster recovery.
A second alternative scenario in which the national economy experiences slower growth in
the near term yields a cumulative 7-year forecast 2.2% below the baseline scenario.
The paradox of the 7-year forecast producing similar 2027 revenues points to the very shortrun nature of the current Moody’s alternative scenarios.
There may be higher inflationary pressure on the horizon caused by excess household
savings, high commodity prices, and a sudden tightening of the labor market.
Reflecting on the forecast accuracy before the pandemic, the medium-term forecasts have
proven to have a small margin of error. Five years out, the 2014 forecast for 2019 was high
by 2.1%. The 2015 forecast for 2019 was high by 4.4%, the 2016 forecast for 2019 was low
by 2.3%, the 2017 forecast for 2019 was low by 1.7%, and the 2018 forecast for 2019 was
high by 1.4%.

Long-Term Outlook
•

•
•

After revenue growth of 4.75% for the decade ending in 2020 (in current, nominal dollars),
revenue projections for the next three decades average 4% (2021–2030), 3% (2031–2040),
and 2.5% (2041–2050); the 30-year average is 3.2% (2021–2050).
Long-term revisions are due, in part, to lower expectations in the short-term forecast, as
well as revisions to the long-term population forecasts.
The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates population growth and shifts in the age
distribution of the population as key factors influencing the rate of growth in output,
employment, and sales.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Project Overview

The BRD collaborates with the RTD administration in order to forecast sales and use tax revenues,
and to identify the key drivers that will impact RTD’s tax revenue stream. Since project inception, the
BRD research team has been working closely with the RTD administration in order to better
understand the existing forecast system, to collect and organize relevant data, and to develop the
three sets of projections.
This report presents the revenue projections at the three forecast horizons, with some discussion of
the economic forces driving these forecasts. The model uses vector autoregression (VAR) techniques
in order to capture a mix of long-term, stable relationships, as well as short-term “deviations” from
these long-term trends. These relationships connect RTD tax revenue components to key
macroeconomic drivers, such as retail sales. The methodology is described in detail in the main body
of this report.
RTD revenue data, state retail sales, and state taxable sales are available through December 2020.
Data after these dates represent forecasts. Additional revenue from medical and retail marijuana
sales are in the RTD receipts. Adjustments to the model were necessary to accommodate the gap
year (July 1, 2017–June 30, 2018) in retail marijuana collections caused by Senate Bill 17-267. As
such, RTD taxable sales in this report are based on RTD sales tax revenues excluding retail marijuana
taxes. Therefore, these data are actually RTD taxable sales excluding marijuana sales. However, the
forecasts reported for RTD sales tax revenues include the forecasts of RTD retail marijuana revenues.
This construction was necessary to produce a series without the discontinuity over the period from
July 2017 through June 2018 to produce reasonable revenue forecasts.
In 2016, revenue from Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses (i.e., ecommerce) became a
significant contributor to RTD’s sales tax revenue. Ecommerce accounted for over 8% of the total
sales taxes collected in 2020.
Given the pandemic recession’s impact on specific sectors of the economy, the BRD began modeling
major components of RTD’s sales taxes (e.g., restaurants, auto sales, ecommerce, grocery, etc.).
Modeling the components of retail sales taxes will produce a forecast that accommodates the
volatility in the subcomponents.
The methodology and model descriptions may be found in Appendix A.

In an effort to provide consistent and accurate RTD revenue forecasts, a new sales and use tax
forecasting system was commissioned in 2010. The Business Research Division (BRD) of the Leeds
School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder was contracted to develop a model for
projecting RTD revenues over the short term (2020), medium term (2027), and long term (2050).

1.C.2.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Forecasts: Short Term, Medium Term and Long Term

Summary: Following the Great Recession, RTD recorded 10 consecutive years of sales and use tax
growth averaging 5.9% (2010-2019). The pandemic-induced recession caused RTD sales and use tax
revenue to decline 4.1% in 2020. After posting 4% year-over-year growth in February, the
deterioration in revenue took hold in March with a 17% year-over-year decrease. RTD recorded yearover-year losses nine months in 2020. A revenue recovery is projected for RTD in 2021, with
forecasted growth of 8% that will push revenue to a new record level.
Figure 2

All equations are estimated using monthly data to produce monthly forecasts that are aggregated
into quarterly or yearly data. Historical data for Colorado and national economic variables were
retrieved in February 2021, with much of the data current through December 2020. RTD revenue
data and state retail sales and taxable sales data are current through December 2020. All reported
data after these dates are forecasts.
The short-term forecast relies on the Baseline Scenario from Moody’s Analytics. These national
macroeconomic indicators drive the forecasts of the Colorado economy.
Colorado Economy Forecasts
As background to the revenue forecasts, data on Colorado economic indicators are presented in
Table 1. Key indicators of Colorado economic activity reflect the COVID-19 economy in 2020, and the
rebound in 2021. The unemployment rate averaged 7.1% in 2020, but is projected to improve to
6.5% in 2021 and 4.5% in 2022. Personal income grew in 2020 despite the record loss in employment
and employee earnings. Moderate nominal income growth is projected in the short-term, but real
income growth will be comparatively modest due to inflation.

Annual Tax Revenue Forecasts
The following table presents the expected changes in RTD base sales tax revenues and the driving
force behind these changes: taxable sales. From 2010 through 2019, district taxable sales recorded
10 consecutive years of growth averaging 6.1%. Taxable sales fell 3% in 2020, but are projected to
increase 7% in 2021 and 3.3% in 2022. Sales tax revenues are anticipated to change in stride, falling
2.6% in 2020, but rebounding 7.6% and 5.7% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Note that the model
uses RTD sales tax revenue (less marijuana revenue) to impute taxable retail sales in the sevencounty RTD district because retail marijuana is no longer assessed the 2.9% retail sales tax rate for
the state. However, retail marijuana is taxed 1% for the special districts, leading to a difference in
taxable sales and sales taxes.

The Short-Term Use Tax Revenue Forecast
In this model, use tax revenues are directly related to Colorado use tax collections reflecting the
broader geographical base for the use tax. Households and businesses residing within the district but
purchasing taxable goods outside the district are required to pay a use tax on these purchases at the
same rate as the sales tax. Illustrating the volatility, use tax revenues fell 1.1% in 2015, but increased
7.5% in 2016, 4.6% in 2017, and 25.7% in 2018 before falling 16% in 2019 and 14.3% in 2020. The
forecast calls for rebounding use taxes in 2021 and 2022. The volatility of use taxes is apparent in
both annual and quarterly data.

Upper- and Lower-Bound Estimates for Baseline Forecast
The previous tables present only medium-level forecasts, which should be interpreted as the mean
values within a range of probable outcomes. All forecasting exercises involve elements of
uncertainty, although information about possible forecast errors is seldom presented. Uncertainty
arises from the errors in equation specification and estimation, and from the forecasts of the
national variables that drive the state variables. Although information on the latter source of
uncertainty is not available, the probabilistic high and low forecast bounds that incorporate possible
errors in fitting the equations are presented. The values of the high and low forecast bounds are
computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a 0.67 probability exists that the interval
between low and high forecast values will contain the actual value of the variable being predicted.
The following table displays the 67% confidence bounds on total RTD revenues through 2022. The
wide 67% confidence interval reflects uncertainty. The possible range is as low as $665.7 million and
as high as $699.8 million for 2021. The 2021 lower and upper bounds range -2.5% to +2.5% relative
to the medium forecast. The confidence bound widens in 2022 with greater uncertainty. The 2022
upper- and lower-bound estimates are -3.5% and +3.4% different than the medium baseline
forecast, showing greater uncertainty one year out. This shows that it is not impossible or unrealistic
that revenue could grow stronger over the next year relative to the medium forecast, as well as the
exposure to the downside risk posed by economic threats.

Quarterly Tax Revenue Forecasts
More detailed information on the forecasts is provided by the quarterly figures. Quarterly growth
was volatile in 2016, but proved much more stable in the years that followed (2017-2019). However,
volatility was unmatched in 2020. For the remainder of the short-term forecast (through 2022), yearover-year growth will range between 4.3% and 12.4%.

Figure 3

Medium-Term Forecasts
Summary: The BRD short-term forecasting model is extended to produce forecasts over the time
horizon through 2027. Using different assumptions about the future course of the national economy,
three alternative projections are derived from the same equation specifications. Under the baseline
scenario, which leverages the Baseline macroeconomic scenario from Moody’s Analytics, RTD total
tax revenues are projected to grow by 41% from the end of 2020 to 2027.
Two alternative scenarios produce variations in the short-term revenue forecast (1-3 years), but
growth rates generally converge in the medium term (7 years). An alternative scenario in which the
national economy experiences a stronger short-term growth pattern yields a 46.6% increase from
2020-2027. Under stronger economic conditions, this scenario out-produces the baseline scenario
nearly every year of the medium-term forecast. In the second alternative, in which the economy
grows more slowly in the short run, there is a 38.2% increase between 2020 and 2027, with slower
growth recorded in the first two years followed by faster growth in the remainder of the forecast. The

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

The BRD short-term forecasting model is adapted to produce forecasts over the medium-term
horizon through 2027. This time frame has been chosen to conform to the RTD investment planning
horizon for FasTracks. The specifications of the equations for these medium-term forecasts are the
same as for the short-term model, and these are also estimated with monthly data.
Over any medium-term period, the U.S. economy can be subjected to shocks producing outcomes
that are difficult to anticipate. One reasonable way to present forecasts that incorporate the
uncertainty about future policy or unpredictable economic shocks is to develop results for
alternative scenarios. In addition to a baseline case, two alternative outcomes are presented: one
allowing for stronger growth than the selected baseline and the other assuming generally slower
economic growth. As an alternative method of incorporating uncertainty into the forecast, statisticsbased confidence bounds for the baseline scenario are also generated, producing high- and lowforecast bounds based on 67% confidence intervals.

Baseline Sales and Use Tax Revenue Forecasts
The Baseline RTD forecast is based on macroeconomic conditions described by Moody’s Analytics in
the “Baseline Forecast”. Moody’s Baseline Forecast is constructed with a 50% probability that the
U.S. economy will perform better and a 50% probability that it will underperform. This scenario
assumes that COVID-19 cases has peaked, and the U.S. reaches herd immunity by September. The
Fed commits to keeping interest rates low into 2023, and the latest round of Federal stimulus that
helps households and businesses is built into this national forecast. Downside risks to this forecast
include another spike in COVID cases that lead to another round of temporary business closures and
delayed or suspended round of economic stimulus. Upside potential includes faster-than-expected
herd immunity, and higher savings that supports potential consumer spending.
Real GDP grows 4.9% in 2021 and 5.2% in 2022; the average through the medium-term forecast is
3.1%. The unemployment rate improves to 6.1% in 2021 and falls well below 5% in 2023. Retail sales
increase moderately through the medium term.

differences in the cumulative revenue from 2020 to 2027 illustrate the impact of slower and faster
growth in the short run. The optimistic scenario produces cumulative (2020-2027) revenue $176
million above the baseline scenario, and the pessimistic scenario produces cumulative revenue $120
million below the baseline scenario. These alternative scenarios allow for a reasonable degree of
uncertainty about possible outcomes for the U.S. economy and may be taken as plausible bounds on
RTD revenue growth over the medium-term period.

the nation nearly every year of the forecast period.
Colorado personal income growth is projected to increase 5.3% in 2021. The average unemployment
rate in 2021 improves to 6.5%, and total employment grows 1.8%. The employment rebound begins
in 2021 and surpasses the prior peak in 2022. With new government stimulus, rebounding
employment and wage and salary earnings, retail sales continue to advance.

67% confidence bounds can be estimated. These interval forecasts show a lower-bound increase of
26.4% in RTD revenues for the 2020−2027 forecast period and a 55.6% increase in the high-range
forecast.

national economy—one positive and one negative—for district taxable sales and RTD tax revenues.

Optimistic Scenario
Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 1 – Upside – 10th Percentile” represents a more optimistic outcome
over the coming four years compared with the Baseline Forecast. In this scenario, there is a decrease
in COVID-19 cases in the short-term, there is another round of federal stimulus, consumer and
business optimism rises (partially on optimism about a vaccine), consumers return to retail and
travel sooner than expected, and the labor market improves.
Real GDP grows strongly in 2021 (5.9%) and 2022 (6.4%) before moderating. The unemployment rate
quickly improves, and retail sales post strong growth.

In this optimistic scenario, total RTD tax revenues reach $927.5 million in 2027, which is 4% above
the medium forecast under the baseline scenario. This scenario yields revenue growth rates faster
than the baseline projections through 2026; 2027 growth is the same as the baseline rate of growth.
Total revenues grow by 46.6% between 2020 and 2027. Cumulative revenues from 2020-2027 are
3.2%, or $175.6 million above the baseline scenario.

Pessimistic Scenario
Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 2 – Downside – 75th Percentile” is constructed with a 75% probability
that the U.S. economy will perform better and a 25% probability that it will underperform. This
slower-growth scenario is caused by persistently high COVID cases, a slow rollout/adoption of the
vaccine, and a smaller-than-expected stimulus package. Consumer confidence and consumer
spending both are negatively impacted, as is spending on business and leisure travel.

Summary across the Three Scenarios
RTD revenues rebound in 2021 across all three scenarios. In the baseline scenario, revenue grows
41% to $891.8 million in the medium term (2020-2027). The pessimistic scenario presents slower
growth early in the forecast horizon, followed by faster growth, growing to $874.4 million by 2027,
netting 38.2% growth over the period. The optimistic scenario records growth that results in an
increase of 46.6% over the period, to $927.5 million, with outperforming growth among the
scenarios early in the forecast horizon.
The timing of future revenue changes differs across the three scenarios. This difference reveals how
revenues may shift, but they eventually end up relatively close to each other. The difference in total
RTD revenues between the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios is 6.1% in 2027, but the cumulative
revenue differences are 5.5% between the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios.

The baseline scenario presents the BRD’s most likely forecast for RTD tax revenues over the years
2020−2027. After 2020, revenue grows steadily during this period, achieving an overall increase of
41% between 2020 and 2027, to $891.8 million in 2027.

Long-Term Forecasts
The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates age shares of the population as a key factor
influencing the rate of growth in real output and in state and district sales that determine RTD sales
and use tax revenues. This model projects annual growth rates in real RTD tax revenues to 2050.
Forecast summary information is presented in both constant (real) and current (nominal) terms.
Synopsis: Coming off a substantially lower base for 2020, the March 2021 long-term forecast reflects
moderate growth in the first 10 years of the forecast horizon, slowing in the final decade. Over the
entire 30-year period, RTD’s total tax revenues in nominal (current dollar) terms are projected to
grow by 3.2% per year on average, while the real (inflation adjusted) growth rate is 0.9%.
This forecast is for three decades: 2021–2030, 2031–2040, and 2041–2050.
National Economic and Demographic Trends
Growth in real output (GDP) is positively related to the proportion of the population that is upper
middle age (30–49 and 50–64) as this group contributes highly productive workers to the labor force
due to their experience and training. Although population shares change slowly, over the period
2010–2030 the proportion of the population in this productive age group is projected to decline,
from 46.2% to 43.4%, contributing to a slowing rate of growth in real output between now and 2030.
The prime population proportion then increases to 44% by 2050.

Summary of Three Scenarios

1.C.2.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

In addition to a slowing of total U.S. population growth over the next three decades, the differing
growth rates of key age groups will have negative effects on economic growth. Growth rates of the
most productive age group (30–64), as well as the total population, will be slower during the next
three decades compared with the previous 10-year period (Table 22), producing some slowing in the
rate of growth in output. Across the three decades of the forecast period, growth in real GDP slows
considerably during the final decade compared with the periods from 2021–2030 and from 2031–
2040. (See the BRD forecast in Table 23; the Moody’s projections are presented only for comparison
with the BRD forecasts and do not play a role in the long-term BRD projections of any real variables
after 2027.) Growth in the current decade was distorted by the negative impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the economy, and the strong growth that should follow in the recovery (although from
a markedly lower 2020 base). The demographic drag dampens growth in the final two decades of the
forecast horizon, partially offsetting the positive influences of increases in productivity and human
and physical capital that account for the long-run trend in GDP growth. During the final 10 years, the
share of the productive age group stabilizes, but the total population growth rate continues to
decline. The net effect of these demographic changes is a further decline in the real GDP growth rate
into the final decade of the forecast.

The BRD’s projected rate of growth in real GDP from 2021–2030 and from 2031-2040 are slightly
below Moody’s growth during the two decades, and notably slower in the last 10 years (2041–2050).
Over the 30-year forecast period, the BRD model projects 1.3% average growth and the Moody’s
model projects 2.2% average growth. The BRD forecast of retail sales growth is below Moody’s for
the forecast horizon.
Growth in U.S. retail sales is driven first by growth in output, which is then moderated by
demographic forces. The BRD forecasts show sluggish growth in retail sales during the last two
decades of the forecast (Table 24 reports rates of growth in real, inflation-adjusted terms).
Both Moody’s and BRD forecast modest growth rates in each of the three forward-looking decades.
Notably, retail sales grow at a slower pace than GDP.

Colorado and District Retail Sales, Taxable Sales, and RTD Sales and Use Tax Revenues
Following the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the economy early in the current decade, growth
rebounds for retail sales and taxable sales at the state and district levels. Over the long term, the
national economic environment is reflected in the Colorado forecast. The combined influence of
national economic forces and changing demographics leaves the state and the district with quite low
rates of growth in sales and taxable sales during the final decade of the forecast as shown in the
following tables and figures.
Colorado retail sales growth over the next three decades is slightly higher than for the nation.
Colorado taxable sales and RTD taxable sales also tend to outperform national retail sales growth
(with the exception of RTD taxable sales in the final decade). The very low growth rates for RTD
taxable sales during the final decade reflects the persistent slowdown in total population growth in
Colorado, and especially in the district.

This long-term forecast ends in 2050. During this period, retail activity faces demographic drag in the
state. The long-term average real growth rate for RTD taxable sales is 0.9%, reflecting the slow longterm (30-year) growth.
Looking at nominal growth rates in RTD taxable sales shown in Table 25, the decade from 2021-2030
and the following decade are expected to produce growth of 4% and 3%, respectively. The pattern of
growth rates in Colorado taxable sales and RTD taxable sales are both consistent with that of retail
sales growth, with average growth rates for the last decade of the forecast being the weakest for all
three sales variables. These rates of growth for nominal sales appear in the next table and figure.

Future RTD sales tax revenues are forecasted by multiplying the effective rate of taxation by the
district taxable sales forecasts. Assuming no further changes in the RTD effective tax rate beyond
those implied by the reinstatement of the vendor allowance, the rates of growth in RTD sales tax
revenues for 2016 and beyond are identical to those of district taxable sales. Since the use tax base
is not directly observable, it is still necessary to estimate an equation to forecast RTD use tax
revenues. In this equation, RTD use tax revenues are driven by Colorado use tax revenues and
indirectly by the value of single family residential building permits. Revenue forecasts in real and
nominal terms over the next three decades are summarized in the following tables and charts and in
Appendix A.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Actual RTD sales and use tax data are now available through December 2020, allowing for error
evaluation through Q4 2020. For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have been above the
actual revenue 73 times and below the actual revenue 84 times, and a simple average of the error
has been -0.8%, with a 4.4% standard deviation (including the rapid revenue swings during the
pandemic recession). The September 2020 forecast for Q3 and Q4 2020 were low by 2.8% and 4.1%,
respectively, illustrating the rapid recovery of revenue in the second half of 2020. The short-term
and medium-term forecasts were revised upward in March 2021, coinciding with optimism about a
primed economic recovery—expectations for GDP, retail sales, employment, and personal income
improved. The average 30-year forecast growth rate in nominal dollars ending in 2050 is 0.2
percentage points lower than the September forecast.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Three models have been developed and estimated for forecasting RTD sales and use tax revenues at
the short term (2022-2022), medium term (2027), and long term (2050). All three models consist of
dynamic equations that link RTD district retail sales and sales and use tax revenues to underlying
national and state economic indicators. Forecasts of the national indicators that are needed to drive
the state and district forecasts come from Moody’s Analytics. Population projections that enter the
equations of the long-term model come from Moody’s Analytics and the Colorado Demography
Office. Colorado economy forecasts are derived from updated specifications of the Colorado
Economy Model that was originally developed by members of the BRD team for the Office of State
Planning and Budgeting.

Key Econometric Concepts
The equations of the RTD forecast model rely on modern techniques of econometric time series
analysis. Each equation specifies a dynamic relationship between two or more variables, capturing
both a long-run equilibrium relation and short-run dynamic adjustments toward this equilibrium.
Such equations are called error correction models (ECMs) and are a type of vector autoregression
(VAR) model. Following time series analysis traditions, these equations may embody complex
dynamic behavior that is based on rigorous examination of historical patterns in the data. Unlike
univariate (ARIMA) methods, which are sophisticated representations of trends and cycles, VAR
models include explanatory variables in each equation to allow persistent departures from trends
and possible turning points.
In the error correction model, a long-run equilibrium relation is joined with a short-run dynamic
adjustment mechanism. The long-run relation is called the cointegrating equation, which captures
the common trends in the variables of interest. For example, district taxable sales and state retail
sales are expected to move together as a result of common underlying economic processes; they are
therefore referred to as “cointegrated” variables. Naturally, one will observe short-run departures
from this common pattern, but with a tendency for one variable to adjust back toward the
equilibrium relation. For example, the district economy may lag behind changes in the Colorado
economy, but departures from the common trends governing these two variables will vanish within
several months. These dynamic adjustments back toward the equilibrium relation are captured by
the ECM.
This framework is illustrated with a simplified version of the relation between district taxable sales
(TXBLSALES_RTD) and retail sales of Colorado (TRDR_TTL).
DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD) = - 0.205*LOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.210*LOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) + 0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(-1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)) - 0.03745*@SEAS(1) + 0.040*@SEAS(5) 0.033*@SEAS(7) +4.125
Here DLOG( ) transforms any variable into its rate of change, so that the left hand side term is
interpreted as the rate of change in RTD taxable sales. Looking at the first two terms on the right
hand side, one sees that RTD taxable sales respond negatively to the level of taxable sales in the

Appendix A: Models for the Three Forecast Horizons

1.C.2.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

A more complex adjustment back toward equilibrium is embodied in the following three terms on
the right hand side of the equation (- 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) +
0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)). Past rates of change in RTD taxable sales and current plus past changes
in Colorado retail trade also impact the rate of adjustment in RTD taxable sales in the current period.
Additional independent variables, such as the price of gasoline (- 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)), can also be included in error correction equations, and this specification also
contains three seasonal dummy variables and a constant term.
This particular specification of lags and differences is the result of experimenting with various
alternatives and selecting the equation that meets standard diagnostic criteria, such as uncorrelated
residuals and statistically significant coefficients. For example, it is natural to allow all 12 months to
enter into the equation as seasonal variables, but only 3 of these were found to have statistically
significant effects. Similar cointegrating equations and ECMs are developed for the other key
variables in the RTD forecast model.
Since the ECM is expressed in rates of change, this is the natural form in which the forecasts of
district taxable sales can be generated. Given historical and forecasted values of all right-hand side
variables, the ECM produces forecasts of district taxable sales based on the forecasted month-tomonth changes.
Econometrics explicitly allows for random errors in the equations and in the estimation of their
coefficients. These sources of error will be reflected in the model’s forecasts, and the resulting
uncertainty can be estimated through simulation methods. This uncertainty is presented in the form
of interval forecasts given by the model’s mean forecast plus and minus one standard deviation of
the forecast error. The upper and lower bounds of these 67% confidence interval forecasts provide
statistically based high and low forecasts for each time period within the forecast horizon.

Comparisons and Linkages between the Three Models
All three models are grounded in the cointegration and ECM methodology, and all three generate
statistically based interval forecasts of RTD sales and use tax revenues. The short-term and mediumterm models are estimated using monthly data and produce forecasts at that same frequency. These
monthly forecasts of sales and use tax revenues are then aggregated to quarterly series for the
short-term forecasts and to annual data for the medium term.
The specifications of individual equations in the short-term and medium-term models are the same,
and therefore the baseline forecasts over a one-year horizon are identical. Variables and forecasts in
these two models are expressed in nominal values.
In order to forecast district level variables (e.g., RTD taxable sales, use tax revenues), it is necessary
to model and forecast economic variables at the state level. The Colorado Economy Model

previous period and positively to the previous period’s level of Colorado retail trade. These two
terms capture the error correction mechanism: if RTD taxable sales are too high relative to the level
of Colorado retail trade, then TXBLSALES_RTD will tend to decline in the following period. In this
situation the relation between RTD taxable sales and Colorado retail sales is out of equilibrium,
requiring future adjustments to restore equilibrium between these two cointegrated variables.

1.C.2.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

previously developed for OSPB provides the framework for predicting state economic variables, such
as Colorado retail trade and Colorado taxable sales. These key Colorado variables are driven by
corresponding national variables and related state series, such as personal income. The linkages
between the economic variables at the national, state, and district level are shown in the following
figure:
Figure 9

The primary drivers from the national economy are personal income, employment, and retail sales,
and these contribute to the determination of Colorado retail sales and, in turn, RTD taxable sales.
Given the effective rate of sales taxation, RTD sales tax revenues are then given by a simple algebraic
identity.
Recognizing that large shocks to the national economy are likely to occur at some time over the
seven-year forecast horizon, the possibility of such shocks is incorporated in the medium-term
forecast by the use of two alternative national economic scenarios from Moody’s Analytics. These
alternative scenarios allow for the possibility of faster economic growth in the near term in one case
and for slower long-term growth in the other. These scenarios also provide alternative bounds that
complement the statistically based lower-bound forecasts from the econometric model.
The long-term model equations are fundamentally different from those of the other models, and are
designed to capture gradual structural adjustments in the economy due to changing demographics.
This model relies on population projections from Moody’s Analytics and from the Colorado State
Demography Office to drive the forecasts of all real national economic variables, state and district
retail sales and taxable sales, and therefore RTD sales and use tax revenues. Whereas Moody’s
forecasts of national economic indicators are used to drive the short-term and medium-term
Colorado Economy Model forecasts, BRD researchers have developed equations for key national
variables for the long-term forecasts. Only Moody’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) forecast is used for
converting forecasts of real variables into nominal values in the long-term forecasts.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

However, market disruptions and supply-chain discord associated with current events creates
additional risk that the CPI can be adjusted upward, potentially sharply, in the coming 24
months. Currently, however, there is no clear evidence of nationwide inflationary pressure. When
asked about prospects for inflation on March 4th, 2021, Chairman Jerome Powell suggested that
inflation will increase this year, but that it would prove to be temporary.
A combination of factors that may cause higher inflation within the next 12-24 months include:
•

Excess savings by households who remained employed during the pandemic (approximately
80% of workers). As the economy reopens, most households are expected to boost
spending well above historical averages. This abnormally high spending can create demandpull inflation.

•

High commodity prices. Several staple commodities, such as copper, lumber, and wheat are
priced near all-time highs. This causes potential cost-push inflation. Such effects are
currently seen in home-construction costs.

•

Sudden tightening of labor markets. As the economy reopens, labor markets are expected
to tighten, leading to wage growth. Wage growth is considered to be the largest contributor
to inflation.

The RTD forecast model currently incorporates annual US inflation that rises to 2.6% by 2022, with
Denver metro area inflation above 3% by 2023. The BRD team will continue to monitor the situation
and may adjust expected inflation when sufficient evidence emerges to suggest changing inflation
expectations.

The Input Data—Sources and Description
This section describes the data used to estimate equations and generate forecasts from the three
models. There are three levels of data: national variables, Colorado data, and district (RTD) data.
National Statistics and Forecasts: National data, such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. GDP figures, track
closely to state indicators. Typically, higher U.S. retail sales indicate higher retail sales in Colorado.
National statistics for GDP and retail sales are published frequently, and several forecasts for these
indicators are available. The Colorado Economy Model that drives the district level variables relies on
these national variables to forecast corresponding state variables.
Some key national indicators are:
•

U.S. Retail Sales: Obviously, this indicator tracks closely to Colorado’s retail sales. This
indicator, along with its forecasted levels, is a central part of the Colorado Economy Model
and the RTD district model.

Higher inflation could have an impact on the RTD forecast. Currently, the real-dollar RTD forecast is
constructed as nominal dollars adjusted to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For most of the previous
decade, the CPI has been low – between 0.5% and 2.0% annually.

1.C.2.b

The figure below shows the relationship between U.S. retail sales and Colorado retail sales
over the past two decades. The Colorado sales values are not seasonally adjusted (the U.S.
figures are), but the two series are clearly closely related. The data have been standardized
to show the common movement of the two variables. U.S. retail sales change direction at
the same time as Colorado retail trade. It can also be seen that, over time, the overall level
of trade trends diverge slightly for these two series. In 2000 through 2006, U.S. retail sales
were, for the most part, greater than Colorado sales, but from 2009 to 2020 the opposite
was true. This implies that U.S. retail sales were growing more slowly than Colorado sales
over the past 15 years.
Figure 10

•

National Income: U.S. GDP, personal income, and disposable income serve as common
indicators for the state of the national economy. U.S. GDP plays a key role in the long-term
model. U.S. personal income is a predictor of Colorado personal income, which enters into
the equation for Colorado retail trade.

•

Consumer Price Index and Components: In forecasting sales and use tax revenues, it is vital
to distinguish between taxable and nontaxable expenditures and to consider how the
composition of household expenditures changes over time. In the short run, the proportion
of expenditures going to taxable items can vary with changes in the relative prices of goods
and services that are tax exempt. Gasoline prices are one example of a CPI component that
fluctuates dramatically, affecting the share of taxable/nontaxable retail sales. This variable
is included in the current specification of some equations in the forecasting model. The CPI
is also used to convert between nominal and real values of personal income and retail sales.

•

Population by Age: In the long-term model, the age distribution of the population plays an
important role in the forecasts of retail sales and taxable sales. For example, the rate of
growth in the prime working-age population of the United States is used in the equation for
national GDP. Population projections come from Moody’s Analytics.

Regional Economic Variables: The equations in the forecasting model are based on basic
relationships between corresponding variables at national, state, and district levels. National data,
such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. personal income, track closely to local indicators. While national

Colorado and Denver Metro Personal Income: Total wages are obtained on a quarterly basis
by industry (or aggregated) and by county from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (not seasonally
adjusted). This information is posted online with a six-month time lag. The data source is the
Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). Because the survey only asks for total
wages disbursed for the quarter, and not for the month, we cannot see an alternative
method for obtaining monthly data by county. This survey solicits information from the
employer’s location, not from the employees’ residence, so some wages leak out of the
Denver Metro region. Personal income data for the state of Colorado are sourced from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics on a quarterly basis. (Data sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics,
www.bls.gov; Bureau of Economic Analysis, www.BEA.gov)

•

State and District Populations by Age Group: In the long-term model, retail sales and taxable
sales at state and local levels are affected by the age distribution of the relevant population.
Data on population by age groups come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s U.S. Population
Projections and Population Estimates, and the Colorado State Demography Office in the
Colorado Department of Local Affairs.

•

Colorado and Denver Metro Employment: Employment by industry and metropolitan area is
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Current Employment Statistics (CES) is a survey of
employers and is available monthly, with a one- to two-month lag. These numbers are
revised as the QCEW data become available. If county-level data are necessary, the QCEW
employment data are available, but lag six months.

•

Taxable and Total Retail Sales and Tax Revenue Data: The Colorado Department of Revenue
(DOR) is the primary source for taxable sales, sales tax revenues, and use tax revenues. From
the collection of sales tax revenues each month and the knowledge of the effective rate of
taxation, the department computes the value of taxable sales (revenues divided by the tax
rate). At the state level, this procedure produces data on sales tax revenues and taxable
sales that are entirely consistent. However, the DOR computes taxable sales based on the
tax laws that apply to state sales tax collections, and these laws previously differed in their
treatment of RTD tax collections. In 2014, HB 13-1272 effectively changed the RTD base to
be the same as the state tax base.
We apply the same DOR data construction procedure to compute RTD taxable sales. Sales
tax revenues collected by RTD are divided by the RTD effective rate of taxation to produce
RTD taxable sales. In addition to providing consistency between the taxable sales and
revenues data, this procedure allows future changes in RTD tax rates to be incorporated
(e.g., anticipated changes in the vendor allowance).
Forecasts of district taxable sales are driven by equations that relate this variable to
Colorado retail trade (taxable and nontaxable). This, in turn, is linked to U.S. retail sales.

level retail trade sales are a reliable indicator of general trends in Colorado retail sales, the inclusion
of state-specific economic variables, such as Colorado personal income, can improve the explanatory
and forecasting power of the model.

1.C.2.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Most long-term economic forecasting exercises employ a production function framework to project
real output (GDP). With this approach, output is a function of labor supply, capital stock, and
technology. From projections of these three determinants, predicting output is straightforward.
However, forecasting these three inputs is a daunting task that is often handled with arbitrary
assumptions about their long-run growth rates. There is little reason to believe that projections of
the growth rates in the three inputs would produce more reliable forecasts than directly projecting
output.
However, the BRD long-term forecasting model borrows some useful elements from this framework.
Modeling real output growth for the national economy is the starting point of the BRD forecasting
model, and all other variables in the BRD model are also expressed in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.
This puts aside the task of forecasting inflation, which depends on national political issues, Federal
Reserve behavior, and changes in global resource prices. Since inflation rates can be expected to
impact RTD revenues and costs symmetrically, incorporating inflation into the analysis is an
unnecessary complication.
Although the BRD model does not estimate a production function or make assumptions about the
long-run growth in inputs, a production relation implicitly underpins the framework. The growth in a
nation’s labor force, capital stock, and technology is affected by the age distribution of the
population. Substantial theoretical and empirical literature on the “demographic dividend”
establishes the impact that age distribution has on economic growth, working through the three
determinants of real output.1 The use of the age distribution of the population in forecasting longterm economic growth in general, and RTD tax revenues in particular, has several important
advantages:
•

•

•

Sound economic theory and empirical evidence supports the existence of a stable, predictive
relation between output and age structure. Output growth is positively related to the
working age share of the population, according to the aggregate production relation, and it
is negatively related to the dependency ratio, according to life cycle models of saving.
The age structure of the population is predictable with reasonable accuracy, and projections
are provided by the Social Security Administration and published by the Census Bureau.
Underlying demographic processes (fertility rates, mortality rates, immigration) change
slowly over time, allowing accurate age-specific population projections. Furthermore, older
portions of the age distribution of the population can be projected with great accuracy
because for the next 30 years, the population over the age of 30 depends only on mortality
rates and immigration—the former being highly predictable.
In terms of the production function framework, the age distribution can impact output
through each of the three inputs. By affecting the savings rate, age structure influences real
business investment and the growth in capital stock. One form of investment is in R&D,

which contributes to productivity growth. In addition, new physical investment embodies
latest technologies, thereby contributing to productivity growth. The labor force is obviously
directly related to the age structure through the size of the working age population. Also,
experienced workers tend to be more productive than new entrants to the labor force, so an
older workforce shows higher output per worker.
The ultimate goal is to forecast (taxable) retail sales, not output. Given the equivalence of
output and income, a simple consumption function links retail sales to output or,
equivalently, to gross national income. However, the relation between aggregate
consumption and aggregate income is expected to vary over time with changes in the age
structure of the population. Therefore, the equation for (national) retail sales includes the
population age shares, as well as aggregate income.
By the same reasoning, the age distribution affects the relation between total retail sales
(the model’s key national variable) and taxable sales (the relevant state and district
variables). For example, the consumption pattern of people 65 and older shows a higher
proportion of spending on nontaxable items compared with younger individuals who spend
more on taxable goods as they establish new households.

The BRD model employs this framework to produce long-term forecasts over the period ending
2050. Business cycle fluctuations come into play only during the current decade as the economy
gradually moves toward capacity output. These business cycle fluctuations play a role in the
medium-term forecasts previously developed for RTD, and the forecasts presented here build on
these 2020–2026 forecasts. The short-term and medium-term forecasts presented in the earlier
sections of this report employ nominal (current dollar) values of all variables, while the long-term
analysis is based on real variables. Both real (inflation adjusted) and nominal forecasts of total RTD
revenues are presented in this section of the report to allow comparisons with other forecasts and
to permit either real or nominal budgetary analysis. The data presented through the end of 2020 are
historical observations, while data from 2021 to 2050 represent forecasts.
The equations of the long-term BRD model employ the same dynamic error correction/cointegration
framework as the short- and medium-term models. All variables in these equations are expressed in
real terms, and projected real variables from the equations are converted to nominal values using
Moody’s forecasted national CPI. Both real and nominal values are presented in the tables and
charts of this section.
National output growth is determined by population shares as indicated by the previous discussion.
National retail sales growth is driven by output growth, moderated by changes in age shares of the
population. State and district sales and taxable sales are similarly related to national and state sales,
as well as state and district population shares. State and district sales growth rates, in turn,
determine the growth in RTD sales and use tax revenues.
National retail sales and Colorado personal income are key factors driving Colorado retail sales in the
long-term forecasting model. But differences in population growth rates and age distribution for the
nation, the state, and the district affect the relations between sales at the three geographical levels.
The growth rate of Colorado’s working-age population, for example, affects personal income growth
in the state, which in turn feeds into the determination of Colorado retail sales. Slowing growth of

Population forecasts are sourced from the Office of the Colorado State Demographer and from
Moody’s Analytics. Colorado population forecast revisions by age and by county were released in
late 2020, and showed slower net migration to the state and the district (note: new Colorado and
district population estimates and projections will be released in October 2021).
Overall, population growth in Colorado and in the district affects the growth in sales and therefore in
sales tax revenues. While total U.S. population growth declines steadily over the three decades of
the long-term forecast, the state and the district exhibit somewhat different patterns in expected
growth rates as shown in the following figure. The estimated population growth rate for the district
and for the state peaked in 2015, followed by a decade of rather flat growth rates, and then began a
long period of decline. If birth rates increase, or the state experiences stronger net immigration, the
trend may be altered somewhat.
Figure 11

In addition to variations in the rate of total population growth, the changing population age
structure also affects the growth rates of sales and tax revenues in the long-term projections. For
Colorado and the district, the proportion of those in the prime working-age group and those in the
youngest age group (0 to 29 years of age) are projected to decline throughout most of the forecast
period, while the share of the aging population will grow. These trends will adversely impact total
and taxable sales in the state and the district.

this prime working-age population therefore indirectly contributes to the declining growth in
Colorado retail sales, Colorado taxable sales, and therefore RTD taxable sales. On the other hand,
moderate growth in the total population of the state adds to the growth in Colorado taxable sales,
offsetting to some extent the adverse effects of changing population age shares on the other sales
and tax revenue variables.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Since budget planning more commonly employs nominal (current dollar) values, the inflationadjusted (real) forecasts are converted to current dollars using Moody’s Analytics annual forecasts of
the national CPI for urban households. This adjustment with the national CPI is consistent with the
conversions to real values used throughout the BRD long-term modeling project. Although local CPI
data are available, these may be less reliable than the national data due to smaller samples in the
price surveys.

Appendix C: A Qualitative Assessment of Colorado’s Economy

Summary: The U.S. and Colorado economies experienced significant contractions as a result of the
coronavirus pandemic. Both the U.S. and Colorado observed significant declines in GDP, employment,
and wage and salary income; and record increases in jobless claims and unemployment. After
decreasing 6.3% year-over-year in Q2 2020, Colorado real GDP began to rebound, but remained
down 1.4% year-over-year in Q3 2020 (5th-best nationally). Colorado lost 342,700 jobs from February
through April 2020 (-12.2%). The state added back 191,500 jobs by December, but remained down
5.4% from peak, ranking Colorado 26th for employment growth. Additionally, the state’s
unemployment rate increased from the 3rd-lowest nationally early in 2020 to the 36th-highest by yearend, illustrating the destructive impact of the recession on Colorado’s labor market.
COVID-19
The United States had the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the world as of March
2021. While Colorado has the 21st-largest population in the United States, the state recorded the
22nd-highest number of cases, and the 26th-highest number of deaths.

Confidence
The Consumer Confidence from the Conference Board recorded an increase in Consumer Confidence
for January 2021, up from a six-year low in April after increasing through November and falling in
December. The Mountain Region often exceeds the national index, though it dipped below the
national reading in June, July, and September 2020, and is above the national reading for January.
The Mountain Region index is far removed from its recent peak in September 2018.

This qualitative assessment of the U.S. and Colorado economies is intended to serve as context for
the RTD sales and use tax forecast. In the process of compiling an annual business and economic
outlook for Colorado, the BRD has developed local indicators that can be used to complement the
results from the econometric models.

1.C.2.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

The Leeds Business Confidence Index (LBCI), a forward-looking index of economic and industry
growth expectations, revealed that Colorado business leaders’ confidence improved ahead of Q1
and Q2 2021 from the record low observed last year. An index reading above 50 indicates positive
expectations. Ahead of Q1 2021, the index increased to 47.9, and improved further ahead of Q2 to
59.5. State expectations decreased slightly to 46.9, a 2-point decrease from Q4 2020. Looking further
ahead to Q2 2021, state and national expectations were more optimistic, with both state and
national expectations rebounding above 50.

Gross Domestic Product
Real GDP increased at seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 4.1% nationally in Q4 2020
following a record decrease in GDP during Q2 and a rebound in Q3 as the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic became evident in economic data. Personal consumption expenditures were up 2.4% on
account of a 4% increase in services, while durable goods declined 0.6% and nondurables shrank
1.1%. Gross private fixed investment rose 26.5%, government consumption fell 1.1%, and the trade
deficit widened. GDP is expected to grow in 2021; according to Consensus Forecasts, Q1 is projected

to grow (annualized) by 4.8%, Q2 7.6%, and Q3 7%, before tapering off to 4.6% growth by Q4. GDP
growth in 2021 stands to be the fastest in decades.
In Q3 2020 (newest available data), Colorado’s real GDP decreased 1.4% year-over-year but grew at
an annualized rate of 30.1% from Q2 2020 to Q3 2020. Nationally, Colorado ranked 5th in year-overyear growth.

Jobless Claims
Initial jobless claims illustrate the immediate and profound impact of the pandemic on employment.
While initial filings in the United States are well below the record highs observed in March and April,
claims improved to 712,000 the week ending March 6, 2021. The average for the year leading up to
the crisis was 217,000 per month. Colorado recorded 863,000 initial claims from the week ending
March 21, 2020 to the week ending March 6, 2021, averaging 16,900 per week, compared to an
average of 1,900 per week in 2019.

Employment and Wages
For the 12 months ending in January 2021, the United States lost 800,250 jobs per month, on
average. In March, the U.S. lost 1.3 million jobs, followed by a record 20.8 million in April—the
largest one-month decline since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began collecting data in 1948. The
U.S. added back 12.9 million jobs from May 2020 through February 2021 but remained down 6.2%
from the prior peak.

Colorado lost 16,500 jobs in March 2020 and a record 325,800 jobs in April, before adding back a
combined 120,500 jobs in May through December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The
majority of the employment rebound was observed in May and June (128,000 jobs); gains continued
through October before losses in November (-4,700 jobs) and December (-20,300 jobs) on account of
surging cases and heightened restrictions in the winter months. The state added 5,100 jobs per
month on average during 2019. The combined Denver-Aurora-Lakewood and Boulder MSAs made
up 62.8% of non-farm employment in Colorado in December 2020.
Leading up to the pandemic, historically low unemployment rates in Colorado, especially in the
Denver Metro area, led to a shortage of skilled workers. Colorado unemployment hit a record low of
2.5% in October 2019 and has experienced a relatively continuous downward trend since the end of
the Great Recession. This decrease to a new record low occurred as both the labor force and
employment posted strong gains over the decade. The Boulder and Denver-Aurora-Lakewood MSAs
had record low unemployment rates of 2.0% and 2.3%, respectively, but have since increased to
6.9% and 8.5% in December 2020, respectively. Colorado’s unemployment rate increased to a record
12.2% in April 2020 and rests at 8.2% in December, ranking the state as having the 4th highest
unemployment rate in the nation. Nationwide, the unemployment rate rose to 6.8% in January
2021.
Industry employment gains in Colorado year-over-year in December 2020 were led by
Administrative Support and Waste Management (5,000); Finance and Insurance (3,000); and Trade,
Transportation, and Utilities (2,800). Employment in Colorado saw record declines in April with the

Leisure and Hospitality sector observing the largest month-over-month decline (-148,900), followed
by Education and Health Services (-44,000), and Trade, Transportation, and Utilities (-40,400).
However, these sectors have observed the largest employment rebound, with the Leisure and
Hospitality Sector gaining 74,700 jobs from April through December, followed by Trade,
Transportation, and Utilities (66,100) and Education and Health Services (33,800).

In Q3 2020, Colorado had the 17th-highest personal income in the nation, and the state ranked 12th
in per capita personal income, at $63,098. The U.S. average was $60,320. The state’s growth in per
capita personal income ranked 48th, at 2.7%. Over the past 10 years, Colorado per capita personal
income has remained higher than the national average.
Real Estate
The most recent data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) All Transactions Index show
that home prices in Colorado increased 5.8% year-over-year in Q4 2020 (26th-highest), signalling that
the COVID-19 pandemic has had little effect on the housing market. The Purchase-Only index
increased 10.7% year-over-year (27th).

The total value of construction is determined when permits are pulled rather than when activity is
put into place. Colorado recorded $19.5 billion in construction in 2020, a 3.6% increase year-overyear. Residential construction drove the growth, recording a 11.5% increase in 2020, while
nonresidential and nonbuilding construction fell.

National retail and food services sales increased 7.3% year-over-year and 5.3% month-over-month in

E-Commerce
Internet sales continue to outpace traditional brick-and-mortar sales. As technology advances
through tablets and mobile devices, consumers have greater ability to make digital purchases and
access the nation’s e-commerce landscape. The stay-at-home orders exacerbated the already-rapid
shift to online purchases, with large retailers such as Neiman Marcus and Barneys New York recently
declaring bankruptcy while retailers such as Amazon reporting record sales.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce sales increased strongly year-over-year in Q2
(44.5%), Q3 (36.6%), and Q4 2020 (32.1%). However, sales declined quarter-over-quarter in Q3 and
Q4 (-1.1% and -1.2%, respectively) coming off the strong growth in Q2. The nation’s e-commerce
market continues to experience steady growth in its market share, making up 14% of total retail
sales in Q3 2020, up from 11.2% in Q3 2019.

Appendix D: Prolonged Recession Scenario

This scenario represents a 96% probability that the economy will perform better and a 4%
probability that it will perform worse. This protracted slump is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic
lasting longer than generally expected. In this scenario, the vaccine rollout goes slower than
expected, and resistant strains rise, causing the recovery to stall.
After real GDP fell 4.1% in 2020, GDP records a modest rebound in 2021 (1.1%) before retrenching,
falling 2% in 2022 followed by a moderate recovery. This prolonged recession has sustained,
detrimental impacts on the labor market, pushing unemployment rates past 10% in 2022 and 2023.
Retail sales decrease 5.5% nationally in 2022 before beginning to rebound.
Following the pandemic recession in 2020, RTD revenue posts gains in 2021, but falls with the
double-dip recession in 2022 (-2%). However, RTD revenue begins posting growth again in 2023,
ranging between 3.6% and 7.4% in the medium term horizon. Annual revenue does not surpass the
prior peak until 2023.
