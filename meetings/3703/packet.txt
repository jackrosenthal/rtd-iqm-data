BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Sales and Use Tax Forecast

October 8, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Fiscal Policy requires that:
RTD will contract with a qualified, independent third party to provide sales and use tax forecasts.
As such, RTD has contracted with the Business Research Division of the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business (CU Leeds) to provide semi-annual sales and use tax forecast model reports in March
and September to coincide with the development of RTD’s annual budget and Five-year Financial
Forecast. The provision of the Forecast Model Report is followed by a presentation to the Board by CU
Leeds.
DISCUSSION
The September 2024 sales and use tax forecast will be included in the 2025 Budget. The attached
September 2024 Forecast Model Report reflects a change from the March 2024 forecast in RTD’s sales
and use taxes as follows:

Forecasts may be too high or too low, reflecting uncertainty in the
economy.
Forecasts are generated from theoretically sound economic relations,
modeled with state-of-the-art methods of modern econometric time
series analysis.
BRD forecasts do not incorporate “add factors” or other subjective
adjustments of model forecasts.
BRD is independent from RTD with no political or financial stake in the
forecast numbers.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Economic growth softened in 2024, but still renders a stable footing that supports RTD revenue
growth in 2024 and 2025. As of September 2024, GDP continues to post moderate gains,
employment grew at a more modest pace, inflation dipped below 3%, and the Fed signaled rate
cuts. Colorado retail activity slowed ahead of the nation and is expected to underperform in 2024
before rebounding in 2025, contributing to slower short-term sales and use tax revenue for RTD.
Following retail normalization in 2023 and 2024, growth rates rebound in the medium-term forecast.
Figure 1

RTD revenues are collected primarily within seven metropolitan counties (the “district”): Adams,
Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson, as well as a portion of Weld County.
A model was developed to examine fundamental relationships between U.S. and Colorado economic
growth, and between Colorado and the district. It forecasts short-term, medium-term, and longterm RTD sales and use tax revenue, and accounts for economic and demographic (e.g., population
age) shifts over time.
Economic Update
•
•
•

•

The U.S. economy has proven resilient in 2024. Inflation fell below 3% for two consecutive
months as of August, and the Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points on September 18th.
Other economic conditions continue to indicate expansion: GDP, employment, wages,
personal income, consumption, and retail sales.
Based on a blend of Moody’s Analytics’ Baseline and S2 scenarios, real (inflation-adjusted)
GDP is projected to increase 2.5% in 2024 and 1% in 2025. National retail sales are projected
to grow 1.8% in 2024—the slowest rate since 2020, suppressed in part by elevated inflation,
low savings, slower job growth, and modest real wage growth.
Nationally and locally, employment continued to post new record levels in 2023, and 2024 is
sustaining job growth, albeit at a slower rate. Colorado employment growth slowed in 2024,
making that state look more average nationally.

Executive Summary

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

•

•

•

•
•

•

RTD sales and use tax revenue declined by 4.1% in 2020 due to the pandemic but grew
19.6% in 2021 and 13% in 2022. Revenue growth slowed in 2023 to 0.3%, to total $858.1
million. Revenue is projected to accelerate to 1% growth in 2024 and 4.2% in 2025.
The Q1 and Q2 2024 revenue was squarely within the confidence bound presented in March
2024.
Colorado employment is projected to increase 1.5% in 2024 but slow to under 1% growth in
2025 under the baseline scenario. Personal income continues to outperform the nation.
Indicating slight loosening in the tight labor market, the national unemployment rate was
4.2% in August 2024, remaining at or above 4% for four consecutive months. The
unemployment rate in Colorado was 3.9% in July 2024.
The forecasting model also provides information on uncertainty that is inherent in any
forecast through construction of confidence bounds on total RTD revenues. The 67% upperand lower-bound estimates illustrate the broad uncertainty behind economic conditions that
pose upside opportunities and downside risks to the forecast. The mean forecast for 2024 of
$867 million is bracketed by 67% confidence bounds of $843 million on the low side and
$890 million for the upper bound. The mean forecast for 2025 is $903 million, with a lower
bound of $833 million and an upper bound of $969 million.
Notable local headwinds include a slow net migration; high office vacancy and commercial
real estate loans coming due in 2025, which eventually will result in markdowns for regional
banks; household credit delinquencies; and depleted housing savings.
Quarterly growth exhibits more volatility than annual growth, and use taxes are more
volatile than sales taxes. The third and fourth quarters tend to be the largest revenue
quarters for RTD.
Forecasts of national indicators that are used to drive state and district forecasts come from
Moody’s Analytics.
For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have been above the actual revenue 79
times and below the actual revenue 94 times, and a simple average of the error has been 0.92%.
RTD Government Relations did not report pending or recently enacted legislation that would
have a direct impact on RTD sales and use tax collection as of September 17, 2024.

Medium-Term Outlook
•

•

Modeling three economic scenarios helps to accommodate the broad uncertainty
surrounding the U.S. economy. These scenarios may be taken as plausible bounds on RTD
revenue growth over the medium-term period; the greatest variation in forecasts occurs
during the first three years.
Under the baseline scenario, RTD total tax revenues are projected to grow by 33.9%
between 2023 and 2030, reaching $1.15 billion by the end of the medium-term horizon. The
September 2024 medium-term forecast is modestly higher than the March 2024 forecast.

Short-Term Outlook

1.C.1.b

•

•
•

A more optimistic scenario, under which the national economy experiences faster growth,
yields cumulative revenues 1.5% higher than the baseline scenario over the medium-term
horizon; however, the 2030 total is 1.1% above the baseline forecast.
A second alternative scenario in which the national economy experiences slower growth in
the near term yields a cumulative forecast 4.8% below the baseline scenario.
Climate change is a direct assumption within the Moody’s Analytics scenario. According to
Moody’s, “The baseline forecast includes climate change assumptions that are consistent
with a weighted average of the assumptions underpinning a range of scenarios, including
those from the Network for Greening the Financial System.”

Long-Term Outlook
•

•
•

After average annual revenue growth rates of 4.8% for the decade ending in 2020 (in
current, nominal dollars), revenue projections for the next three decades average 6.1%
(2021–2030), 3.7% (2031–2040), and 2.3% (2041–2050); the 30-year average is 4% (2021–
2050).
The long-term forecast increased from the March 2024 update.
The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates population growth and shifts in the age
distribution of the population as key factors influencing the rate of growth in output,
employment, and sales.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

In an effort to provide consistent and accurate RTD revenue forecasts, a new sales and use tax
forecasting system was commissioned in 2010. The Business Research Division (BRD) of the Leeds
School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder was contracted to develop a model for
projecting RTD revenues over the short term (2024), medium term (2030), and long term (2050).
This model has been regularly updated and fine-tuned to portray best-available revenue forecasts
that are specific to Colorado’s Front Range economy.
The BRD collaborates with the RTD administration to forecast sales and use tax revenues, and to
identify the key drivers that will impact RTD’s tax revenue stream. Since the project’s inception, the
BRD research team has been working closely with the RTD administration to better understand the
existing forecast system, to collect and organize relevant data, and to develop the three sets of
projections.
This report presents the revenue projections at the three forecast horizons, with some discussion of
the economic forces driving these forecasts. The model uses vector autoregression (VAR) techniques
in order to capture a mix of long-term, stable relationships, as well as short-term “deviations” from
these long-term trends. These relationships connect RTD tax revenue components to key
macroeconomic drivers, such as retail sales. The methodology is described in detail in the main body
of this report.
For this update, RTD revenue data was available through June 2024; state retail sales and state
taxable sales were available through May 2024; and District taxable sales were available through
May 2024. Data after these dates represent forecasts. Revenue from medical and retail marijuana
sales are in the RTD receipts. Adjustments to the model were necessary to accommodate the gap
year (July 1, 2017–June 30, 2018) in retail marijuana collections caused by Senate Bill 17-267. As
such, RTD taxable sales in this report are based on RTD sales tax revenues excluding retail marijuana
taxes. Therefore, these data are actual RTD taxable sales excluding marijuana sales. However, the
forecasts reported for RTD sales tax revenues include the forecasts of RTD retail marijuana revenues.
This construction was necessary to produce a series without the discontinuity over the period from
July 2017 through June 2018 to produce reasonable revenue forecasts.
In 2016, revenue from Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses (i.e., ecommerce) became a
significant contributor to RTD’s sales tax revenue. The category was merged with All Other General
Merchandise Stores in 2022. This broader category represented 8.5% of the total sales taxes
collected in 2023.
Given the pandemic recession’s impact on specific sectors of the economy, the BRD began modeling
major components of RTD’s sales taxes (e.g., restaurants, auto sales, ecommerce, grocery, etc.).
Modeling the components of retail sales taxes produces forecasts that accommodate the volatility in
the subcomponents.
The methodology and model descriptions may be found in Appendix A.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Forecasts: Short Term, Medium Term and Long Term

Summary: Following the Great Recession, RTD recorded 10 consecutive years of sales and use tax
growth averaging 5.9% (2010-2019). The pandemic-induced recession caused RTD sales and use tax
revenue to decline 4.1% in 2020, recording year-over-year losses for nine months in 2020. RTD posted
growth of 19.6% in 2021 and 13% in 2022, but revenue growth slowed sharply in 2023 to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to remain modest in 2024 with growth of 1%, before accelerating to 4.2% in
2025.
All equations are estimated using monthly data to produce monthly forecasts that are aggregated
into quarterly or yearly data. Historical data for Colorado and national economic variables were
retrieved in September 2024, with much of the data current through Q2 2024. RTD revenue data
were provided through June 2024, and state retail sales and taxable sales data were current through
May 2024. All reported data after these dates are forecasts.
The short-term forecast relies on the Baseline Scenario from Moody’s Analytics. These national
macroeconomic indicators drive the forecasts of the Colorado economy.
Colorado Economy Forecasts
As background to the revenue forecasts, data on Colorado economic indicators are presented in
Table 1. Key indicators of Colorado economic activity show an economy that continues to grow. The
unemployment rate signaled a continued tight labor market in 2022 and 2023, averaging 3.1% and
3.2%, respectively. The rate is projected to increase in 2024 to 3.9%, and in 2025 to 4.6%. Personal
income growth surged during the pandemic recession due to fiscal stimulus, and growth continued
in 2022 (6.2%) and 2023 (4.5%) as components of income reached record levels (e.g., wage and
salary income, proprietor income). Nominal and real (inflation-adjusted) income growth is projected
in the short-term. The Denver-Aurora-Lakewood consumer price index grew at a faster pace than
the nation for most of the past decade. Consumer price growth peaked in 2022, slowed to 5.2% in
2023, and is projected to gravitate lower in 2024 and 2025, sustaining price growth between 2% and
3%.

The Short-Term Use Tax Revenue Forecast
In this model, use tax revenues are directly related to Colorado use tax collections reflecting the
broader geographical base for the use tax. Households and businesses residing within the district,
but those purchasing taxable goods outside the district, are required to pay a use tax on these
purchases at the same rate as the sales tax. Illustrating the volatility, use tax revenues fell 1.1% in
2015, but increased 7.5% in 2016, 4.6% in 2017, and 25.7% in 2018 before falling 16% in 2019 and
20.4% in 2020. Use taxes rebounded in 2021 and 2022, increasing 17% and 9.7%, but fell 5.8% in
2023. The forecast calls for a modest decline in 2024 (2.3%) and strong growth in 2025 (17%). The
volatility of use taxes is apparent in both annual and quarterly data.

employment, and employee earnings.

2021 and 13.7% in 2022. District taxable retail sales slowed rapidly in 2023 to 1% and are projected
to remain subdued in 2024 (1.4%). Sales tax revenues change in stride, falling 2.6% in 2020;
rebounding 19.8% in 2021 and 13.2% in 2022; and slowing to 0.8% in 2023. Revenue is projected to
increase 1.2% in 2024 and 3.4% in 2025. Note that the model uses RTD sales tax revenue (less
marijuana revenue) to impute taxable retail sales in the seven-county RTD district because retail
marijuana is no longer assessed at the 2.9% retail sales tax rate for the state. However, retail
marijuana is taxed 1% for the special districts, leading to a difference in taxable sales and sales taxes.

Upper- and Lower-Bound Estimates for Baseline Forecast
The previous tables present only medium-level forecasts, which should be interpreted as the mean
values within a range of probable outcomes. All forecasting exercises involve elements of
uncertainty, although information about possible forecast errors is seldom presented. Uncertainty
arises from the errors in equation specification and estimation, and from the forecasts of the
national variables that drive the state variables. Although information on the latter source of
uncertainty is not available, the probabilistic high and low forecast bounds that incorporate possible
errors in fitting the equations are presented. The values of the high and low forecast bounds are
computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a 0.67 probability exists that the interval
between low and high forecast values will contain the actual value of the variable being predicted.
The following table displays the 67% confidence bounds on total RTD revenues through 2025. The
wide 67% confidence interval reflects uncertainty. The possible range is as low as $843 million and as
high as $890 million for 2024. The 2024 lower and upper bounds range -2.8% to +2.6% relative to the
medium forecast. The confidence bound widens in 2025 with greater uncertainty. The 2025 upperand lower-bound estimates are -7.7% and +7.3% different than the medium baseline forecast,
showing greater uncertainty one year out. This shows that it is not impossible or unrealistic that
revenue could grow stronger over the next year relative to the medium forecast, as well as the
exposure to the downside risk posed by economic threats.

Medium-Term Forecasts
Summary: The BRD short-term forecasting model is extended to produce forecasts over the time
horizon through 2030. Using different assumptions about the future course of the national economy,
three alternative projections are derived from the same equation specifications. Under the baseline
scenario, which leverages the average of two scenarios from Moody’s Analytics (Baseline and S2),
RTD total tax revenues are projected to grow by 33.9% from the end of 2023 to 2030.
Two alternative scenarios produce variations in the short-term revenue forecast (1-3 years), but
growth rates generally converge in the medium term (7 years). An alternative scenario in which the
national economy experiences a stronger short-term growth pattern yields a 35.3% increase from
2023-2030. Under stronger economic conditions, this scenario out-produces the baseline scenario

through 2025, then converges. In the second alternative, in which the economy grows more slowly in
the short run, there is a 30.9% increase between 2023 and 2030, with slower growth recorded
through 2026. The differences in the cumulative revenue from 2023 to 2030 illustrate the impact of
slower and faster growth in the short run. The optimistic scenario produces cumulative (2023-2030)
revenue $105 million above the baseline scenario, and the pessimistic scenario produces cumulative
revenue $335 million below the baseline scenario. These alternative scenarios allow for a reasonable
degree of uncertainty about possible outcomes for the U.S. economy and may be taken as plausible
bounds on RTD revenue growth over the medium-term period.
The BRD short-term forecasting model is adapted to produce forecasts over the medium-term
horizon through 2030. This time frame has been chosen to conform to the RTD investment planning
horizon for FasTracks. The specifications of the equations for these medium-term forecasts are the
same as for the short-term model, and these are also estimated with monthly data.
Over any medium-term period, the U.S. economy can be subjected to shocks producing outcomes
that are difficult to anticipate. One reasonable way to present forecasts that incorporate the
uncertainty about future policy or unpredictable economic shocks is to develop results for
alternative scenarios. In addition to a baseline case, two alternative outcomes are presented: one
allowing for stronger growth than the selected baseline and the other assuming generally slower
economic growth. As an alternative method of incorporating uncertainty into the forecast, statisticsbased confidence bounds for the baseline scenario are also generated, producing high- and lowforecast bounds based on 67% confidence intervals.
Baseline Sales and Use Tax Revenue Forecasts
The RTD baseline scenario was constructed using a blend of Moody’s “Baseline Forecast” and
Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 2 – Downside – 75th Percentile.” Moody’s Baseline Forecast
represents their baseline estimate for the U.S. economy, constructed with a 50% probability that the
economy will perform better and a 50% probability that it will underperform; while the Moody’s S2
is constructed with a 75% probability that the economy performs better and a 25% probability that it
performs worse.
The Moody’s Baseline assumes that the economy continues to operate at full employment in the
short-term. The Fed is expected to decrease interest rates two times in 2024. Inflation is expected to
approach the target range in 2025. The Moody’s S2 presents more caution, with elevated interest
rates cutting into consumption, greater geo-political crises, weaker consumer confidence, and a brief
recession. The macroeconomic data from these two scenarios were averaged to create the RTD
macroeconomic baseline forecast.
Climate change is embedded in the Moody’s scenario. According to Moody’s, “The baseline forecast
includes climate change assumptions that are consistent with a weighted average of the
assumptions underpinning a range of scenarios, including those from the Network for Greening the
Financial System.”
Real GDP is expected to grow 2.5% in 2024 and 1% in 2025. Inflation rose 8% in 2022 and 4.1% in
2023. The CPI is projected to increase 3% in 2024 and 2.3% in 2025. Employment growth is projected
to slow to 1.4% in 2024 and decrease 0.4% in 2025 in this blended scenario.

Colorado retail sales grew 4.9% in 2020, despite the recession, and grew 17% in 2021. Growth
remained strong in 2022 (9.6%) but slowed sharply in 2023 (1.3%). Accelerating growth is projected
for 2024 (1.8%) and 2025 (1.9%); the simple average of 3.6% is projected for the medium-term
forecast horizon. In the medium-term forecast, state retail sales growth outperforms the nation
many years of the forecast period.
Colorado personal income growth is projected to increase 5.1% in 2024. The annual average
unemployment rate in 2024 increases to 3.9% for the year, and total employment grows 1.5%. The
employment rebound surpassed the prior peak in early 2022. With rebounding employment and
wages, elevated wealth and savings, as well as elevated inflation, nominal retail sales continue to
advance.

RTD use tax revenue fell 16% in 2019 and 20.4% in 2020 but rebounded 17% in 2021 and 9.7% in
2022. Use taxes decreased in 2023 by 5.8%, illustrating the volatility of this series. A modest
decrease is projected in 2024 (2.3%), followed by 17% growth in 2025. Simple average growth of
5.4% is projected over the medium-term forecast horizon through 2030. With 90% of RTD tax
revenues coming from sales taxes, the yearly changes in total revenues closely track those for sales
tax revenues.

As an alternative approach to incorporating economic uncertainty into the forecasts, the next
section describes two scenarios that examine the implications of potentially divergent shocks to the
national economy—one positive and one negative—for district taxable sales and RTD tax revenues.

Optimistic Scenario
The RTD Optimistic Scenario was constructed using Moody’s “Baseline Forecast”. There is a 50%
probability that the economy will perform better and a 50% probability that it will underperform.
While the U.S. labor market is cooling, in this scenario, considerable unemployment increase is
unlikely with jobless rates expected to be at 4.2% by year’s end. Monetary policy predictions are
unchanged, with two 25 basis point cuts expected in September and December, justified by 2.6%
inflation prediction for Q3 2024, down from 2.9% in the previous outlook.1
Real GDP grows 2.6% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025. The unemployment rate increases to an average of
4.1% in 2024 and 2025. Retail sales are projected to decelerate in 2024 and accelerate in 2025 in this
scenario.

In this baseline scenario, the mean forecast in the BRD model calls for a 33.9% increase in total RTD
revenues from 2023 to 2030. Allowing for uncertainty in the model estimation and equation errors,
67% confidence bounds can be estimated. These interval forecasts show a lower-bound increase of
14.9% in RTD revenues for the 2023−2030 forecast period and a 52.9% increase in the high-range
forecast.

than the baseline projections early in the forecast. Total revenues grow by 35.3% between 2023 and
2030. Cumulative revenues from 2023-2030 are 1.5%, or $104.8 million above the baseline scenario.

Pessimistic Scenario
Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 3 – Downside” is constructed with a 90% probability that the U.S.
economy will perform better and a 10% probability that it will underperform. This scenario assumes
that bank failures lead to reduced consumer confidence and tighter lending standards, and that the
risk of government shutdown rises. The global economy underperforms due to elevated tensions
between China and Taiwan, the persistence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the Israel-Hamas
war igniting a broader war, leading to supply chain issues.
The combination of these presumptions leads the U.S. economy into recession in Q4 2024, which
lasts for three quarters. The weakened economy leads to a rise in the unemployment rate, not
returning to full employment until Q3 2029. Real GDP is -1.5% in 2025 and begins its rebound in
2026.

In this pessimistic scenario, total RTD tax revenues reach $1.1 billion in 2030, which is 2.2% below
the medium forecast under the baseline scenario. This scenario yields growth rates lower than the
baseline scenario from 2024-2026 (negative revenue growth through 2025), then faster growth rates
that exceed the baseline projections through 2030. Total revenues grow by 30.9% between 2023 and
2030. Cumulative revenues from 2023-2030 are 4.8% below, or $335 million lower than, the baseline
scenario.

Summary across the Three Scenarios
In the baseline scenario, RTD revenue grows 33.9% to $1.15 billion in the medium term (through
2030). The pessimistic scenario presents slower growth early in the forecast horizon, followed by
faster growth, growing to $1.12 billion by 2030, netting 30.9% growth over the period. The
optimistic scenario records growth that results in an increase of 35.3% over the period, to $1.16
billion, outperforming growth early in the forecast horizon.

The timing of future revenue changes differs across the three scenarios. This difference reveals how
revenues may shift, but they eventually end up relatively close to each other. The difference in total
RTD revenues between the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios is 3.4% in 2030, but the cumulative

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Long-Term Forecasts

Synopsis: Coming off a lower base for 2020 but a much stronger 2021 and 2022, the September 2024
long-term forecast reflects moderate growth in the first 10 years of the forecast horizon, which slows
in the final decade. Over the entire 30-year period, RTD’s total tax revenues in nominal (current
dollar) terms are projected to grow by 4.0% per year on average, while the real (inflation adjusted)
growth rate is 1.3%.
This forecast is for three decades: 2021–2030, 2031–2040, and 2041–2050.
National Economic and Demographic Trends
Growth in real output (GDP) is positively related to the proportion of the population that is upper
middle age (30–49 and 50–64) as this group contributes highly productive workers to the labor force
due to their experience and training. Although population shares change slowly, over the period
2010–2030 the proportion of the population in this productive age group is projected to decline
from 46.2% in 2010 to 43.7% in 2030, contributing to a slowing rate of growth in real output
between now and 2030. The prime population proportion then increases to 45.1% by 2050.
However, total population growth rates slow throughout the 30-year forecast period, reducing real
output growth rates with each advancing decade.
Figure 3

In addition to a slowing of total U.S. population growth over the next three decades, the differing
growth rates of key age groups will have negative effects on economic growth. Growth rates of the
most productive age group (30–64), as well as the total population, will be slower during the coming
decades compared with the previous 10-year period (Table 22), producing some slowing in the rate
of growth in output. Across the three decades of the forecast period, growth in real GDP slows
considerably during the final decade compared with the periods from 2021–2030 and from 2031–
2040. (See the BRD forecast in Table 23; the Moody’s projections are presented only for comparison

The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates age shares of the population as a key factor
influencing the rate of growth in real output and in state and district sales that determine RTD sales

with the BRD forecasts and do not play a role in the long-term BRD projections of any real variables
after 2030.) Growth in the current decade was distorted by the negative impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the economy, and the strong growth that should follow in the recovery (although from
a markedly lower 2020 base). The demographic drag dampens growth in the final two decades of the
forecast horizon, partially offsetting the positive influences of increases in productivity and human
and physical capital that account for the long-run trend in GDP growth. During the final 10 years, the
share of the productive age group stabilizes, but the total population growth rate continues to
decline. The net effect of these demographic changes is a further decline in the real GDP growth rate
into the final decade of the forecast.

The BRD’s projected rates of growth in real GDP are below the Moody’s growth during the next two
decades. Over the 30-year forecast period, the BRD model projects 1.8% average growth and the
Moody’s model projects 2.2% average growth. The BRD forecast of retail sales growth is below
Moody’s for the forecast horizon.
Growth in U.S. retail sales is driven first by growth in output, which is then moderated by
demographic forces. The BRD forecasts show sluggish growth in retail sales during the last two
decades of the forecast (Tables 23 and 24 report rates of growth in real, inflation-adjusted terms).
Both Moody’s and BRD forecast modest growth rates in each of the three forward-looking decades.
Notably, retail sales grow at a slower pace than GDP.

Colorado and District Retail Sales, Taxable Sales, and RTD Sales and Use Tax Revenues

Colorado retail sales growth over the next three decades is slightly lower than for the nation.
Colorado taxable sales and RTD taxable sales also tend to outperform national retail sales growth,
primarily during the 2020s and 2030s. During the final decade, Colorado retail trade growth rate
underperforms the U.S. rate of growth. The negative growth rate for RTD taxable sales during the
final decade reflects the persistent slowdown in total population growth in Colorado, and especially
in the district.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the economy early in the current decade, growth
rebounded for retail sales and taxable sales at the state and district levels. Over the long term, the
national economic environment is reflected in the Colorado forecast. The combined influence of
national economic forces and changing demographics leaves the state and the district with quite low
rates of growth in sales and taxable sales during the final decade of the forecast as shown in the

Future RTD sales tax revenues are forecasted by multiplying the effective rate of taxation by the
district taxable sales forecasts. Assuming no further changes in the RTD effective tax rate beyond
those implied by the reinstatement of the vendor allowance, the rates of growth in RTD sales tax
revenues for 2016 and beyond are identical to those of district taxable sales. Since the use tax base
is not directly observable, it is still necessary to estimate an equation to forecast RTD use tax
revenues. In this equation, RTD use tax revenues are driven by Colorado use tax revenues and
indirectly by the value of single family residential building permits. Revenue forecasts in real and
nominal terms over the next three decades are summarized in the following tables and charts and in

Looking at nominal growth rates in RTD taxable sales shown in Table 25, the decade from 2021-2030
and the following decade are expected to produce growth of 6.2% and 3.7%, respectively. The
pattern of growth rates in Colorado taxable sales and RTD taxable sales are both consistent with that
of retail sales growth, with average growth rates for the last decade of the forecast (2.3% for RTD)
being the weakest for all three sales variables. These rates of growth for nominal sales appear in the

Forecast Evaluation
Actual RTD sales and use tax data are now available through June 2024, allowing for error evaluation
through the second quarter of 2024. For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have been
above the actual revenue 79 times and below the actual revenue 94 times, and a simple average of
the error has been -0.92%, with a 4.4% standard deviation (including the rapid revenue swings
during and following the pandemic recession). The March 2024 forecast for Q1 and Q2 2024 were
high by 1.2% and 2.3%, respectively, illustrating the slowdown in Colorado ahead of the national
retail environment. The 2024 forecast was revised down in September 2024, while the medium-term
forecast was modestly revised up. The average 30-year forecast growth rate in nominal dollars
ending in 2050 was revised up from the September forecast.

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Three models have been developed and estimated for forecasting RTD sales and use tax revenues at
the short term (2024-2025), medium term (2030), and long term (2050). All three models consist of
dynamic equations that link RTD district retail sales and sales and use tax revenues to underlying
national and state economic indicators. Forecasts of the national indicators that are needed to drive
the state and district forecasts come from Moody’s Analytics. Population projections that enter the
equations of the long-term model come from Moody’s Analytics and the Colorado Demography
Office. Colorado economy forecasts are derived from updated specifications of the Colorado
Economy Model.

Key Econometric Concepts
The equations of the RTD forecast model rely on modern techniques of econometric time series
analysis. Each equation specifies a dynamic relationship between two or more variables, capturing
both a long-run equilibrium relation and short-run dynamic adjustments toward this equilibrium.
Such equations are called error correction models (ECMs) and are a type of vector autoregression
(VAR) model. Following time series analysis traditions, these equations may embody complex
dynamic behavior that is based on rigorous examination of historical patterns in the data. Unlike
univariate (ARIMA) methods, which are sophisticated representations of trends and cycles, VAR
models include explanatory variables in each equation to allow persistent departures from trends
and possible turning points.
In the error correction model, a long-run equilibrium relation is joined with a short-run dynamic
adjustment mechanism. The long-run relation is called the cointegrating equation, which captures
the common trends in the variables of interest. For example, district taxable sales and state retail
sales are expected to move together as a result of common underlying economic processes; they are
therefore referred to as “cointegrated” variables. Naturally, one will observe short-run departures
from this common pattern, but with a tendency for one variable to adjust back toward the
equilibrium relation. For example, the district economy may lag behind changes in the Colorado
economy, but departures from the common trends governing these two variables will vanish within
several months. These dynamic adjustments back toward the equilibrium relation are captured by
the ECM.
This framework is illustrated with a simplified version of the relation between district taxable sales
(TXBLSALES_RTD) and retail sales of Colorado (TRDR_TTL).
DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD) = - 0.205*LOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.210*LOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) + 0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(-1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)) - 0.03745*@SEAS(1) + 0.040*@SEAS(5) 0.033*@SEAS(7) +4.125
Here DLOG( ) transforms any variable into its rate of change, so that the left-hand side term is
interpreted as the rate of change in RTD taxable sales. Looking at the first two terms on the righthand side, one sees that RTD taxable sales respond negatively to the level of taxable sales in the
previous period and positively to the previous period’s level of Colorado retail trade. These two

Appendix A: Models for the Three Forecast Horizons

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

A more complex adjustment back toward equilibrium is embodied in the following three terms on
the right-hand side of the equation (- 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) +
0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)). Past rates of change in RTD taxable sales and current plus past changes
in Colorado retail trade also impact the rate of adjustment in RTD taxable sales in the current period.
Additional independent variables, such as the price of gasoline (- 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)), can also be included in error correction equations, and this specification also
contains three seasonal dummy variables and a constant term.
This particular specification of lags and differences is the result of experimenting with various
alternatives and selecting the equation that meets standard diagnostic criteria, such as uncorrelated
residuals and statistically significant coefficients. For example, it is natural to allow all 12 months to
enter into the equation as seasonal variables (the @SEAS( ) terms), but only 3 of these were found to
have statistically significant effects. Similar cointegrating equations and ECMs are developed for the
other key variables in the RTD forecast model.
Since the ECM is expressed in rates of change, this is the natural form in which the forecasts of
district taxable sales can be generated. Given historical and forecasted values of all right-hand side
variables, the ECM produces forecasts of district taxable sales based on the forecasted month-tomonth changes.
Econometrics explicitly allows for random errors in the equations and in the estimation of their
coefficients. These sources of error will be reflected in the model’s forecasts, and the resulting
uncertainty can be estimated through simulation methods. This uncertainty is presented in the form
of interval forecasts given by the model’s mean forecast plus and minus one standard deviation of
the forecast error. The upper and lower bounds of these 67% confidence interval forecasts provide
statistically based high and low forecasts for each time period within the forecast horizon.

Comparisons and Linkages between the Three Models
All three models are grounded in the cointegration and ECM methodology, and all three generate
statistically based interval forecasts of RTD sales and use tax revenues. The short-term and mediumterm models are estimated using monthly data and produce forecasts at that same frequency. These
monthly forecasts of sales and use tax revenues are then aggregated to quarterly series for the
short-term forecasts and to annual data for the medium term.
The specifications of individual equations in the short-term and medium-term models are the same,
and therefore, the baseline forecasts over a one-year horizon are identical. Variables and forecasts
in these two models are expressed in nominal values.
In order to forecast district level variables (e.g., RTD taxable sales, use tax revenues), it is necessary
to model and forecast economic variables at the state level. The Colorado Economy Model
previously developed for OSPB provides the framework for predicting state economic variables, such

terms capture the error correction mechanism: if RTD taxable sales are too high relative to the level
of Colorado retail trade, then TXBLSALES_RTD will tend to decline in the following period. In this
situation the relation between RTD taxable sales and Colorado retail sales is out of equilibrium,
requiring future adjustments to restore equilibrium between these two cointegrated variables.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

as Colorado retail trade and Colorado taxable sales. These key Colorado variables are driven by
corresponding national variables and related state series, such as personal income. The linkages
between the economic variables at the national, state, and district level are shown in the following
figure:
Figure 8

The primary drivers from the national economy are personal income, employment, and retail sales,
and these contribute to the determination of Colorado retail sales and, in turn, RTD taxable sales.
Given the effective rate of sales taxation, RTD sales tax revenues are then given by a simple algebraic
identity.
Recognizing that large shocks to the national economy are likely to occur at some time over the
seven-year forecast horizon, the possibility of such shocks is incorporated in the medium-term
forecast by the use of two alternative national economic scenarios from Moody’s Analytics. These
alternative scenarios allow for the possibility of faster economic growth in the near term in one case
and for slower long-term growth in the other. These scenarios also provide alternative bounds that
complement the statistically based lower-bound forecasts from the econometric model.
The long-term model equations are fundamentally different from those of the other models and are
designed to capture gradual structural adjustments in the economy due to changing demographics.
This model relies on population projections from Moody’s Analytics and from the Colorado State
Demography Office to drive the forecasts of all real national economic variables, state and district
retail sales and taxable sales, and RTD sales and use tax revenues. Whereas Moody’s forecasts of
national economic indicators are used to drive the short-term and medium-term Colorado Economy
Model forecasts, BRD researchers have developed equations for key national variables for the longterm forecasts. Only Moody’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) forecast is used for converting forecasts of
real variables into nominal values in the long-term forecasts.
Higher inflation had an impact on the RTD forecast. The real-dollar RTD forecast is constructed as
nominal dollars adjusted to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For most of the previous decade, the
inflation rate has been low – between 0.5% and 2.0% annually. Market disruptions and supply-chain

discord create additional risk of above trend and above target CPI. While price growth improved,
prices were stuck between 3% and 4% for 13 consecutive months before dropping below 3% in July
2024.

A combination of factors has continued to elevate inflation in the economy, some of which are
easing:
•

A disrupted supply chain that is imposing supply shortages and bottlenecks in final consumer
products as well as inputs to production.

•

Excess savings by households remain above pre-pandemic levels, but higher costs of
borrowing, high inflation, and negative real wage growth are causing consumers to spend
down savings and reduce savings rates.

•

Volatile commodity prices. Several staple commodities showed easing prices in 2023,
eventually reflected in consumer prices.

•

Tight labor markets. The economy swung from a very loose labor market during the
pandemic to one of the tightest labor markets in history. As labor markets have tightened,
wages have increased, but not to the extent to keep consumers on par with price increases.
Wage growth is considered to be the largest contributor to inflation. National and state
unemployment rates are lower than pre-pandemic levels, and many businesses face
difficulties finding qualified and willing workers, and this should place continued pressure on
employers to increase wages, especially for low wage workers.

The RTD forecast model currently incorporates annual U.S. inflation that rose to 8% in 2022 and
4.1% in 2023, and a Denver metro area inflation rate of 8% in 2022 and 5.2% in 2023. The BRD team
will continue to monitor the situation and may adjust expected inflation when sufficient evidence
emerges to suggest changing inflation expectations.

National Statistics and Forecasts: National data, such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. GDP figures, track
closely to state indicators. Typically, higher U.S. retail sales indicate higher retail sales in Colorado.
National statistics for GDP and retail sales are published frequently, and several forecasts for these
indicators are available. The Colorado Economy Model that drives the district level variables relies on
these national variables to forecast corresponding state variables.

•

U.S. Retail Sales: Obviously, this indicator tracks closely to Colorado’s retail sales. This
indicator, along with its forecasted levels, is a central part of the Colorado Economy Model
and the RTD district model.

•

The figure below shows the relationship between U.S. retail sales and Colorado retail sales
over the past two decades. The Colorado sales values are not seasonally adjusted (the U.S.
figures are), but the two series are clearly closely related. The data have been standardized
to show the common movement of the two variables. U.S. retail sales change direction at
the same time as Colorado retail trade. It can also be seen that, over time, the overall level
of trade trends diverge slightly for these two series. In 2000 through 2006, U.S. retail sales
were, for the most part, greater than Colorado sales, but from 2009 to 2020 the opposite
was true.
Figure 10

•

National Income: U.S. GDP, personal income, and disposable income serve as common
indicators for the state of the national economy. U.S. GDP plays a key role in the long-term
model. U.S. personal income is a predictor of Colorado personal income, which enters the
equation for Colorado retail trade.

•

Consumer Price Index and Components: In forecasting sales and use tax revenues, it is vital
to distinguish between taxable and nontaxable expenditures and to consider how the
composition of household expenditures changes over time. In the short run, the proportion
of expenditures allocated to taxable items can vary with changes in the relative prices of
goods and services that are tax exempt. Gasoline prices are one example of a CPI
component that fluctuates dramatically, affecting the share of taxable/nontaxable retail
sales. This variable is included in the current specification of some equations in the

Some key national indicators are:

forecasting model. The CPI is also used to convert between nominal and real values of
personal income and retail sales.
Population by Age: In the long-term model, the age distribution of the population plays an
important role in the forecasts of retail sales and taxable sales. For example, the rate of
growth in the prime working-age population of the United States is used in the equation for
national GDP. Population projections come from Moody’s Analytics.

Regional Economic Variables: The equations in the forecasting model are based on basic
relationships between corresponding variables at national, state, and district levels. National data,
such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. personal income, track closely to local indicators. While national
level retail trade sales are a reliable indicator of general trends in Colorado retail sales, the inclusion
of state-specific economic variables, such as Colorado personal income, can improve the explanatory
and forecasting power of the model.
•

Colorado and Denver Metro Personal Income: Total wages are obtained on a quarterly basis
by industry (or aggregated) and by county from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (not seasonally
adjusted). This information is posted online with a six-month time lag in the Quarterly
Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) series from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Because the survey only asks for total wages disbursed for the quarter, and not for the
month, we cannot see an alternative method for obtaining monthly data by county. This
survey solicits information from the employer’s location, not from the employees’ residence,
so some wages leak out of the Denver Metro region. Personal income data for the state of
Colorado are sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on a quarterly basis. (Data sources:
Bureau of Labor Statistics, www.bls.gov; Bureau of Economic Analysis, www.BEA.gov)

•

State and District Populations by Age Group: In the long-term model, retail sales and taxable
sales at state and local levels are affected by the age distribution of the relevant population.
Data on population by age groups come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s U.S. Population
Projections and Population Estimates, and the Colorado State Demography Office in the
Colorado Department of Local Affairs.

•

Colorado and Denver Metro Employment: Employment by industry and metropolitan area is
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Current Employment Statistics (CES) is a survey of
employers and is available monthly, with a one- to two-month lag. These numbers are
revised as the QCEW data become available. If county-level data are necessary, the QCEW
employment data are available, but lag six months.

•

Taxable and Total Retail Sales and Tax Revenue Data: The Colorado Department of Revenue
(DOR) is the primary source for taxable sales, sales tax revenues, and use tax revenues. From
the collection of sales tax revenues each month and the knowledge of the effective rate of
taxation, the department computes the value of taxable sales (revenues divided by the tax
rate). At the state level, this procedure produces data on sales tax revenues and taxable
sales that are entirely consistent. However, the DOR computes taxable sales based on the
tax laws that apply to state sales tax collections, and these laws previously differed in their

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

We apply the same DOR data construction procedure to compute RTD taxable sales. Sales
tax revenues collected by RTD are divided by the RTD effective rate of taxation to produce
RTD taxable sales. In addition to providing consistency between the taxable sales and
revenues data, this procedure allows future changes in RTD tax rates to be incorporated
(e.g., anticipated changes in the vendor allowance).
In recent updates of the RTD revenue forecasts, the BRD team has modeled and forecasted
specific components of sales tax revenues to improve the accuracy of total revenue
forecasts. This disaggregation of sales tax revenues became advisable during the recent
economic turmoil as various components moved in entirely different patterns during the
pandemic and into the recovery. Important examples of components that are now modeled
separately are online commerce sales, which were unusually strong during the pandemic,
and eating and drinking places sales, which dropped dramatically. These several components
of RTD taxable sales are driven by corresponding industry sales at the national and state
levels. The summation of the various components is now reported as total RTD sales tax
revenues.
The BRD Long-Term Forecast Model—Analytical Framework
Most long-term economic forecasting exercises employ a production function framework to project
real output (GDP). With this approach, output is a function of labor supply, capital stock, and
technology. From projections of these three determinants, predicting output is straightforward.
However, forecasting these three inputs is a daunting task that is often handled with arbitrary
assumptions about their long-run growth rates. There is little reason to believe that projections of
the growth rates in the three inputs would produce more reliable forecasts than directly projecting
output.
However, the BRD long-term forecasting model borrows some useful elements from this framework.
Modeling real output growth for the national economy is the starting point of the BRD forecasting
model, and all other variables in the BRD model are also expressed in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.
This puts aside the task of forecasting inflation, which depends on national political issues, Federal
Reserve behavior, and changes in global resource prices. Since inflation rates can be expected to
impact RTD revenues and costs symmetrically, incorporating inflation into the analysis is an
unnecessary complication.
Although the BRD model does not estimate a production function or make assumptions about the
long-run growth in inputs, a production relation implicitly underpins the framework. The growth in a
nation’s labor force, capital stock, and technology is affected by the age distribution of the
population. Substantial theoretical and empirical literature on the “demographic dividend”
establishes the impact that age distribution has on economic growth, working through the three

treatment of RTD tax collections. In 2014, HB 13-1272 effectively changed the RTD base to
be the same as the state tax base.

Sound economic theory and empirical evidence supports the existence of a stable, predictive
relation between output and age structure. Output growth is positively related to the
working-age share of the population, according to the aggregate production relation, and is
negatively related to the dependency ratio, according to life cycle models of saving.
The age structure of the population is predictable with reasonable accuracy, and projections
are provided by the Social Security Administration and published by the Census Bureau.
Underlying demographic processes (fertility rates, mortality rates, immigration) change
slowly over time, allowing accurate age-specific population projections. Furthermore, older
portions of the age distribution of the population can be projected with great accuracy
because for the next 30 years, the population over the age of 30 depends only on mortality
rates and immigration—the former being highly predictable.
In terms of the production function framework, the age distribution can impact output
through each of the three inputs. By affecting the savings rate, age structure influences real
business investment and the growth in capital stock. One form of investment is in R&D,
which contributes to productivity growth. In addition, new physical investment embodies
latest technologies, thereby contributing to productivity growth. The labor force is obviously
directly related to the age structure through the size of the working-age population. Also,
experienced workers tend to be more productive than new entrants to the labor force, so an
older workforce shows higher output per worker.
The ultimate goal is to forecast (taxable) retail sales, not output. Given the equivalence of
output and income, a simple consumption function links retail sales to output or,
equivalently, to gross national income. However, the relation between aggregate
consumption and aggregate income is expected to vary over time with changes in the age
structure of the population. Therefore, the equation for (national) retail sales includes the
population age shares, as well as aggregate income.
By the same reasoning, the age distribution affects the relation between total retail sales
(the model’s key national variable) and taxable sales (the relevant state and district
variables). For example, the consumption pattern of people 65 and older shows a higher
proportion of spending on nontaxable items compared with younger individuals who spend
more on taxable goods as they establish new households.

The BRD model employs this framework to produce long-term forecasts over the period ending
2050. Business cycle fluctuations come into play only during the current decade as the economy
gradually moves toward capacity output. These business cycle fluctuations play a role in the
medium-term forecasts previously developed for RTD, and the forecasts presented here build on
these 2023–2030 forecasts. The short-term and medium-term forecasts presented in the earlier

determinants of real output.2 The use of the age distribution of the population in forecasting longterm economic growth in general, and RTD tax revenues in particular, has several important
advantages:

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

The equations of the long-term BRD model employ the same dynamic error correction/cointegration
framework as the short- and medium-term models. All variables in these equations are expressed in
real terms, and projected real variables from the equations are converted to nominal values using
Moody’s forecasted national CPI. Both real and nominal values are presented in the tables and
charts of this section.
National output growth is determined by population shares as indicated by the previous discussion.
National retail sales growth is driven by output growth, moderated by changes in age shares of the
population. State and district sales and taxable sales are similarly related to national and state sales,
as well as state and district population shares. State and district sales growth rates, in turn,
determine the growth in RTD sales and use tax revenues.
National retail sales and Colorado personal income are key factors driving Colorado retail sales in the
long-term forecasting model. However, differences in population growth rates and age distribution
for the nation, the state, and the district affect the relations between sales at the three geographical
levels. The growth rate of Colorado’s working-age population, for example, affects personal income
growth in the state, which in turn feeds into the determination of Colorado retail sales. Slowing
growth of this prime working-age population therefore indirectly contributes to the declining growth
in Colorado retail sales, Colorado taxable sales, and consequently, RTD taxable sales. On the other
hand, moderate growth in the total population of the state adds to the growth in Colorado taxable
sales, offsetting to some extent the adverse effects of changing population age shares on the other
sales and tax revenue variables.
Population forecasts are sourced from the Office of the Colorado State Demographer and from
Moody’s Analytics. Colorado population forecast revisions by age and by county were released in
late 2023 and showed slower net migration to the state and the district.
Overall, population growth in Colorado and in the district affects the growth in sales and, therefore,
in sales tax revenues. While total U.S. population growth declines steadily over the three decades of
the long-term forecast, the state and the district exhibit somewhat different patterns in expected
growth rates as shown in the following figure. The estimated population growth rate for the district
and for the state peaked in 2015, followed by a decade of rather flat growth rates, and then began a
long period of decline. If birth rates increase, or the state experiences stronger net immigration, the
trend may be altered somewhat.

sections of this report employ nominal (current dollar) values of all variables, while the long-term
analysis is based on real variables. Both real (inflation adjusted) and nominal forecasts of total RTD
revenues are presented in this section of the report to allow comparisons with other forecasts and

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

In addition to variations in the rate of total population growth, the changing population age
structure also affects the growth rates of sales and tax revenues in the long-term projections. For
Colorado and the district, the proportion of those in the prime working-age group and those in the
youngest age group (0 to 29 years of age) are projected to decline throughout most of the forecast
period, while the share of the aging population will grow. These trends will adversely impact total
and taxable sales in the state and the district.

The following two figures further demonstrate changing demographics over time, modeled by the
old-age dependency ratio and the prime working-age ratio. These ratios target more precisely the
changing size of the retired and working populations as they affect income and retail sales.
The old-age dependency ratio increases throughout the forecast horizon, but Colorado and the
district remain below the national ratio.

Conversely, the primary working-age ratio for the district falls through 2030, with some leveling of
this decline between 2030 and 2045 followed by further decline to 2050.

Since budget planning more commonly employs nominal (current dollar) values, the inflationadjusted (real) forecasts are converted to current dollars using Moody’s Analytics annual forecasts of
the national CPI for urban households. This adjustment with the national CPI is consistent with the
conversions to real values used throughout the BRD long-term modeling project. Although local CPI
data are available, these may be less reliable than the national data due to smaller samples in the

Appendix C: A Qualitative Assessment of the Economy

Summary: The U.S. economy continued to post strong growth into 2024. The economy appears
poised to show slower GDP growth as unemployment hits a 2.5 year high. Colorado real GDP
increased 3.3% year-over-year in Q1 2024, and at an annualized rate of 2.3% from Q4 2023 to Q1
2024.
Gross Domestic Product
When determining whether an economy is under a recession, factors considered include real
personal income less transfers, nonfarm payroll employment, employment as measured by the
household survey, real personal consumption expenditures, wholesale-retail sales adjusted for price
changes, and industrial production. The recent pandemic recession was officially marked by the
National Bureau of Economic Research as the shortest U.S. recession (two months) dating back to
the mid-1800s when dating recessions began, and now the economy has remained in expansion for
nearly four years and counting. National real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
(SAAR) of 2.2% in Q1 2023, 2.1% in Q2, 4.9% in Q3, 3.4% in Q4, followed by 1.4% in Q1 2024, and 3%
in Q2. Personal consumption expenditures showed resiliency, increasing 3.8%, 0.8%, 3.1%, 3.3%,
1.5%, and 2.9% respectively, over the same period. Growth was recorded among both goods and
services in Q2 2024. Gross private domestic investment has sustained growth for five consecutive
quarters after dropping 9% in Q1 2023. Government consumption has continued strong growth
through 2024; however, the trade deficit began increasing again (detracting from growth). Real GDP
is expected to increase in 2024 and 2025.
In Q1 2024 (newest available data), Colorado’s real GDP increased at an annualized rate of 2.3%
quarter-over-quarter (ranked 18th) and 3.3% year-over-year (ranked 13th).

This qualitative assessment of the U.S. and Colorado economies is intended to serve as context for
the RTD sales and use tax forecast. In the process of compiling an annual business and economic
outlook for Colorado, the BRD has developed local indicators that can be used to complement the
results from the econometric models.

National consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board, has generally been rising
since hitting a low in July 2022, despite that trend reversing in 2024. In August 2024, the index was
5.4 points lower than in August 2023, and 2.0 points higher than May 2024 (one quarter prior).
Concerns about inflation remain, particularly regarding food and gas prices. Respondents also noted
concern about the labor market situation, depletion of personal savings, and politics. The Mountain
Region index remained above the national index, but it also is generally more volatile than the
national index.

Jobless Claims
National initial jobless claims totaled 230,000 the week of September 7, 2024, similar to the same
period in 2023. National continued claims were up year-over-year. Colorado’s jobless claims have
seen a slight jump in the beginning of 2024 over prior years but have already begun to settle. The
2,531 initial jobless claims filed the week ending August 24, 2024 were up 12.8% year-over-year,
nearly equaling the all-time average. Continued claims in the state also rose year-over-year, up
22.5%, and was 14.8% above the all-time average.

Employment and Wages

Figure 21: United States Employment, Total Jobs

The national unemployment rate increased from 3.8% in August 2023 to 4.2% in August 2024,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate in Colorado increased to 3.9% in
July 2024, tying the state for the 31st-lowest unemployment rate in the nation. The rate increased
from 3.2% in July 2023.
Colorado added 72,300 jobs in 2023—the 6th-best job growth year since 2000. The number of jobs in
Colorado totaled 2.9 million. The state is projected to add another 49,600 jobs in 2024, a slower
absolute number and rate of change, according to the Colorado Business Economic Outlook. Wages
in Colorado’s private sector grew 5.7% year-over-year in 2023 and 3.6% year-over-year in Q1 2024.

U.S. job growth averaged 606,000 per month in 2001 and 399,000 in 2022 as the economy recouped
jobs lost from the pandemic recession, making it back to peak employment in 2022. The U.S.
continued to add jobs in 2023, adding an average of 251,000 jobs per month, which segued into
slower growth to start 2024—an average of 184,000 jobs were added per month through August
2024.

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

By industry in Colorado, the most jobs added in 2024 through July are in Government, Education and
Health Services, and Professional and Business Services. By rate of change, the fastest pace of
growth is observed in Government, Education and Health, and Financial Activities.

There have also been continued struggles to fill record numbers of job openings. While job openings
have generally decreased over the past year, they remain high, totaling nearly 7.7 million openings
in July 2024, a year-over-year decrease of 12.9%. The number of quits, while decreasing 9.3% yearover-year, also remains at high with nearly 3.3 million in July 2024. Colorado’s job openings rate of
6.1% ranked the state 4th in July 2024. The state reportedly had 196,000 job openings and 126,270
unemployed individuals in July, resulting in a ratio of 1.6 job openings per unemployed person in the
state.

Real Estate
Residential real estate prices in Colorado continued to grow in Q2 2024. The most recent data from
the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) All Transactions Index show that home prices in
Colorado increased 3.6% year-over-year and 0.8% quarter-over-quarter in Q2 2024. Colorado’s MSAs
show mostly decreasing year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter price changes.

Inflation
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) – All Items increased
2.5% in August 2024 year-over-year. Core inflation, which includes all items less food and energy,
increased 3.2% year-over-year. Denver-Aurora-Lakewood recorded slower price growth (1.9% all
items, 2.4% core) in July 2024 (most current) as the region recorded notable price decrease in
apparel.

and use tax collections increased 2.8% in 2023. Comparing taxable retail sales in July 2024 to the
same period in 2023, state taxable sales increased 1.9%.

E-Commerce
E-commerce sales continue to expand at a relatively rapid rate. As technology advances through
tablets and mobile devices, consumers have greater ability to make digital purchases and access the
nation’s e-commerce landscape. While the COVID-19 pandemic caused a short-term spike in ecommerce activity, there has been a notable long-term adoption of the sales channel that pre-dates
the pandemic. E-commerce now represents about $1 in every $6 of retail activity. The growth rate
slowed to under 10% for 9 of the last 10 quarters.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

In response to a request by RTD staff, the BRD research team added a fourth scenario modeling the
impact of a prolonged recession. The team leveraged a U.S. macroeconomic scenario titled, “S4:
Alternative Scenario 4 – Downside – 96% Percentile”, which is constructed with a 96% probability
that the economy will outperform this projection and a 4% probability that the economy will
underperform. In this scenario, the economy enters a recession in the fourth quarter of 2024.
Economic growth is slowed by tight financial conditions, the risk of a government shutdown,
elevated interest rates, and heightened geopolitical tensions.
Real GDP grows 2.2% in 2024 but falls 2.8% in 2025 and 0.4% in 2026 before rebounding in 2027; the
medium-term average is 1.4%. The unemployment rate increases to an average of 4.6% in 2024 and
8.2% in 2025. Retail sales turn negative in 2025 before returning to moderate growth.
In this recession scenario, RTD revenue falls in 2024 (0.6%) and 2025 (4.9%) before returning to
growth. After 2025, growth ranges between 0.9% and 8.1% in the medium-term horizon.

2025 Investment Policy

October 8, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
October 22, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2025 Investment Policy
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Each year staff presents the proposed Investment Policy for the upcoming fiscal year in accordance with
Fiscal Policy requirements. The Investment Policy may be amended by the Board at any time.
The purpose of the Investment Policy is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment of RTD’s operating funds, debt proceeds and reserve funds.
The primary objectives of RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2)
sufficient liquidity to meet known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield to achieve a market rate of
return. Although RTD must legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised
Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1), this Investment Policy is more conservative in order to achieve the
Strategic Priority of Financial Success.
The most recent modification to the Investment Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in
October 2023 for the 2024 fiscal year.
DISCUSSION
Staff has identified minor grammatical changes to the Investment Policy as shown in the attached. This
2025 Investment Policy has also been reviewed by legal counsel as well as RTD’s municipal advisor to
ensure adherence to state statutes and efficient investment management. No other changes have been
identified at this time.
Staff is performing analyses regarding the efficacy of the application of the current state statutory
requirements regarding allowable investments for governmental agencies to determine if there are
opportunities that could provide material improvements to RTD’s ability to garner improved investment
returns while maintaining safety of principal.

Packet Pg. 77

1.D.1

In addition, staff is considering alternatives regarding the accounting for investment income associated
with federal funds that would effectively segregate them from other investment income for purposes of
mitigating impacts from TABOR revenue growth limitations in 2025.
As this research is finalized, staff will return to the Board with any recommended changes to the Fisal
Policy and/or Investment Policy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this action item.

2025 INVESTMENT POLICY

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District.
2. SCOPE
This investment policy applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of RTD
(collectively, the Portfolio).
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through Board-approved bond resolutions or indentures
of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated for
investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Subject: 2025 Investment Policy
Page 2

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value
of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
•

Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD, thereby
reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open market prior
to maturity

The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification and
purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard to
insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of
the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual investments
as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses are
inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market
price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will
hereinafter be referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation
by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees

and investment officials shall disclose to the GM/CEO any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any material
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.

Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(NRSROs) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating category
(AA) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2 and
Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is downgraded below
the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio, the CFO will review
the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.

indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 100%

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment precludes
pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices. However,
fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where securities
may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to reinvest
proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,
the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When

No more than 50% of the Portfolio may be invested in repurchase agreements and no more
than 10% may be invested with a single counterparty. The maximum maturity for a
repurchase agreement shall be limited to 90 days.

1.D.1.a

Subject: 2025 Investment Policy
Page 8

purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in
the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.
6.3 Portfolio Duration

6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized
to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from
those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary
dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody
With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.

Packet Pg. 86

Attachment: RTD 2025 Investment Policy (5003 : 2025 Investment Policy)

The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.

1.D.1.a

Subject: 2025 Investment Policy
Page 9

All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Staff will include an annual listing of investments held and investment returns within the Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report.
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the average maturity of the investment
portfolio.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return, commensurate
with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the composition of the
Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various indices may be used to
monitor investment performance.
The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash equivalents)
is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the
designated performance benchmark is the ICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns which
may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this Policy
“bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of participation or
other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy, denoting
any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

20254 INVESTMENT POLICY

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of RTD
(collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through Board-approved bond resolutions or indentures
of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated for
investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Subject: 20254 Investment Policy
Page 2

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value
of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD, thereby
reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open market prior
to maturity

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification and
purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard to
insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of
the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual investments
as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses are
inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will
hereinafter be referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation
by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment

price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating
category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and
Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is
downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio,
the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to
sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.

indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 100%

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment precludes
pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices. However,
fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where securities
may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to reinvest
proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,

rtd-denver.com

Packet Pg. 97

Attachment: RTD 2025 Investment Policy - Red Line (5003 : 2025 Investment Policy)

No more than 50% of the Portfolio may be invested in repurchase agreements and no more
than 10% may be invested with a single counterparty. The maximum maturity for a
repurchase agreement shall be limited to 90 days.

1.D.1.b

Subject: 20254 Investment Policy
Page 8

the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in
the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.

The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized
to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from
those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary
dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody
With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.

6.3 Portfolio Duration

Subject: 20254 Investment Policy
Page 9

7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Staff will include an annual listing of investments held and investment returns within the Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report.
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the average maturity of the investment
portfolio.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return, commensurate
with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the composition of the
Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various indices may be used to
monitor investment performance.
The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash equivalents)
is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the
designated performance benchmark is the ICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns which
may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this Policy
“bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of participation or
other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy, denoting
any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Fiscal Policy

October 8, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
October 22, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2025 Fiscal Policy.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Fiscal Policy establishes the financial control framework and governance of the Agency financial
resources for that year. Staff presents the proposed Fiscal Policy annually for the Board’s consideration
for the upcoming fiscal year. Once approved by the Board of Directors, it may be amended by the Board
at any time.
The most recent modification to the Fiscal Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in October
2023 for the 2024 fiscal year. The Fiscal Policy determines the parameters within which the Proposed
Annual Budget is developed as well as parameters within which financial activities are performed.
Proposed changes to the Fiscal Policy are recommended to the Board to address current and emerging
issues including those that result from regulatory, compliance, or legislative changes, audit
recommendations, as well as Board-directed changes, or changes addressing fiscal sustainability, best
practices or other requisite sources.
Staff presented a 2025 Fiscal Policy discussion item to the Finance and Planning Committee on May 14,
2024, and again on July 23, 2024, which provided initial proposed modifications for Board
consideration.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this Recommended Action is to approve the recommended modifications to the Fiscal
Policy for 2025.
Recognizing that the Board approved a TABOR ballot initiative on June 25, 2024, for the November 5,
2024, General Election seeking voter approval for continuation of the existing TABOR exemption,
modifications to the 2025 Fiscal Policy contemplate that TABOR revenue growth limitations will be in
effect beginning in 2025. Should voters approve the TABOR ballot initiative on November 5, 2024, staff
will subsequently propose additional 2025 Fiscal Policy modifications as a result.

Packet Pg. 103

1.D.2

Preliminary recommendations for modifications to the Fiscal Policy are included in the attached
presentation and red-line draft 2025 Fiscal Policy document. These recommendations include the
following:
•

•

•

•

Revenue Policies
o Pursuit of revenue diversification opportunities to mitigate financial risk
o Ensuring accounting treatment is applied in the most effective manner for TABOR
mitigation

Fund Balance Policies
o Enhancing the policy documentation regarding the FasTracks Internal Savings Account
(FISA)

appropriation
Budget and Financial Forecast Policies
o Additional minimum budget report contents to include comparative cash flows and

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Financial impacts associated with this item have been included in the 2025-2029 Five-year Financial
Forecast (FYFF) approved by the Board during the monthly Board meeting held on September 23, 2024,
and will be included in the 2025 Proposed Budget, which will be presented to the Finance and Planning
Committee on October 8, 2024, as a discussion item and presented on November 12, 2024, as a
recommended action.

Through the efforts of RTD’s Finance team, agency
executives, senior managers, and subject-matter experts,
these four initiatives are reflected throughout this budget
and interwoven into work plans across all departments
and divisions. By focusing on these important factors,
RTD will continue to make meaningful progress toward its
established success outcomes. RTD also continues to

In January, RTD implemented a simpler, more
equitable, and more affordable fare structure.
Customers now pay less for fares in all categories,
including eligible discounts.

On behalf of the agency, I truly appreciate the
opportunity to lead this team of dedicated individuals as
we strive to be the trusted leader in mobility, delivering
excellence and value to our customers and community.

Departments
and Divisions

In 2024, RTD celebrated many successes and first-time
accomplishments for the agency. While the list of
achievements is long, I would be remiss if I did not
specifically highlight a few that have made the lives of
RTD’s employees and customers better.

I also extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to the
many employees who directly contributed to the
preparation of RTD’s FY 2025 Budget. I specifically want
to acknowledge Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer;
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget; Heidi Wagner,
Senior Manager, Finance; the agency’s Budget Analysts;
Stuart Summers, Chief Communications and Engagement
Officer, for compiling this document; and members of
RTD’s Leadership Team. And lastly, I would be remiss not
to thank the customers, communities, stakeholders, and
partners who engage with RTD.

Executive
Summary

The Fiscal Year 2025 Budget represents the agency’s
financial plan for the forthcoming year. This budget aligns
with the agency’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, which
outlines an ongoing commitment to the Strategic Priorities
of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success. With this commitment
also comes a continued emphasis on the strategic
initiatives of Back to Basics, People Power, Welcoming
Transit Environment, and the newly introduced initiative
of Customer and Community Connections.

Between May and August, RTD completed the first
phase of its Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project.
The project reconstructed 30-year-old rail
infrastructure along the agency’s original light rail
alignment. Crews completed weeks ahead of schedule,
and subsequent phases of the project are slated for
2025.
• In September, RTD’s one-year Zero Fare for Youth
pilot program became permanent for customers 19
and under. The Colorado legislature appropriated
funding through December 2025 to support the zerofare youth program.
• Over the last year, RTD made significant progress on
its comprehensive Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan.
The plan is assessing the agency’s operations to
determine a path forward for lowering emissions. The
plan is on track to be completed by mid-December
2024.

good repair, enhanced employee recruitment and
retention initiatives, and made significant progress in

RTD’s People Power initiative experienced improved
hiring and retention, particularly with front-line staff and
expansion of the Transit Police division. Through June
2024, RTD’s active employee counts rose to 3,457 vs.
2,943 in June 2023 with increases primarily in job
categories, such as bus and rail operators, that have
historically been chronically understaffed. The June 2024
vacancy rate for budgeted positions stood at 15%.
These staffing improvements have resulted from
expanded ongoing hiring and recruitment activities as
well as certain retention initiatives such as enhanced
training, onboarding and mentorship programs and
certain total rewards improvements.

RTD continues to expand its Transit Police force in
support of a welcoming transit environment while also
implementing certain measures in support of crime
prevention through environmental design (CPTED).
Expansion of the Transit Police function has provided
additional security assurances to customers and
operators while also devoting certain resources towards
addressing societal issues such as homeless outreach
personnel. This initiative will continue into future periods
and is being coordinated with several local jurisdictions
throughout the RTD boundaries.

Executive
Summary

During 2024, RTD has continued to implement its System
Optimization Plan (SOP), which is the agency’s branded
Comprehensive Operational Analysis (COA), after
emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic and transitioning
to focusing on operations and maintenance activities,
having completed several multi-year FasTracks transit
expansion projects.

RTD has also implemented several improvements during
2024 related to back to basics such as the COA,
improved financial planning activities and a focus on
maintaining a state of good repair for the Agency’s $9.3
billion of assets. During 2024, RTD began a year’s long
infrastructure reconstruction and repair effort to maintain
several light rail elements that have reached 30 years of
revenue service. These ongoing efforts align with RTD’s
Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan with a focus on
providing continual transit services while maintaining
taxpayer’s investments.

Summary

In addition, RTD continues to meet the Board approved
fiscal policy requirements for maintenance of adequate
reserves and debt coverage ratios. The agency’s senior
bond credit ratings were also raised by S&P Global during
2024 to the highest rating of AAA. RTD continues to
cash-fund all purchases without the need to borrow
funding and continues to reduce its debt portfolio
exposure through refinancings and efficient use of
financial resources.

A Revenue Diversification Working Group was convened
in early 2024 that sought to reduce RTD’s financial
exposure to concentrated revenue funding sources and
reduce financial risk. Board approved recommendations
from this Working Group included enhancements to
RTD’s recommended 2025 Fiscal Policy as well as a
November 2024 ballot initiative seeking voter approval to
continue exemption from the TABOR revenue growth
limitations set to begin in 2024.

Enhanced Internal Communications
RTD implemented many new tactics in 2024 designed to break down silos,
increase the flow of information, and ensure all employees are well informed. In
January, the agency implemented an all-digital version of Inside Connections, the
employee weekly newsletter. The interactive, virtual format has increased access
to real-time updates and garnered greater engagement. RTD also overhauled its
bi-monthly all-employee forums and weekly frontline staff bulletins.

Manager and Supervisor Training
In October 2023, RTD launched a comprehensive, six-part training for all
managers and supervisors. The in-person training seminars focused on enhancing
leadership skills, being an effective supervisor, instilling RTD’s values, and goal
setting, as well as other topics. The trainings went through June 2024 and will be
an ongoing part of RTD’s onboarding process for new managers and supervisors.

Elevator Pilot Program
In March, RTD launched its Customer Experience Elevator Pilot Program at three
light rail stations. Following a successful 90-day pilot, the program expanded to six
locations, with more in the works. The program entails elevator doors at stations
being reprogrammed to remain at rest in the open position to deter criminal or
unwanted activities inside the elevators. The initiative as part of the agency’s
Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) efforts across the entire
system. Key findings found a notable reduction in calls for service.

Live Look-in on Buses and Trains
RTD completed a major technology project to enhance operator and customer
safety by installing live look-in equipment on all its bus fleet. The new system
enables RTD’s public safety dispatchers to both view and hear individuals,
situations, and events occurring on a vehicle in the moment. With the live look-in
system, RTD’s public safety dispatchers can use a secure, cellular network
connection to hear audio and view video in real time from the cameras on board
the vehicle. Currently, 20% of light rail vehicles have the live look-in capability.

New Fare Structure
For the first time ever, RTD lowered its fares for all services systemwide on Jan. 1.
The change resulted from a yearlong fare study and equity analysis aimed at
creating a fare structure that is more equitable, affordable and simple for
customers. As an example of the new lower fares, RTD’s monthly pass is now $88,
a discounted monthly pass is $27, and the LiVE program increased customer
discounts to 50%.

Police Department Growth
RTD-PD has continued momentum in building the agency’s police force. The
department aims to reduce criminal activity and improve the personal safety and
security of customers and employees on RTD property, stations, and vehicles.
Currently, 80 officers are in the department with another 10 candidates in police
academy training. RTD is actively shifting from contracted security personnel to
directly employing sworn officers. The addition of officers enables RTD-PD officers
to be a regular presence on buses and trains and at stops and stations.

Theft Report Cards
RTD Transit Police continues to issue Theft Report Cards at Park-N-Rides to make
customers aware of activities that make them targets for vehicle break-ins. If
police officers notice a vehicle with personal belongings in full view, they will
create a report card informing the owner of the unsafe practice. The report cards
make riders aware of unsafe practices while also suggesting ways to make their
vehicle less of a target in the future. Last year, RTD Transit Police issued more
than 5,300 report cards aimed at helping customers reduce their risk.

Zero Fare to Vote
This year, RTD’s Board of Directors approved Zero Fare to Vote as an ongoing,
permanent fare change to encourage voter participation. Zero Fare to Vote will
occur every two years during the election cycle and removes a cost barrier for
people to travel on RTD services to cast their ballot. In 2024, with support from

White House Challenge Saving Lives from Overdoses
RTD is an active participant in a nationwide effort by the White House to increase
training and access to lifesaving opioid overdose reversal medications. The agency
was among the first five transit agencies to be called to participate. At RTD, opioid
overdose reversal medication is carried by all officers and contracted security
supervisors. In 2023, this medication was successfully administered to 103
individuals experiencing an overdose. RTD continues to be a nationwide leader in
the initiative and has provided support to other transit agencies.

Unhoused Outreach Coordinators and Mental Health Clinicians
RTD currently has two mental health clinicians, and a homeless outreach
coordinator working on behalf of RTD across its service area. Given the success of
the program, the agency is now actively recruiting to add three additional mental
health clinicians and four unhoused outreach coordinators. As part of the program,
a Transit Police officer accompanies a mental health clinician to provide referrals
and resources, rather than make an arrest for what could be misinterpreted as
criminal behavior rather than understood as a mental health crisis.

helped RTD identify problem situations and address them in real time before a
bad outcome is realized. RTD’s efforts in this area have gained attention from the
U.S. Department of Transportation resulting in a request for RTD to present its
agency progress and methodology at a recent webinar in September 2024.

Operating Expenses

The 2025 operating revenue budget is expected to
decrease in 2025 primarily from one-time revenues
budgeted in 2024. RTD conservatively budgets for
projected revenues in accordance with its Fiscal Policy to
only plan for revenue that is reasonably certain to be
collected. Fare revenue, grant revenue and other income
are all based on projections from the Board approved
2025-2029 Five-year Financial Forecast (FYFF) utilizing
modest assumptions in ridership growth, actual grant
apportionment information and baseline assumptions for
other revenue such as advertising, investment and
miscellaneous sources.

The 2025 operating expense budget increases over the
2024 budget primarily due to increases expected to occur
in salaries, wages and benefits, materials and supplies
and purchased transportation.

Capital expenditures for 2025 are largely driven by the
TAM Plan. Details of these budgeted capital expenditures
are provided herein and a schedule depicting and
describing the 2024 capital carryforward will also be
provided with the final recommended 2025 budget
appropriation.

45

Appendix

FY 2025 Budget Book
Regional Transportation District

Departments
and Divisions

The decrease in capital from 2024 is due mainly to the
2024 appropriation of capital for the multi-year light rail
reconstruction effort that was budgeted at $152 million in
2024, and unused appropriations will be carried forward
into 2025. This reconstruction effort will prolong the
useful life of light rail track that was opened for revenue
service beginning in 1994.

Materials and supplies increases are expected as RTD
adds revenue hours in alignment with the SOP. Repair
parts have experienced sharp increases in prices due to
the inflationary environment and are expected to
continue into 2025. RTD contracted in October 2024 to
lock in diesel fuel prices with an expected 400,000-gallon
locked price of $2.99/gallon to be carried over into 2025
and a contracted price of $2.52/gallon for and additional
6.75 million gallons necessary for 2025 usage.

Capital Expenditures

Benefit costs will increase along with new hires while also
experiencing inflationary and claims experience increases
for certain health and welfare costs. Certain health plans
offered to employees will have premium rate increases
approaching 20% for which RTD will seek strategies to
contain ongoing future large increases. Retirement plans
include a $15 million lump sum contribution to the closed
non-represented employee pension plan and a 9% of
salaries contribution to the non-represented employee
defined contribution plan. While CBA negotiations are
ongoing, the 2025 Budget contemplates a continuation of
a 13% of wages contribution to the closed represented
employee pension plan and a 9% contribution with up to
a 5% additional matching contribution to the represented
employee defined contribution plan currently budgeted.

Sales and use tax revenue, which comprises over 70% of
RTD’s funding sources, is derived from the September
2024 forecast provided by the University of Colorado
Leeds School of Business which anticipates growth of
4.2% after experiencing an estimated 1.0% growth in
2024 as the economy is expected to stabilize from prior
high inflationary levels which depressed real incomes and
spending. Grant Revenue decreases compared to 2024
due to the one-time pass-through grant for Colfax BRT
budgeted in 2024, however, RTD’s primary source of
ongoing grant revenue from Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) Section 5307 preventive
maintenance grants will continue to be a significant
source of funding in 2025. Overall revenue is anticipated
to keep pace with increases in expenditures in 2025
while also maintaining adequate reserves and supports
RTD’s Strategic Priority of Financial Success.

Salaries and wages will increase as RTD continues to
pursue the People Power Strategic Initiative to improve
hiring and retention particularly for vacant front-line
positions as well as the expansion of the Transit Police
function. Reduction of the 15% vacancy rate is expected
to occur while providing necessary resources to achieve
the System Optimization Plan (SOP) while also
contemplating the supporting resources for front-line
positions. These increases will be partially offset by
expected reductions in voluntary overtime that has been
incurred to fill vacancies. Wage rate increases have been
included at a presumed inflationary rate, however,
Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) negotiations with
the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001 are
ongoing and a final rate increase is yet to be determined.

The System Optimization Plan (SOP) will continually be
evaluated according to RTD’s Comprehensive Operational
Analysis (COA) during 2025, and service plan
modifications will be implemented in accordance with this
process during the planned January, May and September
2025 service changes. RTD may make other service
changes during the year, with Board approval, if
necessary. Staff intends to increase revenue service
hours by approximately 102,000 in 2025 according to the
SOP. This effort will require the continued pursuit of
recruitment and retention of additional front-line staff as
well as some additional supporting staff. Additional
funding for support vehicle maintenance is also
contemplated while provisions have been made for the
expected continued high cost of parts inventory that has
resulted from unprecedented inflation. The 2025 Budget
includes funding for these efforts and supporting
departmental budgets have been developed in concert
with these planned SOP changes to provide adequate
support.

Completion of the Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan
Study which evaluates alternative low- and no-emission
fuel technologies will continue to be evaluated with the
Board and any recommended future changes
contemplated during 2025 for implementation in future
years. Funding for this plan was appropriated in fiscal
year 2024 but no additional funding is contemplated in
the 2025 Budget at this time.

RTD will continue to pursue the Strategic Initiatives of
People Power, Back to Basics, and Welcoming Transit
Environment, with the introduction of Customer and
Community Connections, during fiscal year 2025. The
2021-2026 Strategic Plan allows for modifications, as
necessary, with Board approval and tactics surrounding
these Initiatives may change during the year or staff may
recommend changes to the Strategic Initiatives
themselves to be agile in addressing environmental
conditions.

FY 2025 Revenues

Fares

RTD forecasts revenues conservatively to ensure that
only reasonably certain funding sources are
contemplated when developing expenditures considering
fiscal constraints. This approach provides improved
budget certainty while also supporting fiscal
sustainability. RTD has evaluated the potential effects of
revenue growth limitations from the Taxpayer’s Bill of
Rights (TABOR) which becomes effective in 2025. TABOR
growth limitations could potentially affect up to 50% of
RTD’s revenues but staff does not anticipate refunds to
taxpayers being required for 2025 and has budgeted
accordingly. The November 2024 general election
includes a ballot initiative seeking voter approval to
continue RTD’s exemption from TABOR revenue growth
limits. Any necessary 2025 budget amendments due to
the results of this ballot initiative will be addressed with
the Board in 2025.

Fiscal Year
2024

The 2025 Budget includes an assumed 4.2% increase in
tax collections from 2024 according to the 30-year tax
forecast provided by the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business. Sales and use taxes will continue to
comprise approximately 75% of RTD’s revenue sources
in 2025. Operating and capital grants appear lower in the
2025 Budget compared to 2024 due to the one-time
inclusion of a pass-through grant of $150 million to the
City and County of Denver for the Colfax Avenue bus
rapid transit improvements which are anticipated to open
for revenue service in 2027. This pass-through grant had
no financial impact to RTD.

The 2025 budgeted grant revenue is primarily comprised
of FTA Section 5307 grant annual apportionments for
preventive maintenance as well as a $5 million state
grant for the Zero Fare for Youth Program. Other
revenue comprises just 3% of total revenue and consists
of investment income, advertising and other
miscellaneous revenue and is expected to be relatively
flat compared to 2024.

Executive
Summary

The revenue in 2025 is budgeted to decrease compared
to the 2024 Budget. The 2024 customer ares were
estimated with the implementation of the new fare
structure, however, actual results during 2025 have been
lower than anticipated. The 2025 fares contemplate the
current experience, including continuation of the Zero
Fare for Youth program and have been budgeted lower
by $6.8 million. Fares continue to only provide 5% of
RTD’s revenues. Sales and use taxes have been flat
between 2023 and 2024.

supply chain issues, and it is expected to continue into
2025. RTD contracted in October 2024 to lock in diesel
fuel prices with an expected 400,000-gallon locked price
of $2.99/gallon to be carried over into 2025 and a
contracted price of $2.52/gallon for and additional 6.75
million gallons necessary for 2025 usage.

The “other expenses” category includes miscellaneous
transactions and adjustments.

Fiscal Year
2024

Additional increases in benefit rates will also occur due to
the additional employees and adverse health claims
experience. Retirement plans include a $15 million lump
sum contribution to the closed non-represented
employee pension plan and a 9% of salaries contribution
to the non-represented employee defined contribution
plan. While CBA negotiations are ongoing, the 2025
Budget contemplates a continuation of a contribution of
13% of wages to the closed represented employee
pension plan, and a 9% contribution with up to a 5%
additional matching contribution to the represented
employee defined contribution plan currently budgeted.

Leases and rentals comprises a small portion of RTD’s
expenses, and those costs will remain flat in 2025
compared to 2024. These costs are primarily related to
facility leases such as the Civic Center building, and other
certain smaller agreements associated with
communication towers and storage facilities.

Executive
Summary

Salaries and benefits include a $52.5 million increase due
continuation of front-line position hiring in support of the
System Optimization Plan (SOP) which adds 102,000
revenue hours in 2025. Wage rate increases have been
included at a presumed inflationary rate, however,
Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) negotiations with
the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001 are
ongoing and a final rate increase is yet to be determined.

Utilities, which are primarily comprised of energy costs
for facilities and traction power are anticipated to remain
relatively flat in 2025 due to expected continued similar
volume usage and no significant rate increases assumed.

FY 2025 Capital Expenditures

Executive
Summary

Capital expenditures for 2025 are largely driven by the Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan. Details of these
budgeted capital expenditures are provided in the Appendix and a schedule depicting and describing the 2024 capital
carryforward will also be provided with the final recommended 2025 budget appropriation. The decrease in capital from
2024 is due mainly to the 2024 appropriation of capital for the multi-year light rail reconstruction effort that was
budgeted at $152 million in 2024, and unused appropriations will be carried forward into 2025. This reconstruction
effort will prolong the useful life of light rail track that was opened for revenue service beginning in 1994.

The TAM Plan categorical projects list is available in the Appendix.

Executive
Summary

RTD is continuing its efforts to improve and complete the TAM inventory of assets while also gathering Asset
Information Maturity (AIM) data to assist in evaluating the condition of assets to adequately plan for repairs and
replacements. Gathering this information is a multi-year effort and is contemplated in RTD’s internal initiative to
improve the financial planning process. That process is described in the July 2024 Board presentation of the 2025-2029
Five-year Financial Forecast (FYFF) and is expected to reach a more mature level for use by 2027. The process
includes three generations of implementation with the initial steps implemented in 2024 and continuous improvement
achieved in the following years.

Attachment: Proposed_Budget_Book_FY25_10-04-2024_(SMALL) (5012 : 2025 Proposed Budget)

The Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan provides information to plan to repair and replace assets to maintain a state

The 2025-2029 combined cash flow projections and fund balances are provided below:

Attachment: Proposed_Budget_Book_FY25_10-04-2024_(SMALL) (5012 : 2025 Proposed Budget)

The FYFF provides the basis for preparation of the annual budget and the 30-year forecast. For budgeting purposes,
the FYFF provides target funding constraints to ensure fiscal sustainability. Combined with RTD’s Fiscal Policy to
maintain certain reserve levels as well as the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, the FYFF ensures that budget appropriations
are aligned with expectations of Financial Success and maintenance of a healthy financial position.

Executive
Summary

The 2025-2029 Five-year Financial Forecast (FYFF) was approved by the Board on September 24, 2024. The FYFF is
not an appropriation but a planning tool which is useful, from a financial perspective, to evaluate fiscal sustainability.
In addition to this five-year forecast, RTD also periodically prepares a 30-year long-range forecast in coordination with
the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and other local municipalities with the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) as a component of the metro area Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP) which is required for
RTD to continue to receive federal grant funding.
