#### 1. Approval of contract award for Light Rail Training Simulator

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to approve a contract with OKTAL in an amount not to exceed $1,543,000 to procure and install a Light Rail training simulator at the Elati Light Rail Facility.

Motion:              Director Solano made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the April 15, 2014 Board Meeting.

Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, shares that staff is very excited about this project.  He introduced Bill Bell, Manager of Light Rail Transportation, and Doug Carrington, Project Manager and Light Rail Transportation Supervisor, who reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the April 8, 2014 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.

Austin Jenkins stressed to the Board that the current ability to train light rail operators is limited but this simulator will allow staff to overcome some of those challenges.  Bill Bell shared that he and Doug Carrington visited Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to view their simulator.  He said at that time staff thought they had selected a vendor but that was not even close to what OKTAL could deliver.  Bill Bell stated that while they were in the middle of the price range of bids this product is far superior to what any other company can provide.

Marla Lien, General Counsel, noted that the recommended action language would be modified before this action comes to the Board to read:

“It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to approve a contract with OKTAL in an amount not to exceed $1,543,500 to procure and install a Light Rail training simulator at the Elati Light Rail Facility.”

Director Deadwyler asked how long Calgary had the OKTAL simulator.  She expressed concern that we have purchased technology in the past that was not fully tested by RTD then ends up with a lot of mechanical issues or problems.  She also wondered how long the warranty period is.  Austin Jenkins stated that Calgary began using the simulator in September of 2013.  He noted that OKTAL has also provided simulators for the high speed rail in Paris and many other European countries.  He said that throughout his career he has had a great deal of experience with simulators and he is confident that this is a company with enough experience in the field that RTD will have a good product with a company that will stand behind it.  Doug Carrington stated that there is an initial one year warranty with a three year extension.

Director Folska thinks this is a wonderful idea.  She believes it really reflects RTD’s commitment to public safety.  She asked if the simulator replicates real life conditions, for example can it make the operators stress out, sleepy, etc.  Bill Bell stated that the simulator will have a very realistic feel; it will look just like the interior of our light rail vehicle cabs.  He shared that the scenery will appear as it does in our alignment; there will be pedestrians and automobiles, and the seat will even move as if it was a real train.  Doug Carrington explained that the trainers can create stressful situations that are very realistic to what the operator might go through when they are operating a live train.    Austin Jenkins pointed out that part of the simulator will be made by Siemens to include the proper train consoles.

Director Folska asked if the console was an additional cost.  She also wondered if there would be future software upgrade fees.  Bill Bell stated that the Siemens console was included in the cost.  He explained that staff did not anticipate needing any software upgrades as the simulator is fully expendable over time; staff expects to be able to use the simulator for 20+ years.

Director Tobiassen commended the light rail team for moving this item forward.  He said that he was surprised that staff has waited this long to purchase a simulator and only requesting one.  He shared that he has years of experience with flight training simulators noting that what instructors try to do is create worst case scenarios to get the operators prepared.  Director Tobiassen wondered if logs of training hours were kept for each operator.  Bill Bell stated that operators training hours are tracked but the simulator will allow the training department to keep more detailed records.

Director Bagley stated that he would be supporting this recommendation.  He is very appreciative of staff’s efforts.

Director Solano said that he will be supporting this item.  He noted that in his telecom work he had to do a lot of simulator training so he understands how crucial training is.

Director Daly shared that he has seen many simulators demonstrated at the various APTA conferences he attended.  He commented that one of the big problems with simulators is that a lot of trainees get nauseous or dizzy.  Bill Bell said that he actually experienced that in the Calgary simulator before the motion seat was turned on.  Austin Jenkins said that staff originally contemplated purchasing the simulator without the motion seat to save money but were strongly encouraged to add it for the realism.

Committee Chair Lubow declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. Training Simulator - Ops Committee 4 2014

#### 1. August 2014 Service Change

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, reminded the Board that no action was required on the service changes at this time.  He said staff was presenting this as an informational item before going out for public comment.

Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, explained that staff has three goals for these service changes: (1) prepare for the opening of Denver Union Station (DUS), (2) provide a larger maintenance window for light rail, and (3) improve on-time performance and capacity issues.  He noted that while the financial impact is estimated at an annualized amount of $315K there is actually about $900K of bus service improvements that are counterbalanced by some efficiencies gained on the light rail side.

Director Deadwyler thanked Jessie Carter and his team for working with her and the citizens of Green Valley Ranch to lengthen their service hours.  She shared that there were many complaints that the bus service stopped at 6:00 p.m. and people were unable to get home; now the bus service will be extended to 8:15 p.m. and she expressed how happy the people in the area will be.

Director Lasater asked for further information on the change in weeknight service for the light rail lines, specifically the E-Line.  He wonders if the alternate bus service will get riders to the Lincoln station around the same time as the train or if this change will increase their travel time.  Director Tobiassen expressed that he also had questions related to the H-Line.  Jessie Carter said that he would get with the Directors to discuss the changes in further detail.

Director Menten asked what route times were proposed to be discontinued on the W-Line.  Jessie Carter stated they were the Eastbound trips from Federal Center Station at 6:01 a.m., 3:00 p.m., 3:15 p.m. and 6:45 p.m. and the Westbound trips from Denver Union Station at 5:40 a.m., 2:25 p.m., 2:55 p.m. and 6:25 p.m.

Director Solano asked why Route 120 in Brighton was being changed.  Jessie Carter explained that this is a permanent route extension that came at the City of Brighton’s request.

### D. Other Matters

Bruce Abel said that he had two items to review with the Board.

1)      He reminded the Board that several months ago the contracts for the ADA Service Providers were approved.  He said that he wanted to share with the Board that the transition was completed effective April 1st.  He informed the Board that the transition went very smoothly and staff was very happy with the comments they have heard so far.

2)      Staff has been in conversation with Boulder County and the City of Longmont in regards to the proposed fare buy-up program in which the City would buy fares for the local service.  He said that staff is also working with the FTA on this item and will come to the Board with a recommendation to enter into a six month agreement for the program.  He noted that the goal is to kick the program off in September as kids are going back to school.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Lubow adjourned the meeting at 8:19 p.m.
