Subject:

Approval of contract award for Light Rail
Training Simulator

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to approve a contract to procure and install a Light Rail
training simulator at the Elati Light Rail Facility.
BACKGROUND
Rail Operations identified the need for a simulator in 2010 but funding was not available but funding
became available in 2013 via the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) process.
The complexity of our system, the number of trains we run, and the difficulty that our trainers have in
getting time on the mainline to train new operators without interfering with regular service makes this
tool extremely important. It allows new operators to become familiar with the vehicle and the operating
environment without risk to people or property. It also allows instructors to observe and correct operator
behavior and techniques in a controlled environment. The tool is flexible enough to expand as the system
expands and will pay dividends for years to come.
The procurement process began in December 2013. This process resulted in the receipt of six (6)
proposals. Several proposers set up demonstrations of their products at the Elati facility to aid in the
evaluation process.
DISCUSSION
The Request for Proposals (RFP) was advertised and made available to prospective proposers December
17, 2013. In January of 2014 a briefing for interested proposers was held and written questions from
prospective proposers were received. In February 2014 responses to written questions were sent to
prospective proposers. Proposals were due on February 19, 2014 2:00 p.m. to Contracts and
Procurement, RTD, 1600 Blake Street, Denver, Colorado.
Proposals were received from six (6) potential suppliers with oral presentations, if necessary, by selected
finalists the week of March 3, 2014. Final selection to be made no later than April 15, 2014.
As a result of this process we recommend that the RTD Board of Directors authorize General Manager,
or his designee, to accept the proposal from OKTAL, one of the world leaders in this technology.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project was included in the 2013 capital budget for Rail Operations. The price proposed
by OKTAL does not exceed the budgeted funds of $1,543,500 for this project.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Award the contract to OKTAL as recommended

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

2) Cancel the procurement and resolicit. This not recommended since this will cause additional
delays in the acquisition and installation of this vital tool.

Subject:

August 2014 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required, for information only.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. A
number of service changes have been proposed to improve system on-time performance and make minor
adjustments to operations affected by the opening of the Denver Union Station Bus Concourse. An effort
to address the state of good repair of the District’s light rail infrastructure is also contained herein
through a proposal reducing late night/early morning light rail service; replaced by bus service mirroring
the hours of operation currently provided by rail.
We will monitor customer response to the
implementation of this service plan and propose adjustments as appropriate.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

Route 208 – Iris/Valmont
Resume school tripper service. No cost impact is anticipated.
Route 209 – CU/ Table Mesa PnR
This proposal moves the south-end layover from Table Mesa to Manhattan Circle, due to
City of Boulder’s installation of a traffic signal at South Boulder Road and Manhattan
Circle. This change will provide safer left turns on-to South Boulder Road. Costs are
estimated to be $103,300 annualized.
Route AS – Stapleton/DIA
This proposal discontinues early morning/late evening service between Stapleton and
Monaco/Colfax. Ridership averages less than 1 passenger/trip.
Cost savings are estimated to be -$25,400 annualized.
Route BOLT – Boulder/Longmont
It is proposed to add one all day bus into the cycle to allow for needed travel time
adjustments and recovery. Cost is estimated to be $140,700 annualized.
Route BOUND – 30th Street
This proposal adds one all day bus into the cycle to improve recovery and service
reliability. Cost is estimated to be $103,300 annualized.
Route DASH – Boulder/ Lafayette via Louisville
The city of Boulder is installing a traffic signal at South Boulder Road and Manhattan Circle
which will allow us to move the layover/recovery for Route Dash short-turn trips back to
this location. It is therefore proposed to change the current layover from Table Mesa PnR
back to Manhattan Circle, for the DASH short-turn trips. It is also proposed to separate
interlines on Sundays, which will require an additional bus to improve recovery time on the
service. Weekday peak running time adjustments are also proposed. Cost is estimated to
be $65,800 annualized.
Route DD – Boulder/Colorado Blvd
Use Gate F at Colorado Station instead of Gate A. This effort would reduce potential

C/E/F-Line – It is proposed to continue the peak C and E Line service through the midday,
with each line alternating every 30 minutes. The F-Line would also run through the
midday with 30-minute service. This would create a combined 15-minute headway on the
Southeast Corridor between Belleview Station and Lincoln Station.
This proposal
increases connections to and from the W-Line at Auraria West Station and provides more
service to the Auraria at Colfax Station for students at the campus and helps alleviate the
pullin and pullout issues at the end of the morning peak period and before the afternoon
peak period. This operation requires 10 trains instead of the current 6 during the midday.
Anticipated cost is estimated to be $590,000 annualized.

Anticipated cost impact is estimated to be $212,300 annualized.
C/D-Line – it is proposed to make minor adjustments in running times in both directions
between Mineral Station and I-25 & Broadway and also reschedule the bus connections at
Mineral Station to the Routes 77, 401, 402L, and 403 to improve transfers and make the
service more reliable. No changes in hours proposed.
H-Line – it is proposed to make minor adjustments in running times in the southbound
direction between Dayton Station and Nine Mile Station and also reschedule the bus
connections at Nine Mile Station to the Route 35, 121, 130, 131, 133, 135, and 139 to
improve transfers and make the service more reliable. No changes in hours proposed.
W-Line – it is proposed to adjust running times on the W-Line based on modifications in
regards to the quiet zone crossings. It is anticipated that up to one minute will be saved in
both directions, which will also help with the layover/recovery time at Jefferson County
Government Center Station. This adjustment will save an all-day train on Weekdays and
Saturdays/Sundays.
Total anticipated cost savings is estimated to be -$1,157,000 annualized.
School trippers added/adjusted:
D-Line (train 14), H-Line (train 57). Both are proposed to operate on Monday-Thursday
only, utilizing the new fourth class of service schedule.

BroncosRide
It is proposed that RTD discontinue the following RTD BroncosRide Routes for the 2014
season: Federal Center Station BroncosRide and Market Street Station. Alternative for
the Federal Center Station will be the West Line Light Rail. With the closing of Market
Street Station, the Market Street Shuttle would be discontinued. Alternative service will
also be the West Line Light Rail (W-line), Southeast Light Rail (E-Line), operating out of
Union Station.
Due to bus constraints associated with week night games, it is also proposed that RTD
discontinue service to the Alameda & Havana PnR and East High School for weeknight
games only. Currently these two locations do not have preseason service. This proposal
will extend to any regular season weeknight games only. Alameda & Havana alternatives
will include BroncosRide out of South High School or any station along the Southeast Light
Rail Line. East High School alternative will be the Route 15Ltd which is being extended to
the Decatur-Federal Station. Approximately 150 customers will be effected each game.
