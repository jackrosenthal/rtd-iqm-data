STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Fiscal Policy requires that:
RTD will contract with a qualified, independent third party to provide sales and use tax forecasts.
As such, RTD has contracted with the Business Research Division of the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business (CU Leeds) to provide semi-annual sales and use tax forecast model reports in March
and September to coincide with the development of RTD’s annual budget and six-year Mid-term
Financial Plan (MTFP). The provision of the Forecast Model Report is followed by a presentation to the
Board by CU Leeds.
DISCUSSION
The March 2023 sales and use tax forecast will be included in the 2024-2029 MTFP. The September
2023 sales and use tax forecast will be included in the 2024 Budget.
The March 2023 Forecast Model Report reflects a projected increase from the August 2022 forecast in
RTD’s sales and use taxes as follows:

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Executive Summary
High excess savings and growing employment and income have supported sustained growth in
consumption, and higher prices have driven up nominal retail sales, both contributing to record sales
and use tax revenue for RTD. RTD sales and use tax revenue grew 19.6% in 2021 and 13% in 2022.
RTD’s sales and use tax year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 (8.5%) was the slowest
since Q4 of 2020.

RTD revenues are collected primarily within seven metropolitan counties (the “district”): Adams,
Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson, as well as a portion of Weld County.
Colorado and the Denver Metro region posted strong, above average economic growth following the
2007-2009 “Great Recession.” RTD recorded 10 consecutive years of sales and use tax growth
averaging 5.9% between 2010 and 2019. The pandemic recession created a drop in GDP, led to an
unprecedented decline in employment, and caused a sharp decrease in RTD revenue. The economy,
labor market, and RTD revenue all have recovered from the pandemic recession, but economic
conditions remain distorted, led by inflation and supply disruptions.
A model was developed to examine fundamental relationships between U.S. and Colorado economic
growth, and between Colorado and the district. It forecasts short-term, medium-term, and longterm RTD sales and use tax revenue, and accounts for economic and demographic (e.g., population
age) shifts over time.
Economic Update
•
•

•

The U.S. has recorded a strong economic recovery from the pandemic-induced recession,
illustrated by full employment, record GDP, and strong consumption.
Some economic conditions deteriorated in the first half of 2022 (e.g., decreasing GDP), but
rebounded in the second half of the year. Inflation averaged 8% in 2022 despite aggressive
interest rate hikes by the Fed.
Other economic conditions continue to indicate expansion: employment growth, wage
growth, personal income, consumption, and wholesale and retail sales. However, adjusting
for inflation, some metrics are recording negative growth. Home price appreciation has
turned negative in many markets, and manufacturing output is strained.

Moody’s Analytics projects real (inflation-adjusted) GDP to increase 1.3% in 2023 and 2.2%
in 2024 in the baseline scenario.
The personal savings rate spiked to record levels during the recession but fell to near-record
levels in 2022, and the level of excess savings is decreasing, especially in the lower two
income quartiles. With negative real wage growth and decreasing savings, sustained
consumption may come under pressure.
Nationally and locally, employment recovered to new record levels in 2022. As of December
2022, Colorado employment recorded the 10th-best recovery from the recession. The
national unemployment rate dropped to 3.4% in January 2023, while Colorado’s rate
dropped to 2.8% in December 2022. Colorado had the 2nd-highest labor force participation
rate in the country.

Short-Term Outlook
•

•
•
•

•
•
•

•
•

RTD sales and use tax revenue declined by 4.1% in 2020 due to the pandemic but rebounded
19.6% in 2021 to total $757 million, and grew 13% in 2022 to total $855 million. Revenue is
projected to increase 3.9% in 2023, impacted by sustained but slower consumption and
elevated inflation. Growth is projected to continue at 4.7% in 2024.
The 2022 revenue was within the confidence bound presented in August 2022.
Colorado employment is projected to increase 2.7% in 2023 and 1.3% in 2024. Employment
in the state outperformed, helped by strong labor force growth and the 2nd-highest labor
force participation rate in the country.
While the sources of personal income shifted during the pandemic, statewide total personal
income notched higher during the pandemic due to government assistance.
The unemployment rate descended to 3.4% in January 2023—the lowest since 1969—as the
economy reached full employment and demonstrated tight labor market conditions.
The forecasting model also provides information on uncertainty that is inherent in any
forecast through construction of confidence bounds on total RTD revenues. The mean
forecast for 2023 of $888 million is bracketed by 67% confidence bounds of $829 million on
the low side and $945 million for the upper bound.
The mean forecast for 2024 is $930 million, with a lower bound of $860 million and an upper
bound of $997 million.
The 67% upper- and lower-bound estimates illustrate the broad uncertainty behind
economic conditions that pose upside opportunities and downside risks to the forecast.
Quarterly growth exhibits more volatility than annual growth, and use taxes are more
volatile than sales taxes. The third and fourth quarters tend to be the largest revenue
quarters for RTD.
Forecasts of national indicators that are used to drive state and district forecasts come from
Moody’s Analytics.
For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have been above the actual revenue 73
times and below the actual revenue 93 times, and a simple average of the error has been 1%.

The past two post-recession recovery periods lasted 4.5 years and 4.75 years, before RTD
revenues returned to their previous revenue peaks. However, RTD surpassed the prior
revenue peak after just over a year from the onset of the recession in 2020 due to both the
nature of the recession and the government response.
Modeling three economic scenarios helps to accommodate the broad uncertainty
surrounding the U.S. economy. These scenarios may be taken as plausible bounds on RTD
revenue growth over the medium-term period; the greatest variation in forecasts occurs
during the first three years.
Under the baseline scenario, RTD total tax revenues are projected to grow by 34.2%
between 2022 and 2029, reaching $1.15 billion by the end of the medium-term horizon.
A more optimistic scenario, under which the national economy experiences faster growth,
yields cumulative revenues 2.8% higher than the baseline scenario over the medium-term
horizon; however, the 2029 total is 3.2% above the baseline forecast.
A second alternative scenario in which the national economy experiences slower growth in
the near term yields a cumulative forecast 3.7% below the baseline scenario.
There are higher inflationary pressures caused by excess supply chain disruptions, household
savings, high commodity prices, and a sudden tightening of the labor market.

Long-Term Outlook
•

•
•

After revenue growth of 4.8% for the decade ending in 2020 (in current, nominal dollars),
revenue projections for the next three decades average 6.3% (2021–2030), 2.0% (2031–
2040), and 1.7% (2041–2050); the 30-year average is 3.3% (2021–2050).
Despite changes to the timing of the short-term revenue, the long-term forecast is nearly
unchanged from the August 2022 update to the March 2023 update.
The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates population growth and shifts in the age
distribution of the population as key factors influencing the rate of growth in output,
employment, and sales.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Project Overview

The BRD collaborates with the RTD administration to forecast sales and use tax revenues, and to
identify the key drivers that will impact RTD’s tax revenue stream. Since project inception, the BRD
research team has been working closely with the RTD administration to better understand the
existing forecast system, to collect and organize relevant data, and to develop the three sets of
projections.
This report presents the revenue projections at the three forecast horizons, with some discussion of
the economic forces driving these forecasts. The model uses vector autoregression (VAR) techniques
in order to capture a mix of long-term, stable relationships, as well as short-term “deviations” from
these long-term trends. These relationships connect RTD tax revenue components to key
macroeconomic drivers, such as retail sales. The methodology is described in detail in the main body
of this report.
RTD revenue data is available through December 2022; state retail sales and state taxable sales are
available through December 2022; and District taxable sales are available through November 2022.
Data after these dates represent forecasts. Additional revenue from medical and retail marijuana
sales are in the RTD receipts. Adjustments to the model were necessary to accommodate the gap
year (July 1, 2017–June 30, 2018) in retail marijuana collections caused by Senate Bill 17-267. As
such, RTD taxable sales in this report are based on RTD sales tax revenues excluding retail marijuana
taxes. Therefore, these data are actually RTD taxable sales excluding marijuana sales. However, the
forecasts reported for RTD sales tax revenues include the forecasts of RTD retail marijuana revenues.
This construction was necessary to produce a series without the discontinuity over the period from
July 2017 through June 2018 to produce reasonable revenue forecasts.
In 2016, revenue from Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses (i.e., ecommerce) became a
significant contributor to RTD’s sales tax revenue. Ecommerce accounted for more than 7% of the
total sales taxes collected in 2021.
Given the pandemic recession’s impact on specific sectors of the economy, the BRD began modeling
major components of RTD’s sales taxes (e.g., restaurants, auto sales, ecommerce, grocery, etc.).
Modeling the components of retail sales taxes produces forecasts that accommodate the volatility in
the subcomponents.
The methodology and model descriptions may be found in Appendix A.

In an effort to provide consistent and accurate RTD revenue forecasts, a new sales and use tax
forecasting system was commissioned in 2010. The Business Research Division (BRD) of the Leeds
School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder was contracted to develop a model for
projecting RTD revenues over the short term (2024), medium term (2029), and long term (2050).
This model has been regularly updated and fine-tuned to portray best-available revenue forecasts
that are specific to Colorado’s Front Range economy.

1.C.1.a

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Forecasts: Short Term, Medium Term and Long Term
Short-Term Forecasts

All equations are estimated using monthly data to produce monthly forecasts that are aggregated
into quarterly or yearly data. Historical data for Colorado and national economic variables were
retrieved in February 2023, with much of the data current through the end of 2022. RTD revenue
data were provided through December 2022, and state retail sales and taxable sales data were
current through December 2022. All reported data after these dates are forecasts.
The short-term forecast relies on the Baseline Scenario from Moody’s Analytics. These national
macroeconomic indicators drive the forecasts of the Colorado economy.
Colorado Economy Forecasts
As background to the revenue forecasts, data on Colorado economic indicators are presented in
Table 1. Key indicators of Colorado economic activity show the rebound in 2021, and the estimate
for 2022, and the forecast for 2023 and 2024. The unemployment rate averaged 5.4% in 2021,
marking the beginning of the shift to a tight labor market that drove unemployment rates down to
3.6% in 2022. The rate is projected to tighten in 2023 to 3.2% but increase to 3.6% in 2024 as the
economy slows. Personal income growth surged during the pandemic recession due to fiscal
stimulus, and growth continued in 2021 (8.7%) and 2022 (6.3%) as other sources of income
rebounded (e.g., wage and salary income, proprietor income). Moderate nominal income growth is
projected in the short-term, but real income growth will be comparatively lower due to inflation.
Consumer price inflation peaked in 2022, but is projected to rebound near long-term averages by
2024.

Annual Tax Revenue Forecasts
The following table presents the expected changes in RTD base sales tax revenues and the driving
force behind these changes: taxable sales. From 2010 through 2019, district taxable sales recorded
10 consecutive years of growth averaging 6.1%. Taxable sales fell 3% in 2020 but increased 20% in
2021 and 13.7% in 2022. District taxable retail sales are projected to slow, increasing 3.9% in 2023

Summary: Following the Great Recession, RTD recorded 10 consecutive years of sales and use tax
growth averaging 5.9% (2010-2019). The pandemic-induced recession caused RTD sales and use tax
revenue to decline 4.1% in 2020, recording year-over-year losses for nine months in 2020. RTD posted
growth of 19.6% in 2021 and 13% in 2022, with projections of 3.9% growth in 2023 and an increase
of 4.7% in 2024.

and 4.4% in 2024. Sales tax revenues change in stride, falling 2.6% in 2020, but rebounding 19.8% in
2021 and 13.2% in 2022. Revenue is projected to increase 3.8% in 2023 and 4.4% in 2024. Note that
the model uses RTD sales tax revenue (less marijuana revenue) to impute taxable retail sales in the
seven-county RTD district because retail marijuana is no longer assessed at the 2.9% retail sales tax
rate for the state. However, retail marijuana is taxed 1% for the special districts, leading to a
difference in taxable sales and sales taxes.

The Short-Term Use Tax Revenue Forecast
In this model, use tax revenues are directly related to Colorado use tax collections reflecting the
broader geographical base for the use tax. Households and businesses residing within the district but
purchasing taxable goods outside the district are required to pay a use tax on these purchases at the
same rate as the sales tax. Illustrating the volatility, use tax revenues fell 1.1% in 2015, but increased
7.5% in 2016, 4.6% in 2017, and 25.7% in 2018 before falling 16% in 2019 and 20.4% in 2020. Use
taxes rebounded in 2021 and 2022, increasing 17% and 9.7%. The forecast calls for continued growth
in 2023 (4%) and 2024 (8.5%). The volatility of use taxes is apparent in both annual and quarterly
data.

Upper- and Lower-Bound Estimates for Baseline Forecast
The previous tables present only medium-level forecasts, which should be interpreted as the mean
values within a range of probable outcomes. All forecasting exercises involve elements of
uncertainty, although information about possible forecast errors is seldom presented. Uncertainty
arises from the errors in equation specification and estimation, and from the forecasts of the
national variables that drive the state variables. Although information on the latter source of
uncertainty is not available, the probabilistic high and low forecast bounds that incorporate possible
errors in fitting the equations are presented. The values of the high and low forecast bounds are
computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a 0.67 probability exists that the interval
between low and high forecast values will contain the actual value of the variable being predicted.
The following table displays the 67% confidence bounds on total RTD revenues through 2023. The
wide 67% confidence interval reflects uncertainty. The possible range is as low as $829 million and as
high as $945 million for 2023. The 2023 lower and upper bounds range -6.6% to +6.5% relative to the
medium forecast. The confidence bound widens in 2024 with greater uncertainty. The 2024 upperand lower-bound estimates are -7.4% and +7.2% different than the medium baseline forecast,
showing greater uncertainty one year out. This shows that it is not impossible or unrealistic that
revenue could grow stronger over the next year relative to the medium forecast, as well as the
exposure to the downside risk posed by economic threats.

Quarterly Tax Revenue Forecasts

Medium-Term Forecasts
Summary: The BRD short-term forecasting model is extended to produce forecasts over the time
horizon through 2029. Using different assumptions about the future course of the national economy,
three alternative projections are derived from the same equation specifications. Under the baseline
scenario, which leverages the Baseline macroeconomic scenario from Moody’s Analytics, RTD total
tax revenues are projected to grow by 34.2% from the end of 2022 to 2029.

1.C.1.a

Two alternative scenarios produce variations in the short-term revenue forecast (1-3 years), but
growth rates generally converge in the medium term (7 years). An alternative scenario in which the
national economy experiences a stronger short-term growth pattern yields a 38.5% increase from
2022-2029. Under stronger economic conditions, this scenario out-produces the baseline scenario
nearly every year of the medium-term forecast. In the second alternative, in which the economy
grows more slowly in the short run, there is a 31.5% increase between 2022 and 2029, with slower
growth recorded in the first two years. The differences in the cumulative revenue from 2022 to 2029
illustrate the impact of slower and faster growth in the short run. The optimistic scenario produces
cumulative (2022-2029) revenue $200 million above the baseline scenario, and the pessimistic
scenario produces cumulative revenue $264 million below the baseline scenario. These alternative
scenarios allow for a reasonable degree of uncertainty about possible outcomes for the U.S. economy
and may be taken as plausible bounds on RTD revenue growth over the medium-term period.
The BRD short-term forecasting model is adapted to produce forecasts over the medium-term
horizon through 2029. This time frame has been chosen to conform to the RTD investment planning
horizon for FasTracks. The specifications of the equations for these medium-term forecasts are the
same as for the short-term model, and these are also estimated with monthly data.
Over any medium-term period, the U.S. economy can be subjected to shocks producing outcomes
that are difficult to anticipate. One reasonable way to present forecasts that incorporate the
uncertainty about future policy or unpredictable economic shocks is to develop results for
alternative scenarios. In addition to a baseline case, two alternative outcomes are presented: one
allowing for stronger growth than the selected baseline and the other assuming generally slower
economic growth. As an alternative method of incorporating uncertainty into the forecast, statisticsbased confidence bounds for the baseline scenario are also generated, producing high- and lowforecast bounds based on 67% confidence intervals.
Baseline Sales and Use Tax Revenue Forecasts
Moody’s “Baseline Forecast” represents a baseline estimate for the U.S. economy, constructed with
a 50% probability that the economy will perform better and a 50% probability that it will
underperform.
This scenario assumes the oil prices are going to increase by $1 and $3 dollars per barrel through the
third quarter of 2024. In addition, the Fed is expected to increase the federal funds rate by 25 basis
points once more in 2023. This in conjunction with other economic factors will allow the 10-year U.S.
treasury yield to slowly trend higher until late this fall.
The biggest predicted risk in this forecast come from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s economic
recovery, Fed policy moves, a wage-price spiral, and gridlock resulting from the divided government
in Washington. The Ukrainian war is expected to continue disrupting supply-chains for several
products, chief amongst them oil. Furthermore, China’s economic recovery is expected to increase
their consumption of oil, which is further expected to increase global oil prices. The chairman of the
Fed, Jerome Powell, has increasingly advocated for increasing the federal funds rate, and ensuring
inflation is thoroughly combatted. However, if the Fed tightens too aggressively, the economy would
fall into a recession. The inverse could also happen, in the form of a wage-price spiral. If the Fed

to heights higher than those desired by the Federal Reserve.

Despite the recession, Colorado retail sales grew 4.9% in 2020 and 17% in 2021. Growth moderated
from 2021 to 2022, but remained strong (9.6%). Moderate growth is projected for 2023 (4.6%); the
simple average of 4.4% is projected for the medium-term forecast horizon. In the medium-term
forecast, state retail sales growth outperforms the nation many years of the forecast period.
Colorado personal income growth is projected to increase 4.6% in 2023. The annual average
unemployment rate in 2023 improves to 3.2% for the year, and total employment grows 2.7%. The
employment rebound surpassed the prior peak in early 2022. With rebounding employment and
wages, elevated wealth and savings, as well as increased inflation, retail sales continue to advance.

In this baseline scenario, the mean forecast in the BRD model calls for a 34.2% increase in total RTD
revenues from 2022 to 2029. Allowing for uncertainty in the model estimation and equation errors,
67% confidence bounds can be estimated. These interval forecasts show a lower-bound increase of
19.6% in RTD revenues for the 2022−2029 forecast period and a 48% increase in the high-range
forecast.

“Alternative Scenario 1 – Upside” represents an optimistic scenario constructed with a 10%
probability that the economy will perform better and a 90% probability that it will underperform.
Scenario 1 forecasts a rise for both short-term business sentiment and consumer confidence based
on strong gains in U.S. employment and increased spending, resulting in a greater than anticipated
rise in business investment and consumer spending throughout the year. Inflation rates will continue
to decrease to 2.4% by 2024. In this scenario, major global issues are expected to end faster than
anticipated.

1.C.1.a

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

In this optimistic scenario, total RTD tax revenues reach $1.18 billion in 2029, which is 3.2% above
the medium forecast under the baseline scenario. This scenario yields revenue growth rates faster
than the baseline projections. Total revenues grow by 38.5% between 2022 and 2029. Cumulative
revenues from 2022-2029 are 2.8%, or $200.4 million above the baseline scenario.

Pessimistic Scenario
Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 3 – Downside” is constructed with a 90% probability that the U.S.
economy will perform better and a 10% probability that it will underperform. This scenario assumes
that the global economy underperforms due to elevated tensions between China and Taiwan and
the persistence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This persistence causes supply chain conditions in
both countries to continue deteriorating. In this scenario, China also blockades the Taiwan Strait,
further lowering the number of chips available. Finally, declines in European economies hurt U.S.
exports and corporate earnings from European subsidiaries. In this scenario, the federal funds rate is
lower than the baseline due to the weakened economy, which leads to a decline in the 10-year
treasury and a yield curve inversion later in the year.
The combination of these presumptions leads the US economy into recession in Q2 2023, which lasts
until Q4 2023. The weakened economy leads to a rise in the unemployment rate, with a peak of
7.8% in mid-2024. Real GDP declines by -0.4% and -0.3% for 2023 and 2024, respectively. Overall
lowered faith in the economy causes the stock market to decline 35% over the course of the year.

Summary across the Three Scenarios
In the Baseline scenario, RTD revenue grows 34.2% to $1.15 billion in the medium term (through
2029). The pessimistic scenario presents slower growth early in the forecast horizon, followed by
faster growth, growing to $1.12 billion by 2029, netting 31.5% growth over the period. The
optimistic scenario records growth that results in an increase of 38.5% over the period, to $1.18
billion, outperforming growth early in the forecast horizon.
The timing of future revenue changes differs across the three scenarios. This difference reveals how
revenues may shift, but they eventually end up relatively close to each other. The difference in total
RTD revenues between the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios is 5.3% in 2029, but the cumulative
revenue differences are 6.8% between the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios.

The baseline scenario presents the BRD’s most likely forecast for RTD tax revenues over the years
2022−2029. After 2022, revenue grows steadily during this period, achieving an overall increase of
34.2% between 2023 and 2029, to $1.15 billion in 2029.

Long-Term Forecasts

Synopsis: Coming off a lower base for 2020 but a much stronger 2021 and 2022, the March 2023
long-term forecast reflects moderate growth in the first 10 years of the forecast horizon, slowing in
the final decade. Over the entire 30-year period, RTD’s total tax revenues in nominal (current dollar)
terms are projected to grow by 3.2% per year on average, while the real (inflation adjusted) growth
rate is 0.6%.
This forecast is for three decades: 2021–2030, 2031–2040, and 2041–2050.
National Economic and Demographic Trends
Growth in real output (GDP) is positively related to the proportion of the population that is upper
middle age (30–49 and 50–64) as this group contributes highly productive workers to the labor force
due to their experience and training. Although population shares change slowly, over the period
2010–2030 the proportion of the population in this productive age group is projected to decline,
from 46.2% in 2010 to 44% in 2030, contributing to a slowing rate of growth in real output between
now and 2030. The prime population proportion then increases to 45.3% by 2050. However, total
population growth rates slow throughout the 30-year forecast period, reducing real output growth
rates with each advancing decade.
Figure 3

In addition to a slowing of total U.S. population growth over the next three decades, the differing
growth rates of key age groups will have negative effects on economic growth. Growth rates of the
most productive age group (30–64), as well as the total population, will be slower during the coming
decades compared with the previous 10-year period (Table 22), producing some slowing in the rate
of growth in output. Across the three decades of the forecast period, growth in real GDP slows

The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates age shares of the population as a key factor
influencing the rate of growth in real output and in state and district sales that determine RTD sales
and use tax revenues. This model projects annual growth rates in real RTD tax revenues to 2050.

considerably during the final decade compared with the periods from 2021–2030 and from 2031–
2040. (See the BRD forecast in Table 23; the Moody’s projections are presented only for comparison
with the BRD forecasts and do not play a role in the long-term BRD projections of any real variables
after 2027.) Growth in the current decade was distorted by the negative impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the economy, and the strong growth that should follow in the recovery (although from
a markedly lower 2020 base). The demographic drag dampens growth in the final two decades of the
forecast horizon, partially offsetting the positive influences of increases in productivity and human
and physical capital that account for the long-run trend in GDP growth. During the final 10 years, the
share of the productive age group stabilizes, but the total population growth rate continues to
decline. The net effect of these demographic changes is a further decline in the real GDP growth rate
into the final decade of the forecast.

The BRD’s projected rates of growth in real GDP are below the Moody’s growth during the next
three decades. Over the 30-year forecast period, the BRD model projects 1.1% average growth and
the Moody’s model projects 2.2% average growth. The BRD forecast of retail sales growth is below
Moody’s for the forecast horizon.
Growth in U.S. retail sales is driven first by growth in output, which is then moderated by
demographic forces. The BRD forecasts show sluggish growth in retail sales during the last two
decades of the forecast (Tables 23 and 24 report rates of growth in real, inflation-adjusted terms).

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Both Moody’s and BRD forecast modest growth rates in each of the three forward-looking decades.
Notably, retail sales grow at a slower pace than GDP.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the economy early in the current decade, growth
rebounded for retail sales and taxable sales at the state and district levels. Over the long term, the
national economic environment is reflected in the Colorado forecast. The combined influence of
national economic forces and changing demographics leaves the state and the district with quite low
rates of growth in sales and taxable sales during the final decade of the forecast as shown in the
following tables and figures.
Colorado retail sales growth over the next three decades is slightly higher than for the nation.
Colorado taxable sales and RTD taxable sales also tend to outperform national retail sales growth,
primarily during the current decade. During the final two decades Colorado retail trade growth rates
match those for the US quite closely. Negative growth rates for RTD taxable sales during the final
two decades reflect the persistent slowdown in total population growth in Colorado, and especially
in the district.

Looking at nominal growth rates in RTD taxable sales shown in Table 25, the decade from 2021-2030
and the following decade are expected to produce growth of 6.3% and 1.9%, respectively. The
pattern of growth rates in Colorado taxable sales and RTD taxable sales are both consistent with that
of retail sales growth, with average growth rates for the last decade of the forecast (1.7% for RTD)
being the weakest for all three sales variables. These rates of growth for nominal sales appear in the

Future RTD sales tax revenues are forecasted by multiplying the effective rate of taxation by the
district taxable sales forecasts. Assuming no further changes in the RTD effective tax rate beyond
those implied by the reinstatement of the vendor allowance, the rates of growth in RTD sales tax
revenues for 2016 and beyond are identical to those of district taxable sales. Since the use tax base
is not directly observable, it is still necessary to estimate an equation to forecast RTD use tax
revenues. In this equation, RTD use tax revenues are driven by Colorado use tax revenues and
indirectly by the value of single family residential building permits. Revenue forecasts in real and

Forecast Evaluation
Actual RTD sales and use tax data are now available through December 2022, allowing for error
evaluation through the fourth quarter of 2022. For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have
been above the actual revenue 74 times and below the actual revenue 94 times, and a simple
average of the error has been -1%, with a 4.5% standard deviation (including the rapid revenue
swings during the pandemic recession). The August 2022 forecast for Q2 and Q3 2022 were low by
3.9% and 5.3%, respectively, illustrating the impact of sustained higher inflation. The short-term and
medium-term forecasts were revised upward in March 2023 (in part due to higher inflation driving
nominal revenue growth). The average 30-year forecast growth rate in nominal dollars ending in

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Three models have been developed and estimated for forecasting RTD sales and use tax revenues at
the short term (2024), medium term (2029), and long term (2050). All three models consist of
dynamic equations that link RTD district retail sales and sales and use tax revenues to underlying
national and state economic indicators. Forecasts of the national indicators that are needed to drive
the state and district forecasts come from Moody’s Analytics. Population projections that enter the
equations of the long-term model come from Moody’s Analytics and the Colorado Demography
Office. Colorado economy forecasts are derived from updated specifications of the Colorado
Economy Model.

Key Econometric Concepts
The equations of the RTD forecast model rely on modern techniques of econometric time series
analysis. Each equation specifies a dynamic relationship between two or more variables, capturing
both a long-run equilibrium relation and short-run dynamic adjustments toward this equilibrium.
Such equations are called error correction models (ECMs) and are a type of vector autoregression
(VAR) model. Following time series analysis traditions, these equations may embody complex
dynamic behavior that is based on rigorous examination of historical patterns in the data. Unlike
univariate (ARIMA) methods, which are sophisticated representations of trends and cycles, VAR
models include explanatory variables in each equation to allow persistent departures from trends
and possible turning points.
In the error correction model, a long-run equilibrium relation is joined with a short-run dynamic
adjustment mechanism. The long-run relation is called the cointegrating equation, which captures
the common trends in the variables of interest. For example, district taxable sales and state retail
sales are expected to move together as a result of common underlying economic processes; they are
therefore referred to as “cointegrated” variables. Naturally, one will observe short-run departures
from this common pattern, but with a tendency for one variable to adjust back toward the
equilibrium relation. For example, the district economy may lag behind changes in the Colorado
economy, but departures from the common trends governing these two variables will vanish within
several months. These dynamic adjustments back toward the equilibrium relation are captured by
the ECM.
This framework is illustrated with a simplified version of the relation between district taxable sales
(TXBLSALES_RTD) and retail sales of Colorado (TRDR_TTL).
DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD) = - 0.205*LOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.210*LOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) + 0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(-1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)) - 0.03745*@SEAS(1) + 0.040*@SEAS(5) 0.033*@SEAS(7) +4.125
Here DLOG( ) transforms any variable into its rate of change, so that the left hand side term is
interpreted as the rate of change in RTD taxable sales. Looking at the first two terms on the right
hand side, one sees that RTD taxable sales respond negatively to the level of taxable sales in the
previous period and positively to the previous period’s level of Colorado retail trade. These two

1.C.1.a

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

A more complex adjustment back toward equilibrium is embodied in the following three terms on
the right hand side of the equation (- 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) +
0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)). Past rates of change in RTD taxable sales and current plus past changes
in Colorado retail trade also impact the rate of adjustment in RTD taxable sales in the current period.
Additional independent variables, such as the price of gasoline (- 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)), can also be included in error correction equations, and this specification also
contains three seasonal dummy variables and a constant term.
This particular specification of lags and differences is the result of experimenting with various
alternatives and selecting the equation that meets standard diagnostic criteria, such as uncorrelated
residuals and statistically significant coefficients. For example, it is natural to allow all 12 months to
enter into the equation as seasonal variables (the @SEAS( ) terms), but only 3 of these were found to
have statistically significant effects. Similar cointegrating equations and ECMs are developed for the
other key variables in the RTD forecast model.
Since the ECM is expressed in rates of change, this is the natural form in which the forecasts of
district taxable sales can be generated. Given historical and forecasted values of all right-hand side
variables, the ECM produces forecasts of district taxable sales based on the forecasted month-tomonth changes.
Econometrics explicitly allows for random errors in the equations and in the estimation of their
coefficients. These sources of error will be reflected in the model’s forecasts, and the resulting
uncertainty can be estimated through simulation methods. This uncertainty is presented in the form
of interval forecasts given by the model’s mean forecast plus and minus one standard deviation of
the forecast error. The upper and lower bounds of these 67% confidence interval forecasts provide
statistically based high and low forecasts for each time period within the forecast horizon.

Comparisons and Linkages between the Three Models
All three models are grounded in the cointegration and ECM methodology, and all three generate
statistically based interval forecasts of RTD sales and use tax revenues. The short-term and mediumterm models are estimated using monthly data and produce forecasts at that same frequency. These
monthly forecasts of sales and use tax revenues are then aggregated to quarterly series for the
short-term forecasts and to annual data for the medium term.
The specifications of individual equations in the short-term and medium-term models are the same,
and therefore the baseline forecasts over a one-year horizon are identical. Variables and forecasts in
these two models are expressed in nominal values.
In order to forecast district level variables (e.g., RTD taxable sales, use tax revenues), it is necessary
to model and forecast economic variables at the state level. The Colorado Economy Model
previously developed for OSPB provides the framework for predicting state economic variables, such

terms capture the error correction mechanism: if RTD taxable sales are too high relative to the level
of Colorado retail trade, then TXBLSALES_RTD will tend to decline in the following period. In this
situation the relation between RTD taxable sales and Colorado retail sales is out of equilibrium,
requiring future adjustments to restore equilibrium between these two cointegrated variables.

as Colorado retail trade and Colorado taxable sales. These key Colorado variables are driven by
corresponding national variables and related state series, such as personal income. The linkages
between the economic variables at the national, state, and district level are shown in the following
figure:
Figure 8

The primary drivers from the national economy are personal income, employment, and retail sales,
and these contribute to the determination of Colorado retail sales and, in turn, RTD taxable sales.
Given the effective rate of sales taxation, RTD sales tax revenues are then given by a simple algebraic
identity.
Recognizing that large shocks to the national economy are likely to occur at some time over the
seven-year forecast horizon, the possibility of such shocks is incorporated in the medium-term
forecast by the use of two alternative national economic scenarios from Moody’s Analytics. These
alternative scenarios allow for the possibility of faster economic growth in the near term in one case
and for slower long-term growth in the other. These scenarios also provide alternative bounds that
complement the statistically based lower-bound forecasts from the econometric model.
The long-term model equations are fundamentally different from those of the other models, and are
designed to capture gradual structural adjustments in the economy due to changing demographics.
This model relies on population projections from Moody’s Analytics and from the Colorado State
Demography Office to drive the forecasts of all real national economic variables, state and district
retail sales and taxable sales, and RTD sales and use tax revenues. Whereas Moody’s forecasts of
national economic indicators are used to drive the short-term and medium-term Colorado Economy
Model forecasts, BRD researchers have developed equations for key national variables for the longterm forecasts. Only Moody’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) forecast is used for converting forecasts of
real variables into nominal values in the long-term forecasts.
Higher inflation could have an impact on the RTD forecast. Currently, the real-dollar RTD forecast is
constructed as nominal dollars adjusted to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For most of the previous
decade, the inflation rate has been low – between 0.5% and 2.0% annually.

However, market disruptions and supply-chain discord associated with current events create
additional risk of above trend and above target CPI. Year-over-year prices grew an average of 8% in
2022.

A combination of factors have continued to elevate inflation in the economy, some of which are
easing:
•

A disrupted supply chain that is imposing supply shortages and bottlenecks in final consumer
products as well as inputs to production. The Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to place
pressure on the global supply chain, while the reopening of China’s economy from COVID
lockdown is helping ease some supply pressures.

•

Excess savings by households remain above pre-pandemic levels, but higher costs of
borrowing, high inflation, and negative real wage growth causing consumers to spend down
savings and reduce savings rates.

•

Volatile commodity prices. Several staple commodities, such as oil, gasoline, lumber, and
wheat showed easing prices in late 2022 and early 2023, which should eventually be
reflected in consumer prices.

•

Tight labor markets. The economy swung from a very loose labor market during the
pandemic to one of the tightest labor markets in history. As labor markets have tightened,
wages have increased, but not to the extent to keep consumers on par with price increases.
Wage growth is considered to be the largest contributor to inflation. National and state
unemployment rates are lower than pre-pandemic levels, and many businesses face
difficulties finding qualified and willing workers, and this should place continued pressure on
employers to increase wages, especially for low wage workers.

The RTD forecast model currently incorporates annual U.S. inflation that rose to 8% in 2022, with
Denver metro area inflation at 4.3% in 2023 and 3.0% in 2024. The BRD team will continue to
monitor the situation and may adjust expected inflation when sufficient evidence emerges to
suggest changing inflation expectations.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

The Input Data—Sources and Description

National Statistics and Forecasts: National data, such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. GDP figures, track
closely to state indicators. Typically, higher U.S. retail sales indicate higher retail sales in Colorado.
National statistics for GDP and retail sales are published frequently, and several forecasts for these
indicators are available. The Colorado Economy Model that drives the district level variables relies on
these national variables to forecast corresponding state variables.
Some key national indicators are:
•

U.S. Retail Sales: Obviously, this indicator tracks closely to Colorado’s retail sales. This
indicator, along with its forecasted levels, is a central part of the Colorado Economy Model
and the RTD district model.

•

The figure below shows the relationship between U.S. retail sales and Colorado retail sales
over the past two decades. The Colorado sales values are not seasonally adjusted (the U.S.
figures are), but the two series are clearly closely related. The data have been standardized
to show the common movement of the two variables. U.S. retail sales change direction at
the same time as Colorado retail trade. It can also be seen that, over time, the overall level
of trade trends diverge slightly for these two series. In 2000 through 2006, U.S. retail sales
were, for the most part, greater than Colorado sales, but from 2009 to 2020 the opposite
was true. This implies that U.S. retail sales were growing more slowly than Colorado sales
over the past 15 years.
Figure 10

•

National Income: U.S. GDP, personal income, and disposable income serve as common
indicators for the state of the national economy. U.S. GDP plays a key role in the long-term
model. U.S. personal income is a predictor of Colorado personal income, which enters into
the equation for Colorado retail trade.

This section describes the data used to estimate equations and generate forecasts from the three
models. There are three levels of data: national variables, Colorado data, and district (RTD) data.

1.C.1.a

•

Consumer Price Index and Components: In forecasting sales and use tax revenues, it is vital
to distinguish between taxable and nontaxable expenditures and to consider how the
composition of household expenditures changes over time. In the short run, the proportion
of expenditures allocated to taxable items can vary with changes in the relative prices of
goods and services that are tax exempt. Gasoline prices are one example of a CPI
component that fluctuates dramatically, affecting the share of taxable/nontaxable retail
sales. This variable is included in the current specification of some equations in the
forecasting model. The CPI is also used to convert between nominal and real values of
personal income and retail sales.

•

Population by Age: In the long-term model, the age distribution of the population plays an
important role in the forecasts of retail sales and taxable sales. For example, the rate of
growth in the prime working-age population of the United States is used in the equation for
national GDP. Population projections come from Moody’s Analytics.

Regional Economic Variables: The equations in the forecasting model are based on basic
relationships between corresponding variables at national, state, and district levels. National data,
such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. personal income, track closely to local indicators. While national
level retail trade sales are a reliable indicator of general trends in Colorado retail sales, the inclusion
of state-specific economic variables, such as Colorado personal income, can improve the explanatory
and forecasting power of the model.
•

Colorado and Denver Metro Personal Income: Total wages are obtained on a quarterly basis
by industry (or aggregated) and by county from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (not seasonally
adjusted). This information is posted online with a six-month time lag in the Quarterly
Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) series from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Because the survey only asks for total wages disbursed for the quarter, and not for the
month, we cannot see an alternative method for obtaining monthly data by county. This
survey solicits information from the employer’s location, not from the employees’ residence,
so some wages leak out of the Denver Metro region. Personal income data for the state of
Colorado are sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on a quarterly basis. (Data sources:
Bureau of Labor Statistics, www.bls.gov; Bureau of Economic Analysis, www.BEA.gov)

•

State and District Populations by Age Group: In the long-term model, retail sales and taxable
sales at state and local levels are affected by the age distribution of the relevant population.
Data on population by age groups come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s U.S. Population
Projections and Population Estimates, and the Colorado State Demography Office in the
Colorado Department of Local Affairs.

•

Colorado and Denver Metro Employment: Employment by industry and metropolitan area is
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Current Employment Statistics (CES) is a survey of
employers and is available monthly, with a one- to two-month lag. These numbers are
revised as the QCEW data become available. If county-level data are necessary, the QCEW
employment data are available, but lag six months.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

1.C.1.a

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Taxable and Total Retail Sales and Tax Revenue Data: The Colorado Department of Revenue
(DOR) is the primary source for taxable sales, sales tax revenues, and use tax revenues. From
the collection of sales tax revenues each month and the knowledge of the effective rate of
taxation, the department computes the value of taxable sales (revenues divided by the tax
rate). At the state level, this procedure produces data on sales tax revenues and taxable
sales that are entirely consistent. However, the DOR computes taxable sales based on the
tax laws that apply to state sales tax collections, and these laws previously differed in their
treatment of RTD tax collections. In 2014, HB 13-1272 effectively changed the RTD base to
be the same as the state tax base.
We apply the same DOR data construction procedure to compute RTD taxable sales. Sales
tax revenues collected by RTD are divided by the RTD effective rate of taxation to produce
RTD taxable sales. In addition to providing consistency between the taxable sales and
revenues data, this procedure allows future changes in RTD tax rates to be incorporated
(e.g., anticipated changes in the vendor allowance).
In recent updates of the RTD revenue forecasts, the BRD team has modeled and forecast
specific components of sales tax revenues to improve the accuracy of total revenue
forecasts. This disaggregation of sales tax revenues became advisable during the recent
economic turmoil as various components moved in entirely different patterns during the
pandemic and into the recovery. Important examples of components that are now modeled
separately are online commerce sales, which were unusually strong during the pandemic,
and eating and drinking places sales, which dropped dramatically. These several components
of RTD taxable sales are driven by corresponding industry sales at the national and state
levels. The summation of the various components is now reported as total RTD sales tax
revenues.

The BRD Long-Term Forecast Model—Analytical Framework
Most long-term economic forecasting exercises employ a production function framework to project
real output (GDP). With this approach, output is a function of labor supply, capital stock, and
technology. From projections of these three determinants, predicting output is straightforward.
However, forecasting these three inputs is a daunting task that is often handled with arbitrary
assumptions about their long-run growth rates. There is little reason to believe that projections of
the growth rates in the three inputs would produce more reliable forecasts than directly projecting
output.
However, the BRD long-term forecasting model borrows some useful elements from this framework.
Modeling real output growth for the national economy is the starting point of the BRD forecasting
model, and all other variables in the BRD model are also expressed in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.
This puts aside the task of forecasting inflation, which depends on national political issues, Federal
Reserve behavior, and changes in global resource prices. Since inflation rates can be expected to
impact RTD revenues and costs symmetrically, incorporating inflation into the analysis is an
unnecessary complication.

Sound economic theory and empirical evidence supports the existence of a stable, predictive
relation between output and age structure. Output growth is positively related to the
working age share of the population, according to the aggregate production relation, and it
is negatively related to the dependency ratio, according to life cycle models of saving.
The age structure of the population is predictable with reasonable accuracy, and projections
are provided by the Social Security Administration and published by the Census Bureau.
Underlying demographic processes (fertility rates, mortality rates, immigration) change
slowly over time, allowing accurate age-specific population projections. Furthermore, older
portions of the age distribution of the population can be projected with great accuracy
because for the next 30 years, the population over the age of 30 depends only on mortality
rates and immigration—the former being highly predictable.
In terms of the production function framework, the age distribution can impact output
through each of the three inputs. By affecting the savings rate, age structure influences real
business investment and the growth in capital stock. One form of investment is in R&D,
which contributes to productivity growth. In addition, new physical investment embodies
latest technologies, thereby contributing to productivity growth. The labor force is obviously
directly related to the age structure through the size of the working age population. Also,
experienced workers tend to be more productive than new entrants to the labor force, so an
older workforce shows higher output per worker.
The ultimate goal is to forecast (taxable) retail sales, not output. Given the equivalence of
output and income, a simple consumption function links retail sales to output or,
equivalently, to gross national income. However, the relation between aggregate
consumption and aggregate income is expected to vary over time with changes in the age
structure of the population. Therefore, the equation for (national) retail sales includes the
population age shares, as well as aggregate income.
By the same reasoning, the age distribution affects the relation between total retail sales
(the model’s key national variable) and taxable sales (the relevant state and district
variables). For example, the consumption pattern of people 65 and older shows a higher
proportion of spending on nontaxable items compared with younger individuals who spend
more on taxable goods as they establish new households.

Although the BRD model does not estimate a production function or make assumptions about the
long-run growth in inputs, a production relation implicitly underpins the framework. The growth in a
nation’s labor force, capital stock, and technology is affected by the age distribution of the
population. Substantial theoretical and empirical literature on the “demographic dividend”
establishes the impact that age distribution has on economic growth, working through the three
determinants of real output.1 The use of the age distribution of the population in forecasting longterm economic growth in general, and RTD tax revenues in particular, has several important
advantages:

1.C.1.a

The BRD model employs this framework to produce long-term forecasts over the period ending
2050. Business cycle fluctuations come into play only during the current decade as the economy
gradually moves toward capacity output. These business cycle fluctuations play a role in the
medium-term forecasts previously developed for RTD, and the forecasts presented here build on
these 2022–2029 forecasts. The short-term and medium-term forecasts presented in the earlier
sections of this report employ nominal (current dollar) values of all variables, while the long-term
analysis is based on real variables. Both real (inflation adjusted) and nominal forecasts of total RTD
revenues are presented in this section of the report to allow comparisons with other forecasts and
to permit either real or nominal budgetary analysis. The data presented through the end of 2022 are
historical observations, while data from 2023 to 2050 represent forecasts.
The equations of the long-term BRD model employ the same dynamic error correction/cointegration
framework as the short- and medium-term models. All variables in these equations are expressed in
real terms, and projected real variables from the equations are converted to nominal values using
Moody’s forecasted national CPI. Both real and nominal values are presented in the tables and
charts of this section.
National output growth is determined by population shares as indicated by the previous discussion.
National retail sales growth is driven by output growth, moderated by changes in age shares of the
population. State and district sales and taxable sales are similarly related to national and state sales,
as well as state and district population shares. State and district sales growth rates, in turn,
determine the growth in RTD sales and use tax revenues.
National retail sales and Colorado personal income are key factors driving Colorado retail sales in the
long-term forecasting model. But differences in population growth rates and age distribution for the
nation, the state, and the district affect the relations between sales at the three geographical levels.
The growth rate of Colorado’s working-age population, for example, affects personal income growth
in the state, which in turn feeds into the determination of Colorado retail sales. Slowing growth of
this prime working-age population therefore indirectly contributes to the declining growth in
Colorado retail sales, Colorado taxable sales, and therefore RTD taxable sales. On the other hand,
moderate growth in the total population of the state adds to the growth in Colorado taxable sales,
offsetting to some extent the adverse effects of changing population age shares on the other sales
and tax revenue variables.
Population forecasts are sourced from the Office of the Colorado State Demographer and from
Moody’s Analytics. Colorado population forecast revisions by age and by county were released in
late 2022, and showed slower net migration to the state and the district (note: new Colorado and
district population estimates and projections will be released in October 2023).
Overall, population growth in Colorado and in the district affects the growth in sales and therefore in
sales tax revenues. While total U.S. population growth declines steadily over the three decades of
the long-term forecast, the state and the district exhibit somewhat different patterns in expected
growth rates as shown in the following figure. The estimated population growth rate for the district
and for the state peaked in 2015, followed by a decade of rather flat growth rates, and then began a
long period of decline. If birth rates increase, or the state experiences stronger net immigration, the
trend may be altered somewhat.

In addition to variations in the rate of total population growth, the changing population age
structure also affects the growth rates of sales and tax revenues in the long-term projections. For
Colorado and the district, the proportion of those in the prime working-age group and those in the
youngest age group (0 to 29 years of age) are projected to decline throughout most of the forecast
period, while the share of the aging population will grow. These trends will adversely impact total
and taxable sales in the state and the district.

The following two figures further demonstrate changing demographics over time, modeled by the
old-age dependency ratio and the prime working-age ratio. These ratios target more precisely the
changing size of the retired and working populations as they affect income and retail sales.
The old-age dependency ratio increases throughout the forecast horizon, but Colorado and the
district remain below the national ratio.

Conversely, the primary working-age ratio for the district falls through 2030, with some leveling of
this decline between 2030 and 2045 followed by further decline to 2050.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Since budget planning more commonly employs nominal (current dollar) values, the inflationadjusted (real) forecasts are converted to current dollars using Moody’s Analytics annual forecasts of
the national CPI for urban households. This adjustment with the national CPI is consistent with the
conversions to real values used throughout the BRD long-term modeling project. Although local CPI
data are available, these may be less reliable than the national data due to smaller samples in the
price surveys.

Appendix C: A Qualitative Assessment of Colorado’s Economy

Summary: The economy looks poised for a “soft landing” with slower GDP growth while supporting
further job growth. Colorado real GDP increased 3.2% year-over-year in Q3 2022, and at an
annualized rate of 3.5% from Q2 to Q3. National and Colorado employment reached record levels in
2022. However, rising inflation and tightening by the Federal Reserve pose headwinds.
Confidence
National consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board, has generally been on the
rise since hitting a low point in July 2022. Since then, it has increased by approximately 7.6 points
and now stands at 102.9 points as of February 2023. Concerns about inflation have begun to
subside, as the prices of commodities such as gas and electricity have become more stable. Inflation
is still expected to fall, as many anticipate that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest
rates. However, many economists are concerned about a possible recession due to the Federal
Reserve's recent policies. Breaking with the normal trend, the Mountain Region is above the national
index, resting 6.7 points above the national reading in February. The Mountain Region has seen a
significant increase of 18.7 points from July 2022.
Figure 18: Index of Consumer Confidence

The Leeds Business Confidence Index (LBCI), a forward-looking index of economic and industry
growth expectations, revealed that Colorado business leaders’ confidence remained unchanged
ahead of Q1 2023, but improved slightly looking out to Q2 2023. Panelists expressed concerns about
inflation, interest rates, supply chain issues, the labor market, and slowing consumer spending.

This qualitative assessment of the U.S. and Colorado economies is intended to serve as context for
the RTD sales and use tax forecast. In the process of compiling an annual business and economic
outlook for Colorado, the BRD has developed local indicators that can be used to complement the
results from the econometric models.

1.C.1.a

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

When determining whether an economy is under a recession, factors considered include real
personal income less transfers, nonfarm payroll employment, employment as measured by the
household survey, real personal consumption expenditures, wholesale-retail sales adjusted for price
changes, and industrial production. The recent pandemic recession was officially marked by the
National Bureau of Economic Research as the shortest U.S. recession (two months) dating back to
the mid-1800s when dating recessions began. National real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate (SAAR) of 3.2% in Q3 2022 and 2.7% in Q4 2022. The surge of personal consumption
expenditures slowed but continued to increase, up 2.3% and 1.4% in the last two quarters of the
2022, driven by a decrease in goods (-0.4% and -0.5%) and an increase in services (3.7% and 2.4%).
Gross private fixed investment decreased by 3.5% in Q3 2022 and 4.6% in Q4 2022. Government
consumption grew 0.9% in the fourth quarter, and the trade deficit slightly moderated from the
third quarter. GDP is expected to increase 0.7% in 2023, followed by 1.1% year-over-year growth in
2024, according to Consensus Forecasts.
In Q3 2022 (newest available data), Colorado’s real GDP increased 3.2% year-over-year. Nationally,
Colorado ranked 16th in quarter-over-quarter growth.
Figure 19: United States Real Gross Domestic Product

Jobless Claims
National initial jobless claims had fallen back to levels seen before the pandemic but have seen
growth to 190,000 claims the week of February 25, 2023. While this is down 4% year-over-year, this
is up 14.5% from the lowest numbers in March 2022. Colorado’s jobless claims have seen a slight
jump in the beginning of 2023 over the prior years but have already begun to settle. The 2,560 initial
jobless claims filed the week ending February 25, 2023 were up 3.7% year-over-year.

Employment and Wages
The unemployment rate in Colorado was 2.8% in December 2022, ranking the state with the 9th
lowest unemployment rate in the nation, down from 4% at the beginning of the year. The state’s
unemployment rate is still above the record low 2.5% seen in 2019 but has recovered from the
11.6% in May 2020. Within the state, the Boulder MSA had the lowest rate in December 2022
(2.2%), while the Pueblo MSA had the highest rate (4.3%). The Denver MSA’s unemployment rate
was 2.8%.

Wages in Colorado’s private sector grew 5.8% year-over-year in December 2022, ranking 9th
nationally. Industries with the largest year-over-year growth in December 2022 included Other
Services, Professional and Business Services, and Leisure and Hospitality.

There have also been continued struggles to fill record numbers of job openings. While job openings
have generally decreased over the second half of 2022, they remain at relative highs, totalling over
11 million openings in December 2022, a year-over-year decrease of 3.8%, but an increase of 54.1%
over June 2019 numbers. The number of quits, while also going down throughout 2022, also remains
at relative highs with nearly 4.1 million in December 2022. This represents a year-over-year decrease
of 7.2% and an increase of 17.2% over June 2019. As of December 2022, there were 7.8 million
multiple job holders, up 7.4% year-over-year. While the number of multiple job holders has generally
increased over the past few years, they still remain 474,000 below October 2019 levels.

Record inflation rates in both Colorado and the nation have been impacting consumer confidence
and spending over the past year and pose a significant headwind to growth in the year ahead. To
combat the record-high inflation rates, the Federal Reserve has raised the Federal Funds Rate eight
times since March 2022. However, while inflation has declined in recent months, it still remains
stubbornly high and the Federal Reserve will likely continue raising interest rates, albeit at a slower
rate, in 2023.

Retail Sales
National retail and food services sales increased 6.4% year-over-year and 3.0% month-over-month in
January 2023 (seasonally adjusted). Many categories recorded strong growth year-over-year in
January 2023, including food services and drinking places (25.2%), clothing and clothing accessories

in year-over-year in November 2022 after growing 10.9% in November 2021. The increase in retail
and food services sales is partially elevated due to the high inflation rates observed over the past
year.

Between November 2021 and November 2022, growth across all counties averaged 12.2%. There
were four counties with negative taxable sales growth, including Bent, San Juan, Crowley, and Baca
with decreases of 0.3%, 2.4%, 8.6%, and 16%, respectively.

E-Commerce
E-commerce sales continue to expand at a relatively rapid rate. As technology advances through
tablets and mobile devices, consumers have greater ability to make digital purchases and access the
nation’s e-commerce landscape. The COVID-19 pandemic had a drastic impact on retail sales.

Supply Chain
While supply-side constraints had severe impacts in 2021, they moderated over the course of 2022.
In 2021, production in the economy was unable to keep up with the huge increase in consumer
demand, coupled with a consistent shortage of labor and worsening supply chain bottlenecks. The
increasing spending by consumers may have helped the economy bounce back from the recession in
record time, but this spending put pressure on a supply chain battered with problems stemming
from COVID-19. Many micro supply chain issues morphed into larger problems as modern supply
chains are complex: full containers at ports sitting for weeks, a shortage of truck drivers and workers
at major ports, a shortage of warehouse space, factory production failing to meet demand, and
China’s strict COVID protocols. While these supply chain issues continue to persist, they generally
improved in 2022.
According to Container xChange’s Container Availability Index, the Port of Los Angeles recorded an
average surplus of around 0.73 in February 2023, down from 0.76 in January 2023. A value of 0.5
means that the same number of full containers leave and enter a port in the same week; a value of
more than 0.5 means that more containers enter than leave. While the index remains elevated,
indicative of a high surplus of containers, it has moderated from 0.9 in March 2021. Further, while
the inactive container fleet reached record levels in 2020 due to COVID-19, with 9.8% of global
container vessels idle in June 2020, normal levels returned in 2021 and have remained generally
stable through 2022 and 2023, sitting at 2.6% in March 2022 (most current data), according to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The nationwide shortage of truck drivers persisted in 2022, but did improve slightly, as the American
Trucking Association estimated a shortage of 78,000 drivers, down 4.5% from 2021. In addition,
freight rates have normalized, with the average cost of shipping a standard 40-foot container around
$1,790, as of March 3, 2023, down 84% from a peak of $11,100 in September 2021 according to the
Freightos Baltic Index. The Drewry World Container Index for March 3, 2023 is 80% lower than the

same week in 2022. The top business truck border ports in December 2022 were Laredo, Texas
($19.7 billion); Detroit, Michigan ($9.7 billion); and Port Huron, Michigan ($5.3 billion).

The national supply chain issues have not been absent to Colorado businesses, as they rely on input
parts from not only around the U.S., but the world. Businesses in the state have had to grapple with
increasing costs, a shortage of inputs, and increased wait-times on top of increasing consumer
demand. According to the Q1 2023 Leeds Business Confidence Index, which gauges Colorado
business leaders’ outlook of the economy, 4.6% of panelists said supply chain most influenced their
expectations, with interest rates (38.5%) as the highest influence, followed by inflation (35.4%).

The Supplier Deliveries Index, tracked by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), registered
47.6% in February 2023, down 2.4 percentage points from the prior month, and is the fastest
delivery performance since June 2009. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries as the
economy improves and customer demand increases.

Appendix D: Prolonged Recession Scenario

Real GDP falls 0.7% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024; the medium-term average is 1.7%. The unemployment
rate increases to an average of 5.8% in 2023 and 8.6% in 2024. Retail sales fall in 2023 and 2024
before returning to moderate growth.
In this recession scenario, RTD revenue falls in 2023 (-0.2%) and 2024 (-2.0). However, RTD revenue
begins posting growth again in 2025, ranging between 5% and 6.4% in the medium-term horizon.

In response to a request by RTD staff, the BRD research team added a fourth scenario modeling the
impact of a prolonged recession. The team leveraged a U.S. macroeconomic scenario titled, “S4:
Alternative Scenario 4 – Downside – 96% Percentile”, which is constructed with a 96% probability
that the economy will outperform this projection and a 4% probability that the economy will
underperform. Economic growth is slowed by persistent supply chain disruptions, caused in part by
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and increased tensions in the Taiwan Strait. In this scenario, the Fed
keeps interest rates high despite a slowing economy in order to combat high inflation.

Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update

Patrick Stanley, Manager, Engineering Programs

PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
In November 2004, Colorado voters approved the Regional Transportation District (RTD) FasTracks Plan
through a sales tax increase. The FasTracks Plan is a comprehensive program to construct and operate
new rail lines and improve elements of bus rapid transit (BRT), bus service, and park-n-rides throughout
the region. The Northwest Rail (NWR) is a 41-mile segment of the FasTracks Plan. Six miles of the NWR
are in operation as the B Line from Denver to Westminster, with the remaining 35 miles yet to be
constructed.
Funding Scenarios Derived from Past Planning Studies
As a necessary NWR planning component, RTD completed an Environmental Evaluation (EE) study in
2010. In 2011 and again in 2013, RTD and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad (BNSF) discussed
and prepared preliminary plans for the NWR full build scenario, which included 11 stations and a new
parallel track running from Denver to Longmont. Funding constraints impeded the implementation of the
full build scenario.
In 2013, RTD, with input from local transportation partners, conducted the Northwest Area Mobility
Study (NAMS) to prioritize cost-effective, near-term mobility projects. The NAMS considered the
possibility of constructing the NWR line in phases from the Westminster Station, then under construction
as part of the Eagle public-private partnership (P3) project, to Longmont. The Northwest Area
stakeholders and RTD, after careful consideration of study results, determined that given funding
challenges and near-term inability to secure a railroad agreement, the completion of NWR was a longerterm goal. Resulting from the NAMS recommendations, RTD committed to periodically explore and
update NWR implementation strategies and report to the stakeholders and the public.
Between 2017 and 2021, recognizing the continuous and persisting funding challenges to build the
entire NWR corridor, the peak service phasing concept was explored with the NWR jurisdictional
partners. Based on these inputs, certain stations that were part of the EE were no longer considered as

Packet Pg. 79

1.E.1

part of the peak period operation scope. During the same timeframe, RTD reengaged with BNSF to
discuss the feasibility of peak period operations. The peak service concept preserves opportunities to
implement the entire full build scenario while laying a foundation upon which service and infrastructure
can be expanded as demand grows. The peak service concept emerged as a community-preferred
alternative with the goal to minimize the overall project costs.
During the Planning/Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee meeting held on Tuesday, April 6, 2021,
the Board of Directors granted initial approval for staff to conduct the NWR Peak Service Feasibility
Study (PSFS) to solidify project scope, impacts, and costs to operate three trains in the morning and
evening peak periods, for a total of three daily roundtrips, between Denver Union Station and Longmont.
During the Special Board Meeting held on Tuesday, August 24, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized
the General Manager and CEO to implement the transfer of $8,000,000 from the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA) to fund the PSFS and to enter into all required contracts to complete the study
within the Board-approved budget. In April 2022, RTD issued a notice to proceed to a consulting firm to
assist in the planning, engineering, and outreach efforts for the PSFS.
With the Board’s authorization, staff, supported by a consulting team and jurisdictional stakeholders, is
conducting a comprehensive PSFS, which will result in an independent assessment of a plan to operate
weekday commuter rail service at peak times, with three trips between Longmont and Denver during the
morning and three trips between Denver and Longmont in the evening peak periods. The study will
assess the feasibility of a peak service scenario, identify viable vehicle technologies, fleet and
infrastructure needs, lifecycle costing, risk and mitigation strategies, operational rights within the BNSF
corridor, and independent capital and operating cost estimates. These critical components are being
studied independently and require separate contracts for different areas of emphasis. The study includes
extensive, robust community outreach.
The FS will also assess the potential future integration of NWR and Front Range Passenger Rail (FRPR)
from Boulder to Longmont.
Staff intends to leverage the PSFS deliverables as part of future contracts in connection with any
property acquisition, key agreements, and design and construction, should funding become available for
implementation. In a continued effort to establish and foster partnerships in the Northwest area, the
PSFS summary Scope of Work was reviewed by the northwest area stakeholders prior to the selection
of the consultant team. The stakeholders act as project ambassadors by serving as the members of the
Study Advisory Team (SAT). The SAT is comprised of representatives from the following stakeholders:

The study is being conducted through a five-milestone process:
• Milestone 1 – Peak Service Concept
• Milestone 2 – Local Plans and Commitments
• Milestone 3 – Initial Footprint
• Milestone 4 – Service Options and Partnerships
• Milestone 5 – Options, Strategies, and Next Steps
Milestones 1 and 2 are fact-finding efforts to understand peak service requirements and to research and
document local plans and commitments that have been made along the corridor since the EE was
conducted in 2010.
In Milestone 3, which is currently underway, the information discovered in Milestones 1 and 2 are
analyzed to define the infrastructure requirements and costs for implementing peak service on the NWR
corridor. In Milestones 4 and 5, the PSFS will identify possible partnership opportunities and funding
solutions for potential avenues for the advancement of the project.
DISCUSSION
In conducting the PSFS, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic Priorities of
Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success.
The purpose of this discussion item is to present information to the Board regarding the findings of the
PSFS community outreach efforts and progress to date. As part of Milestone 3, the PSFS team has
conducted two in-person public open houses and a self-guided online meeting to present information
about the PSFS and to gain valuable community feedback. The open houses were held in Boulder on
January 31, 2023, and in Westminster on February 2, 2023. The open houses were attended by Board
members and local jurisdiction representatives and elected officials.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this discussion item. PSFS costs for the calendar year are
contemplated in the 2023 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis and
Preliminary Title VI Analysis Materials for Public Review

April 11, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights Division
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD initiated the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis in 2022. To ensure a community-driven
process and inclusion of voices often not heard, the project team partnered with community-based
organizations to assist in reaching their respective client populations. Those groups included the
following:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Focus ReEntry
Cultivando
Athletics and Beyond
Denver Streets Partnership
CREA Results
Una Mano Una Esperanza

Additionally, the project team established stakeholder groups, representing larger constituencies, through
three focused feedback panels: Equity, Pass Program, and Jurisdiction. The feedback panels used
customer and community input to provide feedback to RTD on how the fare structure could best meet
the study’s goals (equity, affordability, and simplicity), fulfill customer and community needs, and
balance trade-offs among all goals and needs. The three feedback panels convened during each of the
three engagement milestones.
The study included three primary rounds of customer and community engagement at key milestones in
the study:
1. Milestone #1 (April/May 2022) introduced the study and provided opportunity to comment on the
existing fare structure
2. Milestone #2 (June/July 2022) introduced conceptual fare options along with evaluation criteria
for review

Packet Pg. 106

1.E.2

3. Milestone #3 (October through December 2022) introduced two preliminary fare alternatives for
review
In developing the two detailed fare alternatives for public review, the project team considered the
following:
•
•
•

Customer and community feedback
Fare strategies to achieve the three study goals of equity, affordability and simplicity
Impact on minority and low-income populations

At the February 14, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, staff presented a preliminary draft
recommendation for fare structure changes, which presentation is attached. The recommendation was
based on customer and community feedback received on the preliminary alternatives presented in
Milestone #3. During this meeting, staff solicited Board feedback on the draft recommendation, with a
deadline of March 1, 2023. Specific Board comments and questions received, and staff’s responses, are
also attached.
DISCUSSION
In conducting the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis, the agency demonstrates its commitment
to meet the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success.
The following discussion is divided into three sections:
• Board feedback on draft recommendation
• Draft Title VI analysis of draft recommendation
• Proposed outreach/engagement plan for public review of draft recommendation
Draft Recommendation Board Feedback
Board feedback was received from five different Directors (see attachment entitled Consolidated
Comments and Questions). The comments and questions submitted focused on clarifying issues around
the engagement process, new programs and changes to existing programs. Board feedback did not
include changes to the proposed recommendation. As such, staff’s recommendation is unchanged from
that outlined during the February 14, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee.
Additional details on changes to existing programs and potential new programs, such as the zero fare for
youth pilot and the transit assistance grant program, will need to be developed. Further development of
these programs will be informed by customer and community feedback as well as staff and consultant
input. Staff will keep the Board apprised as additional details on these programs are determined prior to
implementation in 2024.
Draft Recommendation Title VI Fare Equity Analysis
In accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, RTD must
conduct an equity analysis any time fare changes are proposed to ensure that changes do not unfairly
impact people of color and low-income populations. The FTA also recommends the equity analysis be

Packet Pg. 107

1.E.2

posted on the agency’s website and other appropriate methods to facilitate the public comment and
community engagement process. A draft fare equity analysis has been completed on the draft
recommendation and will be released to the public for comment in tandem with the draft
recommendation release.
RTD’s Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Policies
Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a
Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their
applicable thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
Disparate Impact Analysis
A disparate impact analysis is a review of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by
minority persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes shall
not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is
defined as all persons who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, nonHispanic.
Disproportionate Burden Analysis
A disproportionate burden analysis is defined as an examination of the difference in the adverse
effects absorbed by low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of
multiple fare changes shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall
ridership. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of
the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed fare change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential adverse effects. The agency will then
analyze the modification and make sure it removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate
burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial
legitimate justification for the proposed fare change, the FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the
proposed change.
Methodology
For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, on certain transit
modes, or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD shall analyze any available information generated
from passenger surveys indicating whether minority and/or low-income customers are disproportionately
more likely to use the mode of service, payment type or payment media that would be subject to the
fare change.
The typical measure of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden involves a comparison between the
proportion of persons in the protected class (i.e., minority or low-income populations) who are adversely
affected by the service or fare change and the proportion of persons not in the protected class (i.e., nonminority or non-low-income) who are adversely affected. In accordance with RTD Title VI Policies, the

Packet Pg. 108

1.E.2

determination of a Fare Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden is based on the difference in the
impacts experienced by minority and low-income persons because of any fare price change or the
average of multiple fare changes compared to the impacts experienced by the overall ridership.
Based on the Federal Guidance and the RTD Title VI Policies, RTD shall:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.

Determine the number and percent of users of each fare media being changed;
Review fares before the change and after the change;
Compare the differences for each particular fare media between minority users and all users; and
Compare the differences for each particular fare media between low-income users and all users.

A fare equity analysis compares the current fare to the proposed fare and calculates the absolute change
as well as the percent change. Utilizing the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden threshold, a
determination is made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that are
disproportionately borne by the minority or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are also
used to assess whether the proposed changes disproportionately benefit the overall population, including
non-minority or non-low-income populations.
Summary of Findings
The Average Fare Analysis analyzes the proposed fare changes, including the fare restructuring, price
reduction, introduction of fare capping, and income eligibility expansion for the LiVE Program, RTD’s
low-income fare discount program.
•

Disparate Impact Analysis – the analysis found that minority customers are expected to
experience a slightly smaller average fare decrease compared to all customers. While both groups
experience a decrease in their average fare, all customers are expected to benefit somewhat more
than minority customers as a result of the proposed fare changes. However, the fare changes do
not represent a Disparate Impact on minority customers as the percentage point difference in
percentage change in average fare from the proposed fare changes does not exceed RTD’s 5%
threshold. Therefore, the proposed fare changes do not present a Disparate Impact.

•

Disproportionate Burden Analysis – the analysis found that low-income customers are expected
to experience a slightly smaller average fare decrease compared to all customers. While both
groups experience a decrease in their average fare, all customers are expected to benefit
somewhat more than low-income customers as a result of the proposed fare changes. However,
the fare changes do not represent a Disproportionate Burden on low-income customers as the
percentage point difference in percentage change in average fare from the proposed fare changes
does not exceed RTD’s 5% threshold. Therefore, the proposed fare changes do not present a
Disproportionate Burden.

Conclusions:
The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board-adopted Title VI
Policies. While changes to some fare payment types would result in a greater percentage change for

Packet Pg. 109

1.E.2

some populations, the aggregate, systemwide differences between all customers and minority customers
and between all customers and low-income customers were within the 5% policy threshold. The
proposed fare changes are expected to benefit minority customers and low-income customers to a lesser
degree than all customers, but the difference in benefits do not exceed 5% on a systemwide basis. As
such, no mitigations are recommended to proceed with the implementation of the proposed fare changes
based on the Average Fare Analysis.
Although there were no disparate impacts or disproportionate burdens identified in the Title VI equity
analysis, RTD has integrated equity focused improvements and targeted program benefitting minority
and low-income populations as part of the draft recommendation. This includes LiVE expansion, Transit
Assistance Grant program, Semester Pass opt-in program for post-secondary educational institutions and
the zero fare for youth pilot. Additionally, RTD has planned efforts to expand access to MyRide retail
opportunities as well as increase outreach activities to promote the LiVE Program through partnerships
with community-based organizations.
Draft Recommendation Proposed Outreach Plan
RTD is required to review the draft recommendations and preliminary Title VI analysis with the public per
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) guidelines. RTD has chosen to conduct an extensive engagement
process throughout the study and expects to continue with a high level of engagement in the final phase
of the project. Meetings and educational materials will be provided in both English and Spanish with
some materials available for safe harbor languages within RTD’s service district. The following public
engagement activities are planned in April and May 2023:
-

-

-

-

-

Public hearings
o Three virtual public hearings - May 3, 4 and 16, 2023
o In person public hearing(s) - May 11 and May 17, 2023
Popup events – Staff and consultants will attend festivals and other scheduled events to solicit
comments on recommendations; events will also be held at select RTD facilities to solicit direct
input from customers
Digital and promotional information – web materials will be available for review and comment
including interactive elements to help customers understand recommendations, social media,
targeted radio and other media outreach
Community based organization (CBO) outreach – provide community-based organizations with
outreach materials and talking points to solicit feedback at the community level
Community partner outreach - leverage existing multicultural and engagement contracts with the
six community partners to distribute outreach materials, solicit feedback at the community level
and recruit attendees for the upcoming public hearing meetings
Local speaking opportunities – solicit opportunities to present information on recommendations to
garner feedback
Internal RTD communications – provide educational opportunities for represented and nonrepresented staff on recommendations and potential impacts to their responsibilities

Packet Pg. 110

1.E.2

Following the completion of the outreach process, a summary of comments will be developed and
modifications to the draft recommended alternative will be considered. A summary of comments and a
final recommendation for consideration of adoption will be presented to the Board at the July 2023
Finance and Planning Committee.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this discussion item; however, as stated in the discussion
section, the final recommended fare structure will yield a financial impact in FY2024, to be further
described in a subsequent Board presentation.

Director Dishell
Question: Can the Board get a number, even if it's a rough number, for what would be needed to
expand the free youth program beyond one year? It would be great to be working on getting this funded
in parallel with the positive press we're currently getting. It may end up being that the amount districts
are currently paying for monthly passes or other purchased media for kids may be sufficient to fill the
gap. On the youth free fare, have we considered a 12 month or 18 month free fare program? This would
allow students to have a full school year's worth of free fares if we started in January.
Staff response: The fare and revenue model projects that approximately $4.5 million annually
would be needed to fund a zero fare for youth program. The project team is considering an 18month pilot if feasible to coincide with the school calendar.
Director Williams
Question: Why did you ask participants about 2 alternatives and then pick a third? Looks to me like most
of the respondents picked $3, $6, $10
Staff response: During the community outreach efforts, when presenting the two alternatives,
the project team emphasized that the final recommendation would likely be different from the
two alternatives based on customer and community feedback. While community input indicated
strong support for Alternative B (the “flat” fare option which proposed a $3 Local/Regional 3hour Pass, a $6 Day Pass and $10 Airport fare), a significant number of community members did
express support for Alternative A since it would lower fares for all users. Based on that input, and
to address concerns expressed by those in the community who supported Alternative A (which
would lower all fares while keeping the existing fare structure), Alternative B was modified to
reduce the fares as follows:
• Local/Regional fare: $2.75
• Day Pass $5.50
• Airport: $10
Question: Do we have quotable responses from the ACLU Colorado, The Colorado Coalition for the
Homeless, the Harm Reduction Action Center, the Denver Streets Partnership, The Transit Alliance,
CCDC, and the rest of our usual and most vocal critics/proponents?
Staff response: To date, the project team has not sought endorsements from specific
organizations. However, the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition (CCDC) was represented on the
study’s Equity Feedback Panel, and the Denver Streets partnership participated in the process
through the Community-Based Organization (CBO) outreach. In other venues, such as the county
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) Forums, where updates on the fare study have been
provided, participants have expressed strong support for the recommendations.
During the final phase of engagement, the team will conduct outreach to other organizations
that you listed (i.e., Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, the Harm Reduction Action Center and
The Transit Alliance) to ensure their input is garnered.

Director Ruscha
Question: What would prohibit the RTD from including paratransit into LiVE sooner than 1/1/2024? (I
understand this exclusion is potentially a violation of the ADA and/or CADA and would like to know if
this can be remedied sooner.) Is this just a matter of a Board vote, or are there logistical considerations
(e.g., PEAK updates)?
Staff response: If the Board were to approve LiVE program changes and program expansion,
staff would work with the Colorado Office of Information Technology to implement the changes
in the state PEAK system. The PEAK system is an online service to apply for benefits. RTD
contracts with the state to use the system to determine LiVE eligibility. It is expected that a lead
time of eight months would be needed to implementation changes to the LiVE application within
the PEAK system.
Question: Will all paratransit programs be included into LiVE or just AaR?
Response: Only the Access-a-Ride services would be eligible for the LiVE discount. The Access-onDemand program would not be eligible for LiVE discounts since it does not fall under the
definition of Paratransit, nor is it a service that is provided by RTD. The program is a subsidy
provided by RTD for paratransit customers who opt into using the on-demand marketplace as an
alternative to public transit. RTD agrees to pay a flat subsidy when customers make this choice.
Director Guzman
Question: How can I support getting my constituents involved and educating them?
Staff response: The project team is developing digital and promotional information. Materials
will be created and published for review and comment including interactive elements to help
customers understand recommendations, social media, targeted radio and other media
outreach.
Question: When can we expect prepared materials for community engagements within our districts?
Staff response: The prepared materials for community engagement will be available in mid-tolate April 2023.
Question: Will materials be provided in Spanish?
Staff response: Yes, materials will be provided in Spanish.
Question: Do we have staff willing to support, I would like to hold up to 3 townhalls in District C
(Westside, Northside West and North Side East which may require both English and Spanish?
Staff response: Unfortunately, supporting individual town halls for each Board member is not
feasible with current staff resources. Currently, four or five public hearings are proposed:
• Three virtual public hearings (one of three meetings will be in Spanish)

Packet Pg. 113

•

One or two in person public hearing (staff are expecting to gauge interest in a second in
person public hearing when the meeting dates are advertised to determine if a second in
person is necessary)

In addition to public hearings, there will be several other opportunities for communities to provide
input.
• Popup events – RTD staff and consultants will attend festivals and other scheduled events to
solicit comments on recommendations; events will also be held at select RTD facilities to
solicit direct input from RTD customers
• Community-based organization outreach – RTD will be providing study materials and
information to several community-based organizations, which have deep ties to equity
communities throughout the region, to gather input on the recommendations. This approach
has been very affective throughout the study to engage communities that have traditionally
been difficult to reach.
• Staff will also be available to present at other community meetings, such as city council and
county commissioners meetings.
• Online engagement will also be emphasized with interactive information to make it easy for
customers to understand the implications of the recommendation on their use of transit
Question: We are proposing these fare changes, this process still continues on through review (Title VI)
and revision?
Staff response: Along with the proposed fare structure, the draft Title VI analysis will be released
for public review in April 2023. The Board will consider the final Equity Analysis in July 2023.
Question: Do we know approximately/generically how long the total process might take? What is the
end date goal?
Staff response: The current schedule would bring the proposed fare structure and the draft
Equity Analysis for review in April and May 2023 followed by requested Board action on the
study and Equity Analysis in July 2023, with the intent of implementing the recommendation in
the first quarter of 2024.
Question: Where/How do we share feedback from the community engagements?
Staff response: The project team will compile all comments received through the engagement
process. The project team will provide Board members with a specific feedback form that can be
submitted through the Board Office.
Question: Where can we direct independent community feedback?
Staff response: Comments can be submitted online through the project’s website.
Question: Will doing this fare change, decrease our services substantially? If not, how do we overcome
the decrease of income from the farebox?

Staff response: The current Mid-Term Financial plan assumed a decrease in farebox revenue. The
current draft recommendation would not impact proposed service levels identified in the Board

percent change

▪ Average Fare Analysis evaluates change experienced by all customers compared to change
experienced by minority customers and low-income customers

▪ Customer Satisfaction Survey data and ticket sales are used to determine fare usage rates and
customer demographics

▪ RTD policy thresholds used to assess whether proposed changes result in adverse effects

disproportionately affecting minority or low-income customers, or result in disproportionate
benefits for all customers

Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis Update

February 14, 2023

PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Since RTD implemented the most recent fare changes derived from the Pass Program Study
recommendations in 2019, the agency has received feedback from many customers and stakeholders
stating that current fares and pass programs are overly expensive and complicated. RTD is also
experiencing other changes that affect the outlook on fare policy. Like many other agencies in the United
States, there has been a consistent trend of declining ridership over the last several years. That trend
dramatically worsened due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The intent of the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis has been to explore simplifying fares to
make services more equitable and easier to understand while aligning fares with the service value
provided. Unlike previous studies, this study has taken a customer-centric approach, focusing on equity,
affordability and simplicity. Also included in the study was the exploration of the trade-offs associated
with lowering fare revenue targets to accomplish broader goals related to affordability and ridership.
Like most transit systems, RTD collects fares from customers who use the system. The fares contribute
to the operating costs of the system. It should be noted, however, that fares cover only a portion of the
cost for RTD to provide service. The percentage of operating costs covered by fares is known as the
“farebox recovery ratio.” Prior to the pandemic, the farebox recovery ratio was approximately 15%; that
ratio is now less than 10%.
Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide public transit service within the Denver
region. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit
service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and
reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 (Environmental
Justice). The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires transit agencies to assess whether a
proposed fare change would have a “disparate impact” on minority populations or represent a

Attachment: Discussion Item 2.14.23 (2) Fare Study and Equity Analysis (4766 : Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis and Preliminary

1.E.2.d

Packet Pg. 166

“disproportionate burden” on low-income populations. A preliminary fare equity analysis will be
conducted on the fare alternatives prior to release of the alternative to the public.
A subsequent analysis will be conducted prior to the Board considering a final recommendation. An
average fare analysis will be a key component of the equity analyses. The average fare analysis will help
RTD understand the cumulative impacts of the proposed fare changes and determine whether minority or
low-income customers are adversely impacted or whether overall customers disproportionately benefit
from the changes.
The three primary goals of the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis are as follows:
1. Equity: Supporting the transit-reliant and financially burdened customers; and to provide equitable
and fair access to RTD fares, products and discounts, regardless of race, color, national origin,
income status or other marginalized communities
2. Affordability: Aligning fares with the value of services received
3. Simplicity: Ensuring that fares are easy to understand, including standard discounts and
streamlined fare payment options
To ensure a community-driven process and inclusion of voices often not heard, the project team
partnered with community-based organizations to assist in reaching their respective client populations.
Those groups included the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Focus ReEntry
Cultivando
Athletics and Beyond
Denver Streets Partnership
CREA Results
Una Mano Una Esperanza

Additionally, the project team established stakeholder groups, representing larger constituencies, through
three focused feedback panels: Equity, Pass Program, and Jurisdiction. The feedback panels used
customer and community input to provide feedback to RTD on how the fare structure could best meet
the study’s goals (equity, affordability, and simplicity), fulfill customer and community needs, and
balance trade-offs among all goals and needs. The three feedback panels convened during each of the
three engagement milestones.
Membership of the feedback panels was as follows:
• Equity Feedback Panel: Representatives from different marginalized communities and
organizations working with those communities: low-income, Black, Indigenous, and People of
Color (BIPOC); English language learners; immigrant populations; people with disabilities; youth;
seniors; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ); and individuals experiencing
houselessness

•

Pass Program Feedback Panel: Representatives from groups participating in different pass
programs: employers, schools, universities/colleges, nonprofits, and neighborhood associations
Jurisdiction Feedback Panel: Representatives from local jurisdictions, including state, regional, and
municipal entities and transportation management organizations/associations

There have been three rounds of public engagement (milestones) as described below:
1. Milestone #1 (April/May 2022) provided the public introduction to the study. Engagement efforts
included the following:
a. The launch of a website and social media campaign
b. Customer and community meetings held in English and Spanish
c. Community partner focus groups
d. Meetings with the three feedback panels
e. An online survey asking for perspectives on the current fare structure
2. Milestone #2 (June/July 2022) provided an identification of conceptual fare options along with
conceptual evaluation criteria. Outreach efforts included the following:
a. Customer and community meetings held in English and Spanish
b. Meetings with the three feedback panels
3. Milestone #3 (October – December 2022) introduced two detailed fare alternatives to the
community and public for review. As with the previous milestones, outreach efforts included:
a. Community and customer meetings held in English and Spanish
b. A second customer survey in English and Spanish
c. Meetings with targeted focus groups
d. Meetings with the three Feedback panels
e. Meetings with community partner focus groups
f. A community-based organization survey
g. A press release and social media campaign
DISCUSSION
In conducting the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis, the agency demonstrates its commitment
to meet the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success.
The project team completed the third round of public engagement (Milestone #3), in which two detailed
fare alternatives were introduced to the community for review.
In developing the two detailed fare alternatives for public review, the project team considered the
following:
• Customer and community feedback
• Fare strategies to achieve the three study goals of equity, affordability and simplicity
• Impact on minority and low-income populations
• Other transit agencies’ fare pricing, structure and policies
• Fare pricing to maintain long-term financial sustainability
• Operational, technical and capital considerations

Input from internal staff, including operators, representatives from the Safety and Environmental
and Customer Care divisions

Alternatives for Customer and Community Consideration
The existing fare structure includes Local, Regional and Airport categories with discounts offered for
Day and Monthly passes. For reference, the following table illustrates the current fare structure:
Existing Fare Structure
LOCAL
3-Hour
$3
DAY
$6
MONTHLY
$114

REGIONAL
$5.25
$10.50
$200

AIRPORT
$10.50

The two proposed draft alternatives provided to the community in Milestone #3 were as follows:
Alternative A
3-Hour
DAY
MONTHLY

LOCAL
$2.75
$5.50
$88

REGIONAL
$5
$10
$160

AIRPORT
$10

Alternative A would lower fares overall, but would retain the Local, Regional and Airport fare levels. The
feedback that informed the development of Alternative A included the following:
• Fare prices should be lowered
• Maintain current service levels without increasing fares
• Reward frequent customers
• Lower airport fares
When measured against the project goals, Alternative A performed as follows:
• Equity: Low-income and minority customers would experience a greater decrease in fares than
other customers
• Affordability: All customers would benefit from the reduced fares, the current distance-based fare
levels (Local, Regional, Airport) would be retained, thereby aligning fares with services received.
Additionally, Local fare and monthly pass price decreases would improve transit competitiveness
against other modes
• Simplicity: Since the distance-based fare categories would remain in place, this alternative would
not address the goal of simplifying the fare structure
Alternative B

$96

Alternative B would simplify the fare structure by combining Local and Regional fares, thereby
“flattening” the fare structure; however, an Airport fare for those traveling to or from Denver
International Airport would be maintained. Feedback that informed Alternative B included:
•
Simplify fare structure
•
Maintain current service levels without increasing fares
•
Remove distance-based fares
•
Reward frequent customers
•
Lower Airport fare

When measured against the project goals, Alternative B performed as follows:
• Equity: Since local fares would remain static, non-low-income and non-minority customers would
experience greater average fare decrease than low-income and minority customers
• Affordability: Not all customers would benefit from the elimination of the Regional fares since
there would be no reduction to the Local fare; however, the reduction of the Regional fare and
the Monthly Pass price decrease would improve transit competitiveness with other modes
• Simplicity: Simplified fare structure and payment except for Airport trips
As part of the Milestone #3 engagement, the project team conducted a survey to gauge community
support for the draft alternatives. Results from the survey are graphically depicted in the following table:

Attachment: Discussion Item 2.14.23 (2) Fare Study and Equity Analysis (4766 : Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis and Preliminary

MONTHLY

Packet Pg. 170

There were 3,610 survey responses. While survey participation from low-income and minority
populations increased compared to the first survey conducted in spring as part of Milestone #1, the
survey results still skew somewhat towards higher income respondents. In general, survey respondents
indicated that they preferred Alternative B because of simplicity, the lower Regional fares, and the lower
Monthly Pass prices. For low-income respondents and those respondents that completed the Spanish
version of the survey, participants expressed greater support for Alternative A since it would provide a
lower Local fare.
Proposed Draft Recommended Alternative
Based on community and customer feedback, the project team has formulated a modified version of
Alternative B to address respondents who expressed a preference for Alternative A. The modified
version of Alternative B would lower the Local/Regional fare to $2.75, the Day Pass to $5.50 and the
Airport fare to $10, as shown in the following tables, while maintaining the simplified fare structure.

The modified Alternative B responds to customer and community input by providing the following:
• Lowered Local and Airport fares
• Simplified fare structure by removing the Regional Fare category. Customers would pay a flat fare
for all travel except for trips originating or ending at Denver International Airport
• Lowered Monthly Pass multiple to reflect hybrid work schedules and reduced transit costs for
transit-reliant customers
• For Discount customers (seniors, people with disabilities, Medicare recipients and customers
enrolled in LiVE), a single price would provide access throughout the region, and a greater
discount is applied to the Monthly Pass

The proposed draft Airport pricing reduces fares for all airport travelers, with a particular focus on
lowering transit costs for airport and airline employees. Through the customer and community
engagement process, occasional travelers indicated that the 3-Hour Pass price was a “good value.”
However, customers traveling three or more days per week expressed concern that the Airport fare is
“too expensive.” As illustrated in the table above, the cost for a monthly pass would drop significantly
from $200 to $88. The cost for a 3-Hour Pass/Day Pass would be reduced to $10. A preliminary
analysis has indicated that if the Airport 3-Hour/Day Pass were to be reduced further than proposed,
potential equity impacts could arise, thereby limiting the ability to further lower that fare.
Access-a-Ride Fares

existing structure for Access-a-Ride customers.

The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) allows transit agencies to charge up to twice the
comparable fixed-route fare for paratransit fares. The modified Alternative B fares would remain below
the maximum permitted by ADA and would continue to allow Access-A-Ride customers to use bus, rail
and FlexRide services for free. Additionally, the modified Alternative B would introduce LiVE fare
discounts for Access-A-Ride customers.
Proposed Changes to Existing Fare Programs
The proposed recommended draft alternative would also make changes to existing fare programs as
described in the next section.

Attachment: Discussion Item 2.14.23 (2) Fare Study and Equity Analysis (4766 : Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis and Preliminary

1.E.2.d

Packet Pg. 173

LiVE Program
Based on input from community-based organizations (CBO), the proposed recommended alternative
would increase the income threshold for LiVE eligibility. Additionally, CBOs also expressed a need for
RTD to work with community partners to better market and expand the LiVE program. Specific
recommendations for the LiVE program include the following:
• Increase the LiVE discount from 40% to 50% to align with other Discount fares
• Increase the income threshold from 185% to 250% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)
• Develop a comprehensive outreach and engagement action plan
• Eliminate the requirement for an in-District address
• Explore expanding means testing beyond the current system (means testing determines whether
customers are qualified for the LiVE program based on a person’s income. Currently, means
testing is only done through the State of Colorado’s PEAK system, which is used to determine
eligibility for federal and state assistance programs such as the Supplemental Nutritional
Assistance Program (SNAP) and Colorado’s Medicaid program.)
Current Pass Programs
In response to customer requests for greater flexibility and predictability with the existing pass
programs, the recommended alternative would provide the following changes to the pass programs
(EcoPass, CollegePass, NECO Pass)
• Contracts would have fixed pricing for two-year periods, based on system utilization
• All trips priced will be based on full fare, Local, 3-Hour Pass price (higher Airport fare will not
apply to Pass Program participants)
• Contract minimums will be reduced to lower barriers to participation
• No bulk or customer category discounts will be applied to any pass program
• New pricing would take effect in 2024
The cost for an EcoPass contract is determined by two factors: the Service Level Area (SLA) in which a
business is located, and the business size. The current SLAs are four zones within the District defined by
the density of RTD service within the zone. As an example, SLA C is downtown Denver and SLA D is
the Denver Airport. The proposed draft alternative would simplify the system by reducing the number of
SLAs from four to three. Furthermore, the employer size categories would be combined, thereby
reducing the EcoPass pricing matrix from 16 to three unique prices.
Bulk Purchases
While RTD currently has a program for bulk purchases, the recommended alternative is to introduce an
expanded program based on input from CBOs, non-profits and businesses. The program would apply to
“retail” products (3-Hr Pass, Day Pass, 10-Rides, Monthly Pass). The program would not apply to
EcoPass participation or resellers/sales outlets/vendors, such as King Soopers and Safeway grocery
stores. The program would introduce a 10% discount for bulk fare purchases at or above $1,500.
New Pass Programs

Attachment: Discussion Item 2.14.23 (2) Fare Study and Equity Analysis (4766 : Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis and Preliminary

1.E.2.d

Packet Pg. 174

The proposed recommended alternative would also introduce several new pass programs in response to
community and customer input. These programs are not fully formulated and require additional work and
coordination with stakeholders, including, in some cases, securing external funding.
Zero Fare for Youth
Throughout the community engagement process, the community expressed a strong desire for
establishing a zero fare for youth program. This desire spanned across all customer and stakeholder
segments.
The program would be targeted at those 19 years and younger. Even though some college students may
be eligible, no changes are proposed to the CollegePass contracts, as college freshmen are not the target
market for this program. The age-based threshold was chosen for simplicity to ensure all high school
students as well as those recently graduated are covered by the program. Given funding limitations, this
program is proposed to be introduced as a one-year pilot with the intent of seeking funding partners to
continue it as a permanent program.
Transit Assistance Grant
This program would respond to CBO/non-profit concerns about lack of accessibility of LiVE program for
clients with immediate needs. The program would address the needs of RTD’s most vulnerable
customers. The proposed recommendation includes the implementation of a grant program for nonprofits serving clients with immediate needs. The proposed recommended RTD funding for the program’s
first year would be $1 million.
Semester Pass
The Semester Pass responds to the need for an alternative to CollegePass for community colleges and
technical schools, that lack the critical mass of students who can participate in the CollegePass
program. The proposal would establish a Semester Pass, whereby participants could purchase a
discounted pass on a semester basis. The estimated price would be approximately $70 per month, or a
20% discount compared to the Full Fare Monthly Pass price.
Fare Structure Changes Considered but Not Recommended
Some proposed changes that were identified during the evaluation of conceptual alternatives are not
proposed to be advanced. Concepts that were considered, but not proposed to be advanced include:
•

•

Elimination of all fares – customers and community members did express a desire to consider
eliminating all fares. This concept would have too great of a financial impact on RTD and would
result in reductions to RTD service or reduce the number of service improvements identified in the
System Optimization Plan.
Modifications to the 3-Hour Pass and the Day Pass – feedback was expressed to consider
increasing the 3-Hour Pass to four hours and reducing the cost of the Day Pass. The 3-Hour Pass
was established in 2019 to accommodate the longest one-way trip in RTD’s system. The threehour window was not intended to accommodate round trips, even though some shorter
roundtrips can be accomplished under three hours. Similarly, the Day Pass is priced at two times

Attachment: Discussion Item 2.14.23 (2) Fare Study and Equity Analysis (4766 : Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis and Preliminary

1.E.2.d

Packet Pg. 175

•

the price of a 3-Hour Pass and is intended as a good value for customers who take two or more
trips throughout the day.
Introduction of an Affordable Housing NECO Pass program – this concept was reviewed and
determined not to be feasible at this time. Concerns were expressed during customer and
community feedback about the potential administrative burden on affordable housing providers. In
addition, there are inconsistencies between how eligibility for affordable housing is determined –
area median income (based on a stratification of incomes in the Denver region) – and how RTD’s
LiVE program determines eligibility – federal poverty level (FPL). These two measures are not
comparable and would result in inconsistencies between the two programs. However, RTD is
committed to working with affordable housing providers to improve access for affordable housing
residents through the proposed expansion of the LiVE program.

Projected Ridership and Revenue Forecasts
Unlike previous fare study efforts, this study did not assume specific revenue targets; however, based
on direction from the Chief Financial Officer, the project team aimed to develop a recommended package
that is generally within 20% of the existing fare structure for 2024. (Note that the current Mid-Term
Financial Plan (MTFP) assumes a fare revenue decrease based on the early direction of this study.)
In addition to forecasting the revenue changes associated with a new fare structure, the effects on
ridership were also modeled. The following analysis assumes an external funding partner can be
identified after the first year of the zero fare for youth pilot. The following table illustrates 2024 forecast
ridership and revenue for the existing fare structure, the MTFP assumptions and the recommended
alternative.

* Ranges in expected ridership and fare revenue reflect potential impacts of the Zero Fare for Youth Pilot
As shown in the table, the proposed recommended alternative would increase ridership over the existing
fare structure by approximately 8% to 14%. However, the ridership increase would be accompanied by
a revenue decrease of approximately 20% to 25% (over the existing fare structure). The corresponding
increase in ridership would not be enough to offset the financial impact of the lower fares. National
examples indicate that, in general, a fare price decrease will result in a loss of fare revenue, despite an
increase in ridership.
Transit customers typically have what is known as an “inelastic” response to price – that is to say, they
have limited sensitivity to price. The reduction in fare revenue, while significant, represents a small

1.E.2.d

Packet Pg. 176

impact to RTD’s overall budget (approximately 2%). No impact to service levels in the 2023-2028 MTFP
timeframe would be anticipated. This is attributed to the fact that the MTFP assumed a fare revenue
reduction starting in 2024. As noted in the table above, the 2024 MTFP assumed fare revenue is
$79.3M, which is within 1 to 7 % of estimated fare revenue under the draft recommended alternative.
The ridership and fare estimates depict the wide range of outcomes based on the scenario assumed for
the zero fare for youth program. If no zero fare for youth program is implemented, the ridership increase
would be at the low end of the range (8% increase). A zero fare for youth program would place the
increase in the high end of the range (14% increase). Likewise, with the financial assumptions, if the
program were to be implemented, but no external funding partner were to be found, the revenue
collected would be 25% less than under the existing fare structure. Should an external funding partner
be identified, revenue collections would be 20% below the existing fare structure.
Proposed Recommended Alternative Response to Study Goals
Equity
A preliminary equity analysis suggests that while low-income and minority customers will experience a
nearly 20% decrease in the average fare paid with the recommended alternative, the decrease is less
than the system as a whole. It should be noted that a 20% decrease in average fare is a substantial
benefit to these communities; and, added commitments to achieving the equity goal include changes to
LiVE pricing and eligibility, introduction of zero fare for youth pilot, the transit assistance grant program
and the discounted semester pass for college students.
In transit fare studies, there is often a trade-off between equity/fairness and simplicity goals. Through
customer feedback, participants in the Denver region expressed a strong preference to improve the
simplicity of the fare structure through this study. The study team respected that feedback and worked
to ensure that equity goals remained a key focus, and as noted, a full equity analysis will be performed
as part of the study.
Overall, the draft recommended alternative that will be presented for the Board’s consideration will:
• Lower Local fare, which is used by majority of equity population customers
• Lower Monthly Pass multiple, which enables more customers to benefit from Monthly Pass
• Expand the LiVE program
• Provide a single fare regardless of distance traveled or services used throughout the region for
Discount Fare customers
• Introduce a zero fare for youth one-year pilot program, which will address a significant segment
of equity populations and reduce transit costs for families
• Significantly decrease fares for Regional customers, which responds to the expansion of equity
populations in suburban communities
Affordability
• Lower fare levels for all RTD services, including Access-a-Ride
• Significantly reduce costs for frequent users with the lower Monthly Pass price

Attachment: Discussion Item 2.14.23 (2) Fare Study and Equity Analysis (4766 : Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis and Preliminary

1.E.2.d

Packet Pg. 177

Simplicity
• Address confusion with the zone-based system by having a single fare to most destinations
except for Denver International Airport
• Align LiVE fare with the Special Discount fare for seniors and individuals with disabilities and
Medicare recipients, reducing the number of unique fares
• Simplify fares for customers paying discounted fares by charging same fare regardless of distance
traveled or services used
• Harmonize pricing for all discount fare customers (during zero fare for youth one-year pilot)
Next Steps
The proposed next steps are as follows:
• Board provides review and feedback on the proposed draft recommended alternative - February
14 through March 1, 2023. Board comments and questions should be sent to the Board Office
who will then forward to staff for review. A form will be provided by the Board Office for all
Board comments and questions.
• Board authorization to release a draft recommended fare structure and draft fare equity analysis
to public – April 2023
• The public review and comment on a draft recommended fare structure – May 2023
• Board consideration of final recommended fare structure and associated fare equity analysis –
July 2023
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this discussion item; however, as stated in the discussion
section above, the final recommended fare structure will yield a financial impact in Fiscal Year 2024, to
be further described in a subsequent Board presentation.
