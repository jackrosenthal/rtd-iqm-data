RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution No. ______ reappointing Scott Reed and Derrick Black, to terms expiring
12/31/2020 as trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and Salaried
Employee Defined Contribution Plan.
BACKGROUND
On August 16, 2016, the Board approved amendments to the above Plans to provide for appointment of
the same four employee trustees for each of the plans, with two trustees being employee participants in
the Pension Plan, and two being employee participants in the Defined Contribution Plan, with termination
dates to provide for staggered terms. The terms of Scott Reed and Derrick Black expired on 12/31/17.
Resolution No. 27 Series of 2010, made modification to state that, “for reappointment of Trustees who
have served satisfactorily and in whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is
not necessary to seek applications for renewal, and instead the application process established by the
RTD Board of Directors in 2008 will be used on those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or
appropriate to appoint new salaried trustees to the Trusts.”
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
attached Resolution No. ______ reappointing Scott Reed and Derrick Black, to terms expiring 12/31/2020 as
trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined
Contribution Plan.
2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, and require a revised
recommendation. This is not the recommended action.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Subject:

Project Carryforward for SmartCard Stored
Value

CFO/AGM,

Date: January 17, 2018

GM
Board Meeting Date: January 30, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a budget transfer of $1,919,147 from the operating reserve to the Information
Technology Base System capital project budget, effective January 1, 2018, to allow for the
completion of the SmartCard Stored Value Implementation Project (#10322) that was not completed
in 2017. The operating reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended Budget with the funds that
were not spent on this project in 2017.
BACKGROUND
The 2018 Adopted Budget includes an amount for previously-approved projects carried forward from
2017. The basis to determine the amount to be carried forward is the Oracle accounting system.
The locally-funded SmartCard Stored Value Implementation Project was closed in error in Oracle,
therefore it was not included in the final capital carryforward report generated in Oracle. The project
was discovered in an Oracle post-budget capital carry-forward report in which the project had been
reopened.
DISCUSSION
The balance of the funds for this project totaling $1,919,147 were not accrued or spent at the end
of 2017. The transfer from the operating reserve to fund the carry-forward to 2018 will allow the
project to proceed in 2018. This transfer will allow RTD to continue work on this SmartCard
project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no net financial impact to RTD. The unspent funds for this project were included in the
general fund balance at year-end. The savings to RTD from not completing the project in 2017 will
be carried forward and be used to replenish the operating reserve at the time of the 2018 Amended
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a transfer of $1,919,147 from the
operating reserve to the Information Technology capital project budget, effective January 1,
2018, to allow for completion of the SmartCard Stored Value Implementati on Project that was
not completed in 2017. The operating reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended
Budget with funds that were not spent on this project in 2017.

Packet Pg. 7

2.11.B

Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer at this time.
Instead, include this request as part of the 2018 Amended Budget. This action is not recommended
since it will require RTD to suspend work on this project, and will not allow RTD to advance the
ongoing SmartCard project as a whole.
