BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: October 10, 2013

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

October 8, 2013

Board Meeting Date: October 15, 2013

Subject:

January 2014 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve
the January 2014 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an
annualized cost increase of approximately $635,500 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or
his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole while also
continuing to review the impacts of the implementation of the West Corridor Light Rail Service and the
associated bus service changes. Routine service changes not associated with or included in the West
Corridor Service Plan are necessary to maintain system on-time performance and provide the appropriate
level of service according to customer demand while we will also need to monitor customer response to
the implementation of West Corridor bus and rail service and propose adjustments as appropriate.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Eight public hearings were held between September 18 and September 26, 2013 in Boulder, Denver and
Lakewood. Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in
Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the
January 2014 service change:

Route 52 – West 52nd Avenue
Realign from current route at West 50th Avenue and Zuni Street via Zuni Street, West 46th
Avenue on to current route at West 46th Avenue and Pecos Street. New alignment brings
service directly to a recently enlarged senior housing development and reduces duplication
with Route 6. Current alignment serves stops for 93 weekday boardings, 60 Saturday
boardings, and 30 Sunday & holiday boardings, of which approximately one-third are
transfers with Route 6, which instead would be available at the intersection of West 46th
Avenue and Pecos Street. All of the affected passengers would remain within walking

Packet Pg. 10

Attachment: Board Report January 2014 - Attachment A (1710 : January 2014 Service Changes)

Route AT – Arapahoe County/DIA
Extend 3:42am northbound trip from Nine Mile Station to instead originate at Arapahoe
Station at 3:28am. Provides important employee start time service for Arapahoe
customers. Cost estimated to be $4,600 annualized.

1.B.1.a

Route P – Parker/Denver
Add southbound trip from Civic Center Station at 3:15pm, relieving overloads on the
current first afternoon trip at 3:45pm. Also, move 4:20pm southbound trip to 4:30pm, for
improved load distribution with 4:45pm trip. Extend the 4:11pm trip leaving Civic Center
Station to the Pinery park-n-Ride from its current terminal at Parker park-n-Ride. Cost

Route Y – Lyons/Boulder
It is proposed to shift the first south-bound trip 6min earlier, to allow for better regional
connections at Boulder Transit Center. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route YL – Lyons/Longmont:
The Route YL is a Boulder County sponsored CMAQ grant funded service that was
implemented in January 2012. Ridership on this service has leveled off at
10 boardings
per day, which is far below the RTD Service Standard for its service type. It is proposed to
discontinue this service. No cost savings would be realized by the RTD, due to the grant
funding of this service.
D-Line Light Rail
This proposal recommends the permanent closure of the currently temporarily closed station on
the Welton Street segment of the Central Corridor. Since January of 2013 stops on the D-Line
service at the 29th & Welton Station have been temporarily discontinued; as part of the effort to
improve schedule adherence on this segment of the Light Rail network. As previously stated in
the January 2013 Board Report, delayed trains affect our customers’ connections with bus
Routes 12 and 43, as well as some transfers for Routes 28 and 38. Additionally, train delays
from this area cascade throughout the system affecting on-time performance on the system as a
whole. Efforts to address the current problem, which stems from the downtown Denver signal
cycle timing change, include the City of Denver’s implementation of traffic signal priority
measures at the intersection of Park Avenue and Welton. The signal improvements and the
elimination of stopping at the 29th Welton Station resulted in a reduction in train delays from
34% of trips on the Welton segment to 17% along the single track section along Welton. Please
see map for more information. No operational cost impacts are anticipated.
W-Line Light Rail
Schedule for weekdays and weekends will have slight adjustments, based on operating
experience. No cost impact anticipated.

1.B.1.a

Ranches package
Route 77 would have minor schedule adjustments.
Route 401 would have minor schedule adjustments. The 8:18 p.m. westbound and 8:42 p.m.
eastbound trips are proposed to be discontinued, due to low ridership [4 passengers total] (-1
weekday hour).
Route 402Ltd would have minor schedule adjustments. (+2.5 weekday hours if no saved bus in
Route 403)
Route 403 is proposed to be removed from the Dutch Creek deviation. It would continue to
serve Highland Heritage Regional Park from University/Lincoln. It is proposed to discontinue trips
from Littleton/Mineral Station at 8:44 a.m. and from Lincoln Station at 8:52 a.m. due to low
ridership [11 passengers total] (-1.5 weekday hours for trips cut, additional savings from
removing deviation). No cost impact anticipated.

South Simms – Alameda Parkway package
Route 21 is proposed to be returned to its former alignment from West Jewell Ave. via West Yale
Ave., Bear Creek Blvd., and Alameda Parkway and return. Service levels will remain unchanged.
Route 100X would have minor schedule adjustments.
Route 116Ltd is proposed to be rescheduled to increase its span of service, covering times not
covered by Route 116X, as well as retaining the most utilized trips in both morning and afternoon
peaks. Proposed arrivals at Federal Center Station are at 5:48, 7:18 and 8:48 a.m. Proposed
departures from Federal Center Station are at 2:55, 4:25, 5:45 and 7:10 p.m.
Route 116X is proposed to have an additional trip added in each direction, with some trips
rescheduled. Arrivals at Civic Center Station would be at 6:34, 7:14, 7:44 and 8:23 a.m.
Departures – subject to adjustments for gate availability – would be at 3:35 p.m., 4:40 p.m.,
5:25 p.m., and 6:10 p.m. No cost impact anticipated.
Call-n-Ride
Belleview Call-n-Ride began operating in January 2012 under a Congestion Mitigation Air
Quality Improvement Grant (CMAQ) sponsored by the Denver South Transportation
Management Association. The Call-n-Ride serves the Denver Technological Center out of
the Belleview Station. In the pm period the Call-n-Ride has been operating a flex route
south of Belleview Ave. Because of the low ridership of the flex route, it is recommended
to discontinue the flex route and have the Call-n-Ride serve our customers by demand
only. No cost impacts are anticipated with this proposal.
Golden Call-n-Ride began operation in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line Light
Rail under a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Improvement Grant (CMAQ) sponsored by
the City of Golden, the Colorado School of Mines and the RTD. The Call-n-Ride operates
one vehicle as a Flex Route and one vehicle as a non-flex route Call-n-Ride. Ridership has
been rising since opening to over 9 boardings per hour. This proposal calls for an
additional 12 hours of Call-n-Ride service be added to the service. Cost impacts are
estimated to be $150,009 (including fuel) annualized.

Thornton/Northglenn Call-n-Ride began operating in December 2003 and the South
Thornton/Northglenn Call-n-Ride began operating in August 2007. These Call-n-Rides are
divided by 112th Avenue. Customers routinely transfer between the two Call-n-Rides at
112th Avenue. This proposal calls for a change that will allow customers to book a trip in
either service area without a transfer. Customers will call the Call-n-Ride that their trip
begins in and will be able to travel to the other Call-n-Ride area without a transfer. No cost
impacts are anticipated with this proposal.

Attachment: Board Report January 2014 - Attachment A (1710 : January 2014 Service Changes)

Longmont Call-n-Ride began operating in February 2001. The Call-n-Ride currently
operates three vehicles during peak periods in the Longmont community. During the
school year, the Call-n-Rides are booked with student related trips. This proposal is to add
an additional vehicle during the school year to be used specifically for students thereby
allowing the regular Call-n-Ride to be used for non-student trips. Annual Cost impacts are
anticipated to be $55,000.

Curtis Park Neighbors Feedback on Proposal to Permanently Close 29th/Welton Light Rail Station
Curtis Park Neighbors (CPN) appreciates the outreach and careful review that RTD staff has done
regarding the closure of the 29th/Welton light rail stop.
29TH/WELTON CLOSURE IMPROVES OPERATIONS RELIABILITY, BUT STATION CANNOT BE
ALLOWED TO BECOME A BLIGHT, AND SAFETY AT 30TH/DOWNING MUST BE ADDRESSED
The data collected this year agrees with riders’ experience: the set of changes including the closure of the
29th/Welton station, the implementation of north-bound signal-priority at Park Avenue for the light rail
trains, and other schedule adjustments have improved the overall D-line’s on-time performance and have
improved connections at 30th/Downing. In the current circumstances, the closure of the 29th/Welton
station was worthwhile and the station should remain closed.
However, we have two significant concerns that must be addressed in conjunction with the permanent
closure of the 29th/Welton Station:


The 29th/Welton station platform and area must be kept as attractive as possible, with no
unsightly construction fencing, weeds, rusty or broken features, or other signs of deterioration.
Ideally the station vertical elements should be removed to limit the appearance of being an
“abandoned station.” Despite the lack of a stop at this location in the immediate term, the
revitalization of that part of the corridor should not be hindered by signs of blight at the former
station.



RTD must do more to improve safety and a sense of security at the 30th/Downing station,
parking, and transfer area. One of the most frequent concerns we heard when the trial closure of
29th/Welton was proposed and began was from residents, some with children, who had been using
that station because of real and legitimate safety concerns at 30th/Downing.
RTD has a track record of ignoring repeated requests – including requests by CPN delivered at
RTD Board meetings – to address aspects of safety at 30th/Downing, such as long-burned-out
lights. (The lights were not addressed by RTD after years of asking until we engaged the command
staff of the Denver Police Department, who demanded and got RTD Facilities’ attention and
finally had the lighting repaired in May.) Police records and neighborhood experience continue to
show safety issues at 30th/Downing, including a call for assistance by DPD just yesterday in
identifying suspects in a brutal beating and robbery in September. (See attached news stories.)

Attachment: CPN RTD Feeback on 29-Welton Station Closure 20131008 - Attachment D (1710 : January 2014 Service Changes)

1.B.1.d

RTD must do more to improve safety at 30th /Downing, particularly recognizing that the
closure of the 29th/Welton station has removed an important way for residents to stay out of a
known troubled area. CPN would like to work with RTD and the Denver Police on a specific
action plan for improving security at 30th/Downing.

EVEN WITH 29TH/WELTON CLOSURE, ON-TIME PERFORMANCE ON NORTH-BOUND RAIL TO
30TH/DOWNING REMAINS POOR. LONG-TERM PLANNING MUST PRIORITIZE LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS.
The review presented by RTD staff at several forums in the past weeks showed that although overall Dline on-time performance is now back above 90%, the north-bound D-line on Welton, mid-day, is only
on-time to 30th/Downing a poor 66% of the time. Although improved from its prior state, as discussed
above, it must be acknowledged that this is still quite bad. Efforts to identify and address the causes of the
on-time performance problems that remain must continue.
Looking at the longer-term, RTD should continue working with the community on developing a
preferred alternative for two-way double-track rail operations on Welton, as envisioned in the
Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods Plan and other plans, and as is being examined in RTD’s Central
Rail Extension Project. The developed alternative must:


Continue high-quality rail service in the Welton/Downing corridor,



Have stops approximately every two blocks, including in the “Arapahoe Square” area,



Be capable of excellent on-time performance,



Provide a one-seat ride from 38th/Blake into downtown with easy transfers to light rail lines,
the free MallRide, the new free MetroRide circulator, and connections to key destinations
downtown, and



Be capable of handling existing and future passenger demand as this corridor becomes more
heavily used by local residents, visitors to the commercial corridor, and passengers connecting
between the East Corridor and downtown. This may require the ability to increase service
frequency as a means of meeting increased ridership over the long-term.

This position was adopted by CPN following presentations by RTD staff and internal discussions, and was
voted on unanimously by the Board of Directors of CPN.

Denver, CO 80202
Re: The Closing of the Light Rail Station at 29th and Welton St.
Dear Board of Directors:
The Five Points Business District represents property owners, business owners, and
community stakeholders in the heart of Historic Five Points. As you know, the above
referenced station is located on the main street of our culturally historic Welton Street
Corridor.
We felt it was important to announce this proposed closing to our mailing list of over 800
community stakeholders and on our Face Book page. We included this subject matter on the
agenda of our monthly community meeting held Saturday, October 6, where Mr. Jesse Carter
from RTD spoke about the benefits of closing this station. While we did not receive a multitude
of complaints, I am concerned that the protests will not really take place until the station is
actually closed in January, one of the coldest months of the year.
We recognize that the proposed closing may significantly increase the on-time performance
and service reliability of this train. However, our property owners who are re -developing their
sites to enhance the commercial prosperity of this area are not inclined to agree that
increasing the on-time performance rate will outweigh the benefits of spurring development
activities on this corridor.
Case in point: The Five Points community is included in RTD”s TOD Pilot Program to study the
possibilities of developing land that RTD owns to revitalize our neighborhood. The RTD/TOD
Pilot Program case study is on the parcel of land that is directly across the street from the 29th
and Welton St. station.

Will this closure affect developers from investing in RTD/TOD’s project if RTD should decide to
pursue development? Will closing the station deter other property owners from investing in
the neighborhood?
These questions are difficult to answer right now but should be asked and answered prior to
making the decision to permanently close this station. We hope that the RTD Board evaluates
not only the on-time performance and reliability issue but also the effect this closure has had
on the commuters, the residents, and the property owners that are being encouraged to
redevelop our historic district.
Sincerely,

Tracy J. Winchester

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

October 8, 2013

Board Meeting Date: October 15, 2013

Subject:

Free Rides for Members of the Military

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free rides on RTD for active duty
members of the United States Military should be extended from the presently approved date of December
31, 2013 to December 31, 2014. Utilization has been minimal to date and this extension will have minimal
impact on RTD.
BACKGROUND
At the October 30, 2006 Special Board Meeting, the RTD Board of Directors approved a resolution allowing
active duty U.S. Military personnel to ride free on all RTD services through the end of 2006. This offer has
been extended annually by the Board since that time and is now valid through December 31, 2013. As a
result of these actions, all active duty members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard,
National Guard, and Reserves are entitled to ride free on any RTD service including special services such as
SkyRide and BroncosRide. To be eligible to ride for free, active duty military personnel must either be in
uniform or present an active duty military ID card.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the RTD Board of Directors extend this offer beyond the current expiration date of
December 31, 2013 and that the expiration date be extended by one year at this time and revisited again
next year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The exact financial impact of this action is not known, but is expected to be minimal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Extend free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should from the
presently approved date of December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014. This is the staff
recommendation.
2. Do not extend RTD’s program offering free rides for active duty members of the United States
Military.

Radio and Computer Aided Dispatch and
Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Project
Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
The Radio and CAD/AVL Replacement Project replaces a 1993-era radio and dispatch system. With a
regulatory radio licensing change, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) requires that RTD’s old
radio frequency spectrum be replaced by the end of 2013. Because the legacy CAD/AVL system was so
tightly integrated with the radio system, it was also necessary to replace the CAD/AVL system.
Innovations in Transportation (INIT) was selected as the CAD/AVL vendor, Motorola is the radio vendor
and Sprint provides cellular data service. Now that installations are completed and the legacy system is
being decommissioned, RTD is meeting its FCC obligations.
Following is a capsulated summary of current and upcoming activities.

complaints addressing; announcement volume (both high and
low); frequency; infringing on one’s quiet time; and missing
announcements. Anecdotal observations by some drivers

Smart Card Project Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
The Smart Card Program (Phase 1) continues to gather rider taps for bus and train EcoPass and
CollegePass riders. During the month of September, 2013, taps including both first boarding and
transfers increased to 1.24M. The Smartcard Customer Service Center, (operated under an RTD
contract with Xerox by Celina, Inc.) continues to distribute new cards upon request, issue replacement
cards and answer riders’ questions as they arise. SmartCard Customer Service metrics such as calls per
week, call types and average on-hold times are reviewed weekly.
RTD’s Treasury Department has taken ownership of the installation of additional platform validators at
various locations throughout the RTD light rail system. In addition, reports have been developed for
Treasury’s use that will assist them in identifying trends in platform validator usage, which will identify
locations where additional platform validators may be required.
Arrangements are currently being made to train the over 35 RTD Street Supervisors in the use of the
Handheld Smart Media Readers or HSMRs. The Street Supervisors will perform many of the same types
of Fare Inspection activities as those performed by the Fare Inspectors that ride RTD Light Rail. Training
is currently scheduled for completion on Friday, October 25th.
In partnership with Xerox, the SMT Program Team continues to work on Phase 1 improvements and is
defining the final scope and deliverables for Phase 2 (MyRide/Stored Value.) Ongoing activities include






Modifications and improvements to current web functionality. Functionality will improve College
Transit Coordinator adoption of the site and allow for a smoother renewal period for EcoPass
customers.
Modifications to current administrative point of sale functionality
Repair of approximately 384 broken and defective onboard stanchions (validator mounting
brackets). Work began in late August and is expected to take approximately 10 weeks.
ADA compliance improvements on existing platform validators

ADA Concerns Update

Information

In our continued efforts to ensure that passengers with disabilities and elderly passengers are able to ride
RTD buses and light rail without difficulty, RTD and the private contractors have taken the following
actions:
Operator Education
Priority Seating Area policy – RTD Bus Operations issued several Transportation Bulletins for all
operators (RTD and private contractors) reminding them of the operator’s obligation to ensure that a
customer using a mobility device has access to the priority seating/securement area. Operators were
reminded that passengers with packages, large items, baggage, or baby strollers utilizing the securement
area should be asked politely to move towards the back, or find another seat. Operators were also
advised to assist if necessary. This information was consolidated and placed in a prominent location in
the August 2013 edition of the Trailblazer.
ADA Pass Up Button – RTD implemented a notification button on the radio system Mobile Data Terminal
(MDT), and operators are instructed to push this button whenever they are not able to accommodate a
passenger in a mobility device. The “ADA Pass Up” button sends a high priority message to RTD
Dispatch so that immediate steps can be taken to address the situation. In addition, RTD and the private
contractors receive a daily report of all incidents where the “ADA Pass Up” button was activated so that
video can be pulled from the bus and reviewed by management to ensure that the operator followed
proper procedures.
Review of ADA Policies and Procedures – All Operators (RTD and private contractors) were given and
acknowledged receipt of a letter that reviewed several RTD policies and procedures related to RTD’s
compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as it applies to transit. These reminders
included the following:
1) Steps Operators are REQUIRED to follow in order to accommodate a passenger with a mobility
device:
 GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT to see if the securement area is occupied by other passengers.
 Look for open seating toward the rear of the bus.
 Request that the securement area be made available. Offer to help passengers move their items
to the open areas.
 Thank passengers for their cooperation
 If space cannot be made, advise all passengers that you must inform Dispatch and wait at the
stop for further direction
 Call Dispatch by using the “ADA Pax Pass-Up” button on the Mobile Data Terminal.
 Inform Dispatch of the situation, and they will give you information about how the customer will
be accommodated, which you must relay to the customer BEFORE leaving the stop.
 Offer a courtesy transfer to the customer. Provide your name, bus number, route and block upon
request.

Packet Pg. 47

1.C.3

2) A reminder that an aide or personal care attendant accompanying a disabled passenger may ride for
free whether the passengers is using a mobility device or not.
3) A reminder that Operators are to permit any customer with an assistance animal to ride RTD without
interference.
ADA Mandatory Training – All Operators (RTD and private contractors) are participating in a mandatory
ADA refresher training class which reinforces the items listed above. A copy of the training class
PowerPoint slides is included with this update. The content of the ADA refresher training class was
shared with Julie Reiskin of the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition (CCDC) to ensure that all salient
points from the CCDC’s perspective were addressed. Ms. Reiskin gave her approval of the ADA
refresher training class content.
During the ADA refresher training class, Operators are given the opportunity to do some role playing in
order to learn methods for handling conflicts that arise when passengers compete for space in the
priority seating/securement area.
All Operations personnel, including Dispatchers, Street Supervisors, Division Supervisors, and Managers
are also required to participate in the ADA refresher training class to ensure that Operators are supported
when faced with an ambulatory passenger that refuses to move from the priority seating/securement
area. This information has also been shared with the Telephone Information Center (TIC) so that a
consistent message is passed on to our customers.
Operator’s Information Page and Bulletin Board – This on-line communication tool for operators will be
updated to include reminders about the Priority Seating/Securement policy and the steps Operators are
required to follow. In addition, operators can use this forum to ask questions and get advice for
handling issues that may arise.
Instructor’s Forum – This is a quarterly newsletter that is produced cooperatively by the RTD Bus
Operator trainers and the private contractor trainers. The newsletter provides helpful reminders on ADA
requirements and RTD’s policies and procedures. The newsletter is shared with all Operators.
Public Education
Share the Ride – RTD Marketing has produced interior signs for buses and light rail, as well as flyers that
encourage passengers to move from the priority seating/securement area in order to make room for a
passenger with a mobility device or other disability. A copy of the flyer in included with this update.
Operators will also be provided a pad of “Share the Ride” handouts (a smaller version of the flyer) that
they can give to passengers as needed.
The “Share the Ride” campaign was developed in conjunction with members of the RTD Bus Operator
Training Department and the DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force (The Task Force was created over
two years ago to work on removing barriers to transit for people with disabilities and is comprised of
individuals from disability advocacy groups, city governments, and RTD).
Social Media – RTD Marketing will post and promote its relevant policies on its website and social media
pages.

Packet Pg. 48

1.C.3

Interior Signage – Revised signs will be placed on the interior of buses and light rail cars near the priority
seating/securement area stating, “The Americans with Disabilities Act requires that these seats be
designated for individuals with disabilities and for those who use mobility devices. Please comply with
your bus operator’s request when asked to move from this area. Thank you for your cooperation.”
Additional Outreach – Operations personnel are working with the RTD Title VI Manager to develop a
focused plan to reach out to various women’s organizations to discuss the Priority Seating/Securement
policy, the impact it could have on passengers using strollers, and strategies for lessening the impact.

Management Oversight
Staff is working on a tracking system to monitor all ADA-related complaints in order to identify issues
and trends. Appropriate action will be taken to assure RTD policies are being followed consistently.
Video is pulled for all ADA-related complaints and anytime the “ADA Pass Up” button is activated on the
bus radio MDT. Operators are addressed whenever the video verifies that the operator did not follow
proper procedures.

Stroller Policy

Customers using strollers have other
options for transporting small children
not available to riders using mobility
devices.

They may need assistance
locating or moving to an
available seat. If asked to
help do so pleasantly.

A primary purpose of the policy
is to remind customers with
strollers that even if they sit in a
priority seating area, they may
have to collapse the stroller and
move to the rear of the bus if
those seats are needed for
those with disabilities.

Accessing the Priority Seating/Securement Area
An operator must make every reasonable attempt to
accommodate a passenger in a wheelchair. Other
riders occupying the securement area is not an excuse
for refusing to accommodate this customer.
Never assume or state to the customer using a
mobility device that the bus is too crowded until
you have taken the following steps:
1. Look first to see if other customers are blocking the
securement area or access to the securement area.
2. Get out of your seat and look to see if there is space
available towards the back of the bus.
3. Stand in front of the person sitting in the priority
seating area, look them in the eye, and state politely,
but firmly “I need to use these seats to allow a
customer with a disability to board please.”
4. If necessary, point to the sign and ask the passenger
to comply with your request.
