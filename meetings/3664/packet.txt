BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
“Group 33” Fixed-Route Service Contract

June 12, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
June 25, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with Transdev Services Inc. for the provision of fixed-route services as described herein. This
contract is for three years, with two one-year options for a total of five years, at a total not-to-exceed
cost of $186,603,968. Additionally, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount
estimated to be $16,101,761 over five years. The total five-year not-to-exceed cost for services and
fuel is $202,705,729.
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to § 32-9-119.5 (2)(a), C.R.S., RTD operates a system under which up to 58% of the agency’s
vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses, nonprofit organizations, or local
governments pursuant to competitively negotiated contracts. The agency currently contracts
approximately 45% of fixed-route service, 100% of complementary paratransit service (Access-a-Ride),
and 100% of FlexRide service, for a total amount of contracted transit service of approximately 56%.
The first contract for the provision of contracted fixed-route services was referred to as the “Group 1”
contract, and each subsequent contract was given a higher number. This service contract is referred to
as “Group 33,” which replaces the Group 29 service contract.
The service package consists of 109 buses providing approximately 284,861 revenue hours per year.
The routes provide service to the cities of Arvada, Aurora, Brighton, Commerce City, Englewood,
Glendale, Highlands Ranch, Lakewood, Littleton, Lone Tree, Parker, Thornton, Westminster, and Wheat
Ridge, the City and County of Broomfield, and the City and County of Denver.
DISCUSSION
A Request for Proposals (RFP) to replace the Group 29 service package was issued February 5, 2024,
with proposals due March 18, 2024, to allow adequate time for a comprehensive procurement process.
The solicitation was made available on the RTD website and was advertised via transit-industry-related
publications. During the solicitation period, one proposal was received. A panel of staff subject matter
experts assessed the proposal using pre-determined objective evaluative criteria. Based on the overall
evaluation of the proposal, the panel recommends awarding the contract to Transdev Services Inc. The
term for the Group 33 contract will be for three years, with two one-year options, for a total of five
years.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Access-on-Demand - Additional Funding

June 12, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
June 25, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to designate

PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD and its contractor partners deliver multimodal transit services across a 2,342 square-mile service
area, including bus, light rail, commuter rail, and microtransit services, as well as Access-a-Ride
complementary paratransit services in accordance with the requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).
In November 2020, RTD launched its Access-on-Demand paratransit service within the umbrella of
Access-a-Ride. Access-on-Demand began as a supplemental demand-response pilot program in
partnership with transit network company Uber. The program’s goal was to provide a responsive, ondemand platform for paratransit customers, which was similar in operation to the agency’s Access-a-Cab
program as it existed at that time. The Access-a-Cab program provided alternative paratransit service
through private transportation providers.
The Access-on-Demand pilot program provided customers a per-trip subsidy of up to $20, and eligible
customers were required to pay the first $2 in fare for each trip. Access-a-Ride customers within four
ZIP codes, selected for their density of existing paratransit customers, were eligible to participate. The
program hours were between 6 and 9 a.m. and between 2 and 5 p.m. The program was later expanded
to an additional three ZIP codes and was expanded again to serve customers 24 hours a day, seven days
a week. During the pilot period, RTD continued to offer its Access-a-Cab demand-response service, for
which a $12 subsidy was offered, and customers were required to pay $2 in fare for each trip.
Following the Board’s approval of funding in November 2022 in the amount of approximately $9.3
million, in January 2023, RTD merged the Access-on-Demand and Access-a-Cab programs. Since then,
RTD has partnered with four contracted private providers, Uber, Lyft, Metro Taxi, and zTrip, to provide
Access-on-Demand service. Customers travel using their choice of these providers, receive a subsidy of

Packet Pg. 5

1.D.2

up to $25 per trip, and pay no upfront fare costs. Additionally, customers schedule trips through the
providers’ mobile apps or call centers, as applicable, rather than via RTD’s Access-a-Ride call center.
Customers are limited to 60 trips per month and are responsible for monitoring their trip usage.
Due to the popularity of Access-on-Demand as an alternative to traditional paratransit services, demand
for service quickly exceeded expectations following the expansion of the pilot program in January 2023.
For example, ridership increased during the 2023 Zero Fare for Better Air (ZFBA) period on both Accessa-Ride by 7% and Access-on-Demand by 25%. The significant increase in demand for Access-onDemand service is likely due to the same-day convenience when booking an Access-on-Demand trip and
the elimination of the subsidy cap. During the ZFBA period, paratransit customers continued to receive
up to 60 Access-on-Demand trips monthly and additionally were able to travel anywhere in RTD’s
service area for zero-fare, that is, no out-of-pocket costs as the subsidy cap of $25 per trip was
removed.
To ensure customers have equitable and sustainable access to the agency’s services, RTD recently
commissioned a peer review of the agency’s paratransit service delivery. This on-site review was
conducted by industry subject-matter experts in late May 2024. These individuals engaged in a holistic
review of the paratransit program, including both the Access-on-Demand program and the Access-a-Ride
program. Their recommendations will assist RTD in adopting industry best practices, understanding the
agency’s strengths and opportunities with respect to paratransit service delivery, and determining
options for potential improvements, sustainability, and fiscal responsibility.
DISCUSSION
In considering this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the Strategic Priorities of Customer
Excellence and Financial Success.
Based on projected continual growth in demand for Access-on-Demand, an additional $8,600,000 is
required in order to continue to provide Access-on-Demand services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the Access-on-Demand program, in an amount not-to-exceed $8,600,000, will be made
available through the unrestricted reserve. Future funding for this program will be allocated through the
annual budget process.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Transit Police Department Update

June 12, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Dr. Joel Fitzgerald, Chief of Police and Emergency Management
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
On January 19, 2021, the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) submitted a written request to the
American Public Transportation Association (APTA) for a peer review of the existing RTD Security
Model. APTA accepted the request and convened a peer review panel of highly experienced transit
policing leaders. Implementation of the panel’s recommendations has been led by the Chief of Police and
Emergency Management. This report describes ongoing operational and strategic changes and those
anticipated over the next several years.
DISCUSSION
The overarching strategy for the Regional Transportation District Police Department (RTD-PD) is founded
on the continued paradigm shift towards expanding 24 hour per day operations in the following areas:
1. Proactive and positive engagement with the community forming trusted partnerships
2. A renewed focus on crime prevention
3. Marked progress in an intentional and phased internal growth strategy
4. Commitment to the application of intelligent and evidence-based strategies and the development
of solutions for complex problems, and
5. Promotion of organization-wide infrastructure improvements that enhance stakeholder safety and
facilitate crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED)
The framework for the enhancement of the RTD-PD community policing, Back to Basics, People Power,
and Welcoming Transit Environment strategies are described herein within the context of four topical
areas discussed in depth in the associated presentation:
1. Strategic Implementation
2. Evidence-Based Policing
3. Strategic Priority Alignment
4. Performance Data Outputs
Community Policing
RTD-PD continues to improve its brand by augmenting its perception by increasing its legitimacy as a
full-service law enforcement entity. As the department assumes a more visible and active role in

Packet Pg. 8

1.E.1

improving overall public safety throughout the transit environment, through the ongoing phased hiring of
sworn officers, while remaining sensitive to non-criminal social issues, it fosters a Welcoming Transit
Environment for customers and employees and frames future expectations.
Increasing police-stakeholder engagement also includes the expansion of key partnerships with agencies
throughout the service area, facilitating a more coordinated multi-agency approach to improving law
enforcement and public safety outcomes. As RTD-PD becomes a more active participant in proactively
addressing regional criminal and social challenges, additional sworn hiring allows the agency to expand
its reach, while 24-hour staffing will meet customer and employee safety expectations.
Examples of RTD-PD’s expansion benefits include:
• All members of the command staff undergoing intensive background clearances checks for
participation in the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force (FBI-JTTF)
• Actively connecting with social service providers to meet specific sector needs, and
• Meeting with police contemporaries in surrounding jurisdictions, part of the ongoing strategy to
improve relationships with other government entities, addiction, and mental health treatment
providers for the benefit of all in the community
People Power
The approval of 70 sworn officers in 2023 enabled RTD-PD to grow at a steady rate. On August 22,
2022, there were only 18 sworn officers in the department, and as of June 10, 2024, there will be 79
sworn officers. An additional eight are hired as police recruits, and 22 officers are active in the
background process. The department has 25 total police academy slots reserved for July/August 2024.
Although overall criminal incidents slightly increased as described herein, workload calculations indicate
the reduction in the agency’s historical overreliance on security, and the corresponding shift toward a
larger sworn police force, is both justified, and is working. RTD-PD's commitment to focus on the
diverse needs of RTD stakeholders is further evidenced by departmental efforts to engage in more
community policing efforts and to increase recruiting; these efforts have led to our continuous growth
since the October 2023 report.
For example, since August 2022, as RTD-PD became more visibly diverse and embraced all tenets of
diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB), by committing to the “30 by 30 Pledge” (a national
initiative to recruit and retain additional women in policing careers), overall interest in employment with
RTD-PD has increased. This rapid increase has been a testament to the agency’s internal cooperation,
enabling RTD to process applicants faster, to conduct robust interviews with candidates, and complete
background investigations within more efficient timeframes than other metro-area law enforcement
competitors.
As RTD-PD continues to transition towards a majority sworn police workforce, it is becoming better
positioned to:
• Nurture community relationships
• Mitigate conditions conducive to crime, and

Packet Pg. 9

1.E.1

•

Expand its capacity to serve those with mental health, addiction, and housing struggles without
over-criminalizing non-chronic offenders.

In short, the agency’s commitment to addressing People Power in terms of police hiring promotes a
tangible reinvestment in public safety resources, further demonstrating to employees and customers the
importance RTD places upon their perceptions of public safety in the transit environment. When the
same persons hired enforce laws and Respect the Ride tenets in a firm, fair, and professional manner, it
adds to the likelihood that RTD meets the diverse needs of all stakeholders.
Information about RTD-PD careers, including career maps, salary and benefits is available on RTD’s
website at the following address: https://www.rtd-denver.com/rider-info/more-rider-info/safety-andsecurity/transit-police-careers
Welcoming Transit Environment
Recent accomplishments in overall applying Evidence Based Policing to affect crime, are highly positive
indicators of the efficacy of the approach recommended by the peer review panel and have enabled the
RTD-PD command staff to engage in more creative deployment strategies to address crimes and aberrant
behaviors.
An example is the consistent decrease in crime trends reported in targeted areas like Denver Union
Station (DUS) and parking facilities. The decrease in criminal incidents at DUS demonstrates how a
strategic and intentional reinvestment into personnel in the form of transitioning away from contracted
security guards to sworn police officers and upgrades to the hardware and use of technology in facilities
benefits the agency, its employees, and customers.
Capital Improvements
Along with the reinvestment in People Power previously cited, another strategic objective is the pending
purchase of technological capital improvement products that will replace end-of-life Records
Management System (RMS) and Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) platforms, respectively. The evidencebased policing enhancements they will bring help RTD-PD get Back to Basics. The procurement of new
CAD and RMS platforms facilitates precision in deployment, creates efficiencies in dispatching, and
augments the ability for all sworn staff to analyze and adapt to trending crimes.
