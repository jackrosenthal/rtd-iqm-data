BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: July 13, 2017

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

July 12, 2017

Board Meeting Date: July 25, 2017

Subject:

Enter into a Contract with RouteMatch for
MDT and On-Board Software for Access-a-Ride

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
for computerized Mobile Data Terminals (MDTs) and onboard software with RouteMatch Software, Inc.
(RouteMatch) (Contract Number 17DH025) for an amount not to exceed $1,800,000. The price
includes MDTs, software, implementation and three years of extended support.
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Access-a-Ride paratransit service provides transportation in the Denver metro area for people
whose disabilities prevent them from using lift-equipped fixed-route bus service. Access-a-Ride service
uses vehicles equipped with RouteMatch software and iPilot 8000 computerized Mobile Data Terminals
(MDTs) and associated onboard equipment that enables dispatching and communications via the
RouteMatch paratransit scheduling and central dispatch software (‘RouteMatch central software’). The
current MDTs entered service in 2009 and reached end of useful life several years ago. The current
MDT’s have very high failure rates and are hard to procure. Consequently, it is imperative that the MDTs
be replaced with modern equipment in order to provide Access-a-Ride drivers with the necessary tools to
provide this important service.
DISCUSSION
RTD currently utilizes paratransit scheduling software produced by “RouteMatch.” It is necessary that
the on-board software loaded on the MDT’s integrate with the backend RouteMatch software in order to
allow Access-a-ride drivers to receive accurate information to perform their duties. Onboard software
that integrates with the RouteMatch central software is already developed.
RTD conducted an evaluation of the various options to replace the existing Access-a-Ride Mobile Data
Terminals. The option with the quickest deployment, least risk and lowest cost is to have RouteMatch
deploy new modern versions of the computerized MDTs with onboard software. Requiring RouteMatch
to provide the updated hardware and software, perform the integration and thus provide the complete
solution to modernize the Access-a-Ride MDT’s will speed the process by providing fewer procurements
and result in a single point of contact for RTD to have one vendor responsible for all of the functionality
associated with the upgrade of the Access-a-Ride MDT’s.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project is included in the adopted RTD budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with RouteMatch to provide
computerized MDTs and onboard software. This is the recommended alternative.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

2. Continue to t r y t o provide remedial repairs to extend the system life. This is not a sustainable
option and does not provide the upgrades necessary for Access-a-Ride drivers to perform their duties.
This is not recommended.
3. Proceed with an entirely new procurement for a new paratransit scheduling software package and
integrated MDT’s. This would take well over a year to procure and deploy the chosen system and is
not budgeted. This is not recommended.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

Date:

July 12, 2017

Board Meeting Date: July 25, 2017

Subject:

Enter into a Contract with INIT for Automatic
Passenger Counters for Light Rail Vehicles

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
for purchase, installation and maintenance of Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs) with INIT
Innovations in Transportation, Inc. (INIT) (Contract Number 17DH026) for an amount not to exceed
$2,400,000 and transfer up to $950,000 from project 10444 (Mobile Data Terminals) to project 10345
(New Automatic Passenger Counter).
BACKGROUND
RTD uses APC’s on light rail vehicles to monitor on-time performance and to gather ridership
information. The data collected by the APCs is ingested into the INIT Computer Aided Dispatch/
Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) system for compilation, presentation, and analysis of ridership
numbers and on-time performance calculations. This data is key for required federal reporting,
operational considerations and planning. Currently, only 42 of the 201 vehicle LRV fleet (24%) are
equipped with APC’s making it very difficult to provide statistically valid information.
DISCUSSION
RTD recently purchased hardware for the Access-a-Ride Mobile Data Terminal (MDT) Replacement
project. Staff subsequently determined that the equipment could be better utilized on the LRV fleet to
expand the number of APC equipped light rail cars to help with passenger count and on-time
performance measurement. A less expensive alternative for the Access-a-Ride MDT Replacement Project
has been identified and pursued, freeing up some funds that can be transferred to purchase additional
APCs for light rail.
RTD currently has an authorized and budgeted project (Project 10345 -New Auto Passenger Counters) to
begin to upgrade and expand the number of APC’s on the LRV fleet. Utilizing some of the hardware that
had already been purchased for the Access-a-Ride MDT project and transferring the remaining funds
from the MDT project will allow RTD to expand the scope of the currently budgeted LRV APC project
and further increase the number of Light Rail Vehicles that can be equipped with new APC equipment.
By using some of this equipment and transferring these additional funds, the APC coverage on the LRV
fleet can be increased to over 70%. This will allow for easier and more timely compilation of
statistically valid data for monitoring on-time performance and for gathering ridership data for internal
and external reporting. This equipment will be upgraded for both reliability and for security of data
transmissions over Wi-Fi. This will be a sole source contract to INIT in order to expand the number of
APC equipped light rail vehicles with technology similar to and compatible with the technology that is
utilized on the existing LRV fleet.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project (Project 10345- New Automatic Passenger Counters) is included in the adopted RTD
budget. The transfer of up to $950,000 from project 10444- Mobile Data Terminals, also included in the
adopted RTD budget, to project 10345 will fund the requested expansion of this effort.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a
contract for purchase, installation and maintenance of Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs) with INIT
Innovations in Transportation, Inc. (INIT) (Contract Number 17DH026) for an amount not to exceed
$2,400,000 and transfer up to $950,000 from project 10444 (Mobile Data Terminals) to project 10345
(New Automatic Passenger Counter). This is the recommended alternative.
2. Continue to try to utilize existing resources and provide minimal expansion and upgrade to the
existing APC’s. This does not leverage the existing hardware purchase and minimizes improvements in
data collection and service monitoring and is not the recommended alternative.

November 2017 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required, for information only. The following service change proposal will be publicized
through direct customer information.
DISCUSSION
We are proposing an additional service change period to introduce the newly renovated Civic Center
Station, as a means of clearly communicating with our customers and providing accurate data for our
public information systems. The expected completion of the station is in November 2017, which would
end the detours Civic Center Stations services have been on since July 2016. This service change will
be focused on the routes in the Civic Center Station area only, directly affecting the following route
services:
0L, 3L, 16, 16L, 83D/83L, 87L, 90L, 100L, 116X, 122X, CV/CS/CX, EV/ES/EX, Free Metro Ride, FF4,
P, RC/RX.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There are no anticipated cost impacts expected at this time.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

July 13, 2017

Subject:

Resolution to Approve Refinancing for Interest
Savings

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: July 13, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: July 25, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the execution and delivery by
the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and related documents in connection with the partial refinancing
of the 2010A and 2015A Certificates of Participation.
In 2010, RTD issued its Series 2010A certificates of participation (COPs) to finance 55 new Siemens
light rail vehicles, 95 access-a-Ride vehicles, 32 Call-n-Ride vehicles, fare boxes and CAD/AVL
equipment. The 2010A COPs also refinanced the 1998A and 2001A COPs for interest expense savings.
The 2010A COPs were originally issued in the amount of $312, 900,000. The COPs are callable at par
on November 1, 2020 and final payment is scheduled to occur in 2040 and the interest rate being paid
ranges from 5.0% - 5.5%.
In 2015, RTD issued its Series 2015A certificates of participation (COPs) to finance 29 new Siemens
light rail vehicles, 179 40’ transit buses, 18 60’ articulated buses, and 7 mall shuttle buses. The 2015A
COPs were originally issued in the amount of $193,915,000. The COPs are partially ($65,000,000)
callable at par on June 1, 2020 and partially ($258,915,000) callable at par on June 1, 2025. Final
payment is scheduled to occur in 2040 and the interest rate being paid ranges from 3.25% - 5.0%.
The approaching call dates and current low interest rate environment have created an opportunity to
refinance portions of the 2010A and 2015A COPs to realize a reduction in interest expense while
keeping the 2020 call date.
DISCUSSION:
RTD has the potential to advance-refund a portion of remaining outstanding Series 2010A and 2015A
COPs to realize, subject to market movement, a savings of approximately $13.6 million (4.35% of
principal of refunded COPs) between 2018 and 2025. RTD Board Policy and the Resolution require a
minimum of 3% savings which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between
now and the date the new interest rate is locked.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that such savings are net of
a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the new financing at a return equal to the
interest expense of the new financing, and (b) the length of time between the execution of the new
financing and the November 1, 2020 and June 1, 2020 call dates of the 2010A and 2015A COPs

Packet Pg. 10

2.B.1

(negative arbitrage). Absent a change in interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage
of time, due to a reduction in time proceeds of the new financing must be invested prior to redeeming
the 2010A and 2015A COPs. Despite the cost associated with the negative arbitrage, the potential
savings from a refunding of the 2010A and 2015A COPs exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding
by RTD. Consequently, staff has assembled a financing team and commenced documentation to be in a
position to take advantage of the opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest expense.
RTD typically uses COPs to finance vehicles when the budget cannot accommodate the use of cash to
acquire the necessary vehicles, as was the case in 2010 and 2015. In this case, staff received an
attractive proposal from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. who is in the pre-selected investment bank pool for
the use of lease financing to refinance the Series 2010A and 2015A Certificates of Participation. As a
response to this proposal, staff engaged RTD’s financial advisor to determine if the proposal was a
better value to RTD than issuing certificates of participation. It was determined that the JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. proposal offered the most value to RTD.
Benefits of the JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. proposal include interest rates competitive with a COP
refinancing of the 2010A and 2015A COPs, the ability to keep the call option for RTD in 2020 as is
currently the case with the 2015A COPs and the ability to avoid the cost of obtaining credit ratings.
The Board is being requested through the Resolution to authorize the partial refinancing of the Series
2010A and 2015A COPs through an annually appropriated capital lease through JP Morgan Chase Bank
N.A.
Drafts of documents including the Lease Purchase Agreement, Escrow Agreement, Purchase and
Assignment Agreement are available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company as independent financial advisors and Butler
Snow LLP as Bond Counsel, in regard to the transaction. The lender in this transaction will be JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds. These costs include financial advisory, attorney and miscellaneous costs. The final payment
year of the new financing will not exceed 2025, the final payment year of the existing Series 2010A and
2015A COPs that are being refinanced.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of 2017,
authorizing the execution and delivery by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and related
documents in connection with the refinancing of the 2010A and 2015A certificates of
participation. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents; including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2017 authorizing the execution and delivery by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and
related documents in connection with the refinancing of the 2010A and 2015A certificates of
participation. This is not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the interest
expense savings currently available to the district.

Section 6.
No General Obligation Debt. No provision of this Resolution, the
Lease or the Assignment Agreement shall be construed as creating or constituting a general
obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within
the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision, nor a mandatory charge or requirement
against the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year. The District
shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to the Assignment Agreement except
in connection with the payment of the Base Rentals (as defined in the Lease) and certain other
payments under the Lease, which payments may be terminated by the District in accordance with
the provisions of the Lease. Neither the Lease nor the Assignment Agreement shall constitute a
mandatory charge or requirement of the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then
current fiscal year or constitute or give rise to a general obligation or other indebtedness or
multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within the meaning of any constitutional
or statutory debt limitation and shall not constitute a multiple fiscal year direct or indirect
District debt or other financial obligation whatsoever. No provision of the Lease or the
Assignment Agreement shall be construed or interpreted as creating an unlawful delegation of
governmental powers nor as a donation by or a lending of the credit of the District within the
meaning of Sections 1 or 2 of Article XI of the Colorado Constitution. Neither the Lease nor the
Assignment Agreement shall directly or indirectly obligate the District to make any payments
beyond those budgeted and appropriated for the District’s then current fiscal year.
Section 7.
Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized
pursuant to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair rental value of the 2017A Leased Property and do
not exceed a reasonable amount so as to place the District under an economic compulsion to
renew the Lease or to exercise its option to purchase the 2017A Leased Property pursuant to the
Lease. The Board hereby determines and declares that the period during which the District has
an option to purchase the 2017A Leased Property (i.e., the entire maximum term of the Lease)
does not exceed the useful life of the 2017A Leased Property.
Section 8.
Exercise of Option; Direction to 2010 Trustee. In the event that
the General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer determines to proceed with the refunding of
a portion of the 2010A Certificates and executes a Sale Certificate in accordance with the

Information

The Smart Card Program is an Electronic Fare Collection and Payment System designed to increase fare
payment convenience for our customers, reduce and optimize fare collection costs for the agency and
reduce fraud associated with paper based fare media. The contract was signed with Xerox Transport
Solutions, Inc. (now Conduent) in mid-2010. A smart card is a plastic card which customers load and
reload RTD fare products. There are currently 4 products; EcoPass, CollegePass, Neighborhood EcoPass
and MyRide Stored Value available on the smart card.
All bus installations are complete for operational service. Additional validators will be installed as buses
are purchased.
Additional platform validators were installed for the University of Colorado A Line, B Line to Westminster
and R Line to Aurora. More platform validators will be installed on the G Line to Wheat Ridge. 191
Light and Commuter Rail platform validators have been installed and are operational.
The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass and Neighborhood EcoPass customers on
January 1, 2013. There are approximately 475,000 active cards in circulation. During the month of
June 2017, 1.2M taps were recorded.
Starting the morning of January 4, 2016 MyRide Stored Value cards were dispersed to the public pilot
program participants at the RTD retail outlets. On Wednesday May 17, 2017, the MyRide portal went
live to the pilot participants and on May 24, 2017, the portal was launched to the general public. As of
June 2017, approximately 5,000 cards were issued, of which 4,000 (80%) were full fare cards and
1,000 (20%) were discount cards. The average stored value loaded (initial purchases and reloads) was
$45.45, with a total value loaded of $611,500. There were 159,500 trips taken using these MyRide
cards with a fare payment value of over $451,200. Of these trips; 71% were local, 26% regional and
3% airport.
MyRide Stored Value Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public through the MyRide
web portal. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar amount on the
card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card online, at RTD sales
outlets and at Retail outlets (Safeway and King Soopers). As of June 1, 2017, customers can load cash
value onto MyRide cards at 50 Safeway retail stores. As of July 1, 2017, customers can load cash
value onto MyRide cards at 86 King Soopers retail stores.
As of January 1, 2017, Xerox Transport Solutions, Inc. separated its Business Process Services Unit into
an independent public company called Conduent. Xerox will be referred to as Conduent.

Disaster Recovery environment
testing has identified issues and all
issues have been resolved.
RTD in active discussions with King
Soopers.
Equipment installation complete at
86 stores. Training underway.
Targeting training completion and
go-live by July 1, 2017.

Initial Disaster Recovery
testing is complete and
successful.
Plans are in development
to conduct a longer
Disaster Recovery test.
As of July 1st, 86 King
Soopers stores are live
and reloading MyRide
cards. No significant
issues have been
reported.
This activity is now
complete.

For a variety of reasons, there has
been a small percentage of cards in
circulation that requires an
administrative action to extend
their usability. Remediation was
made to some of these cards in
March 2016 which yielded positive
results. Challenges continue to
remain and for this reason, the
status is shown as yellow.

RTD and Conduent
continue to monitor.
Issues are documented
and reviewed weekly
with the Conduent
Technical Team.
