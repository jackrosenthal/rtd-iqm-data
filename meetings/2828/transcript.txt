GM Oversight & Performance Management
JEFF WALKER: --talk about [INAUDIBLE] now, since we've been talking about.
So I was holding out for a few minutes until Ms. Catlin, who said that she plans to show up,
arrives. But she's not here yet. I have 3:04.
JUDY LUBOW: Isn't Claudia coming? She was here.
JOHN MCKAY: She's here. She's just in the back office on a phone call.
JUDY LUBOW: Oh, OK.
JEFF WALKER: So I have 3:04 on this. I have 3:01 on that. So let's -DOUG TISDALE: Yes, it's 3:04, yeah. Do we know who's on the phone, if anyone?
JEFF WALKER: There is no one on the phone. We haven't started the meeting yet.
So we have a quorum. So let's call the meeting to order.
JUDY LUBOW: Does Claudia know the meeting has started?
JEFF WALKER: It's 3:00. She can show up whenever. We have a quorum.
So I'm calling the meeting to order. I'm Jeff Walker. I am the chair of the General Manager
Oversight and Performance Management Committee. We'll go around the table first, so anybody
on the phone or anybody listening in can get a check on our voices, and then put a voice to the
person. And then we'll see if anybody's joined us on the phone.
So this is Jeff Walker, chair of the committee. We'll start to my right.
LARRY HOY: Larry Hoy, member of the committee.
JUDY LUBOW: Judy Lubow, non-member.
DAVID GENOVA: Dave Genova.
BOB BROOM: Bob Broom, member.
KEN MIHALIK: Ken Mihalik, member.
JOHN MCKAY: John McKay, Board Office Administrator.

NATALIE MENTEN: Natalie Menten, Board Member with General Manager Oversight.
DOUG TISDALE: Doug Tisdale, member of the committee.
JEFF WALKER: All right. Thank you. And is anyone on the phone?
[PHONE RINGING]
JOHN MCKAY: Yeah. We never dialed in because of the topic of the meeting.
JEFF WALKER: OK. I was just wondering because we haven't done it yet.
JOHN MCKAY: Well, we haven't even started the phone call. So there's no phone-- no one has
dialed, or we haven't even opened up the bridge for it.
DOUG TISDALE: We have not opened up the portal for anyone yet to dial in, which now would
be an appropriate time to do?
JOHN MCKAY: Given that we will be shortly going into Executive Session, not knowing who
might be on the other end of the line, it is advisable not to do so.
DOUG TISDALE: Oh. No, I was thinking that would it be-- and forgive me, it's a question, if I
may, Mr. Chair.
JEFF WALKER: Please.
DOUG TISDALE: Just for the sake of the record, opening up the phone line, allowing someone
to dial in, and then terminating that call if the motion for Executive Session should pass. It may
not.
JEFF WALKER: So we'll wait for the dial in, see if anybody is there. And then if we go into
Executive Session-AUTOMATED OPERATOR: [TELEPHONE SOUNDS] RTD's voice conferencing. Thank you.
[TELEPHONE KEY PAD SOUNDS]
JUDY LUBOW: Oh, mother.
AUTOMATED OPERATOR: Thank you. Please hold to enter your conference. If you are the
first caller, you will hear silence until others join.
JOHN MCKAY: Is anyone on the line?
BOB BROOM: Just the Russians.
[LAUGHTER]

JEFF WALKER: OK. So I will read a motion. I'll look for-- well, I'll read some words. I'll look
for a motion to the effect of what I read, the second. And if it passes, then we'll terminate the
phone call if anybody is on there that hasn't spoken, all right?
OK. So the Chair asks for a motion pursuant to Colorado Revised Statute Section 24-6-402(4)(e),
paren,-- I think that's 1, Roman numeral one-- for the GMOC to enter into Executive Session for
a discussion determining positions relative to matters that may be subject to negotiations,
developing strategy for negotiations, and instructing negotiators. The particular matter that is to
be discussed in this Executive Session is potential negotiation of changes to that certain
executive employment agreement dated-KATE WILLIAMS: Hello. Can I sit in? I promise to be quiet.
JEFF WALKER: Sure.
KATE WILLIAMS: I could lie, but-JEFF WALKER: --executive employment agreement dated effective as of January 1, 2016
between the Regional Transportation District and David Genova, the current General Manager
and Chief Executive Officer of the Regional Transportation District.
May I have a motion?
BOB BROOM: So moved.
JEFF WALKER: I have a first.
JUDY LUBOW: Second.
JEFF WALKER: I have a second. I have a second. The mover is Director Broom. The second is
Director-- oh, she's-JUDY LUBOW: Lubow.
JEFF WALKER: I'm sorry.
JUDY LUBOW: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
JEFF WALKER: I'm sorry. So we have a-LARRY HOY: It's OK. Let it go.
JEFF WALKER: It's one big family. And I have a second from Director Hoy. Any discussion?
OK. Let's move through a vote. All those in favor.

UNISON: Aye.
NATALIE MENTEN: Reluctantly, yes.
JEFF WALKER: Any opposed?
[PHONE RINGING]
All right. With that, we will move into Executive Session. We'll kill the phone call. And I'll ask
Mr. Genova to excuse himself. Thank you for your attendance, at this point.
DAVID GENOVA: Thank you.
KATE WILLIAMS: It's the city and county [INAUDIBLE].
[LAUGHTER]
JUDY LUBOW: You didn't have to whisper.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JEFF WALKER: All right. All right. Let's keep moving. We can get out of here early. Let's see, I
am verifying that everybody
[AUDIO OUT]
LARRY HOY: [INAUDIBLE] buttons, technical buttons here.
NATALIE MENTEN: And I motion that we adjourn.
JEFF WALKER: Just a second.
LARRY HOY: We have to [INAUDIBLE].
JUDY LUBOW: No, we have something to do.
NATALIE MENTEN: We do. Now we talk about the negotiators.
JEFF WALKER: Are we back recording or --- ? OK, so we are now recording on open session
again. OK.
So we have exited Executive Session. We're now in open session. Can you read those parameters
again, so we have it in open session? Do you have those-DOUG TISDALE: No, we don't give the parameters in the open session. Because that would
reveal our negotiating strategy.

LARRY HOY: So maybe somebody that is not going to be a negotiator would want to make a
motion that says that this committee ought to appoint two members from this committee for the
purposes of negotiating-- let me back-- for the purposes of exploring a potential new contract
with the General Manager. And I would go further and pick Jeff Walker-JUDY LUBOW: Eenie, meanie, miney, moe.
LARRY HOY: --and Chairman Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Subject to and consistent with the parameters discussed during the course of
the Executive Session?
LARRY HOY: Absolutely. I was just going to add that to my motion.
NATALIE MENTEN: Discussion?
LARRY HOY: We have to have a second.
DOUG TISDALE: Second.
NATALIE MENTEN: Uh, I wanted to make a nomination. Can't we have two?
LARRY HOY: Well, I think we'll have to either vote this up or down.
JEFF WALKER: And so if this passes-LARRY HOY: And then we can do it again with different names.
JEFF WALKER: If it fails, then we [INAUDIBLE].
OK. So we have a motion and a second to-NATALIE MENTEN: Oh, do I get discussion?
JUDY LUBOW: Yes.
JEFF WALKER: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't see your hand.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yes. So the basis upon it being two people is to ensure that open meeting
is not triggered. But is there anything that prevents more than two negotiators who still use the
same open records laws and say it's an Executive Session with Dave?
BOB BROOM: What? I didn't understand.
JUDY LUBOW: Yeah.

NATALIE MENTEN: It's mainly basically saying there's more than two negotiators. And you
use Executive Session. There's nothing that prevents that. Because that's just what we did.
DOUG TISDALE: If I may, the one condition that would be imposed is you then impose a 24hour notice requirement for posting of the meeting with the Executive Session as part of it.
So, yes, I agree with you that yes, you could, in fact, have three negotiators. And it would have
to be, every time they meet would have to be posted as a meeting. And then it would have to be
posted with a notation that it was an Executive Session for negotiations. Actually, I'm not sure
exactly how it is to be phrased, and we'd have to get legal counsel to opine on that. But I think
that, I believe that, yes, the possibility exists.
Now an easy fix to that could be that the motion be, and should General Counsel agree that
proper notice and Executive Session language could be adopted, that a third negotiator be
appointed. And the third negotiator being axed again. I do not fill in blanks.
LARRY HOY: I'd just as soon have my-- I mean, I guess I could call it into question, but I'm not.
But I would like to just have us vote on my motion up or down.
JEFF WALKER: So we have a motion, a second, discussion. Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: Would it make me limit it to three? Would it need to be limit to even three?
JOHN MCKAY: No.
JEFF WALKER: No.
JOHN MCKAY: It would not. It could be five.
DOUG TISDALE: I think you could argue that it wouldn't have to be.
KEN MIHALIK: Good.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
NATALIE MENTEN: It's good to have a odd number. That's about the only thing.
JUDY LUBOW: Well, we're certainly odd.
[LAUGHTER]
NATALIE MENTEN: And I think that's a easy way to do it, just posting that it's an Executive
Session.
LARRY HOY: It's not very nimble and we don't have a lot of time.

DOUG TISDALE: It is not very nimble. That's true. It's possible it can be done. But it's not very
nimble.
JUDY LUBOW: How do you feel?
NATALIE MENTEN: There are some people who are advocates for government not being
nimble when it happens to be behind.
LARRY HOY: And there are some that say it shouldn't happen in Executive Session.
JUDY LUBOW: Well, can we just check it out with legal before we vote?
JEFF WALKER: I wouldn't want to negotiate with three people, by myself.
DOUG TISDALE: I think at that point, you're kind of inviting different dynamics. But we have
to take a vote at some point.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JEFF WALKER: So we have a motion. We have a second. Any further discussion? Let's vote.
All those in favor.
UNISON: Aye.
NATALIE MENTEN: No. No.
JEFF WALKER: All right. We have 5-4. All those opposed.
NATALIE MENTEN: No.
DOUG TISDALE: OK, two and-KEN MIHALIK: I didn't vote. Clarification. Was that with the additional language that you hadDOUG TISDALE: He did not agree to that. So it was just the-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
DOUG TISDALE: No, I'm sorry. The additional language relative to a third negotiator being
appointed. He did not agree to that. The motion, as I understand it, Mr. Chairman, is relative to
the appointment of two negotiators to negotiate pursuant to those parameters which negotiators
then are subject to and consistent with the requirements of that discussion to report back to the
GMOC. Then the GMOC to report back to the board. Then, if there is approval by the board, that
it come back for final execution of an agreement that comes back to the GMOC and then goes
back to the board.

Because there has been confusion in the past about how many bites at the apple. And I want it
clear on this record and every other record, there are at least five-- and I think I got it up to six or
seven now.
JUDY LUBOW: We all have to use the restroom. We've got to cut this-LARRY HOY: So our motion passed.
NATALIE MENTEN: No, it didn't.
JUDY LUBOW: It did not past. He didn't vote.
DOUG TISDALE: I vote in favor.
JUDY LUBOW: He voted no.
DOUG TISDALE: He votes in favor. He votes in favor. He votes in favor.
NATALIE MENTEN: So we had a 4-3 vote.
JUDY LUBOW: 4-3.
DOUG TISDALE: OK, is it a-NATALIE MENTEN: For the record-LARRY HOY: You didn't vote.
DOUG TISDALE: OK. That's fine then.
JEFF WALKER: I'm sorry, yours-KEN MIHALIK: Was a no.
JEFF WALKER: No, OK.
SPEAKER 2: That means team up again, huh?
NATALIE MENTEN: So for the record, we had Mihalik, Menten, Deadwyler voting no. Broom,
Tisdale, Hoy, Walker in favor of two negotiators.
JUDY LUBOW: Naming who they are.
NATALIE MENTEN: Which have been chosen per your motion, as Director Walker and Chair
Tisdale.

SPEAKER 1: And three people voted no.
NATALIE MENTEN: And three people voted no.
DOUG TISDALE: With there being no prohibition, as I heard the motion, of those directors
from engaging in discussions with each director to get their sense of how to proceed. I saw
nothing in the motion that precludes that.
NATALIE MENTEN: I agree. This is-- [INAUDIBLE]. We don't have any blood on the floor
here.
DOUG TISDALE: I don't think so.
NATALIE MENTEN: And I was being like funny.
Inject a little humor. I've been in some recent things where there's been blood.
JEFF WALKER: Are there any other matter-- hold on, Hoy, because we're going to lose a-DOUG TISDALE: I move to adjourn.
JEFF WALKER: OK.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yeah, and don't speak out. We might pull something, you know. Never
know, man.
JEFF WALKER: All right. Motion to adjourn, meeting adjourned. Thank you all for your time
and attention and for the discussion item. I appreciate every word.
