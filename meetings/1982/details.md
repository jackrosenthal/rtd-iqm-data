## II. November Board Meeting Agenda Review

Committee Chair Sisk asked AGM Genova to review the November Board agenda.  All of the action items had passed committee and not foreseeing any problems.

Motion:                            Director James made the motion to move the                                                                                     agenda to the full Board for November 25,                                                                                     2014.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:                            Chair Sisk asked AGM Genova if we were                                                                                     anticipating any problems on the unanimous                                                                                     consent items. He noted some of the discussion                                                                                     under recommended action about the local                                                                                     government liaison services where some Board                                                                                     members had expressed concern about Roger                                                                                     Sherman leaving.  Director Sisk requested AGM                                                                                     Genova to send the response of the question of                                                                                     cost breakdown on the Boulder Transit Village to                                                                       the full Board.

Pertaining to the 2015 proposed internal audit                                                                                     plan, Chair Sisk expressed it was inappropriate                                                                                     to request an audit of Civil Rights; we will                                                                                     continue to be vigilant regardless; As Directors,                                                                                     we were provided the opportunity to provide                                                                                     input.  We should not highlight Civil Rights any                                                                                     more than any other area. We need to rely on                                                                                     our professional staff.

Director Bagley added that the comment that we                                                                       should have been proactive is bogus and not                                                                                     appropriate.  Chair Sisk agreed.

Vote on the

Motion:                            The motion passed with the full commitment in                                                                                     favor.

## III. Other Matters

- Director Bagley shared that he will be on vacation next week and will not be at the meeting.  He asked Chair Sisk if he wanted Director Anderson to provide an update from the GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee in his stead.  He went on to provide this update:  The Committee had met last Tuesday and approved the ratings for the 10 core and task goals.  Seven of the goals were rated as exceed expectations and three were rated as achieved goal.  Directors Walker, Tobiassen and Folska had also participated. A discussion was held on the Discretionary Performance Payout as provided in the GM’s contract. Last year he had received 8-1/2%; this year the recommended percent is 7% or about $20K.  There will be an Executive Session at the December 16 meeting where the full Board can weigh in on the General Manager’s performance. Any dissenting report can also be made at that time.

Chair Sisk commended Director Bagley for the fine job he is doing with this               GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee. He noted that               while unanimity may not have been achieved, it is important that we operate               with civility. Director Bagley responded it is his honor to serve.  Directors               Hoy and Tobiassen echoed their sentiments that Director Bagley is doing a               great job.  Director Tobiassen reflected on the past history as to why it is               important that we follow a structured process. Chair Sisk stated that no               report will be necessary for the December 16 meeting.

- Paula Perdue shared that in planning for the 2015 Board calendar, she has noticed a particular conflict between the week that we have scheduled the joint board-staff advance (March 7) and the start of the APTA Legislative conference.  She asked how did they want to resolve this.  After some discussion, it was tentatively decided to move the joint strategic advance to the weekend of March 21, 2015.

- Paula Perdue shared that we have invited the grand winners of the Youth Art Program to our December 16 meeting.  We have also extended the invitation to the superintendents of Aurora and Cherry Creek Schools as well as the principals and Mayors for the area.  We are awaiting confirmation from all but the response has been very positive.  We will present the schools with a framed copy of the artwork.

Chair Sisk indicated that Director Folska and Paula should be a part of that               presentation.  Paula added that the Marketing Group has done an               outstanding job in moving this project ahead and in the actual coordination               with the schools.

- Director James shared that he had attended a symposium dealing with sustainable community initiative which had about 70-80 city planners and others in attendance. There was lots of conversation about FasTracks and the city planning efforts.  He also shared that at another event, Denver Association of Business Economists, Miller Hudson had shared information on the I-70 project with Maglev.  He will email a copy of the survey to the Board members for some interesting read.

- Director Walker shared that he had attended a candidate forum in his district for the City Council. He had asked them what were the top issues evolving and they stated that transit was the number 1 concern.

- Director James shared that at the Symposium, the “Last mile, first mile” discussion was prominent. Cities are including this in their thinking.

- Director Hoy emphasized that he would like to see the net proceeds from the Citibank bonds to go to the FISA account.  He stated we have precedence for this.  Director James added it is important that we get the most possible PR from our efforts.  The decision making process will be just as important as where and how the money is spent.

- Chair Sisk shared he was on his way to the Transportation Matters Summit where Bill Van Meter was presenting.  He heard this was a sold-out event of about 450 people.

- Chair Sisk threw a ball in the air and shared his desire to have a dinner or event to invite all former Board members to the table. This would be a social event with a chance to thank them. Some of the other members thought it was a good idea.

- AGM Genova spoke about the opening at RIO Court and the plaque dedication.  Director James added this is a god story of how we can assess our own inventory for acquisition properties that could be re-used or work for us.  This is all part of asset management and state of good repair

- Chair Sisk encouraged the Board members to attend the CMRF event.
