DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 13

2.12.A

The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2015 Recommended Budget (combined Base
and FasTracks) is $1,385.5 million. This includes an operating expense budget of $518.5 million,
interest expense of $97.5 million, capitalized interest of $45.0 million, new capital expenditures of
$555.4 million, debt payments of $62.5 million, FasTracks contingency reserve of $30.0 million,
FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $18.4 million, Board appropriated fund of $26.4 million,
capital replacement fund of $19.2 million, and estimated unrestricted fund balance of $12.7 million.
The previously approved capital (capital carry forward) is $1,303.1 million. The sum of the budget
appropriation and capital carry forward is $2,688.6 million.
Overview of the 2015 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $963.9 million on a combined basis are expected to decrease $12.2 million (1.2%) in
2015 from the 2014 Amended Budget. The decline is composed primarily of a decrease in fare
revenue for West Line of $1.6 million, a decrease in grant revenue of $34.3 million, and a decrease
in other income of $9.7 million, offset by an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $31.7 million and
an increase in investment income of $1.9 million.
Combined farebox revenues are budgeted to decrease $1.6 million or 1.3% based on a decline in
West Line farebox revenues in 2015 per the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation. Total Base
System grants are projected to increase $2.5 million over the 2014 Amended Budget, including new
and carry forward amounts. Drawdowns on Base System grants are estimated to total $85.7 million
in 2014 while new and carryforward grant funding of $119.6 million is projected for 2015.
FasTracks grants are budgeted to decrease $36.7 million from the 2014 Amended Budget due to
decreases primarily in West Corridor New Starts grants and CMAQ grants on Eagle and US36. Other
income will decrease $9.7 million due to the non-recurrence of DUS property sales in 2014. Sales
and use tax revenues of $535.1 million in 2015 are expected to increase 5.9% over the 2014
projected level according to the most recent September quarterly forecast by the CU-Leeds School of
Business. Investment income is budgeted to increase $1.9 million from higher investable balances.
Operating expenditures on a combined basis in 2015 are budgeted $24.7 million lower compared to the
2014 Amended Budget. The decrease is due to: 1) completion of FasTracks expense projects, primarily
the US-36/CDOT managed lanes carryforward project, 2) higher capitalization of FasTracks project
salaries, and 3) decline in contract maintenance in FasTracks due to project completion, carryforward, or
expense/capital transfers, offset by: 5) a $1.2 million increase in FasTracks Operations allocated costs
for Denver Union Station and the Free Metro Ride, and 6) expense projects carry-forward from 2014
totaling $33.0 million. The expense project carryforward to 2015 is $15.1 million for Base operations
and $17.9 million for FasTracks Project.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at the lock price of $2.95 per gallon, compared to a price of $3.12 per gallon in
the 2014 Amended Budget, for a savings of $1.7 million. Gasoline is budgeted at $3.40/gallon, for a
$239,000 savings from both the 2014 Amended Budget and first draft Requested Budget in which the
budgeted price was $3.54/gallon.
The major changes in operating expense comparing the Recommended Budget to the previous Requested
Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the Requested Budget are the
expense projects carry-forward.

Packet Pg. 14

2.12.A

Interest expense in 2015 is budgeted at $97.5 million on a combined basis, an increase of $1.9 million
over the 2014 Amended Budget and remaining essentially flat. Of total interest expense, $26.5 million
is budgeted for Base System and $71.0 million is budgeted for FasTracks. Capitalized interest
(combined) is budgeted at $45.0 million for FasTracks only, unchanged from the 2014 Amended Budget.
Capitalized interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for interest payments in 2015.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $62.5 million, essentially unchanged from the 2014
Amended Budget. Base System principal payments of $53.7 million are $5.0 higher due to issuance
of Base System COPs for fleet purchases. FasTracks principal payments of $8.7 million are $4.8
million lower due to lower actual debt issued than was anticipated in 2014. Financing proceeds from
the issuance of new debt is budgeted at $333.4 million, consisting of $59.6 million for Base System
for COPs and $273.8 million for FasTracks, the latter made up of $198.8 million for future FasTracks
construction and $75.0 million in TIFIA loan draws for the Eagle Project construction. Total debt
issued will be lower by $462.2 million from the 2014 Amended Budget primarily due to a decrease in
FasTracks debt issuance.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2014 (previously approved
capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2015. The capital carry-forward
will be $1,303.1 million made up of $237.7 million on the Base System and $1,065.4 million on
FasTracks.
New capital spending on a combined basis will decrease $318.6 million from the 2014 Amended Budget
due mainly to project completion in FasTracks. New capital spending for FasTracks will decrease
$283.6 million to $460.9 million in 2015 due to on-going project completion on the East Line, US 36
BRT, North Metro and Northwest Rail, offset by increases to the Gold Line and the I-225 Corridor. For
the Base System, new capital spending will decrease $35.0 million to $94.5 million. Of this amount,
the Base system will spend $6.5 million less in park-n-Rides (primarily Stapleton) and $62.3 million less
on bus fleet modernization/expansion. These reductions will be offset by $11.7 million more on facilities
construction and maintenance (primarily Civic Center), $11.7 million more in capital support projects
(primarily IT support for the District), and $9.9 million more on LRT Transit (primarily rail cars). The Base
System new capital was approved as part of the Strategic Budget Plan in July 2014 with certain
adjustments brought forward and disclosed in the previous Requested Budget.
New capital expenditures for 2015 and the change in new capital in the 2015 Recommended Budget
over the previous 2015 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget Plan are shown in Attachment B. The
capital carry-forward expenditures for 2015 and the change in the capital carry-forward in the 2015
Recommended Budget over the 2014 Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.
Notable designated reserve fund changes include an increase over the 2014 Amended Budget in the
Base System year-end unrestricted fund balance, which is projected to increase $4.7 million to $8.5
million due to projected savings in diesel fuel and gasoline and an increase in carryforward grants. Also
on the Base System, the Board-appropriated fund is projected to increase by $3.0 million to $22.2
million, and the capital replacement fund is projected to increase by $3.0 million to $15.0 million.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to increase $3.4 million over the
2014 Amended Budget to $12.7 million. The $4.7 million increase in the Base System’s unrestricted
fund balance is offset by a decrease of $1.4 million on FasTracks. On a District-wide basis, both the
Board-appropriated fund and the capital replacement fund are projected to increase by $1.6 million each.

Packet Pg. 15

2.12.A

These increases are in minimum accordance with fiscal policies for each of the District entities (Base
System, FasTracks Projects, and FasTracks Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.
The FasTracks Construction Reserve at $100 million is split between the Construction Reserve at $60
million and a Start-up Operations Reserve at $40 million. The Start-up Operations Reserve was
established in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation for the years 2015-2016 in order to meet the
1.2x debt service coverage if needed. The 2015 budget reflects continued maintenance of the
FasTracks contingency reserve at a balance of $30 million.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2015 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly.
Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2015 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated fund, a
capital replacement fund, and an undesignated working capital fund (the remaining unrestricted year-end
fund balance) for both the Base System and FasTracks. The objective is for the total of these three
funds to equal approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for the Base
System and two months of same for FasTracks. The 2015 budget reflects continued maintenance of
the FasTracks contingency reserve at a balance of $30 million. This reserve has been carried at $30
million since 2010.
The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2015 on a District-wide basis is projected at $58.3
million, comprised of 1) the Board appropriated fund of $26.4 million, 2) the capital replacement fund of
$19.2 million, and 3) an undesignated working capital fund or remaining fund balance of $12.7 million.
The Base System portion of the three fund balances for 2015 is projected to total $45.7 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two
exceptions:


Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
 Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
 The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.
 Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2015 Recommended Budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Revise the 2015 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed revisions.
3. Do not adopt the 2015 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended since the District
will not be in compliance with State regulations that require the District to adopt a budget by
December 31, 2014. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2014, State
statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations and
maintenance purposes and objects is deemed reappropriated."

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: November 5, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 5, 2014

Board Meeting Date: November 25, 2014

Subject:

Budget Transfer for I-25 North Express Lanes
Extension and Express Bus Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the transfer of $375,000 from the Drivers Kiosk Replacement Project to fund the 2014 payment for the
IGA for the I-25 North Express Lanes Extension and Express Bus Project. Funding for the 2015 payment
will be provided in the 2015 Recommended Budget.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the 2014 goal of innovative and fiscally sustainable service delivery and the 2015
goal of improving service delivery.
In March 2012, the Board of Directors approved a commitment of $750,000 toward the local match for
CDOT’s I-25 North Express Lanes Extension Project. At the time, CDOT was in the process of
submitting a TIGER IV grant submission to fund this project, and requested that RTD contribute a portion
of the local match if CDOT were to receive the grant. RTD agreed to contribute $750,000 toward the
local match based on future operating cost savings on the bus routes currently operating on I-25
between US 36 and 120th Avenue, which would save travel time by using the express lanes. CDOT
received the TIGER grant in 2012, and the IGA obligating RTD for its contribution to the project is
effective November 22, 2014.
DISCUSSION
The I-25 North Express Lanes Extension Project will make efficient use of the existing highway
pavement by adding one additional express lane in each direction on I-25 between 120th Avenue on the
north to U.S. 36 on the south and would then connect to the existing managed lanes at U.S. 36 going
south into Denver. No additional right-of-way will be needed to implement this project. This project
represents a collaborative effort among CDOT, RTD, the Denver Regional Council of Governments,
several local jurisdictions and associated agencies in developing a cost-effective, near-term solution to
address the congestion on I-25.
The IGA is between RTD and the Colorado High Performance Transportation Enterprise (HPTE), a division
of CDOT. Like the previously signed US 36 IGA, the North I-25 IGA guarantees RTD travel times on the
managed lanes and commits that tolls during the peak hours will not be lower than corresponding RTD
fares.
CDOT started work on this project in October 2013, and expects the project to be completed in October
2015. Once this work is completed, several existing routes along the north I-25 corridor will benefit
from travel time savings by using the new express lanes. These routes include the 40X, 120X and
122X express routes, and the LNX and LSX branches of the regional route L.

2.13.B

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the 2014 payment would be provided through this budget transfer. Funding for the 2015
payment will be provided in the 2015 Recommended Budget. Once the project is open, RTD would
expect to see operating and maintenance cost savings of between $64,000 and $282,000 per year
depending on the revised schedules and resulting run cutting process.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $375,000 from the Drivers Kiosk Replacement
Project to fund the 2014 payment for the IGA for the I-25 North Express Lanes Extension and
Express Bus Project. Funding for the 2015 payment will be provided in the 2015 Recommended
Budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the transfer of funds. This is not
recommended because the IGA was executed per Board action. RTD would be in default to CDOT if
the transfer were not approved because RTD would not be able to pay the invoice due in 2014.

Subject:

Approval of Eleventh Year (2015) Contract
Amendment to Jacobs Engineering for
FasTracks
Program
Support
Consulting
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the eleventh year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in the
amount of $17,861,430 for Program Support Services Consulting for FasTracks for the year 2015.
Funds for the award are contained in the 2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital
program in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the 2015 goal of advancing and completing the FasTracks program.
On May 24, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to CarterBurgess (later purchased by Jacobs Engineering) for Program Support Consulting Services at an
initial 2005 Contract amount of $2,360,000, and a Notice to Proceed of July 5, 2005. The RTD
Board has approved subsequent contract amendments that have brought the current Contract Not to-Exceed price up to $150,982,726. The Contract Not-to-Exceed price through the end of 2015
with this contract amendment would be $168,844,156.
The PSC team provides program management support and specialized technical staff support to
augment RTD FasTracks Team staff. Key PSC staff members are co-located with RTD Staff at the
RTD FasTracks offices. The PSC functions as an extension of RTD staff. This approach adds value,
cost-effectively, by allowing RTD to tap the PSC’s specialized resources in planning, environmental,
design, engineering, construction management support, program control, and related disciplines on
an as-needed, often part-time, basis.
Further, as the focus of the FasTracks program has shifted from planning and design to construction,
the staff resources required for support of the program shift similarly. The PSC role has changed,
and will continue to change, to meet the evolving needs of the FasTracks program. This flexibility
allows RTD to retain the core staff required for implementation of the FasTracks program, without
having to continually (and inefficiently) staff up and then staff down in the planning, design, and
construction management disciplines.
Some of the key deliverables and assistance, in process or received, from the Jacobs/PSC team in
2014 included:



Participation in the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) that resulted in the revised financial plan
that was adopted by the Board in May 2014.
Provided key construction management support for the DUS and Eagle Projects.

Provided design and construction management support of I-225 LRT Project.
Provided ongoing support in Planning, Engineering, Project Controls and DBE/SBE/WIN support.

application for the Central Corridor Extension.
Maintained the programwide project controls functions including cost, schedule, estimating,
change management, and document control.
Supported ROW design, survey, and acquisition of all projects.
Provided contract closeout support for the West Rail Line.

DISCUSSION
The Program Support Services Contract was specified for a term of six years with a six-year option,
to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work tasks. The six year option was approved by
the RTD Board in November 2010.The purpose of the annual re-negotiation of the contract is to
ensure that specific tasks and deliverables respond to the evolving needs of the FasTracks Program.
The PSC serves as an extension of RTD staff. RTD staff provides overall management and control of
the FasTracks program and administration of this contract. The PSC provides key personnel to a
number of tasks. These assignments are based on focusing the PSC effort to:





Areas of specialized expertise or experience.
Part-time assignments.
Shorter duration efforts.
Positions that are difficult for RTD to fill.

Each position in the FasTracks organization is evaluated individually to determine whether that
position falls within the above criteria for using a consultant. In addition, before a consultant is
actually brought into the FasTracks program, an assessment is made as to whether the position is
still needed, and an interview is conducted with the appropriate RTD manager(s).
The major program activities in 2015 include the following:





Construction and start of testing of the Eagle P3 project.
Construction of I-225 Project.
Final design and construction of the North Metro Line.
Prepare RFP documents and application for a Full Funding Grant Agreement for the Southeast Rail
Extension.

During 2015, the PSC contract identifies the following specific tasks in support of FasTracks:
Program Management
 Provide the full-time support of a Project Controls Manager for the FasTracks Senior management
Team.
 Provide the support of specific project controls positions in schedule, cost control, and document
control. Provide tracking and monthly schedule and cost updates to each project manager.

RTD has established a 7% DBE goal for this Contract. The latest DBE report indicates that the PSC’s
actual cumulative DBE percentage has been 19.46%. For 2015, the PSC has committed to 27.1% DBE
participation, well in excess of the 7% goal. Additionally, while not in their contract, the PSC has
committed to continuing their participation in the WIN program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the PSC contract from 2005 through 2015 would be
$168,844,156 with this amendment. Funds for the 2015 contract award in the amount of
$17,861,430 are included in the 2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in
the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the eighth year
contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in the amount of $17,861,430 for Program Support
Services Consulting for FasTracks for the year 2015. Funds for the award are contained in the
2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where PSC
support would be utilized.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
eighth year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering. Rather, perform all the work in -house
with RTD staff. This is not recommended as RTD does not have the staff to provide a sufficient
level of expertise in a cost-effective approach to manage the FasTracks Program (As described in
the Background section, the PSC team can provide the technical specialties on an as needed
basis).
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Re-solicit this work to another consulting team. This is
not recommended as the PSC is satisfactorily performing its work assignments and providing
valuable technical and project management assistance to the RTD team.
Selection of alternatives two or three would delay the implementation of the FasTracks Program as
there would be a major loss of continuity on the program.

On November 17, 2009, the RTD Board approved a sixth year contract amendment for 2010. The
actual cost proposal for the 2010 workscope was $1,400,000; but because of cumulative budget
underruns from previous years, the total Contract Not-to-Exceed price only needed to be increased by
$600,000 in order to deliver the 2010 work.
On November 23, 2010, the Board approved a seventh year contract amendment for 2011 in the
amount of $1,550,000, and authorized the six-year option included in the original contract.

the General Manager to approve the 2015 Contract Amendment for Kumar and Associates, thereby
exercising the second of five (5) one-year options and extending the contract term through December
31, 2015.
BACKGROUND
This action supports the General Manager’s first task goal for 2015 – Advancing/Completing FasTracks.
On July 15, 2008, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to Kumar and
Associates at a Not-to-Exceed price of $5,000,000 and a Notice to Proceed of August 1, 2008. The

Purchase twelve (12) Light Rail Vehicles

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a negotiations with Siemens to purchase
twelve (12) Light Rail Vehicles at a total price not to exceed $48 million, and to enter into the resulting
contract with Siemens.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Rail Operations needs to purchase twelve (12)
expansion Light Rail Vehicles in order to continue to provide the proper level of service. In addition,
adding these cars will provide a conservative number of spare cars needed to provide maintenance on
the existing fleet as it ages.
DISCUSSION
We need to begin negotiations with Siemens. It generally takes two (2) years from the time a notice to
proceed is issued before we see the first light rail car delivered. In addition, Siemens has historically
required thirty percent (30%) payment when the notice to proceed is issued, and an additional thirty
percent (30%) within the next ninety (90) days. Rail Operations staff has recently been in contact with
Siemens, and they have verbally agreed to delay the second thirty percent (30%) payment until 2016.
This will be a sole-source contract, and fits within RTD’s capital budget plan.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This acquisition is part of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) that was recently approved by RTD Board of
Directors. Funds are included in the 2015, 2016 and 2017 Strategic Budget Plan and the requested
2015 RTD Budget. In recent correspondence with Siemens, RTD has obtained a $3.9 million price for
each vehicle; RTD will also need to assure that purchase-related expenses, including a “Buy-America”
audit and on-site factory inspection during the car construction are funded.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Siemens has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its
DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to begin negotiations with Siemens, and if these
negotiations are successful, authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute a
contract to purchase twelve (12) Light Rail vehicles in an amount not to exceed amount
programmed in the SBP. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not allow us to begin negotiations with Siemens for the purchase of twelve (12) Light Rail
vehicles. This will delay the procurement process and is not in the best interest of RTD.

Budget Transfer for Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service and fuel line items of the
“Group 20” budget to the service line item of the “Group 23” budget to cover the variation in costs
incurred as a result of adjustments to service levels associated with runboard service changes in
2014. The total dollar amount of the budget transfer is $760,000.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with two (2) different service providers, First Transit and Transdev Services
(formerly known as Veolia Transportation), to provide fixed-route transit services under four (4)
service contracts. The fixed-route services are packaged in “groups” that include a variety of bus
routes. The fixed-route services currently operated by private contractors are as follows: Group 21
(Transdev), Group 22 (First Transit Longmont), Group 23 (First Transit Denver), and Group 24 (First
Transit Commerce City). First Transit Commerce City was providing service under the Group 20
contract through August of this year. That service was re-bid in 2014 and was subsequently
awarded again to First Transit as the Group 24 service package.
DISCUSSION:
Effective with each of the runboard service changes in 2014, RTD Service Planning & Scheduling
made adjustments in the number of service hours in all of the private contract fixed-route service
contracts to best distribute the available resources. The adjustments that were made to the Group
20 and Group 23 contracts resulted in an unanticipated increase in service hours in the Group 23
contract and a reduction in the service hours in the Group 20 contract. At the present time, the
Group 23 service hours have been increased to a level higher than the hours used to estimate costs
for the 2014 budget and the contract will run short of budget funding by the end of the year.
Conversely, the Group 20 service hours have been reduced below the level used to estimate costs
for the 2014 budget. Therefore, it is recommended that the excess budget dollars in Group 20 be
transferred to Group 23 to provide the additional budget funding needed for this service contract for
2014.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no financial impact. The Group 20 service contract currently has budgeted dollars available
to be transferred into the Group 23 service contract.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Approve the recommended action item so that funds will be available to pay invoices for Group
23 service through the end of 2014.
2)
Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will require
staff to locate additional sources for budget funding to pay invoices for Group 23 service.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors

Global Transportation and MV Transportation budgets to the service and fuel line items of the
Horizon Coach Lines budget to cover the variation in costs incurred as a result of the award of the
new Access-a-Ride service contract in 2014. The total dollar amount of the budget transfer is
$1,398,000.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with four (4) different service providers, Horizon Coach Lines, MV
Transportation, Via Mobility Services, and Transdev Services (formerly Veolia Transportation On
Demand), to provide Access-a-Ride paratransit services under four (4) service contracts. Three of
the service providers (Horizon, MV, and Via) use RTD-owned vehicles to provide “dedicated” service,
while the fourth provider (Transdev) uses Transdev-owned vehicles (taxi cabs) to provide “nondedicated” service. The current Access-a-Ride contracts were implemented in April of 2014
following the re-bid of the service in 2013. The current Access-a-Ride service model is a change
from the previous service model. Previously, the service had been provided by four (4) providers all
using RTD-provided vehicles and distributed as follows: MV Transportation—50% of revenue hours,
Global Transportation—16.6% of revenue hours, Horizon Coach Lines—16.6% of revenue hours and
Via Mobility Services—16.6% of revenue hours.
DISCUSSION:
At the time the 2014 budget was being prepared, the re-bid of the Access-a-Ride service was still in
the procurement process and no determination had been made on the service model or distribution of
service hours between providers. Consequently, the 2014 budgets were based on the existing 2013
service model as described above. The award/implementation of the new Access-a-Ride service
contracts in 2014 resulted in the following distribution of service: MV Transportation—50% of all
dedicated vehicle service hours, Horizon Coach Lines—25% of all dedicated vehicle service hours,
Via Mobility Services—25% of all dedicated vehicle service hours, and Transdev—100% of all nondedicated vehicle service (approximately 7% of the total Access-a-Ride service). The new Access-aRide service model resulted in an increase in revenue service hours for the Horizon and Via contracts
and a slight decrease in the service hours in the MV contract (over what had been used for budget
preparation). Global Transportation was not selected to continue providing service under the new
Access-a-Ride service model and contract. Therefore, the unused budgeted funds allocated to Global
in the 2014 budget were reallocated to the other providers.
Unfortunately, due to a
miscommunication, budget funding for Horizon was incorrectly allocated to MV. Therefore, those
funds now need to be transferred from MV to Horizon to cover the increased budget needs for
Horizon.
At the close of the Global Access-a-Ride contract, additional budget funds were released, which can

Packet Pg. 60

2.13.H

also be used to cover the budget funding shortfall for Horizon. Therefore, it is recommended that the
excess budget dollars from the Global budget and available budget dollars in the MV budget be
transferred to the Horizon budget to provide the additional budget funding needed for the increased
level service in the contract for 2014.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no financial impact. There are currently budgeted dollars available in the Global and MV
budgets to be transferred into the Horizon service contract.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Approve the recommended action item so that funds will be available to pay invoices for Horizon
service and fuel through the end of 2014.
2)
Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will require
staff to locate additional sources for budget funding to pay invoices for Horizon service and fuel.

Subject:

Local Government Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Local Government Liaison services with
CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) to exercise the third option year (January 1, 2015 through December 31,
2015) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a cost of $122,496. Funding for this contract is included
in the annual FasTracks budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Local Government Liaison services was issued on October 20, 2011.
Eight responsive proposals were received for evaluation. Three of the teams were interviewed by a
procurement panel, and a recommendation was subsequently referred to the Executive Committee on
December 15, 2011. The Executive Committee unanimously approved the recommendation that CRL
Associates, Inc. be offered a contract which provided for a one-year base price with four (4) one-year
option periods. The referenced extension covers the third option period from January 1, 2015, to
December 31, 2015. CRL will continue to provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the elected officials and
staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and
economic development organizations. This team has a broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns,
as well as an extensive network of relationships with local governments, elected officials, and
stakeholders along the Front Range.
As part of the Local Government Liaison services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and the
Chairman of the Board to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and
county levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular
outreach to the business community and economic development organizations in the Metro area to
develop partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues of concern.
CRL will represent RTD at meetings at the local level of government and provide professional advice,
counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local government activities as they relate to RTD. CRL will also
provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the third option year ($122,496/year) are included in the annual budget for the FasTracks
program.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to exercise the third option year

Packet Pg. 62

2.14.I

(January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a cost of
$122,496.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to enter into
an agreement to exercise the third option year on the contract for the Local Government
Liaison services. A new Request for Proposals could be sent to interested parties, and a new
Local Government Liaison firm could be retained. This action is not recommended because
CRL Associates, Inc. has been very effective in assisting RTD with local government matters
in the past, and this group is very familiar with RTD’s issues and policies.

Board Meeting Date: November 25, 2014

Subject:

Federal Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to enter into a new agreement for Federal Liaison Services with
Squire Patton Boggs LLP for a 23-month contract at a cost of $494,500 ($21,500 per month—the same
rate as currently being paid) with three one-year options (option year one at $264,000; option year two
at $270,000; option year three at $276,000). The total amount of $1,304,500 was below staff’s
internal cost estimate, and funding for this contract is included in the annual budgets.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Federal Liaison Services was issued on August 12, 2014. This
solicitation was a Best Value Procurement where technical factors and cost were all considered. Ten
responsive proposals were received, and they were evaluated by a five-member evaluation committee
that recommended Squire Patton Boggs LLP. The recommendation of the evaluation committee was
subsequently referred to the Government Relations Committee on November 11, 2014. The
Government Relations Committee recommended that Squire Patton Boggs LLP be offered a new
contract for a five-year period. Squire Patton Boggs has been RTD’s federal lobbyist since 2000 and
has assisted in RTD’s receiving over $2.5 billion in federal grants and loans. In addition to constant
monitoring of Congressional and Government Relations Branch activities, status reports are issued
and special reports are prepared when required by the Board of Directors or the General Manager.
DISCUSSION
Constant monitoring of federal legislative activities that relate to RTD is required, and RTD’s interests
must be conveyed to appropriate members of Congress, including the Colorado delegation and other
key Congressional committee members. The Squire Patton Boggs team has excellent rapport and
respect from the Colorado delegation and serves as a resource for the delegation staff. When RTD
has a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) in place as it now does (Eagle P3 Project), the annual
appropriations process requires intense attention to committee hearings and to the status of the
Congressional budget process. In addition, RTD is seeking a Full Funding Grant Agreement for the
Southeast Rail Extension, which also entails extensive contacts with the Colorado Congressional
delegation. Significant lobbying efforts will be required to follow the steps to ensure being awarded
the annual appropriations in the current FFGA, as well as procuring the future FFGA.
The MAP-21 Continuing Resolution expires on May 31, 2015, so the federal lobbyists will play a key
role in representing RTD’s needs in the next reauthorization bill. With the build out of FasTracks, the
lobbyists will need to be especially attentive to the federal financing needs for the new corridors, and
they will monitor discussions and advocate for RTD’s best interests regarding new reauthorization
language. When the bill is enacted, Squire Patton Boggs will play a key role in advising RTD as to
the contents of the bill and monitoring the rule-making process.
In addition to helping with Congressional activities, assistance is also necessary with the Executive
Branch of the federal government, including the Department of Transportation (the Federal Transit

Packet Pg. 64

2.14.J

Administration and the Federal Railroad Administration). Squire Patton Boggs will provide guidance
and assistance in applying for and receiving federal funds from the Department of Transportation.
The Denver office of Squire Patton Boggs serves as important advisory role in RTD’s connection to
relevant national personnel and issues. In addition, annually, or as required, meetings with the Board
of Directors are also held.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Government Relations Committee’s Recommended Action to exercise a 23-month
contract at a cost of $494,500 ($21,500 per month—the same rate as currently being paid)
with three one-year options (option year one at $264,000; option year two at $270,000;
option year three at $276,000). The total amount of $1,304,500 was below staff’s internal
cost estimate, and funding for this contract is included in the annual budgets.
2. Continue the contract on a month-to-month basis, if amenable to the current Contractor
(Squire Patton Boggs LLP). This option is not recommended because continuity and stability
in liaison services is an important consideration.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and issue a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for
Federal Liaison Services. This option is not recommended because RTD’s RFP process was
properly utilized for this procurement, and all the proposals have been reviewed and subjected
to the evaluation criteria, resulting in a recommendation from the evaluation committee—
pursuant to RTD’s long-standing procurement procedures.

2015 FasTracks Public Information Consultant
Contract Award

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the third one-year option to the Virtegic Group Incorporated as the
FasTracks Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period
of performance through 2015. The scope of work is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic
Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This
contract amendment is for an amount not to exceed $686,009.60 for the year 2015. Funds for the
award are contained in the 2015 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
BACKGROUND
Utilizing a Public Information Consultant team to extend the staffin g needs of the FasTracks Public
Information Program contributes to the agency’s 2015 goal to Advance/Complete FasTracks.
In October 2011, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for a Public Information, Communications and
Public Outreach Consultant to serve as an extension of staff in the implementation of the FasTracks
Public Information Program. Following a comprehensive evaluation process, Virtegic Group
Incorporated, a certified SBE firm, was selected for this contract award.
The procurement was set up as a one-year contract award with four one-year options, negotiated
annually by RTD and Consultant Staff and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors. This gives
RTD the opportunity to assess and address the public information and outreach needs of the
FasTracks program on an annual basis as the program evolves. The services needed through this
contract may be reduced or embellished from year to year depending on the future financial situation
and changing needs of the FasTracks program.
Virtegic began its work effort in January 2012 and the RTD Board approved the first of four oneyear options for 2013 and the second one-year option for 2014. In the three years of working as the
FasTracks public information consultant so far, the Virtegic team members have satisfactorily
performed their work assignments and have remained flexible in meeting the needs of the public
information program during staff transitions.
DISCUSSION
The initial contract to Virtegic for 2012 was in the amount of $451,459.20. The first one-year
option for 2013 was $485,167.20. The second one-year option for 2014 was $487,308.80. The
third one-year option for 2015 is not to exceed $686,009.60 bringing the total on this contract to
$2,109,944.80. The 2015 contract amendment includes a base contract amount of $518,009.60 as
well as funds in the amount of $168,000 for an option to provide staffing to assist with special
events planning and preparation for the FasTracks project openings in 2016. This is an option to be
exercised on an as-needed basis only if RTD staff determines extra staff is needed to assist with
preparation for the five project openings in 2016.

Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the Public Information Consultant approach.
This is not recommended as RTD doesn’t currently have the staff to provide a sufficient level of
resources to meet the public information, communications and public outreach needs of the
FasTracks program. This alternative would delay and negatively impact the effective
implementation of the FasTracks Public Information Program.

3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
third one-year option to Virtegic Group. Issue another Request for Proposals for professional
services for Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach for the FasTracks Program
and award a contract to another consulting team. This is not recommended as the Virtegic team
is satisfactorily performing its work and has been flexible in meeting the changing communication
needs of the FasTracks program. Also, this alternative will delay and negatively impact the
successful implementation of the various strategies and activities associated with a
comprehensive and multi-layered communications effort.

Boulder Transit Village – Contract Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to amend contract 10FH032 with Adolfson and Peterson for an additional
$1,450,900, increasing the new not-to-exceed contract amount to $9,389,905.
BACKGROUND
In September 2010, RTD released an RFP for design-build teams to build a bus transfer facility on RTD owned land near 30th and Pearl Streets in Boulder, with the option of incorporating joint development in
support of the City of Boulder’s plan for the area.
In September 2011, the RTD Board of Directors awarded the development of the Boulder Junction TOD
project to the team of Adolfson and Peterson for a mixed-use development that included:







6 bay, below grade bus transfer facility similar to Market Street Station;
New access road, Junction Place, that connects the RTD transit facility to Pearl Parkway;
5 story, 390 space parking garage with 90 RTD parking spaces;
Public plaza connecting the Project elements to each other and the surrounding community;
5 story, 140 room hotel with associated retail;
71 units of affordable rental housing.

DISCUSSION
Currently the project is 90% complete. There have been three amendments to date that have added the
following:




Enclosure of the patron waiting area
Requirement of an escrow agreement to back up letter of credit
Floor vapor barrier

The work remaining that requires a contract amendment includes:





2.14.L

The RFP called for a DBE requirement of 16% of the construction contract. Adolfson and Peterson is
exceeding the DBE goals for the Project and is providing for 24.9% DBE participation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The current contact value through amendment 3 is $7,938,905. The contract amendment will raise the
not-to-exceed contract amount to $9,389,905. The project funding is available from a remaining CMAQ
grant amount of approximately $1,200,000 and local match that is within the project budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to amend contract
10FH032 with Adolfson and Peterson for an additional $1,450,900, increasing the new not-toexceed contract amount to $9,389,905.
2. Do not accept the recommended action. This is not recommended as RTD would lose
approximately $1,200,000 of remaining CMAQ grant funding that is available for the project; and
important elements of the project would not be built.

Resolution No.
, Series of 2014 Related to
the Modification of Call Provisions on
FasTracks Sales Tax Bonds, Series 2007A

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the modification of call
provisions associated with certain of the currently outstanding Regional Transportation District, Colorado
Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series 2007A.
BACKGROUND:

The Regional Transportation District (“RTD”) sold its Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project),
Series 2006A (the “Series 2006A Bonds) in a principal amount of $600,000,000 in 2006. In April,
2007 RTD issued its Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Project) Series 2007A (the “Series
2007A Bonds”), in a principal amount of $363,725,000, to advance refund a portion of the Series
2006A Bonds, the principal maturing from 2030 to 2036 in the amount of $364,265,000, to realize a
reduction in interest expense. The amortization of the Series 2007A Bonds was structured similar to the
refunded principal of the Series 2006A Bonds, with the majority of principal maturing from 2030 to
2036. The Series 2007A Bonds are subject to redemption at the option of RTD on or after November 1,
2017. Since the Series 2007A Bonds advance refunded the Series 2006A Bonds, the Series 2007A
Bonds can be (i) advance refunded on a taxable basis at any time, and (ii) currently refunded on a taxexempt basis no earlier than August 1, 2017.
This action item discusses the modification of the call provisions of a portion of the Series 2007A
Bonds in exchange for receiving a onetime payment from CitiBank N.A. (“Citi”).
DISCUSSION:

The Series 2007A Bonds are currently outstanding in the principal amount of $360,310,000. Citi
currently owns Series 2007A Bonds in an aggregate principal amount of $220,825,000, which
represents the majority of the principal outstanding in years 2030 to 2035, the details of which are set
forth in the following table:

Citi has approached RTD with an offer pursuant to which RTD would amend the call date of the Citi
owned Series 2007A Bonds from November 1, 2017 to November 1, 2024 against receipt of a one-time
cash payment from Citi. As of September 25, 2014, the payment from Citi to RTD was estimated at
approximately $15,000,000 assuming a closing date of November 20, 2014. The sale of the additional
call protection by RTD to Citi, with respect to the Series 2007A Bonds owned by Citi, can be analyzed
in the context of a partial refunding of the Series 2007A Bonds, with the savings of such “refunding”
realized in the form of an upfront-payment by Citi to RTD. If the proposal is accepted by RTD, the
Series 2007A Bonds owned by Citi would be subject to optional redemption by RTD as of November 1,
2024.
Copies of the Modification and Exchange Agreement and Second Supplemental Indenture of Trust are
available for review in the Board Office in substantially final form.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated payment by Citi of $15,000,000 represents 6.88% of the principal amount of Series
2007A Bonds owned by Citi. This is more than twice the (i) RTD threshold of 3.0% net present value
savings as a percent of refunded principal, and (ii) recommended threshold of 3.0% for execution of a
refunding by the Government Finance Officers Association.
RTD will need to make a one-time payment of approximately $1,400,000 to the IRS to satisfy RTD’s
arbitrage rebate liability relating to the 2007A bonds after this transaction is complete.
Costs of execution related to this transaction include fees for financial advisory, legal and other fees and
will be funded from the proceeds of this transaction.
Net funds received by RTD must be applied toward any FasTracks project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2014, authorizing the execution and delivery of a modification and exchange agreement and a
second supplemental indenture of trust relating to the districts Sales Tax Revenue Refunding
Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series 2007A, and other matters related thereto. This is the
recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series

2015 Proposed Internal Audit Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the proposed plan of internal audits to be performed in 2015.
BACKGROUND
The annual internal audit plan has historically been approved by the General Manager. As a result of the
State of Colorado examination, it was agreed that the Board of Directors would also approve the internal
audit plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached plan includes the calculated number of days available for auditing, as well as the audit
plan, the title of the auditor assigned, and an estimate of the days allocated for each audit. A total of
twenty (20) audits are planned. Due to budget constraints, there are no outside audits scheduled for
this year.
The plan is based on estimates of the time required to complete the audits. As in past years, it utilizes
every available business day. If other audits arise during the year, we will request the input of the Board
as to which audits are to be eliminated to accommodate the added audit/audits.

Do not approve the proposed plan. This is not recommended. The plan was developed including
input from numerous sources throughout the District and also includes the audits annually required by
the Board. Delaying the start of audit work will limit the days available for fieldwork and could require a
reduction in overall audit presence in the District.
