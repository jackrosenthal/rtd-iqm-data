November Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Sisk asked AGM Genova to review the November Board agenda. All of the action
items had passed committee and not foreseeing any problems.

Motion:

Director James made the motion to move the
agenda to the full Board for November 25,
2014.
Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Chair Sisk asked AGM Genova if we were
anticipating any problems on the unanimous
consent items. He noted some of the discussion
under recommended action about the local
government liaison services where some Board
members had expressed concern about Roger
Sherman leaving. Director Sisk requested AGM
Genova to send the response of the question of

cost breakdown on the Boulder Transit Village to
the full Board.
Pertaining to the 2015 proposed internal audit
plan, Chair Sisk expressed it was inappropriate
to request an audit of Civil Rights; we will
continue to be vigilant regardless; As Directors,
we were provided the opportunity to provide
input. We should not highlight Civil Rights any
more than any other area. We need to rely on
our professional staff.
Director Bagley added that the comment that we
should have been proactive is bogus and not
appropriate. Chair Sisk agreed.
Vote on the Motion:

The motion passed with the full commitment in
favor.
Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED.

Other Matters

Director Bagley shared that he will be on vacation next week and will not be at the
meeting. He asked Chair Sisk if he wanted Director Anderson to provide an update
from the GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee in his stead. He
went on to provide this update: The Committee had met last Tuesday and
approved the ratings for the 10 core and task goals. Seven of the goals were rated
as exceed expectations and three were rated as achieved goal. Directors Walker,
Tobiassen and Folska had also participated. A discussion was held on the
Discretionary Performance Payout as provided in the GM’s contract. Last year he
had received 8-1/2%; this year the recommended percent is 7% or about $20K.
There will be an Executive Session at the December 16 meeting where the full
Board can weigh in on the General Manager’s performance. Any dissenting report
can also be made at that time.
Chair Sisk commended Director Bagley for the fine job he is doing with this GM
Oversight and Performance Management Committee. He noted that while unanimity
may not have been achieved, it is important that we operate with civility. Director
Bagley responded it is his honor to serve. Directors Hoy and Tobiassen echoed
their sentiments that Director Bagley is doing a great job. Director Tobiassen
reflected on the past history as to why it is important that we follow a structured
process. Chair Sisk stated that no report will be necessary for the December 16
meeting.
Paula Perdue shared that in planning for the 2015 Board calendar, she has noticed
a particular conflict between the week that we have scheduled the joint board-staff
advance (March 7) and the start of the APTA Legislative conference. She asked
how did theywant to resolve this. After some discussion, it was tentatively
decided to move the joint strategic advance to the weekend of March 21, 2015.

Paula Perdue shared that we have invited the grand winners of the Youth Art
Program to our December 16 meeting. We have also extended the invitation to the
superintendents of Aurora and Cherry Creek Schools as well as the principals and
Mayors for the area. We are awaiting confirmation from all but the response has
been very positive. We will present the schools with a framed copy of the artwork.
Chair Sisk indicated that Director Folska and Paula should be a part of that
presentation. Paula added that the Marketing Group has done an outstanding job in
moving this project ahead and in the actual coordination with the schools.
Director James shared that he had attended a symposium dealing with sustainable
community initiative which had about 70-80 city planners and others in attendance.
There was lots of conversation about FasTracks and the city planning efforts. He
also shared that at another event, Denver Association of Business Economists,
Miller Hudson had shared information on the I-70 project with Maglev. He will
email a copy of the survey to the Board members for some interesting read.
Director Walker shared that he had attended a candidate forum in his district for the
City Council. He had asked them what were the top issues evolving and they stated
that transit was the number 1 concern.
Director James shared that at the Symposium, the “Last mile, first mile” discussion
was prominent. Cities are including this in their thinking.
Director Hoy emphasized that he would like to see the net proceeds from the
Citibank bonds to go to the FISA account. He stated we have precedence for this.
Director James added it is important that we get the most possible PR from our
efforts. The decision making process will be just as important as where and how
the money is spent.
Chair Sisk shared he was on his way to the Transportation Matters Summit where
Bill Van Meter was presenting. He heard this was a sold-out event of about 450
people.
Chair Sisk threw a ball in the air and shared his desire to have a dinner or event to
invite all former Board members to the table. This would be a social event with a
chance to thank them. Some of the other members thought it was a good idea.
AGM Genova spoke about the opening at Rio Court and the plaque dedication.
Director James added this is a good story of how we can assess our own inventory
for acquisition properties that could be re-used or work for us. This is all part of
asset management and state of good repair
Chair Sisk encouraged the Board members to attend the CMRF event.
