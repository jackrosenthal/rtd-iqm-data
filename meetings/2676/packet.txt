Subject:

Local Government Relations Update

Below is our update for October 3:
1. Local Municipal Candidate Snapshot – Attached is an updated final snapshot of
municipal candidates. Please let me know if you have any questions. Municipalities
within RTD’s service area holding November elections include: Arvada, Aurora,
Boulder, Brighton, Broomfield, Centennial, Commerce City, Edgewater, Englewood,
Golden, Greenwood Village, Lafayette, Lakewood, Littleton, Longmont, Louisville,
Northglenn, Sheridan, Thornton, Westminster, and Wheat Ridge.
2. Metro Mayors Caucus - The next full caucus meeting is October 4 from 7:30-10 A.M.
at the Denver Zoo - Norgren Hall, Gates Education Building, 2300 Steele St. The agenda
includes a discussion on statewide and regional transportation funding.
3. SB267 Special Session – We are assisting Brandeberry and McKenna organize support
by local mayors and councilmembers for the upcoming special session.
4. Statewide Transportation Funding Ballot Imitative - The Denver Metro Chamber of
Commerce and a broad coalition of partners from across Colorado are pursuing a ballot
initiative for the 2018 election to fund statewide transportation by increasing the state
sales tax. The proposal will likely focus on ensuring local jurisdictions have funds and
flexibility to address their critical transportation needs, providing resources to CDOT for
maintenance of the current system and to deliver identified projects on their $6 billion
state-wide priority list, and securing funding for multi-modal transportation projects
throughout the state. We do not believe any funds would flow directly to RTD, however
the local funds would be completely flexible and could be used for transit purposes in
partnership with the RTD. RTD would also be able to apply for funding from multimodal transportation grant fund. Specifics of the ballot proposal, the campaign structure
and its leadership will be announced later this year.

Re:

October Board Update

The Governor has called a special session of the General Assembly on Oct 2nd to address the drafting error
in SB17-267. BBMK has been working with legislative leadership, the SB17-267 bill sponsors and the
Governor’s office to address this issue since we were notified of the mistake on June 30, 2017. BBMK is
especially appreciative of the Governor’s leadership on this issue and applaud his Administration and the
Colorado General Assembly for acknowledging the drafting error and working towards minimizing the
impact to transit riders and the RTD system.
BBMK continues to follow the work of the state taskforce created in SB17-011 to examine transportation
alternatives for disabled and elderly populations in El Paso and Teller Counties. Although this project
includes counties outside the front range the alternatives explored could be used statewide to address
this growing need. The group is exploring recommendations to submit to the legislature in a final report
due on December 31st. The next meeting is October 24th in Colorado Springs.
The Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce and members of the business community have decided to
pursue a ballot initiative in 2018 to ask the voters for a dedicated sales tax increase to fund transportation.
The transportation funding conversation continues to take shape for the 2018 legislative session and we
look forward to providing the Board updates of proposed legislation as it is introduced.
RTD will be presenting to the TLRC on November 2nd at 10:15am and we strongly encourage Board
members to attend our briefing to the committee as legislators always appreciate seeing the Board
members at the Capitol.
BBMK has met with and will be meeting again this fall with Rep. Lebsock who has indicated to us that he
will be running legislation impacting the District.

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: OCTOBER 3, 2017
Continuing Resolution Keeps Federal Government Operating

Under this ten-week CR, the release of Federal transportation funding will be delayed in some circumstances.
For instance, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) will likely not provide FY 2018 transit formula
funding or Capital Investment Grant (New Starts) funding until full-year FY 2018 appropriations are passed.
Congress Continues Consideration of FY 2018 Transportation Appropriations Bills
The CR provides Congress with additional time to finish consideration and negotiation of legislation
providing full-year FY 2018 appropriations. With regard to transportation spending, the Senate’s bill has
been approved at the committee level, but has not yet been considered on the Senate floor. Currently, there
is no schedule for floor consideration of the Senate bill. The House recently passed an omnibus
appropriations bill that included all twelve individual spending bills.
New Starts Funding
The House omnibus bill would provide $1.753 billion for the New Starts program. In July, the Senate
Appropriations Committee approved its THUD appropriations bill, which would provide $2.133 billion for
the New Starts program.
Both the House and Senate transportation spending bills include sufficient funding to cover all existing New
Starts full funding grant agreements (FFGAs), and both include $63.26 million specifically for RTD’s Eagle
P3 project. This funding will not be available to RTD until a full-year appropriations measure is passed, likely
in December.
TIGER Grant Program
The House omnibus appropriations bill would provide no funding for the Transportation Investment
Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program, while the Senate THUD appropriations bill would
provide $550 million for the program. The President proposed eliminating the TIGER program in his FY
2018 budget proposal, however most transportation stakeholders believe that this enormously popular grant
program will be included in the final FY 2018 transportation spending bill.
Next Steps
It is unlikely that the Senate will take up the House omnibus bill, as it would fail to garner the Democratic
support needed to pass in the Senate. It is more likely that Senators will reach agreement on their own
omnibus appropriations bill during the coming months. The CR expires on December 8, and Congress will
have to act by then to keep Federal programs and agencies operating thereafter.
Work Continues within White House on Trump Infrastructure Proposal
There has been no significant public action on the Administration’s infrastructure proposal since the release
of a six-page Infrastructure Initiative fact sheet with the President’s proposed budget in May. However, we
expect the Administration to send proposed infrastructure principles to Congress soon, so that Congressional
Republicans may incorporate the Administration’s priorities into infrastructure legislation. We expect these

Packet Pg. 59

Attachment: Federal Update 10 3 17 (3268 : Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs)

As of October 1, the Federal government is operating under a Continuing Resolution (CR) that will fund all
programs and agencies through December 8, 2017. The CR also included disaster relief funding for areas
impacted by recent hurricanes, an extension of the country’s borrowing authority (raising the debt ceiling),
and an extension of the national flood insurance program.

1.C.3.a

The Administration’s infrastructure proposal will likely prioritize public-private partnerships (P3s) and the use
of finance tools, such as TIFIA and bonds, to leverage Federal funding. However, the Administration has
recognized that P3s are not a solution for all projects, particularly those located in rural areas. We also expect
the infrastructure package to include incentives for “asset recycling,” which would encourage publicly-owned
infrastructure assets to be leased long-term or sold to private sector operators. The infrastructure package
will likely also include environmental streamlining provisions that build off of the President’s August
Executive Order (EO) titled “Establishing Discipline and Accountability in the Environmental Review and
Permitting Process for Infrastructure Projects” (EO 13807) and recent actions by the Council on
Environmental Quality (CEQ) to implement the EO. Both the EO and the CEQ actions are described in
more detail below.
CEQ Takes Actions to Implement Environmental Streamlining EO
In September, the Council on Environmental Quality (an office within the executive office of the White
House), announced an initial list of actions the Administration will take to reform the Federal environmental
review process and to implement Trump EO 13807. The announcement noted that CEQ will: (1) develop a
framework for implementing the “One Federal Decision” process described in EO 13807; (2) coordinate
with the Permitting Council, US DOT, and the Army Corps of Engineers with regard to high priority
projects; (3) review existing CEQ regulations to identify changes needed to update and clarify National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) provisions; (4) issue guidance to simplify and accelerate the NEPA
process; and (5) lead an interagency working group to review agency regulations and policies to identify
impediments to efficient and effective processing of environmental reviews and permitting decisions.
CEQ is the agency responsible for establishing and enforcing NEPA regulations, so its public pledge to
review these regulations signals the Administration is considering substantive changes to these governmentwide environmental review rules – in addition to further process improvements within agencies like US DOT.
President Trump Nominates FHWA Administrator
Recently, President Trump nominated Paul Trombino to be the Administrator of the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA). Mr. Trombino was previously the Director of the Iowa Department of
Transportation and also served as the President of the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in 2015 - 2016. He also served for 17 years at the Wisconsin DOT.
The Senate must confirm Mr. Trombino for this position, but his confirmation hearing has not yet been
scheduled.

principles to build on the May fact sheet and focus on leveraging limited direct Federal investment (e.g.,
grants) to attract a greater amount of non-Federal funding from state and local governments and the private
sector.
