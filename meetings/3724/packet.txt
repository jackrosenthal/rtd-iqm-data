BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Erie Annexation Election

June 25, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
June 25, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve a request submitted by resolution from the Weld County Board of
County Commissioners to hold an election for the purpose of including in RTD all areas of the Town of
Erie that currently lie outside the District boundaries, and accompanying Resolution No. ___, Series of
2024, to provide for an inclusion election for portions of the Town of Erie to be held on November 5,
2024.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chris Quinn, Project Manager, Planning
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 Minutes
BACKGROUND
The Town of Erie lies within two counties, Boulder and Weld. All of Boulder County is within RTD, and
accordingly, all of Erie within Boulder County is within the District boundary. However, the Town of Erie
District boundary within the Weld County portion is based on the date a particular parcel of land was
annexed into the Town of Erie. Prior to May 25, 1994, annexations of land outside the District made by
municipalities, all or partially in RTD, did not become part of the District. Pursuant to section 32-9106.6(1)(b), Colorado Revised Statutes, any area annexed by an in-District municipality on or after May
25, 1994, is automatically included in the District. As a result, Erie has an almost checkerboard pattern
of parcels lying inside and outside the District. This condition creates confusion for the Town of Erie
residents and elected officials regarding where RTD service can be provided, whether RTD sales and use
tax apply, and whether residents are subject to paid parking fees at RTD Park-n-Ride facilities.
Section 32-9-106.7, Colorado Revised Statutes, provides a process that allows for areas that are
contiguous to any boundary of the District to be included in the District if a resolution from the Board of
County Commissioners requesting an election for the purpose of including the area is submitted to the
Board. Specifically:
32-9-106.7. Additional district area – petition or election – required filings – definitions. (1.5)(b)
Subject to the requirements of section 32-9-106.1(2)(e)(III), [portions of a county that are not
within the boundaries of the district when other portions of the county are within the boundaries
of the district] that [are] contiguous to any boundary of the district may be included in the district
according to the following terms:
(I)
An election is requested for the purpose of including the area in the district by one

Packet Pg. 3

4.A

(B)

of the following methods:
A resolution by the board of county commissions of the county to hold an election
for the purpose of including the area, including municipalities and home rule
municipalities, in the district is submitted to the board of directors of the district.
The resolution shall contain a legal description of the area to be included within the
district.

On June 3, 2024, the Weld County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution requesting an
election to include all parts of Erie outside of RTD into the District, thereby bringing the entire Town into
RTD. The election would be held during the 2024 general election on November 5, 2024. The resolution
contains a legal description of the area to be included, which, in this case comprises just over 2,000
acres or approximately 3.2 square miles of developed residential and commercial properties along with
vacant land zoned for residential and commercial uses. The legal description has been reviewed by
RTD’s boundary mapping consultant and adjusted slightly to conform to the intent of the resolution. An
updated legal description is attached.
DISCUSION
Upon the Board’s approval of the Weld County Board of County Commissioners’ resolution, and
accompanying RTD Resolution for Inclusion Election for Portions of the Town of Erie, the Board will
authorize an election as described in Colorado Revised Statute § 32-9-106.7 be held during the State of
Colorado general election on November 5, 2024, for registered electors who reside within the
geographic boundaries of the area seeking to be included in the district, as set forth in the legal
description attached hereto, for the purpose of including those areas within the district, and designate
RTD’s General Counsel as the election official.
If the registered electors who vote in the election approve the inclusion of the area within the district,
the Board agrees to accept the area for inclusion in District I.
In adopting this recommend action and accompanying RTD Resolution, the agency seeks to meet the
2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community Value. As seen from the attached map, within Weld
County, much of the Town of Erie is within the RTD boundary, but substantial pieces lie outside,
creating confusion for Erie residents and elected officials regarding where RTD service can be provided,
whether RTD sales and use tax apply, and whether residents are subject to paid parking fees at RTD
Park-n-Ride facilities. Inclusion of all portions of the Town of Erie within district boundaries, if approved
by the voters, could alleviate this confusion. Additionally, while the Board-adopted System Optimization
Plan does not envision new service in the areas that would be annexed, Erie would have the opportunity
to apply for service through the Partnership Program that could provide service throughout the entire
Town.
Financial Impact
Financial impacts to RTD from this action include an undetermined amount of additional revenue from
sales taxes and use taxes from the commercial properties and relatively small amounts from automobile
sales to residents of the area. There may also be some unknown expenditures should RTD opt to expand

Packet Pg. 4

4.A

transit services at some time in the future. Additionally, RTD would be responsible for covering the cost
associated with the election. That amount is to be determined.
