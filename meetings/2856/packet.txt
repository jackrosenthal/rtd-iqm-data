Board Meeting Date:

Subject:

Board Commitment to FasTracks Completion
and Peak Service Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Chair of the Board of Directors, Doug Tisdale, by the Chair of the
Planning/Capital Programs, & FasTracks Committee, Judy Lubow, and by Directors Buzek, Guissinger,
Lewis, and Whitmore that the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution No. _____, Series of
2019, Regarding RTD Board Commitment for Finishing FasTracks and Supporting the Peak Service Plan
for Northwest Rail, as presented to the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee.
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2019 Goals as follows:
 Core Goal #2 – Strong & Ethical Leadership;
 Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management;
 Core Goal #5 – Effective Communications & Community Outreach;
 Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability; and
 Task Goal #4 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods.
BACKGROUND
In 2004, the voters of the Regional Transportation District approved the FasTracks ballot initiative to
create a comprehensive rail and bus rapid transit project connecting Denver and its suburbs, with an
expected completion date of 2017 for the entire project. For a number of substantial reasons, some of
which are noted in the resolution, project completion did not occur in 2017. It is expected that by 2020,
approximately 70% of the project’s mileage will be completed. This will leave several sections of the
project not yet funded nor finished.
DISCUSSION
The proposed resolution is appropriate and beneficial because it has been 15 years since the passage of
the FasTracks initiative, several corridors remain unfunded and unfinished, and the voters and taxpayers
deserve assurance that the project is not being forgotten. The resolution will express the Board’s
acknowledgement of RTD’s legal responsibility to complete the unfinished FasTracks corridors and its
intention to do so in as expeditious a manner as possible.
Addressing the financial challenges facing RTD in completing this task, the resolution expresses the
Board’s directives to staff to investigate reasonable cost saving measures and to propose funding
mechanisms to construct and operate the unfinished FasTracks corridors, with a report of steps taken to
appropriately move forward to be provided within two months. Further addressing financial challenges,
the resolution also dictates that staff explore, fund, and facilitate construction and operation of a cost
saving measure for the unfinished Northwest Rail that is presently being evaluated by staff and
stakeholders – the Peak Service Plan. A report outlining proposed steps to appropriately move forward
with this Plan will also be required and submitted within two months.

RESOLUTION NO. __________, SERIES OF 2019
REGARDING RTD BOARD
COMMITMENT FOR FINISHING FASTRACKS
AND SUPPORTING THE PEAK SERVICE PLAN FOR
NORTHWEST RAIL
WHEREAS, the citizens of the Regional Transportation District
(“RTD”) passed a ballot initiative in 2004 to tax themselves to create a
comprehensive train and bus rapid transit project connecting Denver and its
suburbs (“FasTracks Program”), with an intended completion date of 2017
for the full project; and
WHEREAS, the full FasTracks Program was not completed in 2017,
with the current expectation being that approximately 70% of the project
mileage will be completed by 2020; and
WHEREAS, several corridors and extensions included in the
FasTracks Program have not been completed by the date of this Resolution,
nor have funds for their completion been identified or committed, namely, the
Northwest and the North Metro corridors, and the Central and the Southwest
Extensions (collectively, the “Unfinished Corridors”); and
WHEREAS, it remains the uncompromising intention of the RTD
Board to comply fully with and to fulfill the obligations created in the
FasTracks Program passed by the District voters in 2004 in as expeditious a
manner as possible; and
WHEREAS, the RTD Board has always acknowledged that these
FasTracks obligations are the expressed will of the electorate and that RTD is
required to comply therewith, which acknowledgement was previously
expressed, inter alia, in RTD Board Resolution No. 004, Series of 2011
(“Concerning a 2011 FasTracks Election”); and
WHEREAS, a variety of factors created substantial changes and
challenges and increased capital costs in the FasTracks Program following the
2004 voter approval of said Program, which factors included, inter alia, (a)
the requirement that new technology, including Positive Train Control and
new signal systems and commuter rail cars, be employed; (b) the decision that

all but one of the trains be electric-powered rather than diesel-powered; (c)
additional EIS and local government drainage and traffic requirements; (d) an
increase in right-of-way acquisition costs; (e) significantly increased costs for
construction materials; and (f) the great recession of 2008-2009; and
WHEREAS, while acknowledging the financial challenges, RTD will
not abdicate its responsibility to complete the Unfinished Corridors as
expeditiously as possible in a commercially reasonable manner, and to that
end, the RTD Board expresses its unqualified commitment to and promotion
of fiscally responsible actions intended to facilitate and effectuate the
construction of all the Unfinished Corridors; and
WHEREAS, in regard to one of the unfinished Corridors, staff from
jurisdictions along the Northwest Rail Corridor and from RTD have been
investigating the construction and operation of an interim commuter startup
service (the “Peak Service Plan or “Plan”) along the unfinished portion of
the Northwest Corridor as a means of providing service to the Corridor in the
quickest manner possible; and
WHEREAS, the Peak Service Plan would provide rush hour service to
the presently unfinished portion of the Northwest Corridor, including three
trains from Longmont to Denver (and stations in between) in the morning
rush hour period, and three trains going from Denver to Longmont (and
stations in between) in the evening rush hour.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT:
1. The RTD Board expresses its continued commitment to the
completion of all the Unfinished Corridors, directing RTD staff to investigate
and research all reasonable cost-saving measures for construction and
operation of the Unfinished Corridors and creative funding mechanisms for
the same as expeditiously as reasonably possible, with a report to the Board
within two months following adoption of this Resolution outlining proposed
steps to appropriately move forward on these Unfinished Corridors.
2. In regard to the Unfinished Corridors, the RTD Board acknowledges
and appreciates the value and potential of phased approaches and partnerships
such as the Peak Service Plan to bring interim service to the remaining

pricing information from Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad as
expeditiously as possible, with a report to the Board within two months
following adoption of this Resolution outlining proposed steps appropriately
moving forward on the Plan.
3. The RTD Board instructs the General Manager and CEO, through
