#### 1. Approval of 2016 - 2021 Strategic Budget Plan

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts the 2016-2021 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).

JANNETTEMotion:               Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the August 18, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager for Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, introduced Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager for Budget and Financial Analysis.  Jannette Scarpino reminded the Directors that the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) has been discussed in Committee meetings since April, 2015. The Directors have seen two previous drafts with early assumptions.

Janette Scarpino noted that the final version presented for Committee approval today differs from the second draft in the following aspects:

- Reduced grant revenue forecast based on better information

- Additional $3.1 million in revenue from a CMAQ grant and an equal match

- Building maintenance facilities deferred:

o        Bus Maintenance Facility from 2018 to 2021

o        Light Rail Maintenance Facility from 2017 to 2019

- Projects deferred from 2016 to 2017

Jannette Scarpino reiterated that the SBP is balanced.

She briefly highlighted the exhibits included in the Approval of 2016-2021 SBP Board report as included in the Financial Administration & Audit Committee agenda packet for August 11, 2015 as follows:

- Exhibit 1:

o        Shows no service reductions and 10% fare revenue increases in 2016 and 2019 as per Board policy

o        Assumes zero growth in ridership

o        Operating expenses increasing at an average of 3.1% over the term per the Consumer Price Index identified by Moody’s

o        Diesel lock price of $2.23 per gallon with an average 2.5% escalation over the term

o        Gas price at $3.00 with an average 2.5% escalation over the term

o        Total project request of $700 million over the period

o        Board Appropriation Fund and Capital Replacement Fund are funded at a minimum of $3 million per year until a $30 million balance per fund is achieved (estimated to be achieved by 2019)

- Exhibits 2 and 3 are lists of planned Capital and Operations & Maintenance projects

- Exhibit 4 is a list of deferred projects from 2016 to 2017 that totals $21 million

She noted a variety of factors that are out of the Agency’s control that will impact the SBP.  Among these are Sales and Use Tax revenue, fuel cost, cost of materials, inflation, and economic conditions.  Staff will attempt to address these factors when developing the 2016 budget.

Jannette Scarpino added that the SBP will be challenged by changing economic visions, unpredictability of consumer spending behavior, possibly lower future forecast for Sales and Use Tax, continued construction projects, shifting to an Operations & Maintenance environment, continued cost allocations to FasTracks operations, and more acute spending on State of Good Repair.

Director Anderson said she was very impressed with the final version of the SBP.  She noted it was a fantastic list that highlighted what we hope to accomplish in continuing to finish FasTracks as well as provide good service and continue the State of Good Repair.  She added that it was very thorough and a great effort at keeping track of asset management.  She wondered if the SBP would be published.  Jannette Scarpino replied that the Board Report is a public document.

Director Francone echoed Director Anderson’s comments.  She said she is constantly amazed at the work, effort and detail that goes into the SBP.  She noted that during the committee meeting she will be voting no due to the number of questions she has on the document.  She will reach out to staff for further conversation.  She pointed out that the increase in the Operations budget is tied to the CPI and wondered what has been the increase of the Operations budget historically.  Her concern stems out of RTD’s move from Capital Projects to Operations & Maintenance.  Jannette Scarpino replied that the Operations budget has stayed within the CPI.  The next step is to determine the budget target for the departments.  Heather Copp added that the opening of the FasTracks corridors and the transition of operating costs were reflected on the APE presented to the Board during the FasTracks Monitoring Committee meeting on August 4, 2015.

Director Lubow thanked staff for the monumental task of developing the SBP.  She wondered if there was anything on the SBP about low income pass program funding.  Heather Copp replied that it is not on the SBP as staff needs more direction in order to move forward.  It will be included in the 2016 budget or the 2017-2022 SBP.  She added that there will be a presentation on the Fare Study Pass Program during the Operations and Customer Service Committee meeting.

Director Folska commented that the SBP is a dense piece of work yet it is easy to listen to Jannette Scarpino explain it.  She recalled there being a sum of money to further study State Highway 119 (HWY 119) in the north area of the District, $15 million for communications, and $2 million for the study of multimodal transportation in Downtown Denver.  She asked for further information about what would be covered by these funds.  Jannette Scarpino asked if staff could get back to her with the details.  Director Folska preferred to discuss those items during the meeting as this information may be of use for other decisions throughout the evening.

Director Folska mentioned the purchase of electronic mall buses that will be discussed during the Operations and Customer Service Committee meeting that will follow the Financial Administration and Audit committee.  She wondered what would happen if the City and County of Denver (Denver) decided it does not want the mall shuttles on 16th Street.  Jannette Scarpino did not recall the details of the top of her head but would get back to Director Folska with more information.  Dave Genova noted that the mall shuttle buses proposed for purchase could drive on any street.

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, explained that there are plans to do an environmental and preliminary engineering study for HWY 119 is programmed for $3.5 million, with $1 million of that funding coming from the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG).  He mentioned that the other project is the Denver Multimodal Plan for $2 million, with $400 thousand in 2017 and in 2018 as placeholder amounts to further that partnership.  Staff would come back to the Board before proceeding with the study.  Director Folska asked if Denver would contribute financially to the study.  Bill Van Meter replied that their financial contribution will be much more significant than ours.

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, explained that the $15 million allocated to Communications is for the re-assignation of employees back to the Communications department from FasTracks Public Information (PI) team.  Director Folska asked if all FasTracks PI employees and contractors would be absorbed by the base program.  Scott Reed clarified that only the RTD employees currently assigned to various projects would come back to Communications.  He added that overall there is a net decrease in employees.

Committee Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. Second Quarter 2015 Investment Report

Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager for Debt and Investments, referred the Directors to the Second Quarter 2015 Investment Report included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet for August 11, 2015.  He noted that the Liquidity Tier and the Enhanced Cash Tier are surpassing the benchmarks.

There was no further discussion on this item.

##### a. II.a INVESTMENT REPORT 2ND QUARTER 2015

#### 2. June 2015 Monthly Financials Status Report

Doug MacLeod, Controller, reviewed the June 2015 Monthly Financials Status Report as included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet for August 11, 2015.  He noted that all elements (S&U Tax, Ridership, and Fare Revenue) are below the budget mark while S&U is up compared to June 2014 and Year to Date 2014, Ridership is up compared to June 2014 but below when compared to Year to Date 2014, and Fare Revenue is below when compared to June 2014 but up when compared to Year to Date 2014.  He pointed out that the last page of the report has an update on the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).  Staff will bring to the Board an in-depth update on the FISA during the October Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting.

Director Folska asked staff to explain the increase of $16 million in S&U Tax.  Doug MacLeod replied that there has been a significant recovery from the 2008 recession that started showing in 2013.  He said the increase is mainly from restaurants, car sales, and merchandisers/big box stores.  Director Folska wondered if any of the S&U Tax was related to tourism.  Heather Copp noted that when people have more discretionary income they tend to eat out more.  Director Folska added that Colorado enjoys a high rate of employment as well.

Director Lubow wondered when RTD should start worrying about the decreasing trend in ridership.  She asked staff if there was a variance that bothered them.  Heather Copp replied that from a budget perspective ridership has been lower than the forecast for the past several months.  Staff will continue to monitor the trends and take appropriate action to adjust expenses as needed.

Director Bagley said that Heather Copp’s answer to Director Lubow was great.  He reminded the Directors that even though it is the middle of August they are looking at the June report.  He noted that more people are driving due to lower gas prices.  He pointed out that it would be helpful to see a worst case scenario estimation on a month by month basis. Heather Copp replied that she would be glad to make that type of estimation and bring it back to the Board at the September Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting.

Director Lasater mentioned he has been in conversations with different business partners about the 10% forecasted decrease in fuel prices.  He said that in his conversations with RTD staff they cannot say the decrease in ridership is directly related to the decrease in fuel prices, though he sees an assumptive aspect to it.  He noted that this year most arrows on the Monthly Financial Status have been red, compared to last year when they were almost always green.  He asked staff to keep monitoring the situation as he does not like the downward trend.  He added that if the revenue is down the Strategic Budget Plan may not be funded.

Committee Chair Tobiassen pointed out that more people driving due to low fuel prices could mean more congestion in the roads that may lead to more people taking transit.

#### 3. Second Quarter 2015 Internal Audit Update

Ann Marie Isaac Heslop, Manager for Internal Audit, and Kevin Parker, Senior Internal Auditor, pointed the Directors to the Second Quarter 2015 Internal Audit Update as included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet for August 11, 2015.  The report included summary statements of the completed audits for Out of District Parking Fees and HR Purchasing Card.  It also included an update on the several Audits in the final stages of completion.

Director Folska recalled hearing about discrepancies in fuel reimbursements for Access-a-Ride providers.  She asked what actions were taken in the instances where the discrepancies where found.  Kevin Parker replied that RTD was overcharged about $5,000 in fuel.  The management within RTD went through all the invoices to find any errors.  RTD did recover the money.  Internal Audit is working with RTD management to move towards an environment that ensures those kind of errors do not occur.

Director Menten asked staff to share with the Board the discussion about the Xerox handheld units for fare checks as discussed in the Financial Administration and Audit pre-committee meeting.  Kevin Parker explained that the Motorola devices RTD was hoping to use are going to be discontinued and no longer serviced.  Xerox is reviewing RTD requirements and researching opportunities that would serve the Agency’s needs.  Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, further explained that the operating system the current handheld fare check machines use will not be supported in 2016.  Staff and Xerox are working on finding new technology that would serve RTD now and in the long term.  Director Menten asked if Xerox would need to purchase the new machines in order to fulfill their contract.  Bruce Abel replied that is one of the options.

Director Folska mentioned there is a couple that lives in her District who travel all over the system, including the airport.  She was curious as to how the machine will know what type of fare to charge and if the fare checks happen only on the train or also on the bus.  Bruce Abel said that the current SmartCards are used on both bus and rail.  In the bus, there is an interaction with the operator, the passenger and the computer system.  The operator sets the route which determines the fare.  On rail validators, the passenger pushes a button to indicate which fare they will use.  Director Folska asked if the self-service validators have an audible feature.  Bruce Abel replied that they do, yet staff is looking for a more pleasant voice for the audible feature.  He offered to continue the conversation with Director Folska off line.

Committee Chair Tobiassen commended the Internal Audit team for stepping up their authority and looking into cyber security.  He noted that the Strategic Budget Plan presented earlier during the meeting includes some improvements to our security systems.  He added that the Internal Audit team is a key component for RTD’s cyber security.
