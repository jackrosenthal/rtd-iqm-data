Board Meeting Date: August 18, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the 2016-2021 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
This action item meets policy requirements and the General Manager’s goals of Fiscal
Sustainability/Financial Plan by effecting current and long-range budgeting in a timely manner.
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s Fiscal Policies states that “RTD will prepare and update
annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital construction and
improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating
programs.”
The SBP is RTD’s six year financial plan. Updated annually, it provides important cash flow planning
information used to determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as
services that the District can provide using projected financial resources. The first year of the SBP
serves as the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
Each year during the SBP process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed
to support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal
and interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the
District. The other major component of the SBP is the estimate of available revenues during the sixyear time period. These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will
have adequate resources to meet cash flow needs.
Capital and operating/maintenance projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits,
and to what extent they meet the RTD mission statement; projects are constrained to operate within
the forecast of revenues and funding sources available for their completion and operation.
The SBP also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit funding through the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council of
Governments. The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal
funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying SBP projects are
included in the TIP.
The 2016-2021 SBP includes service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales and use
taxes. Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2016-2021 are presented
separately in the FasTracks financial plan.

1.B.1

DISCUSSION
The attached SBP incorporates the 2015 amended budget and includes all known adjustments and
best estimates at this time. The SBP is being presented to the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee on August 11th with a staff recommendation for Board adoption on August 18th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2016-2021 projected cash flow through the extension of
the 2015 Amended Budget. The column titled “Adjusted Amended Budget 2015” in Exhibit I
incorporates revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget and
subsequent known items.
The SBP is balanced through the six year period after incorporating into the projections both the
March sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business, and reductions, eliminations or
deferrals of SBP requested projects. No service reductions are proposed in the SBP through this
period.
Exhibit I summarizes the 2016-2021 projected cash flow activity based on the staff
recommendation incorporating the following:
 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $131.3 million in 2016 is forecast to be 10% higher than 2015 due to
a fare rate increase in concert with the new fare structure to be rolled out in 2016.
Fare revenue increases by 10% again in 2019 per Board policy of consideration of a
10% fare rate increase every 3 years. No fare rate increases have occurred since
2011. The SBP conservatively assumes zero ridership increase through 2021. (Line 1)
 Sales and use tax incorporates the March quarterly update from the CU-Leeds School
of Business for the years 2015-2021. (Line 2)
 Grant revenue estimates are based upon past trends, formula allocations, known
proceeds, and recent congressional actions. Amounts are escalated at the area
Consumer Price Index (CPI) (obtained from Moody’s) or as identified. (Line 3)
 Other income consists of advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, and IGA and
miscellaneous rental income, escalated at the CPI beginning in 2016. (Line 4)
 Operating expenses (excluding depreciation):
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates as follows: (Line 6)
2016:
3.1%
2017:
3.5%
2018:
3.3%
2019:
3.1%
2020:
2.8%
2021:
2.8%
 Service increase consists of the cost of new CMAQ-funded service projects to be
operated by RTD in years 2016-2018 to include service enhancements on Routes L
and 324, Route 73 extension, Superior and Broomfield call-n-Ride services, and
Anschutz Medical Campus Shuttle. These services are included in the DRCOG TIP.
RTD costs will be reimbursed in full by CMAQ grant funds and contributed funds from
the applicable municipalities. Determination will be made in future years whether to
continue such service at RTD’s cost. (Line 7)

Costs of operating the West Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide and I-225 are
allocated from Base to FasTracks based on resource drivers, and thus, Base total
expenses are reduced by the amount of the allocation. (Line 8)
 Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated amount through
2017 then escalated at the CPI rate for 2018-2021. (Line 9)
 Diesel fuel is budgeted at the 2016 lock price of $2.23/gallon, for a savings of $6.7
million from 2015, and then escalated at the national CPI rates as follows: (Line 10)
2016:
2.6%
2017:
2.7%
2018:
2.7%
2019:
2.5%
2020:
2.3%
2021:
2.2%
 Gasoline is budgeted at $3.00/gallon in 2016, down from $3.40 used in the 2015
Amended Budget, and then escalated at the national CPI rates above. (Line 10)
Specifically identified operating and maintenance projects (also termed “expense projects”)
are included. This is detailed in Exhibit III. (Line 11)
The FasTracks service increase, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base System,
increases by the CPI rate serially each year beginning in 2014. (Line 12)
Interest income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in investable
balances and forecasted interest rates per forward rate curves. (Line 15)
Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each year
(both current debt and future debt) by using debt amortization schedules. Projected
interest payments on future debt issues use current municipal interest rate forward curves
incorporated in debt amortization schedules. (Line 16)
Capital expenditures include all anticipated and specifically identified capital projects and
replacements. This is detailed in Exhibit II. (Line 19)
The capital carryforward estimate is shown for 2015 and 2016. (Line 20)
Per Board policy that established a Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement fund,
staff recommends that funding of the Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement
fund be maintained at a minimum of $3.0 million each year until each fund reaches the
minimum target balance of $30 million, projected to occur in 2019. (Lines 21, 22, 32,
and 33)
Debt issued represents COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition in accordance
with fleet schedules, and debt issued for building construction (assumed to be a LRV
maintenance facility in 2019 and bus maintenance facility in 2021). (Line 24)
Principal payments on debt are derived from individual debt instruments outstanding during
each year (both current debt and future debt) by using debt amortization schedules. (Line
25)
The SBP is balanced during the six-year period as shown by the positive unrestricted yearend fund balance. In 2019, the unrestricted year-end fund balance is projected to exceed
the target balance of $30 million. (Line 31)

Exhibit III attached to this document is a detailed listing of planned operating and maintenance
projects during the SBP period in uninflated 2015 dollars.
Exhibit IV
Exhibit IV attached to this document is a listing of capital and operating projects deferred from
2016 that were submitted for consideration during the SBP development process. The SBP
was balanced largely by deferral from 2016 to 2017 of these projects requested for 2016. In
2017, the SBP generates sufficient cash flow to support these deferred projects from 2016.
Exhibit V
Exhibit V attached to this document is a chart of capital projects by type for the current and
last three SBP periods.
Exhibit VI
Exhibit VI attached to this document is a chart of operating and maintenance projects by type
for the current and last three SBP periods.
The 2016-2021 SBP planned capital and expense projects are totaled below, inflated at the CPI rate
starting in 2016:

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its SBP for any Title VI
Impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the SBP will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior to
final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the SBP, Title VI impacts
are reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements (repairs,
replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. The Title VI review will be provided and a
statement from the Planning Department to this effect is attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff-recommended SBP provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive unrestricted yearend fund balance in each year of the SBP. However, uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales
tax revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and supplies, as well as economic conditions will continue to
have an impact on the SBP and may challenge staff to present new options and solutions during the
2016 budget period.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adoption of the 2016-2021 SBP, incorporating all items currently in the recommendation by
staff and the other items identified above. This is the recommended action.
2. Defer the adoption of a 2016-2021 SBP to a later date. This is not recommended because the
SBP identifies the capital programs, expenditures, and service guidelines for the 2016 budget
process and adoption of the SBP serves as a confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for
the 2016 Budget.
3. Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2016-2021
SBP. This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the SBP adoption and possible
delay in the 2016 budget process.

Project Description

LRV Purchase of 12
LRVs

This is the first request for purchase of 12 LRVs to
increase the fleet size to 184. O&M costs are for
oversight meetings and on-site inspection.

Rail Operations

LRV Purchase of 15
LRVs

In 2013, Rail Operations and the Planning Department
Districtwide
determined that eighteen (18) Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs)
would need to be purchased in order to meet the
demands of the existing LRT system and accommodate
the opening of the I-225 line in 2016. This analysis led to
the current procurement of twelve (12) vehicles that was
included in the 2015-2017 capital budget plan. In order to
bring the spare ratio to a desired 20% minimum and meet
the anticipated growth in ridership, we need to purchase
fifteen (15) additional vehicles by 2020 (Base System=15,
FasTracks=2). This will increase the fleet from 184 to 201.

passenger waiting areas, passenger shelters and
benches. In the years of 2016 and 2017, RTD will receive
a FASTER grant stipend from CDOT for State of Good
Repair type projects. These funds will be used to fund
RTD projects that would otherwise have been funded by
RTD base system funds. However, as part of this stipend,
CDOT expects RTD to provide an additional $150,000 of
grants to local governments for transit projects. The funds
from this SBP request will be added to the SBP Local
Government pool so that RTD can meet the terms of the
FASTER stipend and have a meaningful pool of funds to
respond to local government requests.

Asset Management
Program Planning and
Implementation

Asset management, broadly defined, refers to any system District Shops that monitors and maintains things of value to an entity or Operations
group. IT asset management is the set of business
Center
practices that join financial, contractual and inventory
functions to support life cycle management and strategic
decision making for the IT environment. This is also one
of the processes defined within IT service management.
The goal of this project is to replace the current asset
management system, ZenWorks, which is inadequate for
the current and future computing size of the District. A
more robust integrated system is needed for
hardware/software compliance auditing, configuration
control, and adequate capacity forecasting. This includes
the tracking of computers, servers, software, mobile
devices, computer equipment, tablets, laptops, monitors,
etc.

This project will implement a district-wide comprehensive Districtwide
Enterprise Content Management (ECM) solution to
consolidate 65 existing systems that create, capture or
store content at RTD. The project scope will include the
development of policies, procedures, taxonomy and
metadata for the consistent identification, storage,
maintenance, retrieval, retention, and destruction of data.
The project also will include identification of personnel
and tools required to implement the policies and
procedures, implementation of the system, and the
development of training and audit tools to support the
ongoing utilization of the system.
The current project cost estimate assumes that RTD will
own and maintain the hardware and software in-house.
The first phase of this project includes an evaluation of
potential ECM tools, which will include externally hosted
systems or software-as-a-service (SaaS) systems. If a
hosted or SaaS system is selected, the cost structure of
the project will change.

The Call-n-Ride vehicles are equipped with DLT rugged
District Shops mobile computer tablets. These same DLT tablets are
Operations
used by RideChecker personnel to gather infield ridership Center
information, being managed by the same group.
Currently, there are a total of 67 mobile tablets in use: 52
Call-n-Ride and 15 RideChecker. In 2013, 20 machines
were replaced with the Panasonic H2 Tablet, leaving 47
needing replacement in 2015, with 15 in dire need. Even
though the tablets are ruggedized, they still have a higher
break rate than a standard PC that resides within an office
setting. The total number of on-shelf inventory needs to
increase to accommodate time involved with break/fix full
turnaround. An additional 8 tablets are needed in order to
reduce service interruption that has been an issue for
several years. Also, the unit hardware will be set to a 3
year life cycle. Request is based on increased unit
numbers: 55 Call-n-Ride, and 20 RideChecker for a total
of 75 in service and ready inventory tablets.

TrapezeCOM has been the only CRM tool in use for the
Civic Center
past 8 years at RTD and most departments find it difficult Plaza (CCP)
to use and limited in its functionality. Various
departments/projects like Communications, Fastracks,
and the SmartCard system use their own CRM tools to
collect customer feedback that is not integrated. The
recommendation from the Smart Card Business Process
Reingeneering (SMT BPR) is that RTD procure and
implement an Enterprise Level CRM system that would
meet the needs of all departments and projects. The first
phase (2015) of this project is to initiate an enterpise-level
study to perform a needs analysis, develop processes
and procedures, document required reports and key
performance measures, perform a gap analysis and make
recommendations on a system to meet the current and
future needs of RTD. The second phase (2016) is to
purchase and implement an enterpise CRM. If the CRM
study shows there is an acceptable hosted cloud based
offering, like salesforce.com, the required capital funding
would drop and be replaced with annual expense and IT
would only need to request 1 new FTE.

The Light Rail SCADA team and IT Network group are
Civic Center
spending a significant effort in 2015 to separate the
Plaza (CCP)
SCADA network and the corporate network infrastructure.
This separation is necessary in order to isolate and
protect the SCADA network for the safety and security of
the District. Once complete, a need still exists for RTD to
collect data from the SCADA network, which will consist
of train location data (based on track sensors) to support
the real-time project. This can be accomplished in a safe
and secure manner by implementing a bi-directional flow
of network traffic from the SCADA network to the
corporate network without allowing any access to SCADA
assets. This is implemented through a waterfall (unidirectional) firewall device. This request is to procure the
hardware necessary to implement this solution. Real
Time Passenger Information (RTPI) will provide RTD
passengers with predictive arrival times for their next bus.
IT and Marketing are working toward providing predictive
arrival times for buses via three primary delivery systems:
General Transit Feed Specification for Real Time or
GTFS-RT (which will provide the information to Google
Maps and some third party application developers),
Passenger Information Display (PID) signs, and the RTD
website.

RTD relies heavily on its storage units to house 95% of all District Shops - $
District information and computing services. A wide array Operations
of departments and applications use these storage units Center
to store mission-critical data. Computer data storage,
often called storage or memory, is a technology consisting
of computer components and recording media used to
retain digital information. It is a core function and
fundamental component of computers. The central
processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates
raw information by performing computations. In practice,
almost all computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts
fast but expensive and small storage options close to the
CPU and slower but larger and cheaper options farther
away. In computing, a portfolio of storage products,
including: online storage, near-online (nearline) storage,
storage networking, archiving, de-duplication, storage and
backup software are required to run the Enterprise.

plats, ALTA surveys, legal descriptions, and other
electronic and paper records regarding RTD properties
going back to 1997. The extent of this information is
estimated to be 2 to 4 terabytes, which could be equated
to 76,000 to 152,000 bankers boxes of information. These
documents also include information on utilities that cross,
or service RTD stations, rail lines, Park-n-Rides, and
other properties.Organizations that have assets in various
geographic locations typically utilize Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) to record and analyze their
asset base. Utilities and local municipalities are examples
of such organizations. RTD has been using GIS systems
for about 15 years. Currently, these systems are used
mostly used by the Telephone Information Center (TIC),
Scheduling (Transtar), and CAD/AVL. RTD is also getting
started on projects like real-time train arrival information,
which would also need GIS support.This project request is
to sort through Jacobs property survey records, bring this
information within RTD, and organize it on an engineering
GIS platform. Initially, the system will house information
on properties, utilities, track, pnR’s, crossings, and
structures. The system can be expanded to include other
items like the catenary system.

Auto-Scope Upgrade

Real-Time Passenger
Information Integration
with Light Rail SCADA
System

The real-time project team is working on collecting track- Mariposa Light
based train location information from the Light Rail
Rail Division
SCADA system. In order to obtain real-time train location
information for LRVs, modifications to RTD’s light rail train
tracking system (SCADA) are needed to provide a realtime data feed from track-based events including when a
vehicle passes through TWC (train to wayside
communicator) and the beginning and end of track
segments (included in the Integration request). During a
feasibility study, we identified an issue in the Denver
downtown area where the frequency of TWCs along the
tracks are not frequent enough to provide optimal train
locations. This has been referred to as a "dark territory".
To enhance the data feed, auto-scopes (cameras) can be
used to augment data through the following events: 1)
Video track segment occupancy (VTO). This update will
occur when the control system has determined from input
received from a video camera that a train has arrived in a
section of track associated with that specific camera. 2)
Video track segment vacancy (VTV). This update will
occur when the control system has determined from input
received from a video camera that a train has departed
from a section of track associated with that specific video
camera. This request is to install new auto-scopes at key
downtown stations to enable this.

RTPI will provide RTD passengers with predictive arrival Civic Center
times for their next bus. IT and Marketing are working
Plaza (CCP)
toward providing predictive arrival times for buses via 3
primary delivery systems: General Transit Feed
Specification for Real Time or GTFS-RT (which will
provide the information to Google Maps and some third
party application developers), Passenger Information
Display signs and the RTD website. The GTFS-RT data
feed will be made available in Q4 2015 and will allow
application developers from outside of RTD to access realtime information, incorporate this data into existing and
new apps, and make them available to the public. The
delivery of real-time data to PIDs and the website is
expected to be ready no later than Q2 2016. The majority
of effort in making RTPI available lies in gathering existing
information from various sources, converting this
information into a common format that in turn can feed
multiple end-user sources including mobile devices.
Current scope of the project only includes bus
information. Request is to extend scope to include data
from our LR system. To do so, we need to make
modifications to RTD’s light rail train tracking system
(SCADA) to provide a real-time data feed from track
based on events including when a vehicle passes through
TWC (train to wayside communicator) and the beginning
and end of track segments.

Request is to proceed with the Colfax Avenue Transit
Colfax - East Priority Project. RTD has received a Federal Ladders of
ITS
Opportunity grant to fund a capital project to reduce travel
time and increase security and ridership for 15L bus
route. The project includes: stop amenity improvements
(repair and replace existing amenities, lighting, shelters,
security cameras), bus bulbs at a few locations, transit
signal priority (TSP), and bypass lanes/queue jumps. The
project includes East Colfax from Broadway east to
Potomac (near I-225). It is important to note that from
Yosemite to Potomac, the project will only include
improved stop amenities. RTD local match is $1.83M.

Northwest Rail
Bus Rapid Transit @ SH Project is to construct approximately 18 miles of Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor to connect
Line
119
Boulder and Longmont in accordance with the
recommendation of the Northwest Area Mobility Study
(NAMS). It is anticipated that approximately half of the
total costs for this project would be grant-funded. The
establishment of BRT in the corridor would raise ridership
from approximately 1,900 to approximately 5,000 daily
weekday riders in 2035. Detailed cost estimates and
design will be established through the upcoming
environmental clearance study and preliminary
engineering, previously approved in the SBP. The project
is anticipated to take two years to construct. This request
is for the first year of construction.

DRCOG, through the Transportation Improvement
Districtwide
Program (TIP), has allocated $1 million in funding for FY
2017 for this project. RTD would be required to provide a
25 percent local match of $250,000. Given the results of
the Northwest Area Mobility Study, which showed
substantial bus ridership increases from modest capital
improvements made to arterial corridors, there has been
much interest from other areas of the District for RTD to
make arterial BRT investments in other corridors. The
purpose of this study will be to examine the potential for
arterial BRT investments throughout the entire District and
prioritize for future capital investment those corridors
which perform the highest.

The Denver Multi-Modal Access Plan (DMAP) 2.0 would Districtwide
include a complete street network plan for downtown,
considering vehicular mobility and one-way/two-way
conversion, future transit needs (both bus and rail),
bicycle infrastructure, and signal timing. The original
DMAP (2004) identified the need for a downtown
circulator, which was subsequently included in the
FasTracks program and is now operating as the Free
MetroRide. DMAP 2.0 would be intended to identify future
transit investments in a similar manner.

First and Final Mile
Strategic Plan

This plan would build upon the Bike Parking and
Districtwide
Accessibility Study to develop strategies to improve multimodal accessibility at our stations. The scope of
strategies could include:
- additional bus transfer facilities
- pedestrian improvements
- bike access improvements
- improved bike storage
- expanded or new drop off/pick up areas
- transit speed and reliability improvements on bus routes
connecting to the station
The plan would identify potential partnerships with other
public and private entities to implement these strategies.
Finally, the plan would prioritize potential improvements
based on their impact.

costs for preparing RFQs/RFPs and/or responding to
unsolicited proposals for development on RTD land. Lead
items that need to be addressed in advance of releasing
RFQs/RFPs, in response to proposals from local
jurisdictions, or in response to an unsolicited proposals

Property Survey
Records System-wide

Currently, whenever RTD acquires or disposes off any
Districtwide
property right (fee simple, easement, or license
agreement), it utilizes an external survey firm (Jacobs) to
establish the location of that property right on the ground,
and prepare Right-of-Way maps, legal descriptions and
exhibits. The contract with Jacobs will expire at the end of
2016. Jacobs has surveys, Computer Aided Design (CAD)
files, information on adjoining properties, subdivision
plats, ALTA surveys, legal descriptions, and other records
regarding RTD properties. The extent of this information is
estimated to be 2 to 4 terabytes, which could be equated
to. These documents also include information on utilities.

Office
organization's digital media (specifically websites) to find
information and perform tasks. A website is only
accessible when a person with disabilities can use it as
effectively as a person without disabilities. In 2013, RTD
hired a vendor, Interactive Accessibility, to perform an
assessment of our various digital communication

Asset management, broadly defined, refers to any system District Shops - $
that monitors and maintains things of value to an entity or Operations
group. IT asset management is the set of business
Center
practices that join financial, contractual and inventory
functions to support life cycle management and strategic
decision making for the IT environment. This is also one
of the processes defined within IT service management.
The goal of this project is to replace the current asset
management system, ZenWorks, which is inadequate for
the current and future computing size of the District. A
more robust integrated system is needed. This includes
the tracking of electronic equipment.

RTD relies heavily on its storage units to house 95% of all District Shops - $
District information and computing services. A wide array Operations
of departments and applications use these storage units Center
to store mission-critical data. Computer data storage,
often called storage or memory, is a technology consisting
of computer components and recording media used to
retain digital information. It is a core function of
computers. The central processing unit (CPU) of a
computer is what manipulates raw information by
performing computations. In practice, almost all
computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but
expensive and small storage options close to the CPU
and slower but larger and cheaper options farther away.

IT Managed Services Tier 1 Support

RTD needs technology to operate efficiently and to
Districtwide
compete effectively. But as reliance on IT grows, the
resources needed to support this increasingly complex IT
environment may not. In many areas, IT resources are
limited and can be quickly overwhelmed.
We have seen from prior instances that if we fall behind in
keeping up with things such as backups, patches and
security, the odds greatly increase that RTD will face an
IT outage or another problem down the road that will
negatively impact RTD business. For instance, once RTD
rolls out real- time information to the customer and we
have an outage, it will negatively impact customers' view
of RTD.

Board Meeting Date: August 11, 2015

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the second quarter of 2015 attached.
The U.S. economy expansion accelerated (2.3 percent GDP growth) during the second quarter of 2015.
The unemployment rate declined over the period to 5.3% while general inflationary pressures remain
tame.
In order to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Federal
Reserve chose to continue with its accommodative monetary policy and leave the federal funds target
rate range (0.0% - 0.25%) unchanged during the second quarter. In determining how long to maintain
this target range, the committee will “assess progress—both realized and expected—toward its
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

2nd Quarter

Y-T-D

RTD cash and cash equivalents:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 3-month U.S. T-Bill Index

0.040%
0.005%

Enhanced Cash Tier:
RTD enhanced cash:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index:

Packet Pg. 50

1.C.1

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through the Second quarter of 2015 was 0.40% which
would produce annualized earnings of $793,900. The current return for the month of June was 0.59%.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
2015 OUT of DISTRICT PARKING FEES
AUDIT REPORT# 15-02-06

RTD has established a 'Pay for Parking ' program at bus and light rail stations, focused primarily
on riders who reside outside of the District's boundaries. The program was designed with
several objectives , including the expectation to be "self-sustaining , not requiring general fund
subsidy", when approved by the Board of Directors in 2008.
RTD has contracted with Standard Parking who manages the pay for parking program at RTD
lots within the District's boundaries. They are responsible for installing Pay Stations, collecting
cash fees on a monthly basis, recording electronic payments, and reporting monthly results to
RTD . The contract indicates that RTD will reimburse Standard for any unrecovered losses at the
end of the contract term .

AUDIT SCOPE

The scope of our audit concentrated on activity during the last quarter of 2014 and the first
quarter of 2015 as we evaluated the cost/benefit analysis of charging Bus and LRT riders to
park in RTD stations when the passenger lives outside of the RTD District. Internal Audit also
visited lots in order to observe the actual process of testing vehicles and issuing citations when
appropriate.

CONCLUSION

Internal Audit has suggested that Parking Management utilize RTD Finance and RTD Planning
to jointly develop a complete financial analysis of the program to determine accurate net current
financial results , and potential future benefit to RTD. Internal reporting , which requires review
for completeness , indicates the program has incurred inception-to-date cumulative losses of
over $200,000. In addition , efforts will be pursued to identify any additional legal approaches
which can be utilized to improve collections of the currently outstanding $363,000 in Parking
Citations.

CURRENT STATUS

RTD's Parking Management group will meet with Finance and Planning individuals to develop a
complete financial analysis of the program and evaluate alternatives in an effort to reach breakeven status.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

1.C.3.a

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

Purchasing Cards are intended to be an easy to use, more efficient and cost-effective way to
buy and pay for lower value purchases. RTD participates in the State of Colorado Master
Contract for Credit Card Services via Citibank. At the current time , there are 13 Citibank
'Corporate Cards' assigned to IT employees. Approval limits for purchases generally do not
exceed a $3,000 per individual transaction . The current PCard arrangement generates a semiannual rebate to RTD of approximately 1.7% of purchases.
SCOPE

The scope included review of the transactions from January to November 2014.
All employee PCard statements were included in the review and testing of supporting
documentation and compliance with RTD policies and procedures.
OBJECTIVES

The objectives of the audit were to ensure:
1. Adherence to Purchasing card policies and procedures and
2. Purchasing cards are used for valid business purposes only.
METHODOLOGY

The methodology used to accomplish the objectives of the audit included but were not limited to
the following :
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Reviewed the policies and procedures for RTDs Purchasing cards
Obtained information on all card holders and reviewed related forms .
Obtained lists of all transactions for the period indicated under the scope.
Reviewed all transactions and related documentation to confirm the business purpose.
Interviewed staff to provide further information where needed.
