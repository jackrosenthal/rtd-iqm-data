Others Present:

16th Street Mall Discussion (Rick Clarke)
Henry Stopplecamp, Sr. Manager of Engineering introduced Bruce Abel, Assistant General
Manager of Bus Operations, and Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and
Scheduling. He recognized in the audience John Desmond, Executive Vice President of
Downtown Environment at the Denver Downtown Partnership (DDP) and George Delaney,
Chief Operations Officer for City and County of Denver’s Department of Public Works
(Denver). Henry Stopplecamp said both John Desmond and George Delaney could provide
insight into the discussion on behalf of their organizations.
Henry Stopplecamp reviewed the 16th Street Mall presentation included in the Study
Session Agenda Packet for March 31, 2015. He said the presentation would cover the
history of the Mall: where it was, where we are, and where we are going.
Henry Stopplecamp pointed out that prior to the Mall, 16th Street was packed wall to wall
with buses. He noted that once the Mall was completed there were almost immediate
problems with the pavers. Bruce Abel added that the Mall Shuttle is a continuation of
passengers’ trips; the Mall Shuttle intercepts trips from the north at Denver Union Station
(originally Market Street Station) and trips from the south at Civic Center Station,
removing those regional buses from downtown traffic. Jessie Carter said that the Mall
Shuttle has 45,000 weekday boardings, 24,000 Saturday boardings, and 19,000 Sunday
boardings.
Henry Stopplecamp recognized Stan Szabelak, Engineering Project Manager; Cory Granrud,
Park-n-Ride Design Manager; and Jeff Cluphf, Park-n-Ride Construction Manager as the
main staff who works with the Mall.
Henry Stopplecamp ended the presentation noting the Mall’s current projects:
 Ongoing maintenance - He noted that the average maintenance spending is $1
million. The total in 2014 was $1.5 million. The City and County of Denver will
pay 30% up to $300,000.
 Reconstruction project of 3.5 blocks – RTD received a Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) grant for $8 million with a local match shared by RTD,
Denver, and DDP of $2 million for a total of $10 million for reconstruction and
maintenance.
He added that looking forward to the new line openings, the over 40 bus routes that
currently intersect downtown, and the buses that arrive and depart from both Denver

Union Station and Civic Center Station, the Mall will have even more value for connecting
passengers.
Chair Sisk encouraged the Directors to use the Study Session to learn about the Mall by
asking questions to staff and the Denver and DDP representatives.

Director Lasater wondered what happened in 1987 for RTD to take over the maintenance
of the transit lanes when the original contract had Denver as the responsible party. Henry
Stopplecamp replied that it was an agreement between RTD and Denver. Marla Lien,
General Counsel, added that the agreement was part of a settlement with I.M. Pei. RTD
agreed to receive the funds and take care of the transit way maintenance. That was the
fund that expired in 2012 leading to a new maintenance agreement. She added that all
we currently have is the agreement, but she thinks maybe RTD thought it was a good deal
at the time. Henry Stopplecamp said that we have the decisions that were made and it is
up to the current leadership to decide how to move forward. George Delaney agreed that
in the settlement the money would go to RTD and RTD would then take care of the transit
lanes. He concurred that at the time RTD probably thought this to be a good deal.
Director Lasater expressed that he is wrestling with understanding why the 1987
agreement was presented in a way that implied RTD has always been responsible for the
maintenance.
Director Lubow asked for confirmation that a concrete transit way would be cheaper to
maintain than the granite transit way. Henry Stopplecamp confirmed that was correct.
Director Lubow asked what stopped RTD from replacing the transit way. Marla Lien
replied that the transit way is part of the Mall, which does not belong to RTD. Henry
Stopplecamp added that the transit way is a city street. He believes Denver is willing to
look at alternatives; however, there is a historic issue and a 2012 FTA grant to replace the
mall in kind. John Desmond explained that in 2009-2010 there was an extensive
collaborative public process. The conclusion of that 2 year process was a community
consensus to rebuild the transit lanes in granite. Director Lubow asked Henry
Stopplecamp to summarize the cost difference between concrete and granite for
replacement and maintenance. Henry Stopplecamp said that it costs about $1.5 million to
repair a block of transit lanes with the granite pavers. The Mall has 12.5 blocks, so that
would be a cost of about $20 million. He added that some blocks have had to be replaced
5 times in the span of 10 years. He said that the granite is not holding up and that
maintenance crews are out on the Mall 7 days a week. Henry Stopplecamp noted that
gray concrete would cost $400,000 per block to install on the transit ways, $700,000 for

electronically ahead of time so she can be prepared for the meeting with all the pertinent
information.

stylized concrete to replicate the current design. George Delaney added that Denver
estimates $5,000 a year per lane per mile for maintenance, estimating that the
maintenance of the Mall transit ways would be a little over $10,000 annually for both
lanes. Henry Stopplecamp emphasized that these numbers are not backed up by an
official design, so they could be higher or lower. Director Lubow pointed out that
comparatively the cost of concrete is nothing when compared to the cost of granite. She
asked if she heard correctly that Denver was looking at alternative materials as well.
George Delaney replied that Denver has looked at many options; yet at the end of the day
the community consensus was to keep the granite pavers. He added that he was not sure
what direction Denver would take.
Director Walker wondered what other entities needed to take action in order to make a
decision on the Mall. Henry Stopplecamp said that it is a city street so the main decision
would come from Denver. George Delaney said that changing from granite to concrete
could jeopardize the $10 million FTA grant awarded to replace the pavers. He noted that
Mayor Hancock is aware of the community consensus and has asked staff to keep moving
in that direction. Henry Stopplecamp clarified that the Federal grant was for $8 million
and that the other $2 million was a local match. He pointed out that RTD and Denver
could go back and ask the FTA a “what if?” regarding switching to concrete knowing that
the reply could go either way. Staff is working under the 2012 recommendation approved
by the Board to replace the pavers. Director Walker said that from his perspective it
seems like the historical importance of the Mall lies on the design, not the material. He
added that he was in favor of starting the conversation with the FTA or any other
appropriate entities. George Delaney noted that Denver will replace the intersections in
concrete. The sidewalks, medians, water fountains, etc., will remain granite pavers.
Director Francone asked if the 2012 Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) articulated who
maintains the transit way. Marla Lien answered that it designates RTD to maintain the
transit way and Denver to contribute towards maintenance. Director Francone wondered
if staff had an idea of the lifetime of concrete lanes. George Delaney said that Denver
estimates the lifetime of concrete to be 30 years. Director Francone inquired regarding
safety concerns of granite versus concrete. She said that from personal experience the
granite could be a bit dicey when wet. Bruce Abel replied that an advantage to concrete
would be better traction in wet weather. He added that he would not call it a safety
issue.
Director Hoy restated that where we are today is that the community consensus is granite
and RTD decided to take responsibility for the maintenance. He added that if desired,
there was enough money to replace the transit lanes in concrete through the FTA grant
and local match. He wondered what it would take to replace the transit lanes in a
concrete that replicates the current design. Henry Stopplecamp confirmed that there was

Director Solano said that he has spoken with various companies that could pre-make
stamped slabs of concrete and deliver them instead of having to pour on the street. He
wondered if that was a real possibility. Henry Stopplecamp said that it would be possible.
The big issue is preparing the location and anchoring the 12 feet slabs unto the existing
system. He said much of the existing infrastructure would need to be removed. Director
Solano encouraged the staff and Directors to consider the short term versus the long term.
He said that it may cost more to switch to concrete now, but in the long run there will be
savings.
Director James said he is pleased this conversation is going on. He recalled joining the
Mall’s steering committee 5 years ago. He finds all the components (historic, Denver,
FTA, cost effectiveness) fascinating. He thanked staff for examining the possibilities that
include replicating the design. He exhorted staff to work with stakeholders to reopen the
conversation and process. Chair Sisk reminded the Directors that there are no motions to
be made during a Study Session but he trusts that staff received the message. Phil
Washington added that staff is prepared to do that.
Director Bagley inquired how much of the current FTA grant has been spent. Henry
Stopplecamp replied that a little over $1 million has been spent. Director Bagley reminded
the Directors that there is a process to go through, which includes exploring thoughts with
Denver, conversations with Historic Denver, asking the FTA about terminating further
work and/or reusing the grant for a different purpose, restarting the
collaborative/community process from 5 years ago, among others. He said that the
process would take a minimum of 6-12 months. Director Bagley emphasized that this is
not an RTD Board decision, but a decision of all the entities involved, which makes the
process time consuming. Henry Stopplecamp agreed with the timeframe explained by
Director Bagley. Henry Stopplecamp said that the conversation with the FTA has to be
immediate. He said he would follow up with partners with the goal of achieving a
sustainable 16th Street Transit Way. Phil Washington added that a case to the FTA is
always stronger if presented with partners and a formal plan.
Chair Sisk thanked the representatives from Denver and the DDP for attending the Study
Session. He encouraged the Directors and staff to not be stopped by the current FTA

Packet Pg. 8

almost enough money to do so. He added that staff has looked at stamped concrete,
even having a presentation a couple of weeks ago exploring that option. This would
involve mixing granite in the top layer and scoring it to make it look like stones. There will
be another meeting early next month to keep exploring this option. Director Hoy
wondered, since Denver is reconstructing intersections, if maybe one of the intersections
could be a test area of the stamped concrete. He said that this may be a way to explore
durability and community reaction.

6.A

Director Anderson shared that this is a great opportunity to work with our partners in
Denver. She agreed with Chair Sisk in the need for sensitivity. She mentioned that she
has lived in the Denver area all her life and understands how important the historical
aspect is. Director Anderson said that a great case can be made regarding something
more durable and less expensive. She encouraged the staff and Board to work
cooperatively with Denver and the Mall stakeholders. She hopes that the FTA will
recognize the group effort.
Director Tobiassen asked George Delaney what Denver’s long term vision is for the Mall.
George Delaney replied that he has not been part of all the conversations. He suggested
that perhaps Brad Buchanan, Director of Denver’s Department of Community Planning and
Development, would have a better understanding of the discussions that have been going
on. Henry Stopplecamp added that staff has been working with Denver in the revisioning
process. He said that RTD has raised our concerns. There will be a meeting next week
which will hopefully address those concerns. He stressed that RTD’s priority is its
patrons.
Director Menten noted that regarding the conversation to be had with the FTA, the two
main phrases she heard were “in kind” and “sustainability”. She said that with the “in
kind” aspect we would probably be fine because the transit way will still remain a bus
transit way. The “sustainability” aspect is different because obviously the granite is
proving to not be sustainable. She hopes the FTA would be thrilled with a better
sustainability plan. Henry Stopplecamp said that staff hopes for the same. He added that
in the application staff had to explain the sustainability aspect on the maintenance process
(cleaning, polishing the bottom of the pavers, reset them) and explain that if there is no
work done the Mall would fall apart. Director Menten asked where the Fixed Guide
funding went to. Marla Lien clarified that there are two types of funding: the FTA grant
for capital funding and the Fixed Guideway Modernization Fund. The latter is received on
a recurring basis. Henry Stopplecamp replied that the Fixed Guideway Modernization
Fund, which amounts to about $9 million annually, goes to RTD operations.
Director Menten mentioned that Director Walker had shown her pictures of the Nicollet
Mall in Minneapolis. He shared with her about different accidents that have happened at
the Nicollet Mall due to traffic. She wondered how many incidents have happened on the
Mall because of people not knowing they are walking into transit ways. Bruce Abel replied

grant when seeking sustainable options for the Mall. He emphasized the need for
cooperation when maintaining the whole Mall: transit ways, median, and sidewalks. He
said that RTD has the fiduciary need to look at the Mall maintenance from a long term
perspective. He noted that he is in favor of working with the FTA and stakeholders to
work a plan that would make sense for 2015.

6.A

Director Walker said that he lived in Minneapolis in the 1980’s. He noted that the area
has changed drastically. He pointed out that the Nicollet Mall and the 16th Street Mall are
different. He asked if the condition of the concrete base of the Mall is in good shape.
Henry Stopplecamp said that a test study a couple years ago showed that the concrete
base was in good shape. Director Walker expressed that this is an opportunity to do
something good and partner with the other stakeholders. He hopes the other
stakeholders also see this in the same way. He added that the public is not “our”
customers or “their” customers; we are all one big happy family.
Director James acknowledged the DDP’s encouragement of economic development on the
Mall. He said that revisiting the sustainability conversation could be an opportunity to
stimulate private sector investment and the Mall’s economy. He noted that the
conversation needs to include both maintenance and capital improvements. He reminded
the Directors that the Mall is somewhat divided into two: transit way and
sidewalks/median. Director James asked what kind of window RTD has in the FTA grant
schedule to talk about possible changes. Henry Stopplecamp replied that RTD has put out
a bid for reconstruction following the current maintenance guidelines. The reconstruction
will only be for the transit lanes. The Board approved the IGA regarding funding for the
reconstruction of the transit lanes. The goal is to have a contract set by June. Staff
would like to continue this process while simultaneously exploring options with the FTA.
He added that if the current plan was put on hold there would be the risk of losing the
construction season and no work at all would be done on the Mall. Director James agreed
with staff’s plan.
Director Folska confirmed that the granite transit lanes start on the west side of Broadway
and end on the east side of Market Street. She asked if there were plans to extend the
granite and/or granite look towards Chestnut Place. Henry Stopplecamp said that RTD
does not have that in our plans. John Desmond said that the area west of Market Street
was added in 1992. It is a mixture of sandstone and concrete with 3 lanes. There are
unfunded plans to widen the sidewalks in that area, but Denver has no plans to extend the
granite or rebuild the concrete at this time. He added that the Downtown Denver Business
Improvement District (DDBI) takes care of maintaining the Mall, including cleaning and
snow removal of the transit way.
Director Folska asked if I.M. Pei was fired from the original contract. John Desmond
replied that after the original design I. M. Pei was not hired again. Laurie Ollen, who
worked with I. M. Pei on the original design, was hired as a consultant later on.

Packet Pg. 10

that pedestrian/traffic incidents on the Mall are relatively low. He added that of course
anything for safety would be an improvement.

6.A

Director Solano wondered if there are any records of all slip and fall incidents on the Mall.
Marla Lien replied that RTD would not be aware of such incidents since it is not our street
therefore we would not be notified. Director Solano asked if Denver could provide that
information. George Delaney replied that he could ask but he was not sure if Denver has
such record. Director Solano said that if the information does exist it would be helpful to
have it in graph form.

Director Menten wondered if there was any feedback from business owners along the Mall
regarding the shuttles driving shoppers away from their shops. She asked about the
possibility of the shuttle stopping every three blocks allowing people to walk a bit further
and do stop at various shops along their walk. John Desmond said that the jury is out on
that topic. Stops at every intersection and stops every so many intersections both have
pros and cons. He added that this is one of the topics being studied by DDP’s current
study of Downtown Denver. Director Menten asked John Desmond when DDP is
expecting the results of the current study. John Desmond replied that they should have
the recommendations in the next few months. Director Menten asked DDP to share their
recommendations with the RTD Directors. She asked staff to give an update of the
conversation of the Study Session to Historic Denver as a heads up since there are no
representatives present.
Phil Washington suggested looking at the financial impact of the Mall Shuttle stoppage of
2006 to study the effects of the Mall Shuttle. The mall is 12% of RTD’s total ridership.
Not having that ridership would impact the Federal funding formula. Bruce Abel added
that both Engineering and Bus Operations are in conversations with Denver about the
transit on the Mall. He noted that there are a high number of wheel chair boardings on the
Mall Ride. Jessie Carter confirmed that there are about 230 wheelchair boardings per
weekday.
Director Anderson asked to not consider changing the stops on the Mall. She said it
would be inconsiderate to our passengers to do so. She could not agree more with taking
care of those who cannot walk or even ride their bicycles on the Mall.
Director Folska confirmed that it costs about $11.8 million to operate the Mall Shuttle,
with $9 million provided by Federal funding. She asked who provided the difference.
Bruce Abel replied that the rest of the funding comes from the RTD general fund and the
Sales & Use Tax. Director Folska asked about the cost of operating the Free Metro Ride.
Bruce Abel answered that the 2014 allocation model has not been set. He added that the
cost of vehicles and the capital improvements to start operating the Free Metro Ride was

John Desmond clarified that the DDBI is managed by the DDP and it is not part of Historic
Denver.

about $10 million. Henry Stopplecamp added that the Free Metro Ride only operates on
weekdays during peak hours, so the cost to operate is less than the Mall Shuttle.
Chair Sisk thanked the Directors, staff, and guests for their time and hopes to be in
conversations with all of our partners soon. Henry Stopplecamp told the Directors that he
is available for one on one conversation with more in depth information. He added that he
would keep the Directors updated on upcoming conversations with partners.

Other Matters
Director Hoy informed the Directors that former Director Barry Gore is undergoing intense
treatment for a rare form of lymphoma.

B. Citizens Advisory Committee
Committee Chair Hoy introduced Cynthia Stovall and Bob Rizzuto, FasTracks
Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC) Co-chairs, who would be providing the Board
with an update of their activities.
Cynthia Stovall shared that the CAC had a very exciting quarterly meeting at the
Anschutz Medical Campus. There was a presentation on I-225 and the East Rail
Line as well as discussion related to the bus/rail connections. There was also
someone from CU who was working to establish their internal shuttle service for
the campus and a representative for the VA. She noted that there were students,
faculty, staff, doctors, etc. as well as owners of the adjacent businesses in
attendance. Cynthia Stovall stated that the meeting was more focused on
constituents’ concerns as opposed to the specific progress of the lines in the area.
Cynthia Stovall commented that this was one of the most well attended CAC
meetings in terms of the constituents. The CAC will be discussing this at their next
monthly meeting to identify ways they can engage the constituents in the future.
Cynthia Stovall thanked the Directors for their participation in the 2-on-1 meetings.
It is very beneficial to hear the Directors concerns and understand the issues in
their communities.
Cynthia Stovall recognized General Manager Washington for everything he has done
for the region, but especially for his work with the CAC. She said that he has been
a great partner to work with and very involved with the CAC’s activities.

Committee Chair Hoy recognized that the meeting at Anschutz sounded very
productive and was very uplifting for the CAC. He is happy with the turnout from
the community.

Director Bagley mentioned that he recently had his 2-on-1 lunch with Melvin Bush
and Tyler Kealy. They shared with him the participation and discussions that
occurred at the Anschutz meeting; he believes it is a great model for the CAC’s
future outreach meetings. Director Bagley recognized how engaged and interested
both Melvin and Tyler are in the CAC’s activities and their concern for what will
happen to the CAC in the future. He stated that the entire Board is concerned
about what happens to the CAC in the future as RTD finishes construction.
Director Tobiassen thanked Vivian Stovall and Deborah Wilcox for their time in
meeting with him. He appreciates everything the CAC is doing, especially
journeying out to Anschutz for their quarterly meeting. He said he was at the
beginning of the meeting and the turnout was really amazing.
Committee Chair Hoy asked for further clarification about the shuttle that the
University of Colorado (CU) was planning to operate; it was his understanding that
CU indicated the shuttle would serve the entire area, not just the University, when
the Board approved the re-alignment of the line. He requested a copy of the letter
that CU read at a Board meeting regarding the shuttle. Rick Clarke, Assistant
General Manager of Capital Programs, stated that staff would send the Board a
copy of the letter.
Director Deadwyler expressed her appreciation that the Anschutz meeting ended up
being more of a constituent focused meeting. She recognized that people are
concerned about what will happen to the CAC in the future; she does not think that
RTD can let them disappear. RTD needs to be using them to continue to get
feedback from the constituents.

C. Recommended Actions

• Station Names on North Metro Rail Line
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors accept and approve the revised final station names for the North
Metro Rail Line:
48th & Brighton Blvd at National Western Center;
Packet Pg. 15

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 7, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska inquired about the transportation solution provided by the VA for
their medical center. Cynthia Stovall stated that the VA did not have a solution so
much as a conclusion that veterans would not be the ones using public
transportation to get to their facility. It would only be staff riding so navigating
from the Rail Line to the entrance would not be a problem. She explained that the
University has submitted a grant application to run their own shuttle, but it would
only serve their facilities, not the VA medical center.

Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the April 21, 2015 Board
meeting.

Discussion:

Brenda Tierney, North Metro Line Community Involvement
Project Manager, stated that during the Environmental Impact
Statement process the station names were chosen for
planning purposes. She explained that at this point in the
design each jurisdiction is given a copy of RTD’s station
naming policy and we request their feedback. She said that
there were several requested changes from the jurisdictions,
which were consistent with our policy, so staff is
recommending that we accept the requests.
Director Lasater believes this might cause request from our
southern communities related to the stations along their lines.
He wonders if we will work with them on any requests they
might have to change the station names. Brenda Tierney
explained that the communities along the Southeast and
Southwest line were provided with the same opportunity as
those along the North Metro Line. She stated that at this
point they could make a request to change a name but there
would be a cost to do so as we would need to change
signage, maps, etc.
Chair Sisk noted that Denver is contributing funds in excess of
the required local match. He wondered if staff could tell him
how much. Chair Sisk also commended staff for working with
the local governments to include them in the naming process.
He thinks this is a great way to garner community
involvement. Ashland Vaughn, North Metro Engineering
Project Manager, stated that staff is currently working with
Denver of a memorandum of understanding to finalize the
details but they should be contributing around $4 million.
Director Menten stated that she does not agree with some of
the changes requested by Thornton. She expressed concern
that these names are not easily recognizable to the everyday
rider that is not familiar with Thornton. She said that for this
reason she will be voting no. Brenda Tierney stated that
Packet Pg. 16

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 7, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

6.B

Thornton had gone through an extensive vetting process of
the names; they provided RTD with thorough explanations that
made sense and fit with in the policy so staff accepted the
requests.

Director Solano expressed concern over the Thornton names.
He feels they do not reflect the other communities in Adams
County that the line will serve. He stated that he will vote no.
Director Anderson said that she is in support of this motion;
this is one way that RTD can demonstrate to our partners in
the different communities that we listen to their input. She
thinks it is a great way to show our support for our partners.

D. Updates

• Aurora Line/I-225 Rail Construction Update
Chuck Culig, I-225 Project Manager, reviewed a Power Point presentation
with the Board that is available in the April 7, 2015 FasTracks Monitoring
Committee Agenda Packet. Chuck Culig said that the project is 56%
complete. The first substation has been installed, catenary poles and wire
are being installed throughout Area A, and ballast and rail are being installed
throughout Area B. The Iliff Station is nearly complete and the Florida
Avenue and 13th Avenue stations are progressing well. Chuck Culig noted
that all the light rail bridges are at least in some stage of construction but
many are complete. He shared that work has moved to the Aurora Metro
City Center along Exposition, which is the area that will have the biggest
impact on the public and the City.
Chuck Culig shared that his team is also working extensively on public
information and outreach. There are weekly closure/construction emails,
stakeholder meetings, community presentations and various news stories

Packet Pg. 17

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 7, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Hoy noted that the Thornton names may not
have significance for everyone but they are very significant for
the people of Thornton.

and videos. He said that the team will continue to do community/business
meetings and presentations and will begin public tours on May 21. There
will also be a Celebrating Progress Event on April 30 that all Directors are
invited to.

Committee Chair Hoy thanked him for his presentation. He said it is always
exciting to see things actually happening with girders being set and rail being
laid.
Director Folska said she appreciates Chuck Culig’s thorough presentations
and really enjoys working with him. She also appreciates the safety efforts
of the entire team. Director Folska noted that recently there was a problem
with a substation that caused a domino effect, resulting in all of our train
lines being down. She wondered what lessons we have learned from that
outage that can be incorporated on the I-225 Line. Rick Clarke recognized
that there was a cascading failure of the substations last week; the
engineers are working to pinpoint the cause but it was an anomaly that
should not have happened.
Director Tobiassen commended the I-225 project team for their work,
especially the Public Information people. They are everywhere, all the time,
attending public meetings, fare studies, etc. He commented that the City of
Aurora has been incredibly helpful as well with the Channel 8 weekly TV
updates. Aurora is also in the process of hiring a parking manager,
recognizing that they will probably need parking in addition to that provided
by RTD. He said that there has really been a lot of community involvement
up and down the entire corridor.
Director Anderson shared that it had been quite some time since she was in
the area but she was very impressed with the work that was going on when
she drove through there recently. She thanked Kiewit for their safety record
and commitment to the SBE and WIN participation.
Director Lasater inquired about the track alignment near Peoria and
Fitzsimons. He said that it appears the track flyover will end up running into
some of the buildings of the storage facility in the area. He recognized the
great work the entire team was doing on the project. Chuck Culig explained
that eventually some of the buildings would be torn down but the relocation

Packet Pg. 18

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 7, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Chuck Culig pointed out that the SBE Participation Goal for Kiewit is 25%.
Their commitment to-date is 27% so they are on track to exceed the goal.
He noted there are 170 SBE firms on the I-225 line totaling approximately
$59 million in payments to-date. Chuck Culig said that in addition to the
SBE firms there are 137 WIN participants working on the project.

6.B

process took time. He said that construction should begin again on the
flyover shortly.

Director Menten inquired if there were any quiet zones along the line. She
reminded everyone that there were some issues with this along the West
Line; she believes it would be better to address this as part of the planning
rather than when the line is operational. Director Menten wonders what the
Morris Heights Neighborhood Association’s concerns are. Chuck Culig noted
that staff is having a follow-up meeting with them and he will provide
Director Menten with details after the meeting.
Committee Chair Hoy thanked Chuck Culig for such a positive, upbeat
update.

Director Deadwyler shared that a few weeks ago she was concerned that
this project might not finish on-time; however, she drove by the other day
and saw a lot of work happening, so she was very impressed. She pointed
out that the bridge going over Colfax has been constructed but there is
nothing connected to either end. She inquired when that would happen so
Colfax could be reopened. Chuck Culig stated that Colfax is closed due to a
CDOT project, which is the reason we built the bridge well before we were
ready to connect it to the track.

B. Recommended Actions

• Station Naming for Boulder Junction and Boulder Transit Center
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors accept and approve the proposed station names for the
RTD transit facilities in Boulder as follows:
a) The new transit facility located at Boulder Junction at Depot Square shall
be designated as Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station; and,
b) The current Boulder Transit Center located at 14th/Walnut shall be
renamed as Downtown Boulder Station.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the April 21, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Nadine Lee, Project Manager for US36, explained that she was
presenting this recommended action because the US36 Bus
Rapid Transit Team needs to know the naming of the Boulder
stations in order to move forward with signage, schedules,
etc. She referenced the Boulder Transit Facility Names
presentation sent to the Directors prior to the Board meeting.
The presentation is available in the Planning and Development
Agenda Packet for April 7, 2015. The presentation included a
rationale for the chosen names, RTD’s naming policy, example
of signage, and an overview of the Boulder Junction Transit
Village Area Plan. Nadine Lee mentioned that she had received
communication from the City of Boulder that morning

Chair Sisk thanked the RTD Staff, Nadine Lee, and Scott Reed,
Assistant General Manager of Communications, for the
meeting in Boulder the night prior to the Planning and
Development Committee meeting. Chair Sisk said that the
name suggestion was this late because it was a long process
with the local stakeholders. The City of Boulder really
supports the suggested name. He pointed out that “Boulder
Junction at Depot Square Station” is consistent with the
naming conventions along the North Metro Line and
demonstrates shared values between the communities and
RTD.
Director Hoy wished he had an opportunity to talk to Chair
Sisk about this earlier. He asked if Depot Square is a
commercial entity. Marla Lien, General Counsel, explained
that Depot Square is the name of the development and the
condominium association RTD is part of. She asked Director
Hoy if he was thinking about naming rights. Director Hoy said
that was correct. He wondered if there could potentially be a
sign with the name Depot Square on the property. Marla Lien
replied that potentially since that is the name of the
condominium association. Director Hoy expressed his concern
that the conversation up to now has been that for a
commercial entity to have their name on an RTD facility they
must pay, (i.e., the naming rights process). Marla Lien
clarified that the Depot Square name also belongs to RTD as
the agency is part of the condominium declaration. Director
Hoy wondered if that was part of the reason to have RTD be
part of the condominium association. He said he was not
arguing against the proposal, he just wanted a point of
clarification. He apologized to Chair Sisk while saying he
would probably vote no at this time while he seeks more
information from staff and legal counsel.
Committee Chair James asked Nadine Lee if the City of
Boulder had proposed “Boulder Junction at Depot Square” or
“Depot Square at Boulder Junction”. Nadine replied that they
had suggested both and deferred to RTD to choose one. She
anticipates that naming the station “Boulder Junction at Depot
Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 7, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

indicating that their preference was to name the “Boulder
Junction Station” the “Boulder Junction at Depot Square
Station” or “Depot Square at Boulder Junction”. Directors
Bagley and Anderson consented to adding the new proposed
name as an amendment. Committee Chair James declared
the amendment accepted as there were no objections.

6.C

Director Menten mentioned that on the West Corridor there
was confusion at the station platforms while looking for a
particular station on the fare machines. She mentioned that
people would look under “U” for “Union Station” but it would
appear under “D” for “Denver Union Station”. She said this is
also an issue with the “Lakewood at Wadsworth Station”
since most people were looking just for “Wadsworth”. She
wondered how to make it easier for the passengers. Rick
Clarke, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs,
explained that the machines have already been reprogramed so
that stations may be searched by the first letter of any part of
the name. He added that the system will be uploaded in that
manner at the new stations. He noted that Downtown
Littleton had the same problem. Rick Clarke said that if the
new fare structure is approved there would not be a need to
search for a specific station.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED.

• Option to Purchase Real Property at 350 S. Santa Fe Drive (“Bus Barn”)
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager and CEO and/or his
designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary for the grant of
an option, and for the sale, including execution of any deeds and other
property conveyance documents for the purchase of the real property
located at 350 S. Santa Fe Drive (the “Bus Barn Property”).
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the April 21, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Kate Iverson, Manager of Transit Oriented-Development,
mentioned that in August, 2014, RTD received an unsolicited
proposal from D4 Urban, LLC (D4) for the Bus Barn site. RTD
Packet Pg. 23

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 7, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Square” would end up being colloquially shortened to “Boulder
Junction”.

issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) and received a proposal
from D4 and a letter of interest from the Colorado Department
of Transportation (CDOT). RTD staff met with the Directors
during Executive Session on March 3, 2015 and received
direction to move forward with negotiations with D4 for the
sale of the Bus Barn Property. She mentioned that staff
recommends to offer an option to purchase to expire on
December 21, 2017. This would give D4 the time necessary
to work with third parties for different types of approvals.
During this time, RTD could not enter into any agreement that
would give another party the right to purchase or lease any
portion of the Bus Barn Property. Kate Iverson added that the
purchase price would be established when the option is
exercised by a fair market value appraisal through an
independent party. D4 would pay RTD $10,000 in
consideration of RTD’s granting the option. She added that
the way the agreement is structured does not require any
specifics in terms of land use; it just requires D4 to buy it.
The City and County of Denver (Denver) would have to
approve any site plans.
Director Folska shared her excitement over the possibility of
D4 buying the property. She said that since D4 was able to
put a 60 inch pipe under the railroads they would have no
problem to putting in a connection over the railroads to the
Alameda light rail station.
Director Lubow said that she was in favor of the
recommended action. She expressed her concern over the
fact that the purchase price would be set upon appraisal. She
wondered who will do the appraisal and how any disputes
would be handled. Kate Iverson replied that staff is finalizing a
dispute resolution procedure which will include best practices.
The procedure will be included in the agreement. Marla Lien
added that the appraisal will be done by a third party.
Director Lubow asked Kate Iverson to summarize why staff
was pursuing a sole source option for this agreement. Kate
Iverson answered that this is not a sole source process
because once the unsolicited proposal was received, an RFP
was issued. D4 submitted a proposal and CDOT submitted a
letter of interest. Staff pursued D4’s proposal. The
agreement being drafted addresses some of the concerns staff
had from D4’s original proposal. Kate Iverson added that a
sole source process would mean a determination prior to a
competitive process. Director Lubow reiterated that we are
Packet Pg. 24

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 7, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

6.C

6.C

dealing with 1 company after issuing a competitive process.
Committee Chair James stated that the RFP exposed the
property to the market and the result was the original D4
proposal.

Director Bagley pointed out that the aerial photos included in
the packet are not updated since they do not include the
current roadway construction for the I-25 exit. He pointed the
Directors to the survey plans included in the packet for an
updated view of the area. He recalled that 6 years ago when
he was first elected as a Director with Director James and
Director Tobiassen there were plans for this property with
another entity but those plans fell through. He noted that this
means work on this property will probably go beyond 8 years.
Director Bagley added that RTD was lucky to not have done
anything with the property back then because of all the
drainage work done in the area over the years.
Director Francone asked if the agreement was strictly a right
to purchase and not develop. Kate Iverson said that once they
close on the property they can start developing. Marla Lien
added the only thing D4 would have the ability to do on the
property during the agreement time would be inspections.
Director Francone asked if staff foresees any potential use of
the property that may be inconsistent with the Alameda light
rail station. Kate Iverson said that she did not think so. She
added that the property has been rezoned by Denver and any
use of the property needs to be approved by the City Planning
Department.
Chair Sisk said that he is in support of the recommended
action. He noted that the devil is in the details once the
option is exercised. Kate Iverson said that staff understood
his concern.
Chair Sisk wondered if D4 would be able to assign the
property to a different entity. Kate Iverson replied that D4 has
the right to form an entity for the purpose of development but
the entity has to be completely controlled by D4. Marla Lien
added that the process described by Kate Iverson is a common
process for financing and development purposes in order to
minimize liability for the parent company.

C. Updates

• Local Government Update - CRL Associates
Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, introduced Roger Sherman
from CRL Associates.
Roger Sherman said he wanted to address 4 items. The first item is the
General Manager (GM) transition. He noted that this item is of interest to
the local governments and key stakeholders throughout the region. He
pointed out that stakeholders who participated in the 2009 GM Transition
process praised RTD for its transparency then and look forward to the same
process during the current transition.
The second item Roger Sherman addressed was the Metro Mayor Caucus on
March 25th. He said that GM Phil Washington was recognized during the
meeting. There was a construction defects update which will be expanded
on during the State Government update. He noted that the Metro
Transportation District (MTD) was revisited as a discussion topic.
The third item is the Denver elections. Roger Sherman said that the ballots
will be in the mail next week. He pointed out that transit and growth are a
hot issue for all the races as well as the current City Council; the latter
having just voted on an On Demand transportation bill. He added that if a
candidate does not receive 50% plus 1 votes there will be a runoff election
the month after.

Director Solano participated via phone.

6.D

The final item Roger Sherman addressed is the November municipal
elections. He said that RTD will lose some supportive mayors as they are
term limited. He noted that it will be interesting to watch how the races
play out.

Director Solano thanked Roger Sherman for the succinct and informative
report.
Committee Chair Folska asked Roger Sherman to define “On Demand”
transportation. Roger Sherman said that he probably could not do it very
well, but from what he can observe it has to do with utilizing technology to
provide more transportation options. Committee Chair Folska added that
“On Demand” to her means personal transportation and to think that public
transportation would be able to provide such service might be erroneous.
Roger Sherman pointed out that is the language the Denver City Council is
using. Transportation is of importance to the City Council and they are
spending time learning from other cities.
Committee Chair Folska thanked Roger Sherman and CRL Associates for
their assistance in the strategic planning of the GM selection process.
Director James provided clarification on “On Demand”. He said that other
cities are using On Demand transportation as a hybrid of Uber/Lyft and
airport shuttles. It utilizes smart phone data to place the services where the
demand would be. It asks users to walk a couple of blocks and share rides.
He noted that Councilmember Mary Beth Susman has been one of the most
active in the council in regard to utilizing shared resources.
Director Solano said that utilizing technology for these purposes makes
sense.

• State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs
Jenifer Brandeberry from Brandeberry~McKenna distributed to the Board
copies of Governor Hickenlooper’s Stand Up 4 Transportation Day
proclamation. She noted that the General Assembly is two thirds of the
way through. She pointed out that the Senate passed the state budget last
week. Jenifer Brandeberry does not anticipate any changes as the budget
moves through the House of Representatives.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 7, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow wondered if the MTD conversation includes funding for the
Northwest rail line. Roger Sherman explained that the MTD itself has not
had their first meeting. He added that he could not see it not be part of the
discussion.

6.D

She noted that Senate Bill 221 passed. This was the bill John Tarbert,
Transit Police Chief, worked on. The bill cleans up police officer statutes as
it pertains to transit agencies.

The Senate Bill Roger Sherman referred to during his update as the
construction defects bill is Senate Bill 177: Owner occupied housing. The
bill will be discussed on Friday, April 10th.
Jenifer Brandeberry added that they continue to monitor other bills, including
the workforce bills due to the WIN program.
Director Solano said that he appreciates Brandeberry~McKenna’s work.
Chair Sisk expressed his gratitude to Brandeberry~McKenna, CRL
Associates, and Squire Patton Boggs. He said that RTD is fortunate to have
such capable people as liaisons with the State Legislation. He wondered
who was sponsoring the homeless bill. Jenifer Brandeberry replied that
Representative Joe Salazar and Senator John Kefalas. She added that the
bill is based on a national piece of legislation that has the goal to help
homelessness. She noted that locally Denver and Boulder have made
progressive strides in providing services. She pointed out that this may be
part of the reason why the bill keeps getting bounced back.
Director Menten asked for specific examples on how Senate Bill 221 affects
the jurisdiction of RTD police. Chief Tarbert explained that the bill simplified
the wording of the original law. He added that RTD will never have a large
police force but it does need friends within the District. The bill allows for
RTD police and off duty police officers working for RTD to cross jurisdictions
within the District in order to do their job more efficiently. Director Menten
asked if RTD needed police officers for fare enforcement and how many
people are on an average checking fares. Chief Tarbert replied that police
officers are not needed but they can also do fare enforcement. He noted
that, for example, the Southeast corridor has 7 officers working on the
alignment. Off duty police officers currently must exit the train at the end of
their jurisdiction. Fare inspectors can travel throughout the line.
Director Solano said that from his criminal justice background he
understands the problem of fare jumpers.

She pointed out House Bill 1264: the Homeless Person Bill of Rights. It is
calendared for next week. She added that the bill has a fiscal note attached
to it. The Colorado Municipal League and other entities are opposed to the
bill because they believe navigating homeless services should be a municipal
function. The way the bill is currently written may steer folks away from
services they need.

6.D

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Mike Dino noted that Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx announced
a revised version of the Grow America Act. Mike Dino added that the
President continues to look for options to repatriate taxes from U.S.
corporations overseas.
Director Francone asked Mike Dino if he had any information on the bill that
is being co-sponsored by Congressman Ken Buck to reauthorize funds
towards bridges and roads instead of public transportation. Mike Dino
replied that he had not heard of any at this point but will look into it.
Director James expressed his disappointment at Congress since the report
did not include any remarks on Stand Up 4 Transportation. He said that it
made it seem like Congress is not listening. Mike Dino noted that there is a
lot of support for transit and RTD, especially in the Colorado delegation. He
noted that similar bills to the one Director Francone mentioned have surfaced
in the past but have not gotten anywhere. Sherry Ellebracht, Government
Relations Officer, added that there is support by Congress members across
the country. She believes the bulk of the message will happen after the
event with videos and testimonies.
Director Menten asked if the Directors could have an update on the APTA
webcast on the voluntary program based on geographical hiring. Marla Lien,
General Counsel, explained that there were two measures introduced on
March 6th in the Federal register. One was a notice of proposed rulemaking,
which allows for local hire preferences for labor only. She noted that neither
RTD nor the State of Colorado have a local hire preference policy. The
second one is a pilot program, not mandatory, of a local contracting initiative
giving preference to a local entity if the policy was in place. She does not
believe that either one of those programs, as they are written, would require
RTD to do anything more than what it is doing. The concern that these two
measures have stirred is that this may open the door for communities to
enact these laws as doing so would no longer affect their ability to receive
Federal funding.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 7, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mike Dino from Squire Patton Boggs noted that both the House of
Representatives and the Senate passed their resolutions early. He noted
that the House passed a Medicaid “Doc Fix”; he mentioned this as a possible
precursor for doing something for transportation funding. Mike Dino added
that the current transportation reauthorization expires on May 31st. There is
no plan to put a new program together to replace the authorization. He
pointed out that the Highway Trust Fund is estimated to have $5 billion to
fund programs through October and an additional $3 million to fund until the
end of December. RTD and other agencies should expect to see payments
at least through July. After that there may be some reductions.

6.D

Director Solano was not available when asked for a comment.
Committee Chair Folska thanked CRL Associates, Brandeberry~McKenna,
and Squire Patton Boggs for their updates. She asked them to include their
updates in the packet distributed to the Directors before the meeting.

B. Special Acknowledgement - General Manager Washington
Chair Sisk noted that Phil Washington has made a difference in RTD, Metro Denver,
Colorado, and nationally by his very presence. He said that the farewell gathering
on Friday, April 10, 2015 was a wonderful tribute to Phil Washington as General
Manager (GM)/CEO and as a person. Chair Sisk said that Phil Washington’s
remarks towards the end of the event expressed what RTD meant to him and what
RTD must do to move forward. Chair Sisk noted that Phil Washington was very
generous as he never used the “I” pronoun; everything he talked about was “we”.
Phil Washington challenged staff to do better things moving forward and to
continue to grow. Chair Sisk added that because of Phil Washington, every staff
member, stakeholder, and partner knew that they were part of the team. Chair
Sisk commented that it has been an honor for the Directors to have Phil
Washington as the GM; the fact that Los Angeles Metro (Metro) saw in Phil
Washington what RTD has known for years is a credit to Metro. Chair Sisk
finalized his remarks wishing Phil Washington nothing but the best for him and his
family as they move to Los Angeles.
Chair Sisk read a proclamation signed by The Honorable John Hickenlooper,
Governor of the State of Colorado. The proclamation declared April 14, 2015 as
“Phil Washington Day”. Chair Sisk presented Phil Washington with a framed
artwork of Denver Union Station on behalf of the Board of Directors.
Phil Washington thanked Chair Sisk, the Directors and staff. He said that since he
started as GM in 2009 RTD has done many things infrastructure wise. He
remembers sitting at his first Senior Leadership Team (SLT) meeting and nothing
being under construction. Phil Washington recalled saying that if everyone came

Director Lasater was absent.

6.E

Phil Washington added that the 5 openings next year will be a big deal. However,
the biggest accomplishment has been taking care of the employees. He saw that
as his biggest commitment. During his time as GM, RTD started the Multi-Agency
Exchange Program (MAX), the Leadership Academy, the Workforce Initiative Now
(WIN) program and the Veteran’s Luncheon. He said that there is a clear
succession plan, employees are praised and disciplined when appropriate, and an
entrepreneurial culture has been established. He believes the RTD staff is the best
in the country enabling RTD to do great things. He reminded the RTD leadership
that the agency’s greatest asset is the employees, with no distinction between
salaried or represented. There is an unprecedented 5 year union contract and no
strikes, which he added is unheard of. He said that the best is yet to come for
RTD.
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, presented to Phil
Washington, on behalf of the SLT, a framed artwork that included a picture of
Denver Union Station before construction and another as it stands today. Scott
Reed thanked Phil Washington for his leadership and for all he has done for the
Region and the nation.
Committee Chair Anderson thanked Phil Washington for all he has done for RTD.
She wished him blessings upon him and his family and Godspeed in his new
adventure.

C. Recommended Actions

• Budget Transfer Authorization for CAD/AVL-Radio Purchase
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
approve the transfer of $483,000 of previously approved capital funds to
purchase twenty-on (21) CAD/AVL - radio kits for expansion buses.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the April 21, 2015
Board meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations,
noted that the agency is in the process of receiving 30 new
buses for its operations. All the buses will need to be
equipped with the CAD/AVL equipment. Nine CAD/AVL kits

together and put their differences aside we could accomplish a lot. He said the
turning point to move forward was introducing the project managers to the mayors
during a Metro Mayor Caucus meeting.

6.E

Director Folska asked for confirmation that the stop
announcements on buses are part of the CAD/AVL system.
Bruce Abel confirmed that the Audible Stop Announcement
Program(ASA) is part of the CAD/AVL system. Director Folska
expressed her concern due to the recent outage in which the
ASA system stopped working. She asked staff to ensure the
ASA system is fully operational on the new kits.
Director Lubow asked what happened to the 2000 Series
Orion buses. Bruce Abel said that RTD still had them as they
were not retired yet. Director Lubow wondered if we will still
need the new buses. Bruce Abel replied that the agency is
already in the process of receiving the buses.

D. Updates

• Fare Study Update April 14, 2015
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, introduced Lacy
Bell, Planning Project Manager. Bruce Abel noted that the original Fare
Study timeline had an optimistic deadline of April, 2015 for a
recommendation. After the public comment portion of the timeline it
seemed like the most realistic timeframe for the recommendation would be
May, 2015. Bruce Abel emphasized that the public comment period
reinforced the complexity of the project. Staff would like to share with the
Director the competing interests, pros and cons of the many approaches.
He reminded the Directors that 16 public meetings were held, one in each
District including a second meeting at the RTD Administrative Offices.
Bruce Abel noted that the staff will present a more comprehensive look into

Packet Pg. 36

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 14, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

will be repurposed from the retired Longmont buses. The
remaining 21 kits will be funded by the requested budget
transfer. While the agency waits for the new buses, 30
(thirty) 2000 Series Orion buses that were set to be retired
will be used to bridge the gap. These buses need to be
equipped with the system. He noted the action has no
financial impact as the funds are available in the capital fund.

6.E

the Fare Study results during the April Study Session in order to have a more
robust conversation.

Bruce Abel brought to the Director’s attention the overarching public
concern of the general economic malaise. He asked the Directors to
consider what RTD’s role is in addressing these types of issues. Marla Lien,
General Counsel, added that as the Board considers policy implications, the
Board also needs to see the broader context of revenue and quantity/quality
of service. Bruce Abel noted that this is the exact type of tradeoffs that will
need to be discussed during the Study Session.
Committee Chair Anderson asked the Directors to bring their questions on
the Fare Study Update to the Study Session scheduled for April 28, 2015.

E. Other Matters
No other matter was presented.

C. Updates

• Civil Rights Committee Update
Zamy Silva, Senior Manager for Civil Rights, introduced Martell Dyles,
Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) Program Manager. Martell Dyles presented a
video the WIN program created for introduction, marketing, and training
purposes. He then reviewed the WIN presentation included in the Civil
Rights Committee Agenda packet for April 14, 2015. The presentation
reviewed the WIN program statistics, projects where RTD has implemented
WIN requirements, WIN program partners and events, the WIN Ambassador
program, and the WIN and Transit Workforce National Perspective.
Martell Dyles pointed out that the WIN program had 31 new placements in
the first quarter of 2015, making it the largest single quarter placement total
in WIN’s history.
Zamy Silva reviewed the Civil Rights Division Update included in the Civil
Rights Committee Agenda packet for April 14, 2015. The update included
the following items:
 Introduction of Ed Neuberg as RTD’s new ADA Manager
 The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) computer based training to
RTD personnel is scheduled to start on during the 2015 2nd quarter
 The EEO new software will launch May 27, 2015

Director Folska thanked Zamy Silva for the introduction of Ed Neuberg as
ADA Manager for RTD. She noted that the creation of this position is a
hallmark on how the agency is moving forward. She hopes that the ADA
Manager’s scope would include people with disabilities in the conversation
of affirmative action, as this would line up with President Obama’s Executive
Order 13548. Zamy Silva replied that her team has already started putting
some of those plans in place to help raise awareness in terms of the ADA
community. This includes starting the conversation to make the WIN
program information accessible as to not exclude the disabled community.
Director Anderson said that it is wonderful to have the stops announced
audibly on the light rail and buses. She recalled that recently a man sat next
to her on the train wearing a sweatshirt indicating that he was deaf. She
wondered how a deaf person would be able to tell which one was their stop
when it is dark out. She said that staff did not need to reply at the moment
but that she wanted to bring this incident to the discussion. Zamy Silva
replied that she will look into this type of incident. She noted that Ed
Neuberg is in the process of meeting with all the departments within RTD to
find out where we are and how the agency functions. She added that this
research is crucial as her team moves forward addressing these types of
concerns and issues.

B. Recommended Actions

• Increase General Counsel's Settlement Authority to Colorado Governmental
Immunity Act Claim Limits
It is recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Counsel to settle claims made
against the District up to the limits provided in the Colorado Governmental
Immunity Act (CGIA), C.R.S. 24-10-114.
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the April 21, 2015 Board
Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Marla Lien, General Counsel, explained to the Board that prior
to 2013, the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (CGIA)
limited liability for tort claims, a category that covers most
personal injury claims, at $150,000 per person. RTD’s
General Counsel had authority to settle those claims and
General Manager Washington could settle claims up to
$250,000, which he delegated to the General Counsel’s
office. In 2013 the CGIA was amended and individual claim
limits were increased to $350,000. She said that this request
is to authorize the General Counsel the ability to settle claims
made against the District up to the limits provided in the CGIA,
or $350,000.

Director Lasater was absent. Director Solano left before the meeting began.

6.G

Marla Lien reiterated that this action will not impact the
budget; it simply allows the General Counsel to continue to
settle claims within the limits provided in the CGIA, as done
prior to the CGIA amendment. If this action is not passed then
any claims in excess of $250,000 would be brought to the
Board for settlement authority.
Director Hoy asked for clarification if this action provided
General Counsel the authority to settle claims or the General
Manager. He thought he heard both entities mentioned as
being able to settle. Marla Lien stated that this would allow
the General Counsel office to settle claims. She apologized if
at any time she misspoke and said the General Manager
settled the claims.
Director Francone asked if the current General Counsel
authority was for $150,000 or $250,000. She also wondered
how many of the 340 open liability claims might exceed
$250,000. Marla Lien stated that since the General Manager
delegated his authority to the General Counsel department
they could settle claims up to $250,000. She said that it was
very difficult to say what open liability claims might exceed
$250,000 as each case is unique; additionally, there could be
claims that were settled from $150,000 under the previous
CGIA but would settle for a higher amount today.
Director Francone inquired if claims above $350,000 would
still need to be brought to the Board for approval. Marla Lien
explained that there would be no settlements above $350,000
as that is the maximum a claimant can receive by statute.
Director Menten requested if the Board could receive an annual
report related to claims versus settlements. Marla Lien said
that it would take some discussion as RTD would not want to

Packet Pg. 43

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 14, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Marla Lien stated that this request does not have any budget
implications. RTD is self-insured for most liability and
manages claims with its in-house risk management and legal
staffs. She explained that following the change in the CGIA
limits, her department worked with Finance to begin increasing
the self-insured reserves to account for potential settlements
or judgements under the new statutory limits. She noted that
RTD has an actuarial study performed each year and has its
reserves audited to ensure they are adequate.

• Authorization to Execute a Budget Transfer to Purchase Thermal Printers
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute a budget transfer in an amount up to $1,900,000 from the Mall
Shuttle project in order to purchase and install the equipment necessary to
accommodate the sale of fare media under the proposed fare structure.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the April 21, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Doug MacLeod, Controller, reminded the Board that this action
was originally presented at last month’s Financial
Administration and Audit Committee Meeting. There were
several questions from the Board so staff decided to bring this
item back to Committee after addressing any outstanding
items. Doug MacLeod explained that although the Board has
not approved a new fare structure that includes printing of the
Day Passes, there are a lot of pieces that need to be put in
place in the background to have the printers in time for the
launch of a new fare structure. He reiterated that staff would
not move forward with purchasing the printers if they are not
required by a fare structure approved by the Board.

Packet Pg. 44

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 14, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Tobiassen asked if RTD’s contractors are
protected by the CGIA. Marla Lien stated they are not which
is why they are required to carry much higher liability
insurance policies. Committee Chair Tobiassen noted that it is
similar to the railroads requiring RTD to have additional liability
insurance when we operate in their right-of-ways as they also
are not covered by the CGIA.

6.G

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
explained that it would be integrated into the existing
CAD/AVL system that would control the issuance of the day
passes. He informed the Board that a delegation from RTD
recently traveled to Portland’s TriMet to see the printers in
use. TriMet has around a 700 vehicle fleet and only averaging
around 20 service tickets per month for the thermal printers.
Bruce Abel said those were mostly from the early models
related to paper jams; those issues have been addressed in the
models RTD would be purchasing. He stated that TriMet is
anticipating a 10-12 year useful life.
Bruce Abel commented that RTD cannot initiate any form of
our procurement process unless there is a budget for the
project. He explained that the reason staff was coming to the
Board this evening was to address this internal process issue.
Given that this project was not anticipated when the 2015
Budget was adopted there is no budget for the project. He
said this will allow staff to transfer money to create a budget
line item so that the procurement process may be initiated;
staff will not procure the thermal printers if the fare structure
approved does not warrant a need for thermal printers.
Doug MacLeod reminded the Board that the budget transfer
for this item would come from a portion of the Certificate of
Participation (COP) proceeds that were authorized by the
Board to be used for the replacement of the Mall Shuttles. He
said the next action item is the approval to modify that COP.
He stated that staff did acquire bond counsel sign-off and
approval to use those funds to purchase the thermal printers.
Committee Chair Tobiassen asked if staff planned to backfill
the COP budget at some point. Bruce Abel stated that was
correct; the backfilling might take place before the actual
expenditure. He stressed that this is really just paperwork so
the procurement process may begin.
Committee Chair Tobiassen wondered if there was a back-up
plan in place should the day passes be approved but we did

Doug MacLeod noted that he had a thermal printer for the
Directors to see. He recognized that it is fairly small with the
only moving part being the mechanism to cut the tickets. It is
a very durable and low-maintenance device.

6.G

Director Folska inquired if the thermal printers would allow
customers to purchase a ticket by credit or debit card. Bruce
Abel stated that the buses do not have the capacity to accept
credit or debit cards. He said that once the SmartCard
program is fully implemented passengers can use them to
purchase tickets on the buses.
Director Francone asked if staff could provide a breakdown of
the cost of the printers and installation. She also inquired
what color they would be. Kim Heldman, Senior Manager of
IT, stated that there was not a breakdown for cost. Bruce
Abel noted that the cost per thermal printer was based on
estimates for RTD’s conversations with TriMet and ours could
be different. He said that his team would work with marketing
to find an appropriate color.
Director Hoy expressed concern over the integrity of the
passes. He wonders how easy they will be to counterfeit.
Bruce Abel stated that there is a hologram on the tape. Kim
Heldman explained that the passes also contain a rotating day
code security feature. Every day there is a new code to help
deter fraud.
Director Menten asked if the staff planned to go out to bid for
suppliers of the thermal printers. Bruce Abel stated that it is
important for the thermal printers to integrate with the
CAD/AVL system. The manufacturer of the CAD/AVL system
also manufactures thermal printers. He said staff does not
know at this time how many other companies might offer
compatible equipment.
Director Walker expressed his support of the day passes. He
wonders how many TriMet has sold to date. He also asked if
the thermal printers would be able to print our current
Packet Pg. 46

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 14, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

not have the thermal printers in time. Bruce Abel stated that
there was a back-up plan but staff did not want to implement
it on a long-term basis. Currently RTD offers day passes
through places like the Denver Visitor’s Bureau. These passes
are essentially like cash. He said the plan would be to issue
these passes to the drivers until the thermal printers were
installed. He explained that this process requires
implementation of internal controls that are not in place today.
He noted that additionally there is some security concern in
sending the drivers out with essentially cash in a fanny pack.

6.G

transfers if the day passes were not approved. Doug MacLeod
said that over 10 million tickets have been printed on TriMet’s
printers. Bruce Abel stated that the thermal printers could be
used to print transfers but it would need to be evaluated
further to determine if there was a benefit.

• Authorization to Execute a Lease Amendment for Smart Card and /or
Thermal Printers
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the
“Resolution”), authorizing the First Amendment to the Lease Purchase
Agreement related to the Certificates of Participation, Series 2013A.
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the April 21, 2015 Board
Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Doug MacLeod explained that this action is asking for approval
to perform an Amendment to the Lease Purchase Agreement
related to the Certificates of Participation (COP), Series
2013A. He noted that in the case of the 2013 COPs RTD
issues about $200 million to fund the purchases of buses,
including the Mall Shuttle buses. Since the Mall Shuttle
procurement has been delayed staff is requesting the transfer
of $6 million from the 2013 COPs to fund two projects: (1)
expansion of the Xerox contract related to the smart card
project ($3.8 million) and (2) purchase of thermal printers to
support the proposed new fare structure including the

Packet Pg. 47

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 14, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Francone commented that staff indicated they had
received an opinion from bond counsel but she did not see
that included in the packet. Doug MacLeod explained that
was part of the next action item.

6.G

Director Lubow said it was her understanding that issuance of
a COP is based on using collateral. She asked if the $6 million
that will be transferred will now be collateralized by the
purchase of the thermal printers. Marla Lien explained that
when approximately $10 million was paid down on the COPs
certain collateral can be released. Per the amortization
schedule outlined as part of the resolution (Exhibit C), the
thermal printers will be released from collateral as it is a low
value item while the other items purchased (i.e. light rail
vehicles, buses) will remain as collateral.
Director Lubow noted that RTD will still need to purchase Mall
Shuttles when we can find a company to build them. She
wonders how RTD will come up with the missing funding.
Doug MacLeod explained that in June or July staff plans to
issue new COPs for additional rolling stock; $6 million from
those COPs would be used to replace these funds.
Director Menten stated that she will be voting no for the
simple principle that RTD is using borrowed money to
purchase a service contract and thermal printers. This is not
only using money that is borrowed but will ultimately increase
the overall amount owed by RTD.
Director Francone stated that she too has several problems
with this recommendation. She commented that she still does
not see an opinion from bound counsel saying this is okay
included in the packet. Director Francone shared that the
other thing that bothers her is that there is a just a little extra
in the amount requested. She would be more inclined to vote
yes on a request for $5.7 million. Marla Lien explained that
bond counsel opinions are delivered to the trustee and note
holders, not RTD. Doug MacLeod noted that the reason bond
counsel recommended, and staff requested, $6 million was to
try and avoid coming back to the Board to amend the lease a
second time.
Committee Chair Tobiassen shared that he thinks of COPs like
a mortgage that someone might take out to build a house.
RTD is already making interest and principle payments on
money that is just sitting out there; however, it is available

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 14, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

purchase of day passes on buses ($1.9 million). Doug
MacLeod said that per the recommendation of the bond
counsel staff has rounded the requested transfer to $6 million.

• Adoption of 2016 Performance Measures
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
that the Board of Directors adopts the attached 2016 Performance
Measures for mission statement goals 1-7.
There are 23 specific
performance measures in total.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the April 21, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial
Analysis, indicated that there were several recommended
changes from the goals adopted in 2015. The changes
recommended are:
 Goal 1.4: remove the measure for Reportable Light Rail
Accidents while retaining the Preventable goal. The
first measure is considered no longer relevant as the
focus should be directed to preventable accidents and
brings the goals for Rail Operations in line with those
for Bus Operations
 Goal 3.1: reduce the Local On-Time Bus Service
performance measure from 88% to 86% and reduce
the Regional & Express On-Time Service performance
measure from 94% to 92%. Since moving to using the
GPS component of the Automated Passenger Counter
system in 2011 the collection of on-time performance
data has become far more accurate. The new data
capture methodology has shown on-time performance

Packet Pg. 49

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 14, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

and we already have some equity. He said this is just
borrowing the money temporarily so we can do something else
but ultimately the house will still get built. He believes this is
a good temporary use of the funds.





consistently in the 83-86% range for local service while
a peer review indicated actual on-time performance of
82% on average.
Goal 3.3: increase the Mileage Between Lost Service
Maintenance Road Calls from 26,000 to 28,000 miles.
With new bus vehicles that dominate the bus fleet and
require fewer maintenance road calls it is expected that
the mileage between lost service will increase.
Goal 6.1: add a yes/no indication of whether the
required SB154 Cost Recovery ratio is met along with
ratio’s definition along with that of the Operating Cost
Recovery ratio (Board-approved goal). This is to
provide clarification between what state legislature
requires as opposed to the Board-approved goal.

Jannette Scarpino reminded the Board that Goal 6.2 and 6.3
are currently placeholders; these measures will be established
as part of the 2016 Annual Budget process.
Director Francone believes it is still valuable to see metrics on
all types of accidents whether preventable or not. She also
suggests leaving the on-time performance metrics as is.
Director Anderson expressed that to her it makes sense to
only track the preventable accidents because there is nothing
that RTD can do about the others.
Chair Sisk expressed a problem with reducing goals for
system-wide on time performance. He stated that we are
going out to the public telling them we are increasing fares yet
also telling them that we are lowering our goal for on-time
performance. He thinks this is sending the wrong message to
the public.
Director Folska stated that she concurs with Chair Sisk. This
performance measures appears to the public that we are
raising fares and lowering performance. She said that
additionally, RTD does not know what the picture will look like
in 2016 with all the new rail openings. She suggested waiting
to establish this performance measure.
Bruce Abel explained that staff was attempting to recognize
that in 2011 the data collection method became far more
accurate. Using the previous observational method data
counts were only about 240/day and are now exceeding
Packet Pg. 50

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 14, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

6.G

6.G

18,000/day. He said the positive is that every year since
2011 the performance has improved; however, every year
since 2011 staff also has to return to the Board explaining
that we are not meeting our goals. Bruce Abel noted that the
proposed goal still encourages staff to improve while still being
a goal that can realistically be met.

C. Updates

• Review of 2016 -2021 SBP Development Process and 2016 Budget
Assumptions
Jannette Scarpino reviewed a Power Point with the Board that is available in
the April 14, 2015 Financial Administrative and Audit Committee Agenda
Packet. She explained that the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) is RTD’s six year
financial plan for the Base System that must result in a balanced budget.
FasTracks expenses and projects are in the FasTracks Annual Program
Evaluation (APE) financial plan; cost allocations are made from the Base
System to the FasTracks Operations for the West Line, DUS Bus Concourse,
Free MetroRide and I-225 Rail Line.
Jannette Scarpino explained that staff starts with the 2015-2020 SBP
capital programs as a baseline to develop the current SBP. These projects
are prioritized and evaluated using mission statement criteria and 2016
strategic goals. She said the SBP is comprised of operating elements (bus
service, LRT service, and operating and passenger facilities) and capital
elements (fleet plan and operating and passenger facilities and equipment).
Jannette Scarpino noted that there are several revenue and cost
assumptions used in development of the SBP which are:

Packet Pg. 51

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 14, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Tobiassen reminded the Board that these
goals also drive the budget. He thinks that using new
technology to really fine tune the goals and help staff focus
where budget dollars are allocated is a good thing.

Revenue Assumptions:
 Sales and use tax growth rates
o 2016: CU-Leeds School of Business currently forecasts 4.8%
increase over 2015
o 2017-2021: based on quarterly forecasts from CU-Leeds
School
o January 2015: actual sales/use tax is 10.8% over January
2014
 Federal Grants
o Based on actual 2015 appropriations
o Assumed to increase at rate of inflation
 Fare revenue
o Assume 10% fare increase in 2016 over 2015 budget
o Per policy, Board will consider a fare increase every 3 years,
scheduled increase for 2014 was deferred to 2015 and 2015
Cost Assumptions:
 Operating and maintenance costs
o Based on 2015 proposed Amended Budget
o Costs escalated at rate of inflation
o Collective Bargaining Agreement incorporated, fixed through
2017
 Diesel fuel costs
o Locked at $2.95 per gallon in 2015
o Current futures estimate is $2.12 per gallon for 2015
o Conservative cost assumptions and escalated at rate of
inflation
o Provide monthly updates
 Debt service
o Interest payments on existing debt and assumed financing
 Inflation rates
o Based on Moody’s forecasts as of December 2015
o Denver-Boulder inflation rate: 3.1% in 2016
o National inflation rate: 2.6% in 2016
Jannette Scarpino pointed out that there are many issues and challenges in
developing the SBP. The cost of fuel is very volatile so it can be difficult to
make assumptions over several years. Additionally, staff must always look
to optimize/improve service levels, prioritize competing projects and maintain
a State of Good Repair.
Jannette Scarpino stated that staff will continue to review the assumptions
and refine the SBP accordingly. She said the next steps in the process are
to review the first draft of the SBP at the Budget Study Session, review the

Packet Pg. 52

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 14, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

6.G

6.G

second draft of the SBP at the following Financial Administration and Audit
Committee Meeting with the SBP hopefully being approved in July.

Director Lubow asked what impact there might be on the SBP when new
corridors go online like we will have in 2016. She noted one slide of the
presentation mentioned cost allocations for several FasTracks project bus
not the Eagle P3 lines or US 36 Bus Rapid Transit and she wondered why.
Jannette Scarpino explained that the opening of FasTracks lines does have
an impact on the SBP; initially all operating costs are carried in Base
Systems and then there is an allocation made to the FasTracks Operating
budget based on a cost allocation formula. Jannette Scarpino commented
that is it important these are segregated because of the legislation that was
passed requiring a separation of the 0.6 and 0.4 cent sales and use taxes.
She said that the Eagle P3 lines will not be allocated because operation of
those lines is through Denver Transit Partners. As for the US 36 BRT and
new cost allocation formula will need to be created prior to opening as RTD
does not own the entire project like we do for something like the West Line.
Director Lubow noted that during the Northwest Area Mobility Study there
were a variety of BRT corridors proposed. She wonders, given the other
projects already included in the SBP, when those lines might show up on
this plan. Jannette Scarpino said that those BRT lines would not show up in
the SBP until they had been formalized. Doug MacLeod stated that those
BRT lines would also not be included in the APE that will be presented in the
next few months; until RTD has identified a way to pay for and operate a
new service it is not included in the list of projects.
Director Menten noticed that the Power Point indicated the SBP would be
brought back to the Board at the April 28th Study Session. She wondered if
that was still scheduled as that is also the Study Session to further review
the Fare Study. Dave Genova, Interim General Manager and CEO, said that
staff was still reviewing the schedule. It is possible that the SBP may not be
presented again until the May.
Director Bagley believes it needs to be recognized that the diesel price per
gallon Jannette Scarpino mentioned for 2016 is only an indicator of what it
Packet Pg. 53

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 14, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska inquired how far in the future we can buy fuel. She wonders
if we can stock up on fuel for perhaps 2017, 2018 and 2019. Marla Lien
explained that RTD does not purchase fuel from the commodities market; we
sign a contract with a vendor to formulate the diesel, deliver it to our
locations, etc. She said that we have never found a vendor willing to enter
into a contract of longer than one year. Marla Lien stated that the vendor
may have options for purchasing fuel further out on the commodities market
but that option is not available to RTD.

6.G

might be. The futures market can change very quickly and only
demonstrates a trend of what is happening with fuel prices.

• Internal Audit Charter

Director Hoy asked for further clarification on the process for the Board to
interact with the Internal Audit Department. Scott Reed, Assistant General
Manager of Communications, explained that the internal audit plan is
developed in the 4th quarter of each year. He said at that time the Board is
asked if they have any suggestions of possible audit topics to include in the
plan. He stated that if at any time throughout the year a Director had
questions about an existing audit his team would be more than happy to
discuss it with the Director.
Committee Chair Tobiassen asked if information security falls into the Audit
Charter or if this is something that needs to be included. Ann Marie IsaacHeslop said that it includes general audit responsibility but does not outline
any specific audit classifications. That is done during development of the
Internal Audit Plan each year.
Director Menten wonders what resources are available for employees to
suggest areas that they feel need to be audited, especially if they want to
remain anonymous. Scott Reed stated that there are several different ways
for employees to give suggestions and may remain anonymous if they wish.
He said that employees can also contact the Internal Audit Department
directly as well. Dave Genova noted that RTD also has an employee liaison
that is very engaged with the employees. He said this is a great conduit to
get feedback from employees. Dave Genova said that it might be valuable
to bring the liaison, Beverly Lindsey, into a future meeting.

• February 2015 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod reviewed the February Monthly Financial Status report that is
available in the April 14, 215 Financial Administration and Audit Committee
Agenda Packet with the Board. He noted that for the year to date ridership
is down 1.3% but fare revenue and sales and use tax are up 0.5% and
9.5% respectively. He pointed out that we are still under budget and sales
and use tax continues to be strong.
Director Bagley reiterated that the trend for this year is that ridership is
lower than what we project. He said that when the Board talks about
increasing ridership, there are so many externalities that cannot be
anticipated, noting that no one would have predicted the current price of oil.

Packet Pg. 54

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 14, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager of Internal Audit, stated that the Audit
Charter was included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
Agenda Packet and asked if there were any questions.

6.G

He stated that external factors are something that the Board really needs to
think about. It is not simple to try to increase ridership, balance the budget,
and have fare revenue and sales and use tax be rosy because of all the
externalities.

Director Bagley echoed Director Tobiassen’s observation of congestion. He
believes the significant growth in the region in the last three years has really
added to the issue.

Committee Chair Tobiassen commented that ridership appears to be down,

sees an H-Line packed to standing room only leaving Nine Mile. He said that
he also does not see an improvement in congestion no matter what is done
to make the highways better.

April Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Sisk introduced the April Board meeting agenda. He noted there should not be any
real issues with the action items that had passed the committees unanimously. He noted
for a couple of the recommended action items around station names on the North Metro
Rail Line and also the Boulder Junction, staff has worked with the local jurisdictions and
the recommended changes are coming from these respective jurisdictions.
Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to approve
moving the April Board agenda before the full
Board for approval.
Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Hoy noted he had spoken with Jim of Thornton
who was in agreement with the recommended action.

Chair Sisk noted that relative to the transfer of funds
for the use of the thermal printers, he believes the
questions on the COP have been addressed. His
understanding is that payment is already made. In
other words, if our obligations on the COP now is $3M,
by the time we use them, we would have already made
payment for the cost of the printers. The net result is
we will not owe more than the initial $3M. The bond
experts have looked at the proposal and are Ok with
this proposal.
On the action item pertaining to the adoption of the
2016 performance measures, Chair Sisk believes staff
can tighten this up a little bit and that we will be good
for the vote. He noted that Director Menten had
indicated she may vote no on this item. Director
Tobiassen commented this is an item related to the
budget and non-acceptance could have impacts on
budget and timelines.
Vote on
Motion:

The motion passed with full agreement by the
Executive Committee.
Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED.

Update from GM Executive Search Committee
Chair Sisk shared the GM Executive Search committee had met on April 14, 2015. He
noted that three people in the meeting were also members of that committee. He shared
that Roger Sherman, CRL, provided ideas for the comprehensive communications and
outreach plan and the committee had a good dialog on approach and how to best reach
our employees and stakeholders. He noted that the Committee members agreed that
having meetings in their respective districts is not effective in reaching the constituents.
Several other ways for input gathering and sharing of information was discussed including
online surveys and use of social media. He indicated they will be working on a possible
moderated focus group of 10-12 strategic leaders in various capacities to share thoughts
about the General Manager position. Ultimately, the full Board will be making the
decisions on the selection of the General Manager but the discussion centered on what is
the most effective and timely way to garnish input. As noted by Director Bagley, this
process must be corralled to make sure it is meaningful and timely.
The committee also discussed the merits of generating an RFP for the Executive Search
firm or if this could be accomplished by some other means such as use of in-house or
models similar to the way GM Washington was hired in Los Angeles. They reviewed the
cost component from 2009 of about $40K for the firm and another $30K for travel and
incidental expenses. In the end, the committee agreed that the Executive Search firm is
the way to go. They also reviewed the elements of the RFP that included the schedule
and the scope of work. Paula and Linda Wells, procurement agent, were authorized to
proceed with the finalization of the RFP and submit for a proposal. The bidders list should
include local firms that may also reduce the cost component of the search if selected.
Director Hoy requested a step x step, the next 10 steps of the process. The committee
indicated they are building the schedule which can be shared when ready. Paula Perdue
also indicated that it may be possible to provide a checklist of activities, albeit may be
more than 10 steps.

printers
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board
of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing
the First Amendment to the Lease Purchase Agreement related to the Certificates of
Participation, Series 2013A.

Follow-up on Video Recording for Board Chambers
Chair Sisk asked Director Bagley to provide an overview of the discussion on video
recording for Board Chambers. The Interim General Manager has not been privy to some
of the discussion. Director Bagley explained that the request had been brought up at the
Executive Committee a few months ago. He believes the value of this will be to enhance
the transparency and openness of the Board meetings. His request includes all Board,
committee meetings and committee meetings held in the 3rd floor conference room as well
as the Board Chambers.
Dave Genova inquired if the idea was for video streaming or archival/store and retention.
He indicated that his team will need to look at both options as obviously one would be
more difficult to implement than the other. The easier will be to implement broadcast or
streaming video. Director Bagley responded that his vision was for archival capability such
as via web portal access. Director Tobiassen suggested staff gets with IT to see what
they suggest. The technology is advanced on this and it does not have to be difficult.
The use of YouTube as an example would work well and could be cost effective. Director
Bagley added that he is not envisioning some fixed type installation but that he would like
it professionally done. If using a wide-lens camera or a Wi-Fi camera will do the trick, he is
OK with this. Chair Sisk added he is more interested in the audio capability of the
recording and cited an example from his previous experience. He suggested we take
progressive steps with the committee and board meetings.
Director Hoy suggested this needs to be done in steps:
 Start with one camera (no edit required)
 Store on You-Tube and look to expand later
 We need a budget to see how much this will cost but make this a simple
application.
Director Folska added we need a professional job. She requested a cost estimate +-10%
along with an estimate of man-hours to handle.
The question was raised as to if this action item needs to be brought before the full Board
or if the Executive Committee could make this recommendation. Director Folska
expressed that since this will affect the full Board, she thought it was appropriate for the
full Board to vote. The Committee generally agreed that this will be a full Board action.
Paula reiterated the approach that she had heard. The first step is for Interim General
Manager Genova to bring a proposal before the Executive Committee in May that has
budget and cost estimates (including listing the sources of funds). The Executive
Committee will make a recommendation to take this action item before the full Board. The
full Board will vote on the proposal. This will require a Board action report from staff for
the full Board.

Director Menten expressed that she has been in a listening mode and supports the
proposal; however, she is fine with doing this on a shoestring. She indicated that one of
the suggestions made by her was to use college students to reduce costs so she expects
this option to be part of the consideration.

Retiree Awards
There were four retirees for the month of March but only one was in attendance.
General Manager Washington introduced Kevin St. Croix, retired Division Manager, and
asked Bruce Abel, AGM of Bus Operations, and Mike Gil, Deputy AGM of Bus Operations,
to join them.
Bruce Abel said that Kevin is retiring after 35 years of service at RTD. He started in 1980
as a bus operator. Mike Gil shared that an interesting part of Kevin’s career is that he is
one of the few that remember the layoffs in 1981-1982. He drove a bus for 5 years,
went to the Alameda division as a Dispatcher, moved to District Shops as a Lead
Dispatcher and spent the last part of his career as a Division Manager at multiple RTD
divisions. Mike Gil said that he has been one outstanding asset to RTD and he will be
missed terribly.
Kevin St. Croix said it has been a great career at RTD. He remembers coming to a Board
meeting and telling the Directors they were dysfunctional during some very public
disputes, which was a shaky time in his career. There were some good times and bad
times but for the most part it was a great place to work. He thanked RTD for the privilege
to work here.
Chair Sisk congratulated Kevin on his retirement and thanked him for his years of service.
He said that our employees make the District the success that it is.

Doug Gragg, Denver, said his concern this evening is for the selection committee for
the General Manager. He realizes that there is the political practice of RTD looking
nationally for a new General Manager, he believes that if the Board looked locally
within the District the committee could find a minority woman that could fill the
position. There is no need to go to NY City to do it.
Gary Van Dorn, National Federation of the Blind Board Member and President of the
National Federation of the Blind CO Chapter, expressed the NFBCO’s concern over the
recent outage of the automated stop announcements. While they were happy that the
RTD sent out a very clear and concise email about the issue that also asked drivers to
announce the stops, many drivers failed to do so. He requested that RTD provide the
NFBCO with an explanation of what caused such a catastrophic failure in the
automated stop announcement system.
Shantá Farrington, Denver, works as a Community Organizer for Front Range Economic
Strategy Center (FRESC). This organization provides outreach and support, especially
to low-income and disadvantaged communities, during community engagement
processes. She said that FRESC supports the Mile High Connects fare proposal; they
hope that prior to any decisions related to fare in the next few weeks the community’s
voice will be heard.
Joe Tripplet, Denver, expressed concern over the proposed increases to the Access-aRide fare. He worries that eventually Access-a-Ride riders, especially seniors and the
disabled, will no longer be able to afford the cost of this service. He recognized that
while Access-a-Cab is a great alternative, it is not a realistic alternative in the outlying
areas of the District. He asked staff to provide him the rule that Access-a-Ride fare
must be twice the fare of a comparable fixed route.
Andrea Suhaka, Denver, DRMAC Board Member and Chair of the Transportation
Solutions Arapahoe County, has been very involved in the fare study that Mile High
connects is conducting. She believes our low-income community is very
disadvantaged with the new fares RTD is proposing. She thinks the fares for lowincome riders should be at the senior discount price or lower; people that depend on
RTD for their living need to have a lower fare.
Richard McClintock, Denver, has been a long time smart growth and livable
communities advocate. He looks forward to participating in RTD’s upcoming fare
study public hearings; however, he is here tonight for a very different reason. He
would like to thank General Manager Washington for his service. He can only say that
this is a loss for RTD and LA’s gain. He stated that the motto of building as much as
we can as fast as we can has really come to fruition based on his leadership. Rick

McClintock recognized the challenge ahead of the Board in finding a new GM who is as
smart and capable as GM Washington.
Kenny Shepard, Denver, expressed his concern over the new proposed fare to DIA. He
believes RTD will get more revenue if we lower the fare to one that is comparable to
other large cities, like $5.
Hanni Raly, The Arc of Aurora, spoke on behalf of the intellectually and
developmentally disabled community. She said that many of the individuals they work
with are dependent upon government assistance, low-income, and rely upon public
transportation. They see transportation as the conduit for full community inclusion,
recognizing that annually 560,000 people with disabilities never leave their home
because of transportation difficulties. In looking at the proposed fare structure, her
organization knows this number will only grow if adopted. She expressed frustration
that her organization is unable to participate in the Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare
Program as it is today, limiting their ability to assist their community that cannot afford
our fares. The administrative burdens, cumbersome tracking requirements and huge
upfront costs preclude their participation since they receive no public funding. She
believes that in order for the program to be fully realized RTD needs to:
o Consider decreasing the administrative burdens and tracking components
o Consider offering a deeper discount or sliding scale for organizations that work with
low-income populations
o Consider expanding the program for offering payment options that do not require a
complete upfront investment
o Consider allowing cooperatives for non-profit organizations
She stated that by increasing access to programs that increase access to transit all of
our communities win.
Ana Barrera-Ochoa, Denver, spoke not only on behalf of FRESC but also on behalf of
the low-income and working class families. These groups are very concerned that the
fares are going to increase. The working class families are already struggling; it is very
important they are taken into consideration as part of RTD’s fare study. She said that
not only are many of these families transit reliant but they also need transportation for
better jobs and opportunities.

General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Update
Committee Chair Bagley commented that the Board and Senior Leadership Team had the
planning advance for 2016 over the weekend. The goal of this advance was to define
specific task goals for the General Manager and Agency for 2016. He said that the GM
Oversight and Performance Management Committee would begin working with the Interim
General Manager in late April to establish the tactical plans for achieving these goals.
Chair Sisk noted that the GM Executive Search Committee has been established and
includes Directors Bagley, Deadwyler, Francone, Tobiassen and himself as Chair of the
Committee. The Committee had their first meeting this afternoon and achieved a great
deal. Chair Sisk recognized the work of Paula Perdue, Executive Director to the Board, as
she was instrumental in making sure it was a good first meeting. He shared that an
invitation to apply was extended to the Senior Leadership team. The deadline for
applications is April 1st, interviews will be conducted shortly thereafter, with a goal of
appointing an Interim General Manager the week of April 6th at a Special Board Meeting.
He noted that the Committee is moving promptly and efficiently so there is a smooth
transition. Chair Sisk recognized this is a large undertaking but it will be done in a very
transparent way with input from employees, stakeholders, public, etc.

General Manager's Report
General Manager Washington thanked the Board, and particularly Chair Sisk, for
understanding his decision to move to LA Metro and their support during this process. He
also thanked the stakeholders, staff, mayors, commissioners and CDOT. GM Washington
said that what has been accomplished over the last six years, which is quite a bit, was
really a joint and team effort. He recognized that six years ago there was not much going
on but now the West Line is open with 5 more openings coming in 2015. He is very
proud of the work the team has done. GM Washington believes that we will not fully
realize what we have accomplished for a couple decades when our grandchildren and
great-grandchildren are using the transit infrastructure built under our watch.

Chair Sisk reviewed the following events and awards that Board members participated in
during the month of March:

GM Washington shared that on March 6th USDOT announced a pilot program and
regulatory change that will allow transportation agencies to utilize local hiring preferences
on USDOT funded projects. In this pilot USDOT made no provision for comment and they
allowed 30 days for comment on a permanent regulatory change. He said that APTA has
submitted a request to extend the comment period and would like to host a webinar for
USDOT to explain what these provisions mean. To date USDOT has not acted on the
request for an extension. He stated the current comment period ends April 6. APTA will
still have a webinar on March 26th at 12:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss this provision and
any legal issues that may arise. GM Washington noted that the transit industry, especially
the supply/private part of the industry, is pushing back on these provisions, especially as it
relates to rolling stock. He believes this webinar will do a good job in answering some of
the questions out there. He asked Marla Lien, General Counsel, to explain this provision as
it relates to Colorado Laws.
Marla Lien explained that the change in regulation deals only with local hiring preferences
pertaining to the use of labor. In Colorado, the only statute on Colorado labor on public
works does not apply to RTD; it applies to counties, school districts and municipalities
requiring Colorado labor to perform 80% of the work on a public works project. She
stated that RTD does not have a local hiring preference policy nor do we have a state law
applicable to labor on project. In Colorado there are other statutes that would be
implicated if the statute expands; there is a preference regarding commodities and services
and there are bid preferences on public projects. Both of these statutes do include RTD.
Marla Lien explained that those are not currently addressed by the regulatory change but
the webinar will discuss what other kinds of labor or contracting could be affected by local
hiring preferences if USDOT expands the program. She stated that she is not concerned
about this regulatory change diminishing competition on RTD’s projects even if the
program goes forward.
GM Washington explained that this is one of USDOT Secretary Foxx’s initiatives called
ladders of opportunity. The idea is to ensure that local workers benefit from economic
opportunities that transportation projects present.
GM Washington noted that a memo outlining the proposed Flatiron Flyer milestones would
be sent to the Board. The proposed dates are:
 June 30, 2015 – Media events announcing the arrival of the Flatiron Flyer pilot bus
 August 13, 2015 – Opening of Boulder Junction
 October 24, 2015 – Station Ribbon Cutting and Parties, full Flatiron Flyer fleet
arrival
 January 17, 2015 – BRT service change

Director Menten asked for clarification if USDOT would be participating in the APTA
webinar. She expressed concern that we would not really be able to learn how this might
affect RTD if USDOT is not participating. GM Washington said that USDOT had not
confirmed their involvement but APTA plans to host the webinar either way. He thinks
that even if they do not officially participate there will be some USDOT representatives on
the phone hearing the questions/concerns.

Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer in an
amount up to $1,900,000 from the Mall Shuttle project in order to purchase and install
the equipment necessary to accommodate the sale of fare media under the proposed fare
structure.
Director Tobiassen shared that as the Chair of the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee, he has been speaking with many Board members and staff, and it is clear
there are still a number of questions that need to be addressed. Director Tobiassen
requested that this item be removed from this evening’s agenda and brought back to the
Board at the April 21, 2015 Board meeting. This would also allow for staff to provide a
more in-depth explanation of this item at the April 14, 2015 Financial Administration and
Audit Committee meeting to ensure everyone’s questions are answered.
Director Anderson expressed concern that postponing this item might set back the
openings scheduled for 2016. General Manager Washington stated that he and Director
Tobiassen had discussed this item. He stated that he does not have concerns about the
timeline for the 2016 openings if this item is delayed until the next Board meeting.
Director Menten inquired if staff had consulted with the bond counsel at this time. Marla
Lien stated that was one of the things being worked on prior to the committee meeting
briefing.
This item was delayed until the April 21, 2015 Board Meeting.

General Manager Washington thanked the RTD staff, led by Pauletta Tonilas, for all of
their efforts related to Stand Up for Transportation Day on April 9th. This is hugely
important for infrastructure in this country as May 31 is the end date for MAP-21. He
stated that this event is gaining steam and brining attention to the issue. He thanked the
Directors for their support and participation.
Director Folska thanked staff for all their efforts surrounding Stand Up for Transportation.
She had her bus signing event recently and there were so many people signing that she
does not think there is room for even one more signature. She recognized the wonderful
job that GM Washington has done within the District and thanked him for his efforts.
Director Menten expressed her appreciation for having the RTD Board/Senior Leadership
Team Advance within the District. She knows of government bodies that feel it is better
to take an expensive trip outside their area, which she does not support.
Director Bagley stated that, in reference to the Strategic Planning Advance, there has
never been any thought of having this anyplace but close to the Blake Street offices and
within the District.
Director Lasater shared that he recently attended a Southwest (SW) Rail Extension
meeting hosted by Director Bagley. He complimented Director Bagley on having such an
informative and well attended meeting. He believes there was some very good dialogue
related to the future of the SW Rail Extension.
Director Bagley thanked Director Lasater for his attendance at the meeting. He noted that
he has been working with staff for the last 6 months about the SW Rail Extension; the
model for the Southeast Rail Extension has motivated his community to look at ways to
move their extension forward. He thanked staff and GM Washington for their
involvement.

From:

William C. Van Meter,
Manager, Planning

Date:

April 2, 2015

Subject:

Option to Purchase Real Property at 350 S.
Santa Fe Drive (“Bus Barn”)

Assistant

Date: April 2, 2015
General

GM
Board Meeting Date: April 21, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager and CEO and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary for the grant of an option, and for the sale, including execution of any deeds and other
property conveyance documents for the purchase of the real property located at 350 S. Santa Fe Drive
(the “Bus Barn Property”).
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the 2015 goal of fiscal sustainability in leveraging RTD assets. The Property
originally housed a large bus maintenance facility (hence “Bus Barn”) that was used by RTD until District
Shops opened in the late 1980’s. The building was demolished by RTD in the 1990’s and the Property is
currently vacant. An aerial showing the Property is attached as Exhibit A. RTD has no current or future
transit use for the Bus Barn Property.
In August 2014, RTD received an unsolicited development proposal from D4 Urban, LLC (“D4”) for the
development of the Bus Barn Property. RTD staff determined that the proposal had technical merit, and
in October 2014 received direction from the Board of Directors to issue a solicitation for an RFP for
development proposals for the Bus Barn Property.
RTD staff issued RFP 14DH068 on November 12, 2014 and received one response from D4, and one
letter of interest from the Colorado Department of Transportation.
RTD Staff, a City and County of Denver (“City”) designee, and a Denver Urban Renewal Authority
(“DURA”) designee reviewed D4’s response and determined that the proposal was nonresponsive based
on the criteria given in the RFP. RTD staff met with the Board of Directors in Executive Session on
March 3, 2015, and received direction to move forward with negotiations with D4 for the sale of the
Bus Barn Property under terms different than that proposed by D4.
DISCUSSION
This action would give the General Manager and CEO authority to grant D4 an option to purchase the
Bus Barn Property. The terms of the option would be as follows:


The option would expire on December 31, 2017, meaning D4 could exercise the option and
purchase the Bus Barn Property at any time prior to December 31, 2017.



RTD could not enter into any agreement that would give another party the right to purchase or
lease any portion of the Bus Barn Property during the option term, and cannot offer the property
for sale during that time frame.



The purchase price for the Property will be established when the option is exercised, and would be
the fair market value of the Bus Barn Property based upon an appraisal.

Packet Pg. 76

13.A



D4 will pay RTD $10,000 in consideration of RTD’s granting the option.



There would be no preconditions to closing other than delivery of the purchase price (which will be
established when the option is exercised).



Once the option is granted, no subsequent Board action is required during the option term.

The Bus Barn Property is currently accessible predominantly by car from South Santa Fe Drive. The
ultimate development use will be determined by whether the Bus Barn Property remains accessible only
by car, or can be connected directly to Alameda Station via a pedestrian bridge. Construction of a direct
pedestrian bridge connection will require (i) securing approvals from Union Pacific (UP) and Burlington
Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroads, RTD and the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to cross the existing
Consolidated Main Line freight rail and RTD light rail tracks, and (ii) securing sufficient financing, likely
from public financing sources, to construct, own and maintain the bridge.
By granting D4 an option, RTD is allowing the development proposer time to determine if they can
negotiate and secure the necessary approvals and financing to build a pedestrian bridge from third
parties, including UP, BNSF, and the PUC which must approve the rail crossing, as well as from the City
which will likely own the bridge, and DURA which will determine if public financing would be available
for its construction.
Ultimately however, the decision whether or not to build a bridge is up to D4. D4 may elect during the
Option period to move forward with a re-development of the Property that does not include a bridge,
subject to securing necessary City site plan approvals. If D4 does elect to build the bridge, then D4 (not
RTD) will have to obtain the necessary approvals and financing, but such requirements for the bridge will
not be preconditions to D4 exercising the option or to closing on the Bus Barn Property.
At any time during the Option period, D4 may give notice to RTD of its intent to exercise the Option, at
which point the Parties will negotiate a purchase price based on a fair market value appraisal of the
Property at that time. D4 could also elect to terminate its Option, or could fail to exercise it within the
Option period. If D4 terminates or fails to exercise the Option during the Option period, any subsequent
decisions about the Property, including an extension of the Option period would come back to the Board
for approval.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
If the Option is exercised, RTD will receive the amount determined by a fair market value appraisal of the
property.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager and CEO and/or his
designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary for the grant of an option, and for the
sale, including execution of any deeds and other property conveyance documents for the
purchase of the real property located at 350 S. Santa Fe Drive (the “Bus Barn Property”).
2. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary for the conveyance of the option. RTD does not have any current or future transit need
for the Bus Barn Property. The Option allows the development proposer to determine if a transit
supportive use is viable, and if exercised, RTD will receive the fair market value of the property as
determined by appraisal. A subsequent RFP is unlikely to be successful, and an Option
agreement is the best structure to allow the development proposer to secure approvals needed
from third parties.

Budget Transfer Authorization for CAD/AVLRadio Purchase

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to approve the transfer of $483,000 of previously
approved capital funds to purchase twenty-on (21) CAD/AVL - radio kits for expansion buses.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
aging 2000 Orion forty foot heavy duty transit fleet.
We recently determined that the District needs thirty (30) more forty foot heavy duty transit buses than
we had planned for. The additional vehicles are needed due to changes in schedules and routes that
have resulted in a shortage in this type of vehicle. This shortage has put a strain on service delivery due
to a reduced spare ratio and it has also limited our ability to properly maintain our fleet.
As a stopgap measure we have opted to retain thirty (30) of the Orion’s until replacements are acquired.
This creates the need for twenty-one (21) complete CAD/AVL - radio kits since the original plan was to
retire all of the Orion’s.
We expect to replace these buses in 2016 but since this is an increase in the planned fleet size we have
a need to purchase twenty (21) complete CAD/AVL - radio kits to keep these buses in service. The radio
kits will be transferred to the replacement vehicles when they arrive in 2016.
DISCUSSION
We retired nine buses that were previously used in Longmont. These buses were all equipped with
CAD/AVL radio systems. This reduced the number of radio kits need for the thirty (30) buses being
retained by nine (9) which reduced the required number of radio kits to twenty-one (21). All of our buses
need to be equipped with the CAD/AVL radio system in order for us to keep track of the vehicles and
provide on-time performance data.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total dollars being transferred is $483,000. No additional funds are being requested so there is no
impact on the budget. It is a net zero transfer.
DBE PARTICIPATION
Since this is a financial transaction only DBE requirements do not need to be considered.

Packet Pg. 81

13.B

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee, to approve this transfer in order to
proceed with the purchase of the radio kits.
2. Do not authorize the transfer. This is not recommended because it will cause a delay in the
District’s ability to increase the number of buses in service which will impact service delivery.

Date:

Board Meeting Date: April 21, 2015

Subject:

Increase
General
Counsel's
Settlement
Authority to Colorado Governmental Immunity
Act Claim Limits

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Counsel to settle claims made against the District up to the limits provided in the
Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (CGIA), C.R.S. 24-10-114.
BACKGROUND
Until 2013 the General Counsel had authority to settle claims against the District for amounts for which
the District could be liable under the CGIA. Resolution No. 19, Series of 2007 granted the General
Manager authority to approve and execute settlements of claims against the District in an amount not to
exceed $250,000 per claimant.
The General Manager delegated settlement authority to the General
Counsel. CGIA limited liability for tort claims, a category that covers most personal injury claims, to
$150,000 per person. In 2013 the CGIA was amended and individual claim limits were increased to
$350,000, adjusted every four years by the consumer price index for the Denver-Boulder-Greeley area.
The amendment applied to claims which accrued after July 1, 2013 and for which suits could be
brought starting in 2014.
DISCUSSION
RTD presently has 340 open liability claims. Claims are opened and closed on a revolving basis but
eventually all open claims will be subject to the new CGIA limits. RTD is self-insured for most liability
and manages claims with its in-house risk management and legal staffs. The types of liability claims
which can be brought against the District are limited by CGIA and include operation of vehicles, and
under limited circumstances, walkaways and some facilities. In addition, RTD is liable for claims in
contract or arising out of federal and state statutes. Increasing the General Counsel’s authority will
allow these claims to be settled within the claims budget to the level which most routine types of claims
require. Granting this authority is in keeping with how other types of claims are delegated. Claims
arising out of a project for which the General Manager has been granted budgetary authority are not
brought before the Board. RTD legal and claims staff subscribe to publications such as the Jury Verdict
Reporter, try cases in federal and state district courts, and attend alternative dispute resolution meetings
where experienced judges and attorneys discuss the potential value of claims.
Staff is continually
educated regarding potential outcomes should cases go to trial. The alternative to delegation would be
to bring claims before the Board which would be primarily reliant on counsel’s assessment in authorizing
settlement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact arising from increased settlement authority. Following the change in CGIA
limits RTD began increasing self-insured reserves to account for potential settlements or judgments
under the new statutory limits, has an actuarial study performed each year and has its reserves audited
to ensure they are adequate.

Packet Pg. 83

13.C

ALTERNATIVES
1.
It is recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Counsel to settle claims made against the District up to the limits provided
in the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (CGIA), C.R.S. 24-10-114.
2.

Do not authorize the General Counsel to settle claims against the District for the limits provided in
the CGIA. The General Counsel’s authority would in that case not exceed $250,000 which has
been delegated by the General Manager to the General Counsel. Claims in excess of that amount
would be brought to the Board for settlement authority.

Station Names on North Metro Rail Line

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors accept and
approve the revised final station names for the North Metro Rail Line: 48th & Brighton Blvd at National
Western Center; Commerce City• 72nd; Northglenn•112th; Original Thornton•88th; Thornton
Crossroads•104th; Eastlake•124th; York•144th; and North Thornton•Hwy 7.
BACKGROUND
Station names were originally assigned to locations based on geographic locations during the North
Metro Corridor Environmental Impact Statement (2007 – 2011) and have been used on plans, fact
sheets and the website ever since. During final design, final station names are required for station
signage and related purposes. The following requests were received from the local jurisdictions of
Denver, Commerce City, Northglenn and Thornton.
It is important that station names are recognizable as destinations to RTD patrons. This enables travelers
to easily identify station locations and to efficiently complete trips. Staff recommends station names
that are readily recognizable and make sense for the location while following RTD policy and precedents.
DISCUSSION
The City and County of Denver requested the station at National Western Stock Show be changed to
National Western Center. The City and County of Denver is contributing funds toward the North Metro
Rail Line over and above the required local match. While the National Western Stock Show and National
Western Complex are trademarked names of private entities, the National Western Center is not. In
addition, the intent of the City and County of Denver is to be heavily involved in the “National Western
Center” development in the near future.
Staff Recommendation: Change to 48th & Brighton at National Western Center
This solution fits directly into the current station naming policy of naming stations after cross
streets as well as naming after a publicly recognized location.
The City of Commerce City requested that the 72nd Avenue station be changed it to Commerce CityEast 72nd Avenue.
Staff Recommendation: Change to “Commerce City•72nd”
This solution names Commerce City in the station and includes a cross street in accordance with
the station naming policy. Staff recommends the “East” and the “Avenue” be dropped since no
other stations include a direction or street type designation. It also follows a precedent set at
Littleton•Mineral and Lakewood•Wadsworth stations on other existing lines.

The City of Northglenn

to

Staff Recommendation: Change to “Northglenn•112th”
This solution names Northglenn in the station and includes a cross street in accordance with the
station naming policy. Staff recommends the “Avenue” be dropped since no other stations
include a direction for street type designation. It also follows a precedent set at Littleton•Mineral
and Lakewood•Wadsworth stations on other existing lines where names of cities are added into
station names.
The City of Thornton requested the following station names:
1. Changing “88th” to “Original Thornton at 88th”
This is the first station in Thornton so including the name of the City is appropriate. Using
‘Original Thornton’ gives recognition to the adjoining area where Thornton began.
2. Changing “104th” to “Thornton Crossroads at 104th”
This station is located where two important roads intersect, Colorado Boulevard and 104th
Avenue. Colorado Boulevard runs through the center of Thornton and extends far north into Weld
County and 104th is an important access route to DIA from communities in the northern part of
the metro area.
3. Changing “ 124th-Eastlake” to “Eastlake at 124th”
The Town of Eastlake, now incorporated into Thornton, is a strong historic and geographic
reference point for this station. Eastlake was one of the stops on the original Union Pacific rail
line.
4. Changing “144th” to “York at 144th
York Street and 144th Avenue intersect close to the station and provide a geographic reference
point for this station name.
5. Changing “162nd/Hwy 7” to “North Thornton at Hwy 7”
This station name reflects the fact that the station is located at the northern end of the line and
at the northern boundary of Thornton.
Staff Recommendation: Change to the following – Original Thornton•88th; Thornton
Crossroads•104th; Eastlake•124th; York•144th; and North Thornton•Hwy 7.
Each of the suggestions from the City of Thornton makes sense and fits within the station
naming policy. Staff recommends changing the “at” to a bullet to conform to RTD standards.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact at this time, however decisions need to be made prior to final design
completion so signage and systems set up can be completed with final station names.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the Board of Directors accept and approve the revised final station names for the North
Metro Rail Line: 48th & Brighton Blvd at National Western Center; Commerce City• 72nd;
Northglenn•112th; Original Thornton•88th; Thornton Crossroads•104th; Eastlake•124th;
York•144th; and North Thornton•Hwy 7.
2. Do not accept the recommended action. Instead leave the names as defined in the EIS. This is not
recommended as it would not be responsive to key stakeholders making the request.

a) The new transit facility located at Boulder Junction at Depot Square shall be designated as
Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station; and,
b) The current Boulder Transit Center located at 14th/Walnut shall be renamed as Downtown
Boulder Station.
BACKGROUND
Although the U.S. 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project does not officially have any infrastructure
improvements west of U.S. 36•Table Mesa Station, the new BRT service starting in January 2016 has
triggered a need to name the Boulder end-of-line stations in advance of the production of public
information and marketing campaigns and collateral materials. In addition, RTD will need adequate lead
time to fabricate and install any replacement signage at these station locations prior to opening day.
RTD has not officially named the new transit facility currently under construction at Boulder Junction at
Depot Square near Junction Place and Pearl Parkway in Boulder. In addition, the City of Boulder has
indicated a desire to rename the Boulder Transit Center.
Boulder Junction
The end-of-line bus facility located at Boulder Junction has yet to be officially named. “Boulder Junction”
is the name of the mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented neighborhood in Boulder (30th and Pearl Street) while
“Depot Square” is the name of the development over RTD’s underground bus facility. The city of Boulder
refers to the development housing the RTD transit facility as “Boulder Junction at Depot Square.”
If RTD follows its typical station-naming convention, the transit facility would be named based on its
geographic location, Junction Place and Pearl Parkway. However, both RTD and the city of Boulder
commonly refer to the location as “Boulder Junction”. The city of Boulder and the Boulder Junction
Access District have officially named the development “Boulder Junction at Depot Square”, and the city
has formally requested that RTD use the full development name for the station.
RTD staff recommends the name requested by the city of Boulder.

Boulder Transit Center
The Boulder Transit Center located at 14th and Walnut Street has been in place for many years as the
main RTD transit hub in Boulder. With the Boulder Junction Station coming online as another major
transit hub, the city of Boulder wishes to change the name of this facility to further distinguish it from
the station at Boulder Junction. For this reason, the city of Boulder requests that RTD rename the
Boulder Transit Center to “Downtown Boulder Station.” The proposed name will help customers identify
the location of this station within the city of Boulder. RTD staff has no objections to this request and
agrees that such a change, if desired by all parties, should be implemented with the BRT opening.
Staff Recommendation: Boulder Junction—station name determination
Staff recommends the station name to be designated as Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station for
the following reasons:
 Boulder Junction is a known entity in Boulder and it designates where the bus facility is.
 This name is supported by the City of Boulder.
Staff Recommendation: Boulder Transit Center—name change request
Staff recommends the station name be changed to Downtown Boulder Station for the following reasons:



This name is supported by the city of Boulder
It reflects where the station is located within the city of Boulder.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD has already established a project budget in the FasTracks program to place new signage at the
stations for the implementation of the new BRT service. Any changes to the station naming will be
incorporated into this effort. It is expected that all of the recommended changes can be done within the
established budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors accept and approve the proposed station names for the RTD transit
facilities in Boulder as follows:
a) The new transit facility located at Boulder Junction at Depot Square shall be designated as
Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station; and,
b) The current Boulder Transit Center located at 14th/Walnut shall be renamed as Downtown
Boulder Station.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead, conduct a more extensive naming exercise to
identify an alternate name for the station at Boulder Junction at Depot Square. This is not
recommended because it is a time consuming task and the public is very likely to refer to it by the
recommended name anyway. For the Boulder Transit Center, not accepting the Recommended Action
would result in leaving the name as it is today, “Boulder Transit Center.” This is not recommended as
the city of Boulder has requested the name of the downtown station to be changed.

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: April 21, 2015

Subject:

Authorization to Execute a Budget Transfer to
Purchase Thermal Printers

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer in an amount up to
$1,900,000 from the Mall Shuttle project in order to purchase and install the equipment necessary
to accommodate the sale of fare media under the proposed fare structure.
BACKGROUND
RTD has proposed a modified and simplified fare structure to the Board to be enacted in January 2016.
Under the new fare structure, it is proposed that transfers be eliminated and a day pass be offered to
customers for purchase on board RTD buses. The day pass is proposed to be priced at two times the
single fare and would allow a customer to have unlimited rides during a service day, thereby not
requiring a rider to purchase a fare at each transfer.

DISCUSSION
In order to make the day pass widely available to RTD’s patrons, the ability to purchase day passes is
needed at the location where a patron accesses RTD’s services either on buses or at rail platforms. RTD
currently has the ability to sell day passes at rail platforms through ticket vending machines (TVMs) and
at sales outlets but currently does not have the ability to offer day passes to patrons who purchase their
first fare upon entering a bus. In order to offer a day pass on buses, a thermal printer would be installed
in each bus whereby a customer would pay for the day pass through the farebox and the operator would
produce a day pass from the thermal printer. The day pass will be printed on watermarked paper and
would clearly indicate the service day for which it is valid.
Although the Board has not yet authorized RTD to implement the new fare structure, authority to enter a
contract for the purchase and installation of thermal printers is being sought at this time due to the lead
time necessary to complete this procurement to meet the January 2016 fare structure implementation. If
the final Board action approving changes to RTD’s 2016 fare policy does not include a day pass, thus
negating the need for thermal printers, this funding will not be used.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of installing thermal printers on each of the approximately 1,000 buses in the RTD
fleet is $1,900,000. This cost includes the equipment as well as the connections and installation
necessary to tie the printers into the RTD network.

Packet Pg. 91

14.F

The funding necessary for this procurement would come from a portion of the Certificate of Participation
(COP) proceeds that were authorized by the Board to be used for the replacement of Mall Shuttles.
Therefore, there would be no need to seek additional funding for this procurement and no budgetary
impact other than the transfer of funds from one project to another. These funds will be backfilled
through the 2015 amended budget process.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer in order to purchase
and install the equipment necessary to accommodate the sale of fare media under the proposed
2016 fare structure. This action grants authority to execute a budget transfer in an amount not
to exceed $1,900,000 from the Mall Shuttle project. This is the recommended action.

2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer. This action
would result in RTD’s inability to procure needed day pass fare media equipment in time to
provide the ability for patrons to purchase day passes on buses and avoid multiple fare payments
for transfers. This is not the recommended action.

GM

Date:

April 8, 2015

Board Meeting Date: April 21, 2015

Subject:

Authorization to Execute a Lease Amendment
for Smart Card and /or Thermal Printers

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the First Amendment to
the Lease Purchase Agreement related to the Certificates of Participation, Series 2013A.
BACKGROUND
In 2013 the District issued Certificates of Participation (COPs) to fund the acquisition of buses and
ticket vending machines. The original plan for use of these funds included the acquisition of new
Mall Shuttle buses. Since 2013, the anticipated Mall Shuttle bus manufacturer has gone bankrupt
and the timeline to replace the Mall Shuttles has been delayed.
Also during this time, staff has identified a need for funding in the amount of approximately
$5,700,000 for the following two projects:
1. Expansion of the Xerox contract related to the smart card project ($3,800,000).
2. Thermal printers to support the proposed new fare structure including the purchase of day
passes on buses ($1,900,000).
This action item discusses the amendment of the Lease Purchase Agreement related to the
Certificates of Participation, Series 2013A and the reallocation of some of the funds originally
planned to be spent on Mall Shuttles.

DISCUSSION
The District’s Bond Counsel, Butler Snow, has provided the attached Resolution which authorizes the
execution and delivery of the attached first amendment to the lease purchase agreement related to
the Certificates of Participation, Series 2013A and would allow the District to fund the smart card
and thermal printer expenses identified above. Since the Board previously approved the funding of
the Xerox project in March but has not yet approved the thermal printers, this amendment to the
lease is structured in such a way that either or both projects can be funded with the existing Mall
Shuttle funds following Board approval.
Although the approximate cost of the two requests above is $5,700,000 the Resolution provides for
funding of up to $6,000,000. This allows for the possibility of future board action approving some
additional related project costs without the need to amend the lease a second time.

Packet Pg. 93

14.G

This first amendment to the Lease has been approved by the trustee bank. Bond counsel will provide
the trustee with an opinion that the First Amendment is authorized by the Lease as required by the
Indenture of Trust.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Any 2013 COP Mall Shuttle funds that remain after funding one or both of the two projects above
will be used for bus acquisitions as originally anticipated, possibly even mall shuttles if an appropriate
manufacturer is identified. Any additional funding that may be needed for Mall Shuttles as a result
of this lease amendment is anticipated to be obtained through future COP issuances.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2015, authorizing the execution and delivery of a first amendment to the lease purchase
agreement relating to the 2013 lease purchase agreement and authorizing the General
Manager to take action in connection therewith. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series
of 2015, authorizing the execution and delivery of a first amendment to the lease purchase
agreement relating to the 2013 lease purchase agreement and authorizing the General
Manager to take action in connection therewith. This is not the recommended action as it
would not provide the funding previously approved by the Board in March, 2015 for the
expansion of the Xerox contract in relation to the smart card project.

of the Owners of the 2013A Certificates; and
WHEREAS, the Trustee has given its written consent to the execution and delivery of
this First Amendment; and
WHEREAS, the District and the Corporation desire to amend and supplement the Lease
in accordance with the terms and provisions of this First Amendment.
NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and the
representations, covenants and warranties herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:
Section 1.1
The acquisition and installation of thermal printers, equipment
related to the SmartCard project and other necessary fare collection equipment (collectively, the
“Additional Fare Collection Equipment”) in the maximum principal amount of $6,000,000 shall
constitute a Cost of the Project under the Lease and the Trustee shall be authorized to disburse
moneys on deposit in the Project Fund to pay the costs of acquiring, installing and implementing
the operation of the Additional Fare Collection Equipment.
Section 1.2
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in the
Lease or in the Indenture, the Additional Fare Collection Equipment shall not be included as
2013A Leased Property under the Lease. The District shall retain ownership of the Additional
Fare Collection Equipment and such Additional Fare Collection Equipment shall not be subject
to the terms and provisions of the Lease.
Section 1.3
Exhibit C to the Lease, which sets forth the Release and
Amortization Schedule, shall be amended and restated in whole, in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit C and by this reference made a part hereof. Under the provisions of the Lease, upon the
payment of the principal component of Base Rentals under the Lease in the total cumulative
amount of at least $10,110,000, corresponding components of the 2013A Leased Property are to

Section 12.3 of the Lease.
Section 1.4
Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained in the
Lease or in the Indenture, (a) the District and the Corporation shall not be required to assign to
the Trustee any rights under any contract relating to the manufacture of the Additional Fare

relating to the Additional Fare Collection Equipment without such contract being assumable by
the Trustee.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: April 8, 2015

From:

Doug MacLeod, Controller

GM

Date:

April 8, 2015

Board Meeting Date: April 21, 2015

Subject:

Adoption of 2016 Performance Measures

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopts the attached 2016 Performance Measures for mission statement goals 1-7. There are 23
specific performance measures in total.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These measures provide a framework in which RTD can determine
how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within the context of its
mission statement. A report detailing year-to-date performance on each of these measures is
presented to the Board of Directors following the end of each quarter. The proposed performance
measures for 2016 are brought to the Board of Directors for approval at this time because the
measures are used in development of the 2016-2021 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and 2016 Budget.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the adopted goals from 2015 to 2016 are listed below:
 Goal 1.4 Reduce the number of light rail accidents
o Reportable Light Rail/Auto Accidents per month is removed while Reportable Light Rail
Accidents per 100,000 miles – Preventable is retained. The first measure is considered
no longer relevant as the focus should be directed to preventable accidents. The
revised measure is now the equivalent in Rail as for Bus (Goal 1.1).


Goal 3.3 Improve miles between road calls
The goal for Mileage Between Lost Service Maintenance Road Calls is increased from
26,000 to 28,000 miles. The improvement is expected due to the new bus vehicles
that dominate the bus fleet and require fewer maintenance road calls. A lost service
maintenance road call is a maintenance-related problem that results in a revenue vehicle
being traded, towed, or repaired on the street causing a service delay of 1 minute or
more. Mileage between lost service road calls is calculated by dividing actual miles
operated by the number of lost service maintenance road calls.



Goal 6.1 Maintain all required recovery ratios
A yes/no indication of whether the required SB154 Cost Recovery ratio is met is added
along with the ratio’s definition. The definition of the Operating Cost Recovery ratio is
also added (this ratio is not required by law but has a Board-approved goal of 20%).
The difference between the two ratios is essentially the use of a wider revenue base
that includes federal grants and investment income in the SB154 ratio’s numerator. The

Packet Pg. 120

14.H

required SB154 ratio is 30% and the calculation will be provided with the Financial
Status Reports at each quarter-end only.


Goal 6.2 Increase ridership
o Overall Ridership Increase will be established by the financial plans inherent in the
adoption of the 2016 Annual Budget in November 2015 and in the Board-approved
Ridership Goal model and it is carried as a placeholder at this time.



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total operating revenue
o These measures will be established by the financial plans inherent in the adoption of the
2016 Annual Budget in November 2015 and are carried as placeholders at this time.

It is noted that we will develop a performance protocol for commuter rail linked to the concessionaire
agreement with Denver Transit Operators and such measurement report will be brought to the Board
for review at a later date.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2016 Performance Measures will be utilized in the development of the final 2016 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2016 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures included
in the 2016 Performance Report.
2. Modify the recommended 2016 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance
measures to be included in the 2016 Performance Report and make required adjustments, if
necessary, to the 2016 Requested Budget.

3. Do not adopt the 2016 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures
included in the 2016 Performance Report.
