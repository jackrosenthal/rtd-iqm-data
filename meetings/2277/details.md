## IV. Retiree Awards

Interim General Manager Genova introduced Rosalie Hankus, retired Executive Assistant to the General Manager and CEO, who retired after 39 years of service.  He said it was a real honor to recognize Rosalie Hankus for her 39 years of service where she always had a smile and a positive attitude.  She served as the Executive Assistant since 1991, supporting 3 different General Managers.  He stated that Rosalie is really the face and voice of RTD; she is the first person that many people interact with at RTD.  Rosalie started in 1975 in public information, moved into the marketing department, then transit improvements and design and the planning department all before becoming the Executive Assistant.  Interim General Manager Genova thanked Rosalie for her dedicated to RTD.  She will be missed.

Rosalie said that working here had been terrific; it was really a wonderful place to work.  She is forever grateful to everyone at RTD for all her wonderful years here.

Chair Sisk also thanked Rosalie for her time at RTD.  She has always been the welcoming person for RTD.  She is so cordial and will truly be missed.  Chair Sisk recognized that there have been so many lives touched by RTD.

Chair Sisk recognized Debbie Mills, Customer Service Division Representative for 24 years, who was also retiring but unable to attend the meeting.  He thanked her for her commitment and dedication to RTD.

## V. Public Participation

- Barbara Sabatino, The Gathering Place, shared that she came to Denver to start her life over as a single, divorced woman.  She has been able to do so with the help of non-profit agencies within the community.  Part of being able to start over is also being able to transport herself from one place to the other, which she does through RTD.  She said that when you start at the bottom it is very hard to build your way up with very little money.  Barbara Sabatino asked the Board to not take away transfers and not raise fares.  It will double the cost of riding RTD and make it that much harder for people like her to get on their feet again.

- Rochelle McBride, Denver, has been riding RTD since the age of 7.  She is now homeless and RTD is her only form of transportation.  She does not have a high income and cannot continue to afford to ride if we raise the prices.  She shared that there are many women at her shelter who have disabilities, herself included.  If RTD raises the fares the shelter will no longer be able to assist its residents in getting around either.  She asked the Board to look out for those who are less fortunate and keep the fare where it is.

- Joe Triplett, Aurora, said he was speaking this evening to represent visually impaired seniors.  They are concerned about the cost of Access-a-Ride increasing by two times the proposed comparable fixed route fares.  The Access-a-Ride riders hope that fares for this service can be based on a rider’s economic situation.  He volunteered to be part of a committee or panel to work with the Access-a-Ride staff on this.

- Margaret Johnson, Denver, shared that she recently moved to Denver after living in Texas.  When she got back and the prices were $2.25 for a local fare it was quite a jolt.  She is handicapped, elderly and escaped an abusive partner and she needs RTD’s services.  She said that recently she was given incorrect directions from Customer Information and then continued to receive wrong information from every driver and employee she spoke to.  She stated that we cannot get rid of transfers if we are going to misdirect people who are using the service.

- Zoë Williams, 9 to 5, is a community organizer in Denver.  From where she sits there is a crisis within the Denver metro community, a community that RTD is a part of.  She noted that the reality is that in the City of Denver you have to earn $35 per hour to be able to afford to rent an apartment; however, the fastest growing sector of the workforce is low wage jobs.  She said that people are struggling every day just to get by.  Those same people that are struggling are also those that rely on RTD.  She shared that for the last two weeks people have marched and rallied outside the RTD office to lift up their message that the current cost of RTD is already a burden.  She stated that the proposed fare structure would make public transportation a commodity for those that could afford to make the choice to ride and not for those that need it most.  She is calling on the Board to also lift up the message that has been shared over and over by the public.

- Jo Lorenzini, Denver, said that he is homeless and a veteran.  He recognized that his demographic is a little different in that he is privileged enough to have a car, but he cannot afford to drive every day.  He shared that everyone who is homeless had an income under $700 per month.  At that income they cannot afford to do anything but ride the bus.  They cannot afford rent, medicine, etc.  He said that he depends on transfers when he rides RTD.  He hopes that RTD will keep fares affordable and keep transfers.

- Julie Bennett, Delores Project, stated that it is hard to pay bills and bus fare.  If RTD raises fares she will lose any work she has now as she will not be able to afford to travel there.  She could not get prescriptions, travel to doctors’ appointments, etc. unless she decided to walk, which is not an option as some places she needs to go are 20 miles away.  She said that there are many people in her same situation.  There are many people in need of an income based fare or for the fare to at least remain where it is today.  She believes that raising prices will actually lead to RTD losing money as those that are rich will decide to drive their cars and those that need RTD will not be able to ride.

- Doug Gragg, Denver, said that he wanted to stress to the Board his opinion that we need to hire a minority and a woman at the next General Manager and CEO.  He believes there are many strong candidates in the Denver metro area and we do not need to be looking in other cities.  He thinks Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, would make a good candidate.  He suggested adding fast food restaurants in Denver Union Station to make it more affordable for everyone.

- Cesar Gevert, Denver, is here to represent The Gathering Place, a homeless shelter serving women, children, and the transgender communities.  He stated that 80% of women who become homeless are homeless because they left an abusive relationship.  He recognized that while women’s wages are lower than men, wages for someone who is transgender is even lower.  He shared that 48% of The Gathering Places budget goes to purchasing RTD fare.  If the increase happens 53% of their budget would go to RTD.  He noted that 52% of the population that uses RTD in Denver are poor.  He encourages the Board to really think about an income based monthly pass where people that receive only $180 per month do not have to spend $104 of it on a bus pass.  He also asked that RTD lower the cost of passes through the Non-profit Agency Reduced Fare program so that agencies like his can serve their population better.

- Wilma Barnet, The Gathering Place, shared that she has been riding the bus since it was 50 cents.  She gets $773 per month in disability and only gets an increase of $11 per year.  She wonders how RTD came up with the proposed price increase for the local monthly passes of $25 per month.  She asked the Board to put themselves in her shoes.  She cannot afford these fare increases on her limited budget.

- Sue Vayo, Denver, said her only means of transportation is RTD.  To get anywhere like The Gathering Place for a meal or to visit her mother she has to take three buses.  If RTD takes away transfers than you take away her meal.  She stated that now it will cost her $10 to get to The Gathering Place and visit her mother.  If she had $10 she could afford to buy a meal.

- Tom Grushka, Highlands Ranch, thanked the Board for their time this evening.  He said that as a blind person, he depends on RTD for his independence; therefore, he does not only want to see RTD survive, he wants to see RTD thrive so RTD needs to be sustainable.  He expressed concern about purchasing thermal printers for the buses.  He suggested this action item from staff be more generalized to perhaps allow for the purchase of something using magnetic readers.  He believes this will save costs for RTD.  Tom Grushka said that he is also concerned about a conflict of interest with CH2M Hill being involved in the oil industry.  He is concerned about their objectivity and impartiality in developing a proposed fare structure.  He wonders if they are really working to get more people to ride RTD as that will not be good for their oil business.

- Patrick Horvath, Mile High Connects, is here to speak to the importance of affordability of RTD’s fares.  The comments from the public overwhelmingly support how important this is to the people that elected the Directors.  He believes there are reasonable alternatives to the proposed fare structure and hopes the Board will consider them.

- Gail Whitinger said that since the Board was not taking questions she would just be making a statement.  RTD will lose more money than we will make with these fare changes.

- Jorge Jimenez, Denver, spends 4 hours every day on the bus.  He said he is also concerned about the affordability of fares.  He is lucky to have a job but it is a low income job.  He stated that for people with low income jobs who have a family to raise it will be very difficult to do if the fares are raised.  He imagines it is a lot harder for people who do not work.  He asked the Board to consider having a fare that is affordable to low income people.

Chair Sisk thanked everyone for taking the time to be at the meeting.  He shared that there will be a Study Session scheduled next Tuesday where the Board will be discussing the fare.  He said that while there is not an opportunity for public comment everyone is welcome to attend.

## VII. GM Executive Search Committee Update

Chair Sisk said that progress continues to be made by the Committee.  As everyone is probably aware, on April 9th David Genova was appointed Interim General Manager and CEO of RTD.  He said that CRL Associates, a locally based company, has been selected to provide strategic advisory services.  They will be helping the Committee build a communication plan to ensure we are communicating with, and getting feedback from, our stakeholders, constituents, employees, etc.  Chair Sisk indicated that the goal is to have the GM Executive Search process concluded by January 1st, 2016.  The Committee is also in the process of looking for an executive search firm that will help us find the best candidates.

Chair Sisk stated that the next step would be for the Committee members to work with their buddies to identify leaders within their communities to participate in a focus group.  He asked the Directors to provide those no later than next Tuesday.

- Director Menten inquired if there had been any progress in working with the FTA to redefine the use of the grant money received for the 16th Street Mall reconstruction project.  Interim General Manager Genova said that staff is in the process of working with the FTA.  Staff has been receiving encouraging information that we may be able to do something different but there has been no official decision.
