BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Approval of Board Expense Reductions for 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Executive Committee of the RTD Board of Directors that the Board approve a
motion to adopt the attached Resolution No. ______, Series of 2020, concerning a Reduction of Directors
Expense Budget Lines in Fiscal Year 2021 to Offset Revenue Shortfalls Due to COVID-19 Impacts
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2020 Core Goal #3 - Strong Financial
Management.
BACKGROUND
Directors are eligible for reimbursement from the District for reasonable local and travel expenses
incurred that are necessary to the transaction of official District business. Out-of-District registration
fees for the first two sanctioned events for each Director are not charged against the Director’s
expenses and are instead paid for using Board Office funds.
In 2009, 2011, and 2020, the Board adopted resolutions reducing the Board members’ spending limits
on their local and travel expenses as economic downturns required a reduction in overall agency
spending. The ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and beyond necessitate additional
budget reductions.
DISCUSSION
For Fiscal Year 2021 only, the attached resolution:
•
•
•

Eliminates the amount allocated to each Directors’ travel expense budget;
Reduces by $1,000 the amount allocated to each Directors’ local expense budget;
Eliminates the amount budgeted by the Board Office to defray the cost of Directors’ registration
fees incurred in order to attend out-of-District transit-related conferences.

If favorable economic factors and public health conditions allow, the Board may choose to reinstate
funding, by way of a budget adjustment in 2021, to allow Directors to travel to out-of-District transitrelated conferences.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adoption of this resolution would result in an estimated General Fund savings of $132,000 during Fiscal
Year 2021. This amount represents a 72.7% reduction in the budget allocation for Directors’ overall
local- and travel-related expenses.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

010 SERIES OF 2020
RESOLUTION NO. ______,

WHEREAS, RTD’s Board of Directors consists of 15 elected members who serve their
constituents on a daily basis throughout the community, at committee meetings, study
sessions, and Board Meetings, and at the legislature; and
WHEREAS, each fiscal year moneys are allocated to Directors’ expense budgets to allow for
reimbursement of their individual local and travel expenses; and
WHEREAS, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on both farebox revenues
and sales and use tax revenues; and
WHEREAS, though RTD has received a significant amount of funding through the federal
CARES Act, that amount is not enough to offset lost revenues, and considerable agencywide budget reductions are necessary both now and in future years; and
WHEREAS, physical distancing requirements, broad travel restrictions, and event
cancellations both locally and nationwide have diminished Directors’ opportunities to travel
within their districts to conduct business and meet with constituents and to travel outside
of the state in the exercise of their duties; and
WHEREAS, at the same time, remote meetings have offered the Directors the ability to
conduct business from home, thus minimizing or eliminating the need to travel to and from
the Blake Street Offices to participate in, and formally vote during, Board and committee
meetings during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic; and
WHEREAS, due to projected revenue shortfalls in 2020, the Board of Directors approved
Resolution 012, Series of 2019, and Resolution 006, Series of 2020, which reduced the
amounts allocated to the Directors for fiscal year 2020.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that for fiscal year 2021 only, in light of ongoing
financial hardships impacting the agency, the Board hereby reduces the following budget
lines:

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
September 23, 2021

DRAFT - Strategic Plan Survey Data Validation Board
Report
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Barbara McManus, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 min

BACKGROUND
On August 10, 2021, the Board of Directors adopted four strategic priorities in its 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan, namely:
• Community Value
• Customer Excellence
• Employee Ownership
• Financial Success
The Strategic Plan leverages survey data to gauge key stakeholders’ and customers’ satisfaction with
RTD and the services the agency delivers throughout the region. To establish the baseline and
supplemental data for the Community Value and Customer Excellence strategic priorities, TransPro
Consulting, the consulting firm initially selected through a solicitation process to assist in the creation of
the Strategic Plan, was engaged to conduct surveys in 2021 through the deployment of contracted
professional surveyors.
DISCUSSION
During the June 26, 2021 Board retreat, Directors expressed an interest in engaging a third-party to
validate the survey results as a means of ensuring that the survey data collected by TransPro accurately
reflects the views of RTD’s stakeholders and customers.
In approving this action, the Board acknowledges its intent for Plante Moran to validate the Community
Value and Customer Excellence survey data.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost of survey data validation services performed by Plante Moran at its contractually established
rate is not expected to exceed $2,500.
