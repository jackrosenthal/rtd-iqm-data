### A. Call to Order

Committee Chair Francone called the meeting to order at 3:35 p.m.

Committee members in attendance: Chair Francone, Vice Chair Bagley, Directors Archuleta, Menten, Tobiassen and Walker.  Director Anderson participated via phone

Others Present:               General Manger Genova, Barbara McManus

### B. Review of 2016 Goals & Request for GM Self-Assessment (30 Minutes)

Committee Chair Francone reviewed the October 18th date that the self-assessment was due from GM Genova and asked if there were any questions on the Goals that were approved in 2015 and sent for review in the GMO packet.

There were no questions on the 2016 goals and assessment due date.

### C. Overview-Process and Timing of Evaluation Cycle (20 Minutes)

Committee Chair Francone directed the committee to the timeline provided in the packet and outlined the schedule moving forward, noting that the second survey would be sent in early October and the results would be available for review prior to the meeting on October 25th.  At that meeting, we will also review the final self-assessment submitted by General Manager Genova and discuss as needed.  Committee Chair Francone feels this meeting will have quite a bit of discussion.

Director Bagley suggested the meeting should start at 3:00 instead of 3:30 because of the volume of content.  The committee agreed.

### D. Review GM Fall Performance Survey (10 Minutes)

Committee Chair Francone continued to outline the next meeting dates as follows:

- November 15th:  Assessment discussion, Review of Contract, and Results discussion

- November 22nd:  The full board will be invited to attend the GMO Meeting with Executive Session

- December 6th:  The committee will review Benchmarking and finalize the recommendations to the Board as well as Review the Board Action

- December 20th:  Full Board will Vote on Performance Evaluation and Payout

### E. Questions and Next Steps

Committee Chair Francone asked about the Benchmarking process and how we would go about the process.

Director Bagley asked if we would have any new information to review since we had just done a complete exercise last year when we were in the process of hiring a new General Manager.  Whether we get any concrete data or not we will have the information for reference.

Barbara McManus said she felt she would have some additional information as she had reached out to some of her counterparts through APTA.  She also added that this was a recommendation of the State Audit to review on an annual basis.

Director Anderson asked why we were using the TLRC for any type of Benchmark and feels this is not reliable and would like Barbara to look into this further.

Director Bagley asked about the Self Evaluation and the timeline and if the committee could have the assessment from General Manager Genova ahead of time.  He said if the General Manager were to prepare the self-assessment by October 18th, the committee could review it prior to the meeting on the 25th.  He asked how the rest of the committee felt about that schedule.

General Manager Genova said that schedule would work for him.  He said he would prepare the evaluation for the 18th to be distributed and added to the packet.  The committee agreed.

Committee Chair Francone said the committee would agree to that schedule and felt having the document to review ahead of time would allow the committee form valuable feedback.

### G. Adjourn

Committee Chair Francone adjourned the meeting at 4:05 p.m.
