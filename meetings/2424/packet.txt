Approval of Contract for Investment Advisor
Services

CFO/AGM,

&

Board Meeting Date: January 19, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a one year contract
plus four one year optional extensions to Public Trust Advisors (PTA) to perform RTD’s investment
advisor services. The new contract would begin March 1, 2016 with a cost of up to $175,000 for the
first year depending on the assets under management during the year. The cost of the optional years is
also dependent on the assets under management at that time. The cost for all four option years is
anticipated to be approximately $800,000, if executed. Total cost for five years is anticipated to be
$975,000.
BACKGROUND
RTD has utilized Public Finance Management (PFM) as investment advisor for the past five years in
relation to RTD’s bond proceeds and operating funds. With the end of this contract approaching, a
Request for Proposals (RFP) was published in November, 2015. Notifications regarding the procurement
were sent to a total of six financial institutions.
DISCUSSION
Proposals were received from eleven financial institutions. All Proposals received were evaluated and
scored according to the Selection Criteria included in the District’s RFP which were:






Cost of Services (20%)
Exhibited knowledge and understanding of the RTD’s investment parameters and related
Colorado statutes. (20%)
Specific strategy recommendations and approach in regard to the investment of proceeds.
(20%)
Qualifications, experience and ability of the firm and the individuals assigned to this
engagement in providing the services outlined in “Statement of Work”.
Overall completeness, clarity, and quality of the proposal and responsiveness to the RFP.
(20%)

Through this evaluation process, the following two firms were identified as the best value for RTD:



Public Finance Management (PFM)
Public Trust Advisors (PTA)

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

RTD issued a best and final offer request to these two firms to ensure the best possible pricing was
obtained. The proposal evaluation committee determined that Public Trust Advisors (PTA) had the best
overall proposal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the first year of this contract has been included in the 2016 Budget. Funding for the four
optional years would need to be appropriated in future RTD budgets. Funding for investment advisor
services is an annual recurring expenditure that is regularly included in the budget and SBP process.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Approve the recommendation to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors authorizes the Interim General Manager to execute all documents necessary
to award a contract to Public Trust Advisors to perform RTD’s investment advisor services.
This is the recommended action.
2) Do not approve the recommendation to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorizes the Interim General Manager to execute all documents
necessary to award a contract to Public Trust Advisors to perform RTD’s investment advisor
services. This is not the recommended action because it will delay having an investment
advisor available and staff has found Public Trust Advisors to have the best overall proposal.

(1) The majority of debt interest payments occur on December 1st therefore variance will correct by year end
(2) Increase due to drawing funds from the TIFIA loan (TIFIA loan of $280m has been fully drawn) and issuance of 2015 COPs.
(3) Increase is due to funds being set aside for semi-annual debt service payments
(4) Variance is due to a timing difference between construction expenditures and bond and COP draws. Bond and COP draws will replenish this by year-end.
(5) Increase is due to the increase to fund balances per the 2015 amended budget
(6) Decrease will be replenished with draws on Bond and COP project funds at year-end

&

Board Meeting Date: January 12, 2016

The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public currently
enrolled in the pubic pilot program to pay for transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored
Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards encoded with chips. These cards can be loaded with certain
dollar amounts and used much like a debit card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or
rail until the dollar amount on the card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto
the card at RTD retail outlets.
Over the New Year weekend, the elements of the fare revenue program were moved into an operating
state. This included:
 Day Pass Printers installed and operational on RTD fixed route buses
 Vouchers for the first 1,000 Pilot Participants were distributed; more participants will follow in a
staggered launch
 For Pilot participants, Stored Value cards available for purchase at RTD sales outlets
 New Fare Structure deployed on buses, at rail stations, TVMs, Fareboxes, etc.
 New platform validator layout and stickers addressing recommendations of National Federation of
the Blind of Colorado (NFBCO) and other constituents
 New Run Board
 Web portal enhancements focused on Customer Care functionality (activated earlier)
Starting the morning of Monday January 4th, cards were being dispersed to the Public Pilot Riders at the
RTD retail outlets.
