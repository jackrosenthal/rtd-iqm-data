C. Updates

• Denver Union Station Update
Bill Mosher with the Denver Union Station Project Authority addressed the
questions that had been presented by different Directors at the prior
meeting. The pedestrian bridge is 260 ft long from 18th Street to Wewatta.
The cost of the bridge is $5.2 million including the elevators; the elevator
itself is worth $1.2 million.
Director Bagley had requested a tour and Bill stated he would work with the
Board Office to coordinate. Director Deadwyler had asked about affordable
housing and he is still waiting for an answer as the staff person that had the
information is out of town.
He stated that as of February 28, they have spent $387 million and are 81%
completed. On the light rail the final acceptance was obtained on December
22, 2011 and the LRT Plaza opened on May 18, 2012. On the regional Bus
facilities, the critical path for the entire project goes through the bus box
structure. On Phases I & II West of Wewatta, they have completed the
Chestnut Pavilion elevator and escalator installation as well as the fire
damper installation in Plenum. The Chestnut pavilion exterior is nearing
completion. The storefront framing and glazing; the concourse metal panel
columns wraps; lighting fixtures installation as well as the smoke/exhaust

On the commuter rail, they have completed the steel fabrication for the CRT
canopy and the CRT systems duct bank in the throat. They are nearing
completion for the OCS foundation pier drilling and the CRT train hall canopy
structural steel erection among other aspects. Platform No. 2 construction
continues. The EVA lane structure and the chiller enclosure near platform 5
are underway.
Streets and Plazas completed include the LRT Plaza, 17th Street Gardens
Plaza and 16th Street (Chestnut to Wewatta). 16th Street (Wewatta to
Wynkoop) is expected to be completed in April. Wewatta Street is expected
to be completed during the summer and the Wynkoop Plaza by November.
The two way Mall Shuttle traffic is open on 16th Street with a minor detour.
Bill Mosher also provided an update on the DUS renovation project. He will
work with team USA to get some pictures as they will be taking a tour in
the next couple of days. Public involvement is still being solicited. They are
coordinating all the private projects and the interpretive display is underway.
Director Daly asked if chiller is what they call the air conditioner. Bill stated
that it is and it is only for cold air.
Director Folska asked if he is aware of any condominiums in the DUS area.
Bill stated that due to the FHA increasing the requirements, it is hard to get
financing for condominiums. Also, the construction defect laws in Colorado
are too onerous and expensive. Insurance companies do not want to cover
that. It is hard to get insurance and financing and is a big liability for a long
period of time; all of this might prevent construction of condominiums for a
while.
Director Bagley asked if they could do the tour on a Tuesday before the
committee meetings or Board meeting. He also asked if the tour could
hopefully be done before the 18th of April. Bill stated that he will coordinate
with Paula and the Staff.
Director Solano asked what would happen to the tracks over the bus box in
a storm situation. Bill Mosher clarified that below grade does not mean
below ground. The tracks are on a channel over the top of the bus box;
Packet Pg. 6

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 5, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

evacuation fan installation are all underway. In Phase III East of Wewatta
(behind DUS), they have completed several components including the train
bridge caissons and caps; the precast beams and planks installation;
backfilling the bus box wall and waterproofing among others. The Wewatta
and DUS pavilions elevator and escalator installations are underway. Finish
work continues within the public restrooms as well as the sawtooth
concrete Apron bus slips.

6.A

Director James asked if they are still under budget. Bill stated that they are
spending the money allocated and are trying to keep costs down. They are
trying to use funds efficiently as they are on a fixed dollar amount. He
stated they are also on schedule. They are focusing on getting the office
space for Amtrak done to be able to move them back. The contractors have
done remarkably well in the area of safety with close to 600 days without
incidents. Contractually they are scheduled to finish by 2014 and they
expect to have it done on time.
Director James thanked him for all they have done. Bill thanked the Board
for the opportunity to present and their support.

D. Other Matters
Director James stated that on the morning of March 21st the Board of
Transportation Solutions will host their Annual Road Ahead event, and all Directors
are invited.

there are water proofing and drainage provisions for the tracks. Rick Clarke
also stated that the trains will clear the snow as long as they are run
frequently. General Manager (GM) Phil Washington stated that the light rail
has never stopped. Bill Mosher stated that they are not concerned about
water sitting in the tracks as they have planned for it.

C. Updates

• Legislative Update - Local, State, Federal
Local – Roger Sherman
Roger Sherman said that in looking at the meetings CRL Associates has had
since the last update, the one theme that really runs consistent is discussion
about revenue options. He stated that this morning they had a Metro
Mayors Caucus FasTracks Task Force Meeting that Directors Bagley and
Sisk attended along with General Manager Washington and several other
RTD Staff. Roger Sherman believes it was a very good discussion similar to
the statewide discussion of how to fund transportation and make the
appropriate allocations. He said that at the meeting they were given a
spreadsheet that outlined the various options the Mayors are considering
which is very extensive.
Roger Sherman stated that there was a full Metro Mayors Caucus Meeting
on February 6th, an Impact 64 Meeting on February 12th, a Metro Area
County Commissioners meeting on February 22nd, and the Colorado
Transportation Commission meeting on February 26th. At all of these
meetings, a major component was transit funding. He explained that these
discussions are complicated because they are at a statewide level. Roger
Sherman said that the allocations would most likely be done based on
population. Roger Sherman explained that he has offered to go to a Club 20

meeting to provide an update to them on the polling that has been done
showing that transit is very popular.

State – Brandeberry~McKenna
Jenifer Brandeberry stated that this Friday, March 8, 2013, will mark the
hallway point of the Colorado General Assembly. She stated that as the
Board may know, they have been spending a lot of time on some very
controversial issues ranging from civil unions to gun legislation. Jenifer
Brandeberry shared that in all her time lobbying she has never seen so many
big, emotional issues going in front of the legislators.
Jenifer Brandeberry outlined that for RTD’s agenda, her team is working on
the bill to change our parking statute. This is a Democratic sponsored bill
by Nancy Todd in the Senate. The bill’s House sponsor is Republican Kevin
Priola. This bill has moved from the Senate into the House and is scheduled
to be discussed in the House Transportation Committee on March 6, 2013.
She shared that they have spent a lot of time with the Transportation
Committee Members; this committee contains many legislators who come
from the northern part of the state. Jenifer Brandeberry stated that no one
to date has testified in opposition of the legislation; however, there are many
cities, city managers, etc. who have approached us about working on an
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). She shared that our sponsors
understand that if RTD needed to go out and negotiate 35-40 IGAs it would
defeat the purpose of the legislation. This is a permissive tool for RTD and
our partners in the local communities.
General Manager Washington reiterated that we have been hearing that
other cities are requesting to execute the “Boulder Model” not understanding
that Boulder is unique because it has only one facility that RTD owns. He
stated that we have not anticipated administering a large number of IGAs. It
is RTD’s position that we are not staffed nor was it ever intended that we
would administer 30+ IGAs. General Manager said that Director Lasater
had mentioned setting up a task force; he believes that is appropriate but we
are not set up to administer that many IGAs.
Jenifer Brandeberry stated that the other piece of legislation her team is
working on is a bill that will be introduced in the next week. The sponsors
Packet Pg. 10

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 5, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Roger Sherman shared that he attended the City and County Manager’s
Association Conference on February 14th and 15th. While there was nothing
specific pertaining to RTD at the conference he believes building
relationships with the city managers is very important to RTD’s long term
success. He stated that he met with the new Commissioner, Casey Tighe,
from Jefferson County and also has meetings scheduled with several other
new commissioners in the upcoming weeks.

6.B

Jenifer Brandeberry shared that there were a few other bills that might have
interest for the Board. One is a bill to allow the local jurisdictions to use the
High Performance Transportation Enterprise money for transportation
purposes. This bill has cleared the Senate and is in the House
Transportation Committee. Jenifer Brandeberry noted Director Folska’s
question to Bill Mosher regarding Transit Oriented Development. She
believes SB 52 addresses some of the concerns he mentioned about our
current construction defect statute. This bill has been taken off the table
but the conversations have been that it will be re-scheduled once DRCOG
completes a study they are currently working on.
Jenifer Brandeberry said that at the beginning of the session Senate Bill 23
was introduced. It would do a very dramatic overhaul of the Colorado
Governmental Immunity Act. This bill proposed raising the overall cap that
had not been raised since the 1970s. She believes the timing was very ripe
for this bill. The bill bumped the cap from $150 thousand to $350 thousand
per claim with an ongoing index. Jenifer Brandeberry stated that the bill
was testified to in the Senate last week with zero opposition; the bill was
put on the Consent calendar. She stated that the bill will pass.
Jenifer Brandeberry stated that the Joint Transportation Committee is
meeting very regularly at the state level to keep up-to-date on what is going
on. She shared that Brandeberry~McKenna and RTD have been invited to
present on March 28, 2013 to the Committee. The goal of the presentation
is to share with the Committee how we have been so innovative and
creative with our funding.
Jenifer Brandeberry informed the Board that they are and will continue to
see a very active, innovative group of people who want to look at doing
government differently. She thanked the Board for their working relationship
and all their outreach to their legislators.
Director James asked if it would be possible to prevent the request for other
IGAs by removing Boulder from the language of the bill. Marla Lien

Packet Pg. 11

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 5, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

of the bill will be the Majority House Leader, Dickey Hullinghorst, and Chair
of the Joint Budget Committee, Senator Pat Steadman. She explained that
this bill came from RTD’s work on the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM).
Colorado has a very complicated Sales and Use Tax System. Jenifer
Brandeberry stated that for various reasons, the State collects Sales Tax on
certain items and RTD collects on certain items but they do not match. The
purpose of the bill is to streamline the collections so that what RTD collects
matches with what the State collects. She said that this bill is projected to
increase RTD’s collections by about $3 to $3.5 million.

6.B

Director Menten shared that she listened to the hearing in the Senate and
she thought there was a great deal of confusion about the parking bill. She
stated that she is confused as to why there will be a House hearing on the
bill tomorrow as well as a scheduled briefing for March 28th. Director
Menten wonders why we are waiting so long to have a briefing when we are
putting the bill through these hearings. Jenifer Brandeberry explained that
the briefing on March 28th is a general briefing about RTD and public
financing while the hearing tomorrow is Committee Bill Hearing for the
House Transportation Committee.
Director Menten asked if Jenifer Brandeberry could provide her with further
information on the tax bill once it is available. Jenifer Brandeberry said she
would get that to Director Menten as soon as it is available.
Federal Update
Sherry Ellebracht explained to the Board that Mike Dino was in Washington,
D.C. so she would be providing them with an update. She stated that
sequestration did go into effect on March 1st, 2013. Sherry Ellebracht
shared that the final figures from the Office of Management and Budget
indicate that the New Starts Grants will be reduced by about 5%. She
explained that we do not know how those cuts will be allocated. Sherry
Ellebracht said that the formula funding would be exempt from the
sequestration budget cuts.

 Legislative Conference - Key Messaging
Sherry Ellebracht provided the Board members with a packet of information
for their upcoming trip to Washington, D.C. for the APTA Annual Legislative
Conference. She stated that it contained Patton Boggs’ Power Point
presentation that has excellent slides as well as some talking points and
background information that Board members can speak to when they go to
their meetings on the Hill.
Sherry Ellebracht explained that there are several things we will be asking
for when we meet with our delegates. She stated that RTD still does not
know what we will be receiving as an appropriation for Eagle P3. We will be
asking our delegation to write a letter to the FTA and Department of
Transportation asking for the most funding possible for that project. Sherry
Ellebracht stated that with the sequestration affecting New Starts Grants, it
will also be important for us to explain the consequences to the Eagle P3
project if we do not receive the full grant funding. She said that it will be
very important to go to the meetings prepared and to speak as one voice
with one message.

Packet Pg. 12

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 5, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

explained that Boulder was not in the language of the bill but it was a
separate IGA with RTD.

6.B

Sherry Ellebracht said that she believes the presentations will be fantastic.
Directors and Staff go to the conference to hear the latest on what is
happening and APTA always has presenters that can provide the most up-todate information.
General Manager Washington said that it will be important to continue to
repeat the messages that staff has been impressing upon the FTA
Administrator. The first message is to convey the uniqueness of the Eagle
P3 project; this is the only Public-Private Partnership in the country. It is
also important to convey RTD’s track record of success. Finally it is
important to highlight the WIN job creation that is tied to the project.

There were no other matters.

B. CAC Update
David Lewis stated that on February 20th the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC)
had a monthly working session at Civic Center with an update from the
Government Affairs staff. They also held a CAC briefing for the new directors; he
thanked Directors Anderson, Lubow and Solano for attending. On February 26 they
had an Advance (Retreat) to focus on how to be an asset to the Board and staff in
communicating with the community and collecting feedback on the build out of
FasTracks. They have established one-on-one meetings with the Board members to
help make personal connections and understand their priorities and interests for
their districts. The quarterly community outreach meetings for the year have been
scheduled in order to provide more advance notice. The CAC members are
reaching out to their networks in those communities. David Lewis encouraged the
Board members to participate in these meetings as it adds credibility, the
community feels they are being heard, and the CAC acts as a conduit for the
communication. He will provide the dates to the Board office.
Director Bagley stated that he was part of the selection committee for the CAC.
He complimented the CAC for the activities they have undertaken. He believes it is
critical for the Board members to go out of their districts and attend the CAC
meetings. He indicated that the discussions held by the CAC and information they
provide to the Board is often different than the Board expects. He also stated that
the next CAC meeting will be in Highlands Ranch on March 20th. It is important for
other members to come to that meeting. He thanked the CAC for what they do as
they are an extension of the Board.
Director Tobiassen thanked David Lewis for the presentation. He also supported
Director Bagley’s statement on the importance of what the CAC does and
supported Directors attending the meetings.

C. Recommended Actions

• Property Acquisition for the I-225 Project

Motion:

Director Rivera-Malpiede made the
motion to move this item to the
full Board at the February 19th,
2013 Board meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Director Walker recused himself due to a conflict of interest.
Rick Clarke stated that in September the Board approved the
acquisition of the majority of properties needed for this
project. As the final design progressed, they have identified
additional smaller parcels that are required. This proposal is
for four additional parcels; two of them are for the traction
power substations which often can be moved around, this is
why they were not included in the original packet. The other
two parcels are sliver parcels for sidewalks identified as
detailed design of the bridge over Mississippi progressed.
John Shonsey, Chief Engineer, provided a background of the
process used for property acquisition. The process normally
begins in the environmental stage where the alignment and
properties impacted are identified. During the design the
parcels required and size of each are identified. The Uniform
Property Acquisition Act passed by Congress in 1970 and
amended in 1987, which provides consistency independently
of the location of the property, is always followed by RTD.
Once the properties have been identified, staff sends a letter
of intent to the owners. The next step is to move to the
appraisal phase to identify the fair market value. If the
property exceeds $5,000 the owner has the ability to get his
own appraisal which RTD will pay for. RTD will make an offer
to the property owner based on the established fair market

Packet Pg. 16

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 5, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying
properties as necessary for construction of the I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail
Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under
state eminent domain law.

6.C

Director Lasater asked if staff knows how many times we
have not been able to negotiate and used eminent domain.
John Shonsey stated that the West Corridor is a good
example, RTD acquired almost 100 properties and only 3%
went through the condemnation process. The goal is to not
go to court but agree in the fair market value. Director Lasater
asked if there is a common thread as why we do not get a
closure in the negotiation. John Shonsey stated that in most
cases it is due to a significant difference in the appraisal value
and we cannot reach an agreement. Sometimes the property
owner really does not want to sell the property and we have
to go to court for the project to continue. Rick Clarke stated
that most of the time it is because of the difference in
appraisal value. Also, sometimes the properties are large
commercial properties which have a unique purpose and can
get complicated.
Director Lubow stated that she was concerned about the
resolution stating that “the designee has the authority to
amend, including enlarging the legal description of the
properties”; this statement leaves the Board approval vague.
She wanted to know if this is only for the minor changes.
Marla Lien stated that the only way RTD can take properties is
for a transit purpose. As design goes from 30 to 100 percent
requirements might change. Sometimes it is just right-of-way
and sometimes the owner requests RTD take more property.
John Shonsey stated that it works both ways, as property
owner may also request that RTD change the design to avoid
taking part or the whole property. Director Lubow asked if
this clause has made any significant difference in what
property is acquired versus what the Board approved. Marla
Lien stated that it only affects the size of the property; to buy
any additional properties staff would have to come back to the
Board. Rick Clarke stated that if staff has to come back to the
Board for every minor change it would use up a great deal of
staff’s time.
Packet Pg. 17

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 5, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

value. If the owner rejects the offer, RTD moves into
condemnation proceedings. Even once the condemnation
proceedings have begun, RTD continues negotiations with the
owner. Along with the condemnation proceedings, RTD goes
into an immediate possession hearing for the property in order
to allow RTD to begin construction. RTD only acquires
properties that are needed for transit use or purpose. If we go
to court, the fair market value is determined by the court.

Director Sisk asked why we cannot work an agreement with
the public service company for the amount of property
required. Marla Lien stated that the eminent domain starts
when we tell the property owner that RTD has the legal
authority to take that property even if they do not want to
sell. Under the Uniform Act RTD is required to establish our
authority. Unless we disavow ourselves in writing of the right
to take the property, it is under eminent domain law and we
have to comply with the process even if it is public services.
The likelihood of this going to court is minimal. Director Sisk
stated that his concern is that when these issues go to court it
is bad public relations for the agency as well as the city and
the county as these are our customers. This is a very
expensive process. He requested an analysis and lessons
learned on how we can avoid condemnation, even though he
understands the letter has to be sent out. John Shonsey
stated that they will provide the information.
Rick Clarke stated that staff works hard to try to avoid having
to go to trial; however, there was a case that went to trial
because the other party was asking for $5 million and we
were offering less than $1 million. Director Sisk stated that
when making that decision we should put into consideration
the fact that we will have to pay attorney fees and other cost
to move forward with the court proceeding. John Shonsey
stated that RTD is confined the Uniform Act and the fact that
in many cases we have federal funds involved. When we use
federal funds we have to justify the value and need
concurrence from the federal government in order to proceed
with the fair market value which is established through the
different appraisals. If there is a difference in the appraisals
staff will try to negotiate but staff still has to have the
documentation in order to support the case. We use Uniform
Act to make sure that everybody is treated the same. Marla
Lien stated that in non-federal projects there is an appraiser,
review appraiser and for properties above $250,000 they need
to be reviewed by the Federal Government to approve the
settlement. GM Phil Washington stated that staff does
everything possible to avoid the courts and spend an incredible
amount of time on disputed acquisitions. Staff always talks
about the possibilities and settlement options.
Director Solano asked what happens when we are taking land
from a business that will then need to close. John Shonsey

stated that whether it is a business or a family, RTD would
provide relocation assistance and try to help them find a
location that is suitable because economically it is more viable
for them to stay within the same community. Staff works
with cities and communities through their economic
development staff. RTD provides assistance and takes
everything into account. This is included in the evaluation of
the property. Director Hoy asked if any of the properties in
this request will have that kind of impact. John Shonsey
stated that none of these acquisitions will have to relocate
anybody. Director Hoy requested for this discussion to
continue offline.
Director Tobiassen stated that this process is the back end of
a very long process that started years ago with the
environmental study. RTD has hosted several public meeting
and outreach to many of the property owners in the corridor;
these owners are already aware that this would happen.
Many of the property owners have been present at the Board
meetings; this is a win-win for anybody in the corridor.
Director Menten asked if they have used any appraisers from
out of state for I-225. John Shonsey stated that he is not
aware of any appraisers from out of state. Appraisers have
been hired by the contractor. If the property owner wants an
appraisal, it is up to him to determine who the appraiser will
be, but normally they will pick a local appraiser.
Director Hoy recognized John Shonsey who is retiring from
RTD. Rick Clark stated that they will miss John as he has
been instrumental in developing FasTracks and making sure it
is moving successfully. He will be working until the end of
March; they will have a happy hour on Thursday the 14th.

for On-Call Construction Services
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award contracts to
Krische Construction, Gilmore Construction Corporation, ITP Construction
Services, Inc., and Sky Blue Builders, LLC, the four most qualified firms
based on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the amount up to $40
million for On-Call Construction Services. The work in these contracts will
consist of general civil construction including grading, drainage, utilities,
paving, intersection improvements, site work and landscaping. Funding for
these contracts will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the
work is performed.
Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the
motion to move this item to the
full Board at the February 19th,
2013 Board meeting.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded
the motion.

Discussion:

Rick Clarke stated that with a program as large as FasTracks,
there is often a need for contractors to do miscellaneous
construction work. This is usually work that does not fall
within the prime contract and it is more cost-effective to do it
separately. In the past, they have had good experiences with
On-Call construction services. The staff in Capital Programs
and the Civil Rights Division worked together to structure this
contract in order to allow small and mid-size contractors to
work on FasTracks. They did a best-value selection which
includes both price and technical capability. Staff selected
four contractors for the job in this request. He recognized
the representatives from the different contractors present at
the meeting.
GM Phil Washington stated that each of these contractors
have agreed to hire WIN participants in their projects.

D. Updates
Rick Clarke introduced the Eagle P3 team, which includes Brian Middleton,
Project Director; Greg Straight the Design-Build Manager and Ashland
Vaughn, Construction Manager. Other team members were also in the
audience.
They presented a video on the progress of Eagle P3.
Greg Straight stated that the Eagle P3 Project includes the East Rail Line
which offers 34-minute travel time to DIA; the Gold Line which offers 25minute travel time to Ward Road and the Northwest Rail Westminster
Segment which offers 11-minute travel time to Westminster. This also
includes the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF). He reviewed the
historical milestones which include the groundbreaking for each for each of
the corridors which are now underway.
The presentation included the project scope, the financial breakdown for the
$2.2 million and major changes that have occurred. The contractor has done
a great job in developing the final design. They have been working with the
communities to identify different interest/requirements that enhance the
project and the community. One of the changes was the Aviation Station,
which has not cleared at the federal level but is expected to move forward.
This will be the year when they change the landscape of the Denver
Community as intersections will change, bridges will be built, and the rail
will be put down. They are still on track for opening in 2016.
Ashland Vaughn stated that at this point there are 21 bridges under
construction with close to 26 miles of track construction and 70% of rail
welding completed. Our partners have done a fantastic job and minimized
the obstruction to the public and worked hard on public outreach. He
provided a summary of the situation in each of the corridors and the CRMF.
Greg Straight stated that the vehicles are being built specifically for the
project. Staff has worked with the community on the vehicle design,

• Eagle Update

6.C

Bill Sirois, Senior Manager for Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and
Planning Coordination, provide update on developments at 38th and Blake
where the Urban Land Conservancy is doing a project. The Olde Town
Arvada Station is included in the pilot program. In December the Board had
discussed putting out a Request for Qualifications (RFQ), jointly with the
City of Arvada and Arvada Urban Renewal Authority (AURA). The RFQ
came out on March1, 2013 for a master developer to identify how to
incorporate the station with the community in that area. They have received
an unsolicited proposal for the Arvada Ridge Station and expect to have a
decision soon on whether or not to accept that proposal.
Ashland Vaughn stated that they have over 350 people in the WIN program
and 73 of them have been placed. 60 of them are at RTD and FasTracks
with 93% of them retaining their jobs after 90 days with an average starting
salary of $16.75.
Director Folska asked if the video is available on the website. Greg stated
that it is not available yet as this is the first time it has been shown but it
will be posted tomorrow. Director Folska asked if they will write a white
paper on safety. Rick Clarke stated that they are updating the design criteria
for crossings and have put together a taskforce to develop lessons learned
from the different corridors. As far of the white paper, they might write a
technical paper to share with APTA with regard to the challenges and how
they were addressed. Director Folska asked for clarification of what
happened on March 1st. Bill Sirois stated an RFP was sent out and we
expect to have it back by April. Once we receive it, they will solicit an RFP.
Director Folska asked for clarification on the difference between an RFP and
RFQ. Bill Sirois stated that the RFQ is a Request for Qualifications, which
identifies qualifications to be a master developer. Once those are received
they create the RFP which includes a more detailed and conceptual level
plan on how they would incorporate RTD’s facilities into a development in/or
around the station. Director Folska asked if the developers are local. Bill
stated that it is being advertised both locally and around the country.
Director Tobiassen thanked the Eagle team for the presentation. He thanked
them especially for the work they have done in protecting Colorado wild life
in the corridors. It is very difficult. He also recognized the PI team.
Director Lubow seconded Director Tobiassen’s comments and thanked the
staff for their efforts. She asked about the developer withdrawing the
Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 5, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

primarily with constituents with special needs to get their feedback. These
modifications have been incorporated to address their requests. The final
production will be done in Philadelphia. The presentation also included the
rolling stock and systems progress.

6.C

Director Rivera-Malpiede also congratulated the team for an awesome job.
They have been on call 24/7 and she thanked them for their efforts and for
coming to the communities to answer questions. She is proud to have a
facility that will be LEED certified. This will be a major cornerstone for the
communities. The WIN facts are impressive. She is proud to be on this
Committee.
Director Menten asked if RTD will be paying the developer that is
withdrawing because they did not get the money form Arvada. Bill Sirois
stated that it was defined that RTD would not bring any additional money to
the table; the money that is already allocated will be the money used to help
build the garage. Director Menten asked who will profit if the legislation
passes and Arvada comes back in. Bill Sirois stated that the entire intent
with the parking bill in this particular instance is to provide a revenue source
to fund the gap to build parking, without funding it would not be possible.
The revenue would be used to pay for the parking structure. Director
Menten asked if the developer would function only as the developer and not
operator of the parking facility. Bill Sirois stated that if we were to accept
the unsolicited proposal, which has not been decided yet, all the details
would be subject to negotiation; staff would come back to the Board for
approval.
Director Daly asked if they can still run in the same strength by using surplus
rail from the West Corridor which is light rail and shifting into commuter rail.
Greg Straight stated that they absolutely can because it is all 115 pound
rails.
Director Anderson thanked the staff for all the hard work they have done on
the Eagle P3 project. Though she appreciates their efforts to save wildlife,
she is very pleased with the way that staff has work with the cities of
Arvada and Denver and all the places close to the railroad tracks. Staff
spent hours working with the neighborhoods and she appreciates the
fabulous work they have done. It makes her job easy. This is the
culmination of all the years of work since 2010 when they first started the
Eagle P3 project. As part of the TOD projects it is great to have cooperation
between RTD and the city of Arvada. It is impressive the densities that
have been built in property that was polluted and the developer has cleaned
up.

proposal for TOD in Arvada for the parking structure. Bill Sirois stated that
the developer was depending on city funding it did not receive. He is still
evaluating and staff is meeting internally to make a final evaluation. Director
Lubow asked if that means that if the proposal is withdrawn then RTD
would have the regular proposed parking. Bill Sirois stated that is correct.

6.C

Director Folska asked for the name of the developer with the unsolicited
proposal and how much parking they would construct. Bill Sirois stated
that the developer is Paragon Development. For Arvada Ridge they are
contemplating 210 spaces. Director Folska asked what demand is
anticipated. Bill Sirois stated that it is a 30 year demand; they are building
with the idea that it will last for 30 years.
Director Hoy thanked them for the presentation. He is excited that the
communities will finally be able to see what we are doing.

There were no other matters.

B. Recommended Actions

• Radio-CAD/AVL Owner’s Representative Contract Fifth-Year Amendment
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute
all documents necessary to amend the contract with IBI Group (IBI) as the
Owner’s Representative to Support Replacement of RTD’s Radio and
Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL)
Systems (Contract 18DH016). This contract amendment is for the fifth year
of a five year period of performance. The scope and fee are renegotiated
annually. The fifth-year fee is not-to-exceed a limit of $1,700,000 for a
total contract value to date of $9,622,000.

Director Lasater asked what the life expectancy is for the
hardware. George Hovey stated that it is six to seven years
and that they are half way complete with the installation of
the system. Staff has started with the capital budget process
going six and seven years out. They feel confident in gaining
full value as they have a state of the art system in terms of
quality. Director Lasater stated that based on his experience
in municipal government, the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) has been changing bandwidths. Since RTD
has a 450MHz Analog Radio communications systems, would
this mean that the agency will have to throw everything out
and reinvent the wheel? George Hovey stated that they are
trying to move out of the 450MHz bandwidth and relinquish
the license. RTD is currently operating in a grandfathered
waver for 2013 and if it is not off that bandwidth by the end
of the year RTD could get penalized by the FCC. The agency
is working in two modes: for voice communications they are
working with the State of Colorado, emergency services
agencies with Consolidated Communications Network of
Colorado (CCNC). For data transmission RTD is using cellular
technology.
Director Bagley asked what was the contract amount for the
fourth year. George Hovey stated that it was over $2 million.
They offer technical services and the installation which
includes 5-10 major contracts.

meeting.

Discussion:

David Genova, Assistant General Manager introduced Richard
Rost, Facilities Engineering Manager and Robin McIntosh,
Senior Facilities Manager. David Genova stated that the light
rail maintenance-of-way (MOW) group is in need of a new
place to accommodate growth of the light rail system for both
base system and FasTracks. The property was initially
acquired to relocate the Burnham Yard lead track. The original
plan was to demolish the building. The building will be a
combination facility as it will serve the base system and
FasTracks. The acquisition of the property that was necessary
for the West Line, was a $9.2 million investment made by
FasTracks.
Director Sisk asked why the Kiewit bid was determined to be
unresponsive. Richard Rost stated that there are attachments
that are required by all bidders and Kiewit failed to submit one
of them. David Genova stated that there were about eight
items that were part of the bid package, different forms and
certifications they need to provide, and Kiewit did not include
all requirements. General Manager (GM) Phil Washington
stated that staff always offers an opportunity for firms that
want a debrief, but in this case there were several forms
missing to include some SBE documents and staff had no
choice but to deem it non-responsive.
Director Solano asked how many companies had placed bids
and how this was the best bid. Richard Rost stated that they
award based on low bid and if the low bidder is nonresponsive they go to the next bidder. David Genova stated
that this is an invitation for bid process. In this process there
are very tight specifications and requirement and the bidders
need to include all the information requested in the bid
package. Selection is based on price only as opposed to an
RFP process where there would be an evaluation criteria and
price is not the only factor.

Committee Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED to the unanimous
consent agenda.

• 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update
It is recommended by the Bus Operations Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt the Title VI 2013-2015 Program Update to comply with
federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964.
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the
motion to move this to the full
Board at the March 26, 2013
Board meeting.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded
the motion.

Discussion:

GM Washington stated that this issue is brought to the
Operations Committee because though they have a May 31st
deadline for the report to get to the Feds; staff has to submit
the program to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) by
April 1st. Since there was no Civic Rights Committee meeting
until next month, they had to bring it in the next available
Committee meeting which was Operations. Staff tries to
avoid bringing an item to another committee but because of
the timing issues associated with the submittal of the report
they had no choice. At the last Civil Rights committee
meeting the submission was not ready to bring it up.

Director Deadwyler asked if Calahan makes up the 25% goal
established and if DBEs have been invited to participate in this
project. David Genova stated that since the project is funded
with local money the goal is SBE. If it was a federal project
the goal would be DBE; however any SBE or DBE would be
allowed to bid. Calahan is a certified SBE and they will be
subcontracting some of the work to other SBE. Director
Deadwyler asked if staff can find out if Calahan is opening it
up to DBEs. David Genova stated that they will try to find
that information for her.

He stated that with regard to the question of whether or not
the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) piece should be
included in the Title VI piece, his answer is no. These are two
separate and distinct items. He said that the FTA does not
require it and that ADA is a standalone program too extensive
to be included in Title VI. Staff is working in putting together
a very comprehensive plan that will include all ADA aspects
such as transportation, hiring, facilities and communications.
They expect to bring it up in the next 60 days or less through
the Civil Rights Committee with input from other areas of the
District. They will look at the compliance piece of the
program. FTA does not expect ADA to be part of Title VI and
we want to comply with the FTA for federal funding.
With regard to the discussion about moving the Title VI
position to Planning, GM Washington stated that he
restructured the position primarily to make sure that Title VI
functions go in front of the various projects just like
environmental and other areas included in the planning area.
He wants to be proactive instead of reactive in this area.
They will continue to develop the area and the incumbent in
this position. Staff still wants to bring the Title VI functional
issue at the policy level through the Civil Rights Committee.
With regard to the document, it was not in the appropriate
format and he takes full responsibility for it. They want to
hear the Board comments, make the correction and have the
final document in the package this Thursday for the Board
meeting next Tuesday.
The big piece of the document is the content and intent as
FTA looks to see if we have a program. FTA will also come
back to see if we have implemented the program, but the
document shows the content and intent of having the program
Mike Turner, Planning Coordination Manager stated that one
example is the East corridor project where they were looking
at different alternatives at the very beginning, which went in
or near various kinds of diverse neighborhoods. Under the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) environmental
justice is very much related to Title VI issues, but more related
to see how the different alternatives address mobility and how
they benefit or impact populations of different race, color or
national origin. It is a matter of making sure that we take all
Packet Pg. 30

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 19, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

6.D

of that into account so that there is not a disproportionate
impact. In this project they had a very large Hispanic
population and they had to have language translation involved
and specific outreach. Another example is the launch of the
Central Rail extension where there are several alternatives,
they need to look at how they will provide the service, do they
use light rail, street car and how we get into downtown or
not. The Five Points area’s citizens would have a lot of
concerns with regard to the service they would get and how it
would impact them. All this would be part of the analysis. It
is probably a good idea to have that prospective at the very
beginning of the program as all projects beginning in planning
but when it gets down to specific services and alternatives
and impacts it needs to be looked at very closely.
Director Bagley commented that this is about a 600 pages
report, he trusts the staff and know how important this
document is for compliance with the FTA. He thinks the main
components have been handled. He supports the approval of
the document.
Director Deadwyler stated that she has questions about the
move of Title VI to the Planning Department. Based on GM
Washington statement that it was to get ahead with the
program, she wants to know why we were behind; with the
quality of staff available, there is no excuse for RTD to not
meet a deadline. Also, with a 600 pages report, she would
have wanted to be able read it to understand the issues, but
they have turned this into a crisis situation. She has trust but
not 100% trust. She wants to know why the report was
delayed. She is not happy about these moves and the lack of
time to read the whole document though she understands they
need to approve it. She stated that she will be at the GM’s
desk any time there is a flaw and anytime the Board misses a
deadline because of lack of information or because it is poorly
written. She asked GM Washington to respond to why this
report was delayed. GM Washington stated that there are no
excuses and he takes full responsibility for it coming to the
Board now; however there are several issues and this
particular report is very comprehensive. They will try to do is
do better in the future in terms of deadlines. This is an area of
continued improvement.
Director Deadwyler asked if there is any chance of the Title VI
department going back to the Civil Rights Division. GM

Director Lubow stated that she is also concerned about the
timing. It is a lengthy document that includes a lot of dense
legal material, which is deeply important and not having the
time to read all of it, precludes them from doing their job. She
will vote against because she could not read it. Based on
what she has been able to read, she has learned a lot and
already has a lot of questions. GM Washington stated that
they have a few revisions and hope to have them ready by
Thursday. Director Lubow stated that she has a lot of
revisions and that she understands how demanding it is to
write a document like this but it makes it difficult for the Board
members if it is not ready on time. GM Washington mentioned
that staff is ready to sit down with the Directors and help
them with any questions they might have. This is an update
of the last document presented three years ago and that they
have always had. The previous document is set to expire in
May. Director Lubow stated that she agrees with Director
Deadwyler and understands that we need to be proactive, but
thinks that the Civil Right Division would be a better place for
Title VI.
Director Solano is concerned about a Civil Rights issue that
should have been planned from day one and not dealing with it
at the last minute. Civil Rights is a very important issue to
ridership. He will vote no.
Director Folska stated that she is troubled about putting any
civil rights into different divisions in RTD. She understands
that everything is going to be revised under the Civil Right
Committee but it dilutes the impact of the Civil Rights
Division. She asked about the expertise of Mike Turner on
Title VI and any experience he has advocating for people
affected by it. GM Washington stated that Mike Turner has
been in the planning division for several years. The items that
are part of his purview in terms of being proactive and looking
at the planning pieces include the tasks that he mentioned
earlier. They see Title VI as an early part of planning. Having
it in the Civil Rights department often times made Title VI
more reactive than proactive as it stayed out of the planning
arena for various projects. With the change, Title VI will
address very important issues and become part of the planning
items at the front end. Director Folska stated that everybody
Packet Pg. 32

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 19, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Washington stated that he believes that the new reporting and
structure is in the best interest of the agency.

6.D

Director Folska stated that she understands about the FTA
requirements and that they are not asking for ADA specifically.
However it is important to recognize that adding the phrase
people with disabilities does not distract from the main focus
of the report. These people fall in all other categories of race,
English proficiency, etc. It is important to have it, because if
they are not in the list they are not counted. She hopes that
they will make the commitment to include ADA aspects, even
if not all ADA requirements. GM Washington stated that staff
can do that.
Director Walker stated that based on his experience, he agrees
that putting Title VI in planning is the right move. Having all
those resources in the planning stage, when impact studies
are being done, is good because it allows having the input of
all the different areas at the same time and is easier when you
have all of them within reach of each other. Planning should
be at the front end. With regard to the document, he knows a
lot of the information comes from the previous year which is
not available until the end of the fiscal year and sometimes not
available in a timely basis. He understands why the document
is coming now, based on the timeline that the feds have
versus the timeline when the information becomes available.
He supports the program.
Director James agrees with the colleagues with the concerns
they have. He hopes that since this is a three year update, an
executive summary format would help the Directors not be so
overwhelmed. The summary should include history of how
the document has been updated in the past. It would also
help to start the process earlier so the Directors are aware of it
and can start getting information. GM Washington
appreciated the comment. He thinks the last time they did an
executive summary and he will look at that.

Packet Pg. 33

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 19, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

needs to be trained in Civil Right across the different divisions.
She doesn’t agree with having this piece along with
environmental justice in an area where people don’t have
specific expertise advocating for Title VI. It makes more sense
to have all the Civil Rights issues whether Title IV, Title II or
Title VI concentrated in the Civil Rights Division, headed by
Kenn Hardin who is clearly competent in this area. That
division can outreach to other division to educate them and
everybody knows where to go.

Director Deadwyler stated that she knows they are going to
move the report forward, but she still feel like there is no
excuse for getting the document so late, when it is done every
three years and that department is only working on that. She
thinks it could have been doable and workable if proper
planning was on top of the list. She still doesn’t believe it
belongs in planning. This process is not working and
something needs to be done. She also questioned the
expertise of the staff that will be handling the issues in
planning. She will sit with Mike Turner to see what they have
done in this area and how they will address all the aspects of
Civil Rights. She doesn’t want staff to blindside the Board
with something so important and putting them in the position
of just trusting them.
Director Rivera-Malpiede assured Director Folska, that there
are many people in this community that will never learn to
speak English. She also mentioned that she has had the
privilege to work with Mr. Turner in several environmental
impact statements and she has seen him interact with the
Latino Community where he is very well respected. She has
been with him on the East Line and he has helped her on
health impact assessments to get a better understanding of
who lives in the community, including all diversities, every
disability, every language, every service that was lacking and
how to move it forward. She believes that they are all here to
work together and there is not any kind of underlining deal to
circumvent the community, which is not the vision or the
mission. She believes that Mr. Turner’s credentials are
excellent.
Director Folska stated that this is a very important policy and
this is what they are tasked to do. She did not get a chance
to read all of it, and because of that she will not support it.
With regard to Director Rivera-Malpiede’s comments, she did
not say that all people can learn English and she was not
saying Mr. Turner is not capable.
Director Lubow stated that it is a good suggestion on moving
things forward by having an executive summary. But the
whole document is very useful and if there is an executive
summary she would like to be able to upload the prior
documents that the executive summary refers to.

Director Anderson stated that coming from a family with
members that were displaced by I-25 and I-70 and also
knowing many of the people that when displaced moved out
to Arvada, she thinks that having the Title VI issues addressed
at an early stage is very important. With regard to the
document, she skimmed through it, a lot of things refer to
material the Directors have received in the past, and she does
not think they need to read page by page. She trusts the staff
to do their job and to make sure that when we send something
to the FTA is correct and puts the agency’s best foot forward.
She will appreciate an executive summary and all documents
should be available to all Directors. This is very important; she
would have nothing to judge it by but it looks thorough and
she expects it will meet the FTA criteria. By not moving it
forward, the Board will put the agency’s future in jeopardy.
Director Solano stated that he is representing the constituents,
people that are legal residents but cannot speak English and
have not been provided information about the bus systems or
RTD in Spanish. He had to make special requests for that type
of information. RTD has not been proactive in a diverse way
in his area. He will vote no.
Director Anderson stated that she has found all the
information for FasTrack and Bus services in Spanish. She has
also worked with the people in Adams County to give them a
better community. She has also checked on opportunities for
them to learn English and there are many volunteers to help
people learn English.
Director Solano stated that there is no requirement to speak
English to be American.

Director James agreed with Director Lubow that making the
other documents available should help them better understand.
He also stated that he thinks moving Title VI to planning to
allow it to be proactive is a good idea. He is Chair of the
Planning and Development committee. The idea of having all
the process far ahead in the planning state is good and he will
support the initiative.

• Contracted Fixed Route Services Update 4th Quarter 2012
Bruce Abel introduced the Contracted Service Group Carolyn Conover,
Senior Manager; Greg Smith Manager of Competitive Services; Brian
Matthews Manager of Special Services and Larry Buter, Paratransit Manager.
He also mentioned that the managers of the various service contractors
were in the audience.
Bruce Abel requested to reverse the order of the updates and present the
Contracted Fixed Route update first since it relates to the other updates.
Greg Smith stated that the performance statistics for the year-to-date 4th
Quarter are in the packet. First Transit Commerce City and Veolia did not
meet goal in the preventable accident ratio per 100,000 miles. With regard
to miles between lost service road calls Veolia did not meet year-to-date
goal; however RTD staff has worked with their maintenance department to
ensure the quality of repairs made on buses and as a result in the 4th quarter
alone they did meet the goal. Bruce Abel stated that this quarterly report
also reflect year-to-date. They discussed with the Board the challenges they
were having in the maintenance arena and the performance has improved
over the quarter. They continue to have challenges with on-time
performance as result of fewer services and ridership increases. Staff
continues to campaign and try to improve those problem areas and work
towards improving those particular routes.
Director Lubow asked for clarification on what non-preventable accidents
are. Bruce Abel stated that preventable accidents are those were the
operator did not do everything within his/her power to prevent the accident,
non-preventable is out of the purview of the operator. One example is a
passenger slips on a bus stop on ice. That is a passenger accident but not
something that RTD has management control of. On preventable accidents
they do training with the operators. Director Lubow asked how failure to
meet performance standard by some of the contractors compares to RTD

own employees. Bruce Abel stated that the report shows comparable
performance regardless of who the service provider is.

Director Sisk asked if 88% of on-time performance is really acceptable to
RTD. Bruce Abel stated that the goal set each year as part of the budgeting
process is 88%. By industry standards, it is an aggressive goal, which
means that our performance is a lot better than many of our peers. He
mentioned that San Francisco celebrated when they got 68%. GM
Washington mentioned that their general manager still got a bonus. Bruce
Abel also stated RTD holds itself to higher standard, but due to service
reduction and passenger increases we have been challenged to meet our
own standard. Another piece is that typically they expect to spend 1% or
1.5% of service expansion every day just to keep up with traffic growth
which slows us down. As passenger load grows, dwelling time (time spent
in the boarding process) also grows. As processes take longer if we don’t
have money to build in more service we fall behind on the schedules. In an
ideal world we would have about a 1% or 1.5% of the budget to expand the
service, but we haven’t had the luxury. Director Sisk asked if the bus is a
minute late would that be factored in. Bruce Abel stated that the definition
of on-time is the bus does not get more than a minute earlier or more than
five minutes late.
Director Hoy asked if the shortfall for the on-time performance can be
addressed by changing the time because we are always late or are those
instances made up of anomalies that just happen. Bruce stated that they
have policy schedules and policy headways from a marketing perspective.
When they have a bus that is policy headway for every 30 minutes, when
traffic allows the bus to complete the trip in 30 minutes we are great. But if
either traffic grows or passenger volume grows and it takes more time for
people to board the bus they have two options, add another bus or be
consistently late. These are some of the tradeoffs of having policy
headways. Director Hoy asked for clarification on the data included in the
report. Bruce Abel stated that these numbers show the year-to-date. That
is why they make special note to talk about each quarter. However that is
the way the report has been formatted. Director Hoy stated that it is harder
to interpret today, if somebody made a dramatic improvement it might not
show up in the report.

Packet Pg. 37

Director Daly asked for a reminder of some other non-preventable accidents.
Greg Smith mentioned that some of the non-preventable accidents review
during 2012 included passengers getting on the bus, tripping on their own
feet and hurting themselves; passengers falling from the seat for no
apparent reason and injuring themselves or passengers de-boarding the bus
and tripping on the last step.

6.D

Director Deadwyler asked regarding on-time performance what happens
when a driver has to pick up a passenger with heavy load that may take
extra minutes and pushes that driver off schedule. She asked if this would
affect the driver. Bruce Abel stated that it is reflected in decrease of ontime performance. In terms of the drivers they are all aware that the priority
is safety. In cases where they examine in-depth performance of a route and
they find that an operator is not performing as we would like, they provide
training for the operator. Director Deadwyler stated that she is glad that
they are not punished, but she has heard that in many cases passengers
have been passed up. Bruce Abel stated that the only time they are allowed
to pass a passenger up is if the bus is filled to capacity which hopefully they
would have a bus following.
Director Daly clarified for Director Lasater that the column labeled 2012
goals is not the performance; it is what was set as the goal for the year.

• Customer Complaint Summary 4th Quarter 2012
Bruce Abel stated that the report is included in the packet. Carolyn Conover
stated that they do see increases in complaints but in many cases it relates
to services changes in 2012. When services cuts occur, there are more
passengers riding on fewer routes. One of the main categories is “bus did
not show” or “bus was late.” When staff receives a complaint they
investigate, looking at video and playbacks of the CAD/ADL system, but
even if the complaint is not valid, they can’t take it off the report.
Director Lubow noticed that the report states than in some cases it is just a
perception. She hears from people who are annoyed. This people will get a
response back from the scheduling department telling them than the stats
don’t show a problem. An area that she has heard has nothing to do with
bus being late or not showing up, but that the schedule change doesn’t
make sense. There doesn’t seem to be a way where the fact that the
customer is dissatisfied is addressed appropriately. Bruce Abel stated that
all complaints are reviewed, they use several different means. The schedule
may well not make any sense for a particular individual but schedule is set
according to the majority of users. Another issue is that Directors hear from
the individuals that have complaints. But the survey shows that there is a
high majority of customers that are satisfied with the service. Director

Packet Pg. 38

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 19, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lasater stated that looking at the 5-6 year comparison it seems that
in the top categories for 2012 seems to have been a tremendous failure.
This based on the complaints report and is a trend that concerns him. Bruce
Abel asked if they were moving into the next subject. Chair Tobiassen
stated that they would finish the issue of on-time performance and move to
this issue.

6.D

Director Deadwyler agrees with Director Lubow because she gets a lot of
calls from people that want to complain and they don’t reach to the call
center because they’ve had bad experiences and nothing has been done.
That affects the stats because they stop calling. RTD needs to have a
process so that people don’t feel that they cannot report something because
RTD doesn’t believe them. We need a program that addresses each case
and stop sending generic letters. Bruce Abel stated that he did not imply
that they are not valid, and he will be glad to explain to the Board members
what the process is.
Director Walker has had good luck with the way the staff has addressed the
complaints. He thanked the staff for their help; he feels that all comments
have been look into.
Director Solano went back to on-time performance and stated that First
Transit Commerce City is consistently poor and they are negotiating a labor
agreement and that might be affecting the on-time performance.
Director Bagley asked for Directors to stay on the right item. Director
Solano stated that this was on-time performance. Director Tobiassen stated
that the items order had been changed.
Director Hoy stated that we do a million passenger trips; it seems that he
gets a complaint once a month. He rides the bus very regularly and probably
has complained once and he was wrong and the staff was right.

• Access-a-Ride Services Update 4th Quarter 2012
Bruce Abel stated that the Access-a-Ride services report with updates on
ridership, revenue hours, on-time performance and customer complaints is
included in the Board packet. Larry Buter stated that on-time performance
continues to improve as a result of a recent change to reinforce a six minute
wait policy for pick-ups.
Director Deadwyler stated she is concerned about the statement on the six
minutes wait, because some of the users have trouble getting to the street
due to their disability and sometimes they have to wait more than six
minutes for the bus to arrive. She wonders if that is something that needs
to be addressed with the contractor. Bruce Abel stated that some people
are disabled and live in units where there is no provision to have shelter.

Packet Pg. 39

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 19, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Lubow stated that she doesn’t doubt that, but there has to be a way to
address those customers that have a sincere concern. Bruce Abel stated
that they take every complaint seriously and all complains are investigated;
however the users might not be satisfied with the assessment.

6.D

Director Folska asked for definition of what the IVR system is. Bruce Abel
stated that the IVR will allow the computer do some of the work. At this
point RTD doesn’t have the person power to make outbound calls to track
every vehicle and call every customer and inform them where the vehicle is.
The IVR and on-board computer systems will work with the Global Position
System (GPS) to identify where the vehicle is and it will automatically call
the user 10 minutes before the vehicle arrives. Another feature is to have
automatic call backs at night to remind the users of the next day schedule.
Also a person can call in and ask where their ride is and the system can
inform them. Director Folska asked if this will work for access-a-cab.
Bruce Abel stated that it is only for access-a-ride because those are the
vehicles that are under RTD managerial control. Larry Buter stated that the
system will help with access-a-cab in how the trip is booked. Instead of
calling the call center the user will be able to call IVR and the system will
prompt the user for some information and transfer the call to the selected
cab company and the user will work directly with the reservation desk at the
cab company. Director Folska asked if the call center would go away. Larry
stated that they are just removing the process of scheduling access-a-cab
trip. Users will always have the option to talk to an operator at the call
center. Director Folska clarified if the process is that when users want to
schedule an access-a-cab, they call the system and it goes directly to the
cab company. If they call the call center, they have to wait in line, and then
the call center faxes or emails the order to the cab company. Larry stated
that it is correct.
Director Tobiassen asked if the IVR has been implemented. Bruce Abel
stated that they just finalized the contract negotiation. Director Tobiassen
asked what the expected day of delivery is. Larry stated that they said the
turnaround would be 180 days, but this is a project shared with the TIC
department so it might take a little longer than that. Director Tobiassen
asked them to keep the Board informed as they receive a lot of complaints
for the access-a-cab service. Larry mentioned that they met with the cab
companies and are committed to meet quarterly. Also the TIC department
Packet Pg. 40

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 19, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

RTD is trying to work on a case by case basis, so that if they are in that kind
of situation, RTD calls ahead so they have time to get to the front door of
their multi-family dwelling unit and get to the vehicle in six minutes.
Director Deadwyler stated that she appreciates that, but also wants to know
what else is being done to provide flexibility. Bruce Abel stated they are
trying to make sure that one customer pick up does not impact other people
that are also waiting for the service. They just signed the contract for the
Interactive Voice Response (IVR) so that people can sign up for the service
and they will be automatically contacted 10 minutes before the vehicle gets
to their location. Director Deadwyler stated that she really appreciates their
efforts to improve, as they get a lot of complaints from the family members.

6.D

will track the access-the-cab complaints and forward them to the
corresponding cab company for their response.
Director Deadwyler asked if it is true that the cab companies are using
private contractors and they have a choice to pick up the passenger or not
and they can refused to transport a disable passenger. Bruce Abel answered
that yes, the cab driver is an independent contractor, working with yellow
cab. However they are not supposed to refuse service.

Bruce Abel and Brian Matthews, Manager, stated that the report is included
in the Board Packet.

• Radio and Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location
(CAD/AVL) Project Status Update
Bruce Abel and Trent Ratcliff stated that that the report is included in the
Board Packet. They had a brief conversation about this with the action item
related to the FCC changing the radio specifications.
Director Hoy asked what the new schedule for installation is. George Hovey
stated that it is August.
Director Tobiassen asked if all of Director Lasater’s questions have been
addressed. Director Lasater stated that they were.

• Smart Card Project Status Update
Bruce Abel introduced Beverly Scott, Assistant Project Manager, and Judy
McMurphy who recently joined RTD in the IT area. As stated in the packet,
Gary Googins left RTD and they are in the process of transitioning the
project. They are reviewing the project schedule and milestones and will
advise the Board if there is any impact on the schedule.
Beverly stated that they recorded over 1.1 million taps in February and in
March they have recorded 750,000 expecting to surpass the amount in
February. They are seeing a successful implementation at this point.
Director Menten asked if the Denver Downtown Partnership is paying for the
two additional validators mentioned in the report. Beverly clarified that RTD
is paying for them but the Denver Downtown Partnership approval is
required for the electric feed because they own it. They have received the
approval to use their right of way for the 18th and California and they will
place a validator closer to the end of the train. They expect to be able to
move forward with the 16th and California as well.

Director Folska asked if they can provide information on what is being
collected from the riders. Bruce and Beverley stated that they can discuss
that offline and review the program objectives, the type of information
collected and what it is being used for.

Director Sisk stated that this is the technological edge that we need to avoid
people in lines and the soonest it can be implemented throughout the region
the better.
Director Walker echoed the comments. He has received good comments
from users even though it is in early stages.
Director Tobiassen asked if they know how many should have tapped versus
the actual taps. Beverly stated that on a week day they are getting 55,000
they think should be closer to 70,000 but they are validating. Bruce Abel
stated that the benchmark was set against prior years EcoPass records. It
has been up and down. Director Tobiassen stated that we will need to
know in the future to make sure.

• 4th Quarter 2012 Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
David Genova and John Tarbert, Transit Police Chief, stated that the report
is in the packet.
Director Lasater asked if since we transitioned security companies, has that
affected the statistics decreasing warning and citations. John Tarbert stated
that the change did not affect as it happened in February.
Director Hoy stated that there seems to be three times more warnings as
citations. He wondered if the change from the state legislators from a
felony to a misdemeanor. John Tarbert stated that the change was from a
misdemeanor to a traffic infraction. The activities of all the fare
enforcements have not changed. David Genova stated that they have
talked about doing away with the policy of first time violator getting a
warning, but decided to leave things the way they were and monitor to see
if there was a rise on activity. There doesn’t seem to be a difference.
Director Tobiassen has been riding 15L on Colfax and the feedback from
drivers and customers about the Aurora police officer riding the buses has

Director Bagley stated that this program is important for RTD to become
relevant in the way we access information and how the fares are provided.
They were in Washington DC and they had the experience to use the
smartcard and it is fantastic. He asked them to keep up the good work.

Director Solano mentioned that he attended a forum on truckers against
human trafficking. They approached him because that might be taking place
in the transit industry. John Tarbert stated that it has not been addressed
specifically to them. However, anything can happen on public transit, but
they are not aware of anything like that. GM Washington stated that this is
a topic with high visibility at the national level. They have talked to the
drivers stressing that if they see something out of the norm they need to
report it immediately. FTA has requested to add this issue in the training for
all transit agencies.

• 2011 RTD Customer Satisfaction Research Results: Executive Summary
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager Communications and Dennis Yaklich,
Acting Market Research Manager, provided a presentation on the Customer
Satisfaction Research focused on lifetime customer value, frequency of use
and forgiveness of service issues. Presentation included the key findings in
the areas of bus, light rail, call-N-ride and Skyride. He also mentioned they
are sending 8,000 mailers for a survey on access-a-ride, which will be
mailed this month. He mentioned that more details are available if the
Directors wish to review them.
Director Folska asked how many mailers they have sent for other services
and what the response was. Dennis Yaklich stated they sent 16,000 out
and that 37% was the overall response. Director Folska asked for the cost
of the mailer. Dennis stated that those 16,000 were not mailed, those
customers had the option to respond by mail and a pre-paid envelope was
provided. He was not sure of the total amount but will look for that
information and provide it to her.
Director Anderson asked for clarification about the low scoring from those
users that have to pay for parking. Dennis stated that only out of district
users have to pay for parking. Scott Reed stated that overnight in district
users receive the first 24 hours free but if they park longer they would have
to pay.

D. Other Matters
There were no other matters.

been positive. He also mentioned that he is in the E470 Corridor, they have
implemented a program where the state patrol provides a list of stolen plates
to E470 and they can identify stolen vehicles going through the express toll.
He acknowledged the RTD parking staff and noted they have been
implementing similar program in our parking to identify stolen vehicles. John
Tarbert stated that this is being done as a public service at no cost for RTD.

B. Recommended Actions

• Resolution No.__, Series of 2013 related to the issuance of RTD Certificates
of Participation, Series 2013A
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the
“Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional Transportation District
Certificates of Participation, Series 2013A.
Motion:

Chair Anderson made the motion
to move this item to the full Board
at the March 26, 2013 Board
meeting.
Director Deadwyler seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter began by recognizing Brenden Morgan as well
as Dee Wisor from Sherman & Howard L.L.C and Mike
Newman and Jason Simmons from First Southwest Company.
He stated that they have been a big help on a debt deal that
was closed today for approximately $100 million. This was
one of the items approved at the February, 2013 Board
meeting.
Brenden Morgan stated that on January 22, 2013, staff
presented the refinancing of three RTD financing issues at

Packet Pg. 46

lower than current interest rates to reduce payments, and
improve cash flow as a Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) item and
proposed to use the financing capacity generated by the
refundings as a step toward accelerating construction of the
North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to 72nd
Avenue.

Brenden Morgan said that this action item discusses the third
of the three refunding opportunities that were included in the
RAM item proposed on January 22, 213. This item also
includes a discussion of the financing of buses and ticket
vending machines the District is in the process of procuring.
Brenden Morgan stated that RTD issued its $80.965 million
Certificates of Participation (COP), Series 2005A in June 2005
for the purpose of financing 29 light rail vehicles. At present,
$38.030 million par amount of the 2005 Certificates remain
outstanding.
Brenden Morgan explained that RTD has the potential to
advance refund the remaining outstanding 2005 Certificates
on a callable basis to realize, subject to market movement, a
savings of approximately $1.5 million (4%). He also explained
that this Resolution requires a minimum of 3% savings which
allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates
between now and the date the bonds are sold.
Brenden Morgan noted that while the potential refunding
savings are significant, such savings are net of a cost resulting
from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the refunding
certificates at a return equal to the interest expense of the
refunding certificates, and (b) the length of time between the
sale of the refunding certificates and call date of the 2005
Certificates that we are refunding. He stated that this is called
the Negative Arbitrage. Brenden Morgan said that despite the
cost associated with the Negative Arbitrage, the potential
savings from a refunding of the 2005 Certificates exceeds the
typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Staff has assembled
a financing team and commenced documentation to be in a
position to take advantage of the opportunity for RTD to
reduce its interest expense.
Packet Pg. 47

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 19, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Brenden Morgan shared that the first of these refundings was
approved today and obtained an on cost capital of 1.63% and
a savings of $25.2 million over the life of the bond.

Brenden Morgan stated that the Resolution also provides for
financing of up to $210 million worth of equipment as
anticipated to be financed in the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
He noted that this is a correction for the Board Report that
reads $280 million. The buses included in this financing are
intercity buses, 40 foot transit buses, 60 foot articulated
buses, Mall Shuttles and ADA cutaway vehicles. Ticket
Vending Machines (TVMs) to be financed include replacement
machines for the southwest and central corridors which will
make all of the District’s light rail lines credit card compatible.
Brenden Morgan explained that the District intends to
reimburse itself for the purchase of this equipment with the
proceeds from these certificates as outlined in the
reimbursement resolution adopted by the Board on May 22,
2012.
Brenden Morgan stated that Terry Howerter has taken the
preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
refunding bonds by preparing documents that are available for
review in the Board Office in substantially final form.
Brenden shared that RTD has been receiving the advice of First
Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors, and
Sherman & Howard L.L.C., as Bond Council. The Certificates
will be underwritten by a team including RBC, J.P. Morgan,
Loop Capital Markets, and Stifel Nicolaus.
Director Solano expressed that he thinks this is great news.
He represents the North Metro area and this will help them get
services in a more efficient and quick way.
Director Deadwyler asked for the total cost of the refinancing
and how many years it was for. Terry Howerter explained
that staff has combined two items together to avoid certain
reissuance costs. There will be underwriting fees, bond
counsel fees, miscellaneous fees, etc. Brenden Morgan stated
that for the Certificates of Participation the costs are about
$1.5 million on a $225 million issuance. He said that we are
not extending the amortization for the 2005 Certificates that
we are refinancing. The other equipment will be financed over
its usable life: 12 years on the larger buses and 5-6 years on
the smaller ones.

Chair Anderson asked for Brenden Morgan to repeat the total
savings amount. He stated that from the bonds sold today,
March 19, 2013 the total savings was $25.2 million. Chair
Anderson congratulated the team for such a huge savings.
Director Menten noted that the original Certificates of
Participation goes back to 2005. She asked if these
Certificates were approved by the voters. Brenden Morgan
explained that since these are COPs this was structured as a
capital lease so it was not brought to the voters for their
approval.
Director Menten believes that some people within Colorado
would consider this as debt. Marla Lien stated that the courts
of the State of Colorado have ruled that genuine lease
purchase agreements where there as an asset for which you
pay fair market value on an annual basis is not debt; it is a
rental of an asset. She said that RTD has ensured through
bond counsel that all our financing and the assessment of the
value that we pay on an annual basis are in compliance with
the laws of the State of Colorado.

Director Daly noted that recently we were re-rated by Fitch.
He asked if we received a poorer rating. Brenden Morgan
stated that we did receive a downgrading in 2012 but when
we had a presentation this year they reaffirmed the rating from
last year so there was no change at this time. Terry Howerter
added that we have not received the ratings for the COPs
presented in this Recommended Action.

C. Updates

• Fiscal Sustainability Task Force Recommendations Update

Doug MacLeod stated that the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force was formed
in 2010. The Task Force brought forward recommendations that were
approved in June 2011 and in May 2012 the Board prioritized the
recommendations. He said that staff had a meeting on March 7th with the
State Department of Revenue (DOR). Doug MacLeod shared that we
explained our goals and they were well received. He stated that the next
step is to meet with DOR staff to better understand their auditing processes.
The next step will be to develop a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
followed by an RFP to engage a third party to supplement the DOR audit
duties. Doug MacLeod explained that this does not require additional State
legislation.
Doug MacLeod noted that as the Board may recall, we have put together
some legislation to get RTD on parity with the State; this means that
vendors would have the same exemptions for RTD as the State.
Director Hoy noted that it seems the Department of Revenue is being very
cooperative which was not the case two years ago. Doug MacLeod
explained that our proposal has changed. We wanted to do a combination
of self-collection and auditing originally but we have changed this as we
have learned about the issues involved. He also believes there was some
misunderstanding by the DOR as to what we wanted; they thought we
wanted to audit their work. Doug MacLeod stated that we are now on the
same page.
Director Hoy asked about using a third party auditor. He thought that the
Department of Revenue was opposed to this idea. Terry Howerter explained
that we also changed our approach with regard to the auditors. We will
supplement the State’s audit and bring auditors in at that level. He
explained that the State does this with several cities already.
General Manager Washington stated that we have a great working
relationship with the former RTD Board member and Executive Director of

the Department of Revenue, Barbara Brohl. He said that she has been
outstanding in understanding what we are trying to do. She has really
helped us.

Director Menten asked how many additional staff members would be needed
to implement the Task Force recommendations Doug MacLeod reviewed.
She also asked if we would need any additional software. Terry Howerter
stated that we are not anticipating any additional staff as the audit would be
outsourced to a third party. We would also not need any software.
Director Menten pointed out the con listed under the Sales and Use Tax
Compliance Review section is a perception by vendors of additional
compliance burdens. She stated that as a small business owner, if they
have to fill out a form for another government entity and worry about an
additional audit there is no perception of an additional burden; there is an
additional burden.
Director Bagley stated that in looking at the Top, Second and even Lower
Tier Priorities he wanted to note how important the Task Force is. The Task
Force included staff, Board members, and people from the business
community. He explained that it is very important to him to see that we
have really made progress with taking action on some of the items
identified. He is very happy to see us where we are today.
Director Hoy noted that if the tax parity goes through, vendors would
basically be duplicating the same forms. Doug MacLeod explained that
concept is that it will be simpler and easier for the State to perform their
audits; it is a clean audit for both the State and RTD. He believes it will be
beneficial in that aspect.
Director James thanked Staff for their persistence in moving forward with
the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force recommendations. He feels that
managing our fiscal house seems to be going well.
Director Menten asked for clarification as to what action requires legislation
that staff mentioned was introduced today, March 19. She asked for
clarification on the language of the bill; she wanted to ensure that we are
not requesting a business owner fill out additional paperwork. Doug
MacLeod stated that we need legislation for the exemption parity but not for

Director Menten noted that the annual cost of $500 thousand for the Sales
and Use Tax Compliance Review is for both collections and auditing. She
asked if staff could tell her how that amount breaks out. Terry Howerter
explained that this is a monthly fee we receive from the Department of
Revenue as one number so staff would not be able to break it out.

the supplemental audit services. Marla Lien explained that the bill creates
the same Sales and Use Tax Base for RTD, Science & Cultural Facilities
District (SCFD), and the State. Terry Howerter reiterated that the parity will
make it simpler for the vendors to file their taxes because everyone will have
the same tax base.

• January 2013 Financial Summary
Doug MacLeod reviewed the January 2013 Financial Summary Memo with
the Board that can be found in the March 19, 2013 Financial Administration
and Audit Agenda Packet. He explained that due to the year-end financial
audit, the financial information was not yet complete so staff only presents
Dashboard information.
Committee Chair Walker shared that when he was reviewing this report he
was thinking about the American Community Survey that came out several
weeks earlier that showed the people of Denver are really good about riding
bikes. He commented that he wonders if this has an influence on why
fewer people are using public transportation. Committee Chair Walker thinks
it is a trend that we should keep an eye on.

• 2013 Amended Budget, 2014-2019 SBP, 2014 Budget – Calendar
Jannette Scarpino explained that this 2013 Summary Budget Calendar is to
help the Board anticipate the timing of the key financial plans that staff will
present throughout the year. She stated that staff will look to the Board for
collaboration in developing these plans throughout the year. Jannette
Scarpino noted June 25, July 16, and November 19 as meetings of
particular importance.
Jannette Scarpino shared with the Board that staff is anticipating bringing
forth changes for the 2014 Budget in FasTracks Projects. She explained
that these are multiyear projects but only the current year’s budget amount
is adopted. Jannette Scarpino stated that going forward we will be
disclosing future years’ budget expenditures as well. Staff will ask the
Board to approve the budget but not appropriate the funds for the additional
years. She said that this change comes from a request by the Federal
Transportation Administration for more transparency; while it has always
been the Board’s intent to approve the entire project, only the current year’s

Chair Anderson recognized that Director Menten made some good points but
she shared that she sat on the Colorado Municipal League Sales Tax
Committee as a business person and retailer who collected taxes. Chair
Anderson explained that the consensus of opinion was that if it was uniform
than it was easier rather than having to keep two sets of tax records.

6.E

budget is in Oracle. This change will allow for future years to be in Oracle
as well which is what we provide to the FTA.

• 2012 Performance Report – Fourth Quarter

D. Other Matters
Director Sisk highlighted that the Board had a discussion tonight about Sales Tax
Parity and that there was a bill brought by Senator Hollingsworth to the legislature
today. He handed out a resolution that he asked the Board to consider approving at
a Special Board Meeting following the Government Relations Committee Meeting on
April 2nd, 2013. This resolution shows the steps have been taken and
demonstrates that the Board is taking measures to create funding sources to
assist/fund the unfunded corridors.
Director Sisk shared that he was very honored to join his colleagues in Washington,
D.C. for the APTA Legislative Conference. He thought it was very beneficial and
was impressed with the respect that RTD has throughout the nation. This makes
him very proud to be part of RTD.
Director James reminded the Directors about The Road Ahead event on March
21st, 2013 that they were invited to. He believes it will be very interesting.
Director Solano reiterated that he believes the reason the on-time performance for
First Transit Commerce City was lower than the other areas was because the
negotiations of the union contract are coming up. He thinks this may be due to
worker apathy. Director Solano also provided the number for Truckers Against
Trafficking Every Day Heroes: 1-888-373-7888 for the record.

Board Censure Policy Request
Director Rivera-Malpiede provided information on the nature of this request. She
referenced the resolution # 005 of series 2008 regarding the Board Operating Guidelines
and stated that we needed something with more teeth. She has heard lots of concern
from the community on various perception of inappropriateness of behavior. She has
noted that other elected officials have a censure process or policy and she wanted to have
the discussion on if such a policy is appropriate for the RTD Board.
Marla Lien, legal counsel, asked for a clarification on whether we were asking about
censure or censor. Director Rivera-Malpiede stated censure. Marla Lien then explained
that the Board does not have the right or ability to restrict other Board members in what
they discuss with constituents. A Board member may have meetings with constituents or
other elected officials and express their views which may differ from the official Board
position. She then cited a previous case where this issue was challenged under the 1st
Amendment rights to free speech.
Director Rivera-Malpiede provided three specific instances of which she had concern:
1. Board members asking for free tickets to events based on their perceived VIP status
2. Using RTD time and meetings to promote their personal agenda or calling card
3. Meeting with Cabinet or high-level officials for personal gain while misrepresenting
themselves as on official RTD business.
Marla Lien responded that these represent two distinct issues:
 Items 2 and 3 are not in violation and the Board members are entitled to pass out
their books, meet with whomever, and offer diverse points of views. This is not

It is recommended by the Bus Operations Committee that the Board of Directors adopt
the Title VI 2013-2015 Program Update to comply with federal laws, regulations and
guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Director Rivera-Malpiede asked to have this issue tabled until next month.
Directors Bagley and Hoy expressed some frustration over the lack of understanding of
proper protocols and decorum. Director Hoy shared the concern that having a frivolous or
unofficial meeting with senior level Cabinet members could ultimately take away from the
ability of setting up subsequent meetings with these officials on official RTD business.
Director Anderson shared she will be meeting with members of the Board one-on-one to
review protocols and to share the Board Operating Guidelines.
General Counsel Marla Lien reiterated that Board members have 1st Amendment rights and
no action can be taken against them for these actions. General Manager Washington
stated that it would be good that if a meeting is setup, an upfront acknowledgement that
this is an unofficial request would be the right thing to do. Part of the concern is the
Cabinet that consisted of the Secretary, Deputy Secretary and their legal counsel assumed
that the visit was official RTD business. Director Hoy asked at what point was it disclosed
that the visit was unofficial-at the time the meeting was setup, or when they arrived for
the visit? This would make a difference.
Director Walker asked Marla Lien if it makes a difference if there is a quorum or when
people can represent the Board. Marla Lien replied that there are situations where a Board
member can be elected to represent the full interest of the Board or when staff can be
sent as a delegate to represent the Board. Generally, this is an understood thing.
Director Bagley expressed his opinion that if a Board member is traveling on a trip that is
paid for by RTD, the purpose of that trip should be clear and there should be an
understanding of the protocols or policies regarding the appropriate use of public funds.
The Committee agreed that it may be appropriate to have an independent person speak to
the protocols and decorum for the legislative body. This is an education process on how
the Board can be more effective in representing the Agency as a whole.
Chair Anderson will work with the Board office and General Manager on follow-up to the
concerns of protocols and decorum.
IV.

Other Matters


Director Daly stated that he felt a special thank you should be given to Sherry
Ellebracht for setting up the Legislative conference and how well the conference went.
Director Bagley added that he think this was a better conference this year and an
effective use of the Board time. He thought the meeting with the FTA Administrator
was most valuable. General Manager Washington stated that the schedule was
expanded to include more Congressional delegates this year. Chair Anderson stated
her compliments to everyone for the Hill visits.
The Committee voted to provide a special thanks to Sherry Ellebracht.

all the facts before pursuing such action. This would not play well in the media and
would reflect poorly on the agency in the school of public perception.

Director Bagley shared that the CAC Committee had met in Highlands Ranch. He
appreciated that 13 of the CAC members from across the district drove out to
Highlands Ranch for this visit. He also shared that he spoke at the Denver Rotary Club
of approximately 80 people in attendance. The meeting went well and the people were
receptive.
Director Walker shared that he had met with the Englewood City Council this week and
received a positive response. They are enthused over the great relationship with RTD.
He also spoke to a neighborhood group who are excited about the trains. They support
the activities of RTD and understand the decisions that are being made.
Director Walker inquired about the Resolution for sales use tax. General Manager
Washington indicated staff helped draft the resolution to make sure it was consistent
with the provisions of the RAM that the Board approved.
General Manager Washington indicated that when they were in Washington D.C., they
had lobbied the FTA for more than an across the Board type allocation. It was our
perception that the FTA would receive funds to be used at their discretion. Today,
Congress approved $1.8B to be given to the FTA for distribution. He thinks the timing
and ASK from RTD was appropriate.
Senate Bill 27 on parking passed out of committee 11-2.
General Manager Washington noted there are five major APTA conferences and that
the Board might want to consider how attendance might be spread out over these
conferences. Director Bagley added the Rail-volution is also a good conference with
innovative ideas. Chair Anderson shared she thinks there are benefits with attending
some of the other conferences for the new Board members which will help them learn
their job better. They will think more about this idea while recognizing Board members
have the discretion on how they choose to spend their travel budget.
General Manager Washington asked the Committee to consider putting some of the
updates that are discussed in the Operations Committee on the weekly GM report so
that time spent in the meetings can be used more effectively.
General Manager Washington requested the Committee to consider moving the start
time for the Committees and Board meeting to 5:00 p.m. Chair Anderson indicated
she would have Paula to poll the Board members for this proposed change.
Director Anderson will be meeting with each Board member to better understand how
she can help them achieve their goals. She will also be sharing the Code of Conduct
with the members and visiting with them on protocols.
Director Bagley indicated the first General Manager survey will be coming out around
April 5 with a requested response time around April 10th. General Manager
Washington will provide his quarterly accomplishments and activities for this survey.



Gene Putnam, City of Thornton Transportation Planning, expressed that initially he was
apprehensive about the NAMS study. However, as he has evaluated this further, he
understands the need to look at alternatives for Longmont as the price tag for the use
of the ROW has increased. He is also concerned about connectivity possibilities with
Ft. Collins and Loveland as part of the CDOT efforts. He will support this NAMS
study.
Mike Cummings, University of Denver, expressed his concerns about the Board
teambuilding session and the perceived exclusion of a couple of Board members.
Martha Harvey, Arvada shared some concerns in the area of seating for the disabled on
bus coaches, the lack of proper signage, the access to the Smart card machines for
swiping of EcoPass cards and the poor quality of the voice used on the machine to
provide instructions for the disabled. Chair Anderson indicated someone from staff
would get back to her.
Tom Grushka, RTDWatch, expressed his concerns about riders with disabilities. He
stated that in 2004 RTD had promised an increase in bus service and he wonders
when they will get the service as promised. He also stated the Civil Rights need to
have a more substantive position on users with disabilities.
Kenny Shepard, Denver, asked if it is possible to get a station at 64th on the East
corridor. He cited possible needs for a station there including hotel access.

Chair Anderson reported that on February 15, she and Directors Hoy, Bagley, Walker
and Solano attended the Metro North Chamber Gala event.
Chair Anderson shared that on February 19, the Board had a teambuilding session at
Unser Racing. All of the Board members were invited to attend and the Board had
done its due diligence in checking with the facilities to see if everyone could
participate. They had shared they have had a number of teambuilding events for
corporations and that as a “team”, there would be a role for everyone. Some of the
Directors chose not to participate. In the future, we will look at exercises where there
is a specific role for everyone. However, the Board is focused on utilizing the talents
of all its members to move this organization ahead and to set policy for the agency as
we focus on the difficult transit decisions ahead.
The joint Board-staff strategic planning advance will be on March 2. Chair Anderson
encouraged everyone to complete the survey monkey they had received from the
facilitator.
The North Metro Line tour will be February 26 starting at 2:00 p.m.
Chair Anderson requested General Manager Washington to provide his report.

General Manager's Report







General Manager Washington shared that this agency’s number 1 priority is safety. He
updated the Board on the issue that had happened that morning around 6:18 a.m.
where a bus driver entered northbound on southbound I-25. He indicated they had
been investigating this issue. Some of the confusion had to do with detour signage
around the 19 street entrance indicating the HOV lane was closed. They have
performed their usual process of testing the operating and putting the driver out of
service until this investigation is complete. The training department will continue to reemphasize safety first.
General Manager Washington indicated RTD had been invited to a groundbreaking of
the University Station Apartment on February 26.
General Manager Washington indicated the I-225 groundbreaking will be March 1 at
the site of the future Aurora Station north of Centerpoint and Sable. Many dignitaries
are expected to be there including a special invitation that he had extended to the
highest ranking Major General in this area who was involved in the Veterans Hospital.
The I-225 opening will be a gateway for Veterans across several states who will utilize
the Veteran’s Hospital.
General Manager Washington indicated that he had sent an email response to the
editor of the Denver Post addressing specifically the question from the editorial in the
Denver Post on 2/18/13 raising the question “how well are they doing at meeting the
needs of disabled customers they're elected to serve? General Manager Washington
provided these few examples:

RTD was the first major transit agency in the nation to offer wheelchair lifts on 100
percent of its bus fleet, well ahead of the requirements of the Americans With
Disabilities Act (ADA).
RTD pioneered the access-a-Cab program for the metro area, greatly expanding the
on-demand service available to the disability community.
The Denver area is ranked as one of the nation’s most accessible metro areas for
persons with disabilities, due in large part to RTD’s transit services.
The Denver Post just ran a story last month noting how RTD’s contractor for the
East Rail Line serving DIA had solicited and listened to recommendations from an
individual with disabilities who had asked for modifications to the wheelchair
passenger area on the rail vehicles being built for that line. Under RTD’s direction,
those modifications are being made.
RTD’s rail fleet is fully equipped with automatic stop announcement systems, and
the full bus fleet will have that installation completed later this year.
RTD carried over 700,000 passengers last year aboard our access-a-Ride service,
which is provided for persons with disabilities too severe to use our regular liftequipped service.
The access-a-Ride service has an on-time performance rate of 96 percent,
significantly exceeding the national average, and at least equal to RTD’s stellar ontime performance record for our light rail system.
In compliance with ADA regulations, there wasn’t a single access-a-Ride trip denial
in 2012.
RTD works with the disability community in a number of different ways. Several
RTD staff members participate on the DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force,
which also includes individuals with disabilities and staff members from several
cities and disability advocacy groups. The goal of the task force is to identify and
work to remove barriers for Access-a-Ride passengers so that they feel comfortable
using RTD fixed-route services.
The RTD Bus Operator Training Department schedules regular outings for bus
operator trainees at places like Craig Hospital, a local MS Center, and the Colorado
Center for the Blind. The training staff also works with local high schools and
individuals that need one-on-one training on boarding and riding RTD buses.
Disability awareness training is part of the on-going bus operator training at RTD
and our private contractors and is a topic of RTD refresher training and private
contractor monthly operator safety meetings.
RTD has an active ADA Customer Service panel that includes disabled fixed-route
and Access-a-Ride passengers that meets on a regular basis to address ADA-related
issues.
RTD has an active ADA Committee comprised of RTD staff members from a wide
range of RTD departments that meets as needed to address ADA-related issues.

RTD has consistently received awards and accolades from the disabled community
regarding our services and programs.

integrated testing. They are expecting on March 1 to turn this over to operations.

o

Allocation Matrix (RAM) items and to use the financing capacity generated by these items
to accelerate construction of the North Metro Rail Line (NMRL) from Denver Union Station
(DUS) to 72nd Avenue.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:


Refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce payments,
improve cash flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing debt to bridge the Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) for the Eagle
project at a lower interest rate than previously assumed, saving interest costs and
preserving additional capacity under Colorado’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR);



Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance remaining portion
of the DUS to 72nd Avenue segment;



Initiating procurement for construction (Request for Proposals) of the NMRL to 72nd
Avenue in the next ten months.

Approval of the opportunities listed above will allow RTD to take advantage of the low
interest rates that financial markets are currently offering to accelerate the completion of
the NMRL to 72nd Avenue. This action will not impact the availability of funding from
previously-approved RAM items.

Director Menten indicated these changes create quality of life issues
especially for the senior citizens. They estimate it will add about 175
hours to their travel to work.
GM Washington reminded the Board that the West corridor plan has
already been approved. We do these changes about 3 times a year
and there will be opportunity to adjust or change if needed. Director
Bagley reiterated these were minor changes and do not affect the
West Corridor.
Director Deadwyler shared from her own personal experience and
stated they will be an opportunity to meet with the community and
staff if changes are needed. She did so and they made a change to
one of her routes. The process does work. Director Rivera-Malpiede
agreed this is a fluid process and it is important to get with staff and
your community to discuss the needs.

Senate Bill 13-027 Board Action

It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors
support Senate Bill 13-027, concerning the provision of parking facilities by third parties at
or near Regional Transportation District mass transit stations, and allow RTD’s lobbyists
and staff to work with legislators to make any amendments consistent with the Board of
Directors’ intent. In addition, RTD would enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA)
with the City of Boulder (Boulder) that would require Boulder’s concurrence before any
existing RTD owned park-n-Ride could be sold or leased for private operation under the
amended legislation.
Chair Anderson called for a motion to approve Item J, Senate Bill 13-027 Board Action
Motion:

Director Daly made the motion to approve item J, Senate Bill
13-027 Board action.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

General Counsel Marla Lien was asked to explain the City of
Boulder issues and concerns. Marla Lien stated that Boulder
was concerned about its existing Park-n-Rides. The City
wanted an IGA stating that RTD would not convert existing
Park-n-Rides to pay parking without Boulder’s agreement and
RTD has agreed to this.
Director Menten commented that she had heard from a
number of people in Aurora that they had voted down this
initiative on the ballot and they perceive it is a back door
effort to get this approved.
Director Lubow asked about an amendment and Marla Lien
responded the amendment was about the intent which is part

of the bill. There has been some discussion but no new
amendment has been introduced.
Director Lubow expressed she would feel better if there were
some elements of guarantee. Legal Counsel Lien stated there
are no guarantees.
Director Deadwyler expressed her concerns that there need to
be some form of guidelines. She would not be voting for the
charging of fees.
Director Folska indicated she had testified on this issue last
week. When she looks at the initiatives under the Risk
Allocation Matrix (RAM) which was recently approved, one of
the opportunities is for a monetization of our parking fees. All
this bill does is open up that opportunity but it does not mean
necessarily that we will charge.
Director Daly provided an update that the bill was laid over in
the Senate to a future date.
Director Lasater commented that the Board should consider
immediately an ad hoc committee to put forward some
foundational dialogue around this bill. We need to be
proactive rather than reactive. He also shared that someone
had asked the question, “Is RTD an elected body? If so, they
should take care of their own directives on this issue.
Director Sisk stated we should be explicit in our relationships
with the respective municipalities. Parking for customers at a
reasonable price does not drive customers out. RTD need to
work with its fellow constituents on this issue.
Director Walker indicated he will support this bill as it allows
staff and lobbyists to help shape this bill.
Director Folska made reference to “free rider effect” and noted
that some people who are parking free are actually passing the
cost to others. We need to be innovative in regard to our
practice and that this is consistent with the Eagle P-3 process
of putting user fees where they belong.
Director Rivera-Malpiede stated she agreed with the need for
an ad-hoc committee and if that is done she would like to see
representation from our most vulnerable communities.
Director James stated that he sees this as movement of
controls-these are small movements but allows freedom for
municipalities and private companies to manage parking more
cost effectively.

Director Bagley asked if there was an IGA with Boulder. Marla
Lien indicated the IGA was a separate document. Bagley
stated this is his point that any local government can establish
a subsidiary agreement if merited.
General Manager Washington reflected that today
approximately 13% of the RTD ridership actually park. The
majority of them use the feeder service.
Chair Anderson indicated she will support this as another tool
in our toolbox to work with our partners.

Director Folska reflected on the commitment of the people. She stated that she is aware
how hard staff works to provide service to people of disability. She believes however,
that the Board and leadership should participate in a sensitivity leadership training. She
referenced an email that she had received from someone in Director Menten’s district and
asked Director Lubow to read the email aloud.
Director Deadwyler commented about the article in the editorial and the comments that
were made at the Board meeting earlier on exclusion of the disabled to the teambuilding
session. She commented that the articles failed to note that she participated in the event
and that she is also disabled. However, she prefers not to go around highlighting this fact
but to focus on what she can do and how she can contribute as a member of the team.
Teambuilding requires different folks to play different roles. Just as the body has many
members, they each play integral roles (i.e. toe, eye, ear, feet). If the news is to be
reported, it should be reported correctly. Coming to this teambuilding session was an
option. She has been asking for a teambuilding session for over 2 years and she was
happy to participate. The purpose of the teambuilding session was to improve
relationships between the Board members so that they can focus on working together to
move the RTD business forward. It was not personal nor was it intended to be personal.
As a matter of fact, the Board office had done due diligence in working with Unser to
make sure everyone could participate. At the event itself, they had randomly assigned
positions and had called on Claudia to be the team captain who focuses on strategy. She
had elected not to be present.
Director Folska stated she found Director Deadwyler’s remarks encouraging and that she
made a valid point. She indicated there are visible and hidden disabilities and that her
disability is visible. She was offended by this teambuilding session just as the Chair might
be if they had selected to do rock climbing because of her age.
Director Lubow commented she is looking forward to the next teambuilding session.

Discussion:

General Manager Washington introduced Julio Rivera, ATU President,
who expressed his thanks to the negotiating team and to General
Manager Washington. The agreement passed with a union vote of
95% to 5%. Julio expressed that they had focused on some tough
issues like preservation of the pension and strengthening the health
benefits. They were also able to afford a modest pay increase to
their employees.
General Manager Washington thanked Julio for his words and
thanked Julio and his negotiating team as well. They shared a
common goal to negotiate a fair contract with emphasis in areas that
were important to the employees. The 95% acceptance rate by the
union employees for this unprecedented 5-year agreement speaks to
the integrity of their process and the willingness to work together.
He is especially appreciative of the fact this did not get negotiated in
the media but at the table where it fully belonged. This contract is
for the good of the employees and the good of the district.
Chair Anderson thanked both teams for a job well done. She related
a story of meeting an employee on Sunday morning who had just

Recommendation for Contract Awards to
Krische, Gilmore, ITP and Sky Blue for On-Call
Construction Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to award contracts to Krische Construction, Gilmore Construction Corporation, ITP
Construction Services, Inc., and Sky Blue Builders, LLC, the four most qualified firms based on the
application of the evaluation criteria, in the amount up to $40 million for On-Call Construction Services.
The work in these contracts will consist of general civil construction including grading, drainage, utilities,
paving, intersection improvements, site work and landscaping. Funding for these contracts will be
included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.
BACKGROUND
RTD has long employed on-call contractors to perform civil and structural work on various projects for
the base system. As RTD’s rail system has grown and with the complexity and size of FasTracks, the
need has arisen for an on-call construction services contract for the base and FasTracks Projects.
Four firms were selected to deliver the work. One firm was selected for the value of the work to be
performed in the price range of $0 to $500,000 and three other firms were selected for the value of the
work to be performed in the price range of $0 to $2,000,000. The selection committee originally
planned on selecting two contractors for each price range, but upon review, it was deemed that only
one of the three proposers in the $0 to $500,000 price range would have the capability and capacity to
perform the work. Therefore, three contractors were selected in the price range of $0 to $2,000,000 to
end up with a total of four.
One contractor will be chosen for each work order, based on the value of the work order and capacity of
the contractor to complete the work. It is the intent of RTD to distribute work orders on a rotational
basis factoring in: work order amount, contractor (prime and sub) capacity and availability to do the
work, and cost and price agreement. RTD intends to distribute work orders on an equitable cost basis
among the four contractors.
RTD will evaluate, at its sole discretion, the capabilities of the submitter to effectively deliver the work.
The goal of this solicitation is as follows:






Provide finished products that meet RTD’s overall needs, including its Small and Disadvantaged
Business Commitment participation goals and demonstrate a substantive commitment to RTD’s
Memorandum of Understanding with its stakeholder constituents as approved by RTD.
Meet the schedules established in the work orders.
Provide a safe and quality product.
Maximize improvements within the program budget.
Minimize inconvenience to the public.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the contract awards are included in the existing budgets of RTD FasTracks Projects. Work
performed under these contracts will be assigned on a work order basis, and paid for by the project that
assigned the work.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award contracts to Krische
Construction, Gilmore Construction Corporation, ITP Construction Services, Inc., and Sky Blue
Builders, LLC, the four most qualified firms based on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the
amount up to $40 million for On-Call Construction Services. The work in these contracts will consist
of general civil construction including grading, drainage, utilities, paving, intersection improvements,
site work and landscaping. Funding for these contracts will be included in the budgets of the
projects on which the work is performed.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to award contracts
to the four firms listed above; the most qualified firm based on the application of the evaluation
criteria, in the amount of $40 Million. This is not recommended as the evaluation criteria was in
accordance with federal and RTD procurement standards. In addition, the evaluation review process
was extensive, six professionals providing input into the selection to insure that this recommendation
met the Board’s expectations. Furthermore, this alternative would delay the implementation of
several key projects.

12.A

3. Reject all submittals and reconsider the on-call construction services approach. This is not
recommended as experience has shown that an on-call services contract provides the highest quality
at the lowest price for these miscellaneous specialized projects. In addition, it provides immediate
response to any required emergency actions.

Contract Award for the Rio Court Maintenanceof-Way Renovation/Tenant Finish Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager,or his designee, to award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder,
Calahan Construction, in the not-to-exceed amount of $3,472,630 for renovation and tenant finish of
the Rio Court Maintenance-of-Way (MOW) facility.
BACKGROUND
The site/facility was acquired to accommodate the relocation of the Burnham Yard lead track due to the
FasTracks West Corridor project. The lead track that was relocated was aligned through the south end
of the property. The original plan was to raze the entire building that resided on the site. After
consideration, it was determined to remove only a portion of the building and utilize the rest for a new
light rail maintenance-of-way (MOW) facility needed to accommodate growth of the light rail system.
The renovated facility will house all light rail MOW requirements to maintain all track work, signal,
communication and power systems for all RTD light rail corridors including the West Line and I-225. All
functions will be relocated from the existing Mariposa MOW facility that no longer accommodates light
rail’s expanded needs. The alternative to this project is to demolish the building, design and construct a
new building. This alternative is not recommended because it will be much more costly, take much
longer to demolish, design and construct, and most likely result in a smaller facility due to property setbacks for new construction.
DISCUSSION
The project was advertised on January 30, 2013. The pre-bid conference was held on February 12,
2013 and the bids were received on March 1, 2013 as follows:
1. Kiewit Construction – $3,449,474
2. Calahan Construction - $3,472,630
3. White Construction - $3,807,500
4. Newstrom-Davis Construction - $4,575,889
After review of Kiewit’s bid documents they were determined to be non-responsive. The bid difference
between Kiewit and Calahan is $23,156.
SBE INVOLVEMENT
The SBE goal was advertised at 25%. Calahan Construction is a certified SBE firm and they will also
subcontract work to other SBE firms.

Funding for the project is included in the 2013 approved budget. The construction budget is
$4,905,403 with $495,452 being CDOT FASTER grant funding and $4,409,951 of local funding.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager,or his designee, to award a
contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder, Calahan Construction, in the not-to-exceed
amount of $3,472,630 for renovation and tenant finish of the Rio Court Maintenance-of-Way (MOW)
facility
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder, Calahan Construction, in the not-toexceed amount of $3,472,630 for renovation and tenant finish of the Rio Court Maintenance-of-Way
(MOW) facility. Project shall be rebid. This is not recommended as the bids are considered
competitive and are below RTD’s budget.
3. Do nothing. Cancel project and redirect funds. This is not recommended as the project is required to
accommodate the expanded MOW operations that are necessary to support FasTracks.

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: March 13, 2013

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

March 8, 2013

Board Meeting Date: March 26, 2013

Subject:

Radio-CAD/AVL
Owner’s
Representative
Contract Fifth-Year Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to amend the contract with IBI
Group (IBI) as the Owner’s Representative to Support Replacement of RTD’s Radio and Computer Aided
Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Systems (Contract 18DH016). This contract
amendment is for the fifth year of a five year period of performance. The scope and fee are
renegotiated annually. The fifth-year fee is not-to-exceed a limit of $1,700,000 for a total contract
value to date of $9,622,000.

BACKGROUND
The scope of work and fee for this Board-approved five year period of performance is negotiated
annually to allow the contract to adjust to changes related to the design choices RTD makes. RTD
anticipates this fifth year of the IBI Group contract to be extremely busy the first half of the year to
complete management of installations and system acceptance testing. Additionally, radio coverage
improvements and decommissioning of the old radio system will require significant efforts.
RTD has been operating a 450MHz analog radio communication system that supports voice and data
communications between dispatchers, bus and light rail operators, Transit Police and field support staff
for the RTD’s operations. The radio system is integrated with the CAD/AVL system. The system was
initially implemented in 1993 and is past the last years of the industry’s common 15-year service life.
Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires changes to the available radio
frequency bandwidth, which are not compatible with the current radio and CAD/AVL design. This
narrow-banding requirement was to have been completed by December 31, 2012. RTD received a one
year extension from the FCC in order to complete construction of the system.
RTD requires the services of an Owner’s Representative (OR) for the Radio-CAD/AVL Replacement
Project to provide highly technical, managerial, business services to support the agency through the
normal project steps from requirements, procurement, through acceptance testing and on into
operations. The OR will provide unique technical skills unavailable internally to RTD.
RTD issued Contract No. 18DH016 to obtain an Owner’s Representative for the Radio-CAD/AVL
Replacement Project. IBI was selected in 2009 by competitive procurement to be RTD’s Owner’s
Representative for the Radio and CAD/AVL Replacement Project. The contract requires eight (8) percent
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) participation. IBI is currently exceeding their goal.
This is a complex and dynamic project so the scope and fee are reviewed and negotiated each year. IBI
has successfully completed the work anticipated for the earlier years and it is in RTD’s interest to
authorize contract amendment for the fifth year of the contract to continue needed support.

Packet Pg. 88

12.C

DISCUSSION
This is the start of the fifth year of a Board-approved five-year period of performance. RTD has the
option to extend the period of performance by one additional year available as needed. Due to the
complexity and changing conditions of the project, each year’s scope of work and fee are reviewed and
negotiated annually.
The anticipated fifth-year activities are:
 Support the CAD/AVL and data radio project implementation and contract administration
(procurement approved by the Board January 2011)
 Support cut-over, operations, maintenance, risk management, and disaster recovery planning
 Complete Automatic Stop Announcement (ASA) data clean up, testing and implementation
 Support procurements, design, contract administration and project execution for the following:
o Asset management database interface development and testing
o Ride Check Plus, data analysis software, interface design, development and testing
o Radio coverage enhancements
 Support development of Standard Operating Procedures for the new system
 Support acquisition of communication pathways (fiber and/or microwave) to connect networks
 Decommissioning of old radio sites

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost to the District for amending the Owner’s Representative contract with IBI Group for the fifth
year is a not-to-exceed cost of $1,700,000. Funding has been included in the 2009-2014 Finance and
Administration Department’s Information Technology Division capital budget. The contract values for
the first four years were $872,000, $1,850,000, $2,600,000 and $2,600,000 for and with this 5th year
addition total award is $9,622,000.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the request for the Radio-CAD/AVL Replacement Project Owner’s Representative
contract amendment and continue on schedule, reduce risk and allow current RTD employees to
continue focusing on operating the current system. This is the staff recommended action.
2. Attempt to accomplish the project with in-house staff. RTD staff does not have the necessary
skills or available resources to undertake this project.
If the IBI agreement is not approved and these resources are not available, the project would proceed
with a combination of Work Order contractors and RTD staff. It is likely that Alternative 2 will delay the
implementation of the project as well as incur additional cost for another vendor’s learning curve.
Failure to meet the extended FCC narrow-banding deadline may result in a penalty of $10,000 per day
per radio channel in accordance with 47 CFR 1.80 and potential termination of FCC license or an order
to cease and desist all transmissions until the license violation is corrected.

Subject:

Property Acquisition for the I-225 Project

Clarke

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: March 26, 2013

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the I-225 Segment 2
Light Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent
domain law.
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the successful proposer for the construction of the
I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project the right of way necessary for the construction of the project.
Property needs will be identified and specific legal descriptions prepared beginning the formal acquisition
process. This process begins with good faith negotiations, but may ultimately result in court
proceedings under eminent domain law. Staff would like to proceed with the acquisition of all property
identified, subject to any modifications or additions required by the contractor and/or construction
activities.
DISCUSSION
On September 18, 2012 the RTD Board approved the acquisition of properties for the I-225 project. As
detailed final design has progressed by the design-build contractor, these additional acquisitions have
been identified.
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by design and authorize the
General Manager and/or Property Managers to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition is included in the I-225 budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as
necessary for construction of the I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed
with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2013
I-225 SEGMENT 2 LIGHT RAIL PROJECT PROPERTY ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project; and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed that attached Right of Way plans tabulation sheets, which list the
property to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just compensation to
acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate condemnation
proceedings to acquire the additional identified Properties and to obtain immediate possession of the
properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall have the authority to
amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of the Properties as it deems necessary in the
best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to exercise the power of
eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title 38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by the I-225 Segment 2
Light Rail Project, although financially compensated according to the law, makes a significant personal
sacrifice for the public good, a sacrifice not made by others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public purpose, that there is
a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within the corridor for and in furtherance of a
public purpose, and that the additional acquisitions are for the benefit of the public health, welfare and
safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Managers, as the Board’s
delegatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
The Board directs that the RTD delegatees should negotiate in good faith for the acquisition of
the property and if the delegatee is unable to acquire any property through good faith negotiations, then
the RTD may acquire such property through the exercise of the power of eminent domain.
The Board further resolves to make every possible effort to communicate with property owners,
to recognize time constraints that may impact them, and to address concerns of owners to the
maximum extent feasible without negatively impacting the Project.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of the Properties as soon
as permitted by law.
Made and adopted this ___ day of _________________, 2013.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: March 14, 2013

Terry Howerter Chief Financial Officer

Board Meeting Date: March 26, 2013

Subject:

Resolution No.__, Series of 2013 related to
the issuance of RTD Certificates of
Participation, Series 2013A

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional
Transportation District Certificates of Participation, Series 2013A.
BACKGROUND:
On January 22, 2013, staff presented the refinancing of three RTD financing issues at lower than
current interest rates to reduce payments, and improve cash flow as a Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) item
and proposed to use the financing capacity generated by the refundings as a step toward accelerating
construction of the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to 72nd Avenue.
This action item discusses the third of the three refunding opportunities that were included in the RAM
item proposed on January 22, 2013. Also included in this action item is a discussion of the financing of
buses and ticket vending machines the District is in the process of procuring.
DISSCUSSION:
RTD issued its $80.965 million Certificates of Participation (COP), Series 2005A (the “2005
Certificates”) in June 2005 for the purpose of financing 29 light rail vehicles. At present, $38.030
million par amount of the 2005 Certificates remain outstanding.
With long-term interest rates near historic lows, RTD has the potential to advance refund the remaining
outstanding 2005 Certificates on a callable basis to realize, subject to market movement, a savings of
approximately $1.5 million (4.00% of principal of refunded bonds). The Resolution requires a minimum
of 3% savings which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between now and the
date the bonds are sold. The 2005 Certificates are callable June 1, 2015 at par.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that, such savings are net of
a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the refunding certificates at a return equal to
the interest expense of the refunding certificates, and (b) the length of time between the sale of the
refunding certificates and call date of the 2005 Certificates (“Negative Arbitrage”). Absent a change in
interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a reduction in time
proceeds of the refunding certificates must be invested prior to redeeming the 2005 Certificates.
Despite the cost associated with the Negative Arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the
2005 Certificates exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has
assembled a financing team and commenced documentation to be in a position to take advantage of the
opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest expense.

Packet Pg. 100

13.E

In addition to the refunding, the Resolution provides for financing of up to $210,000,000 worth of
equipment as anticipated to be financed in the Strategic Budget Plan(SBP). Buses included in this
financing include intercity buses, 40 foot transit buses, 60 foot articulated buses, Mall Shuttles and ADA
cutaway vehicles. These vehicles are expected to be delivered within the next 24 months. The District
has taken delivery of 18 of these vehicles to date. Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs) to be financed
include replacement machines for the southwest and central corridors which will make all of the
District’s light rail lines credit card capable. The District intends to reimburse itself for the purchase of
this equipment with the proceeds from these certificates as outlined in the reimbursement resolution
adopted by the Board on May 22, 2012.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
refunding certificates, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a
preliminary official statement, continuing disclosure agreement, certificate purchase agreement and the
Resolution for issuance of the refunding certificates. The Board is being requested, through the
Resolution to authorize the issuance, to establish the parameters and to approve agreements required in
connection with the issuance of the certificates.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Certificate Resolution including the Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Certificate Purchase Agreement are
available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and Sherman
& Howard L.L.C. as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Certificates will be underwritten by a
team including RBC (40%), J.P. Morgan (20%), Loop Capital Markets (10%) and Stifel Nicolaus (30%).
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Costs associated with the refunding are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and printing fees.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of 2013,
authorizing the issuance of the District’s Tax-Exempt Certificates of Participation, Series 2013A.
This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2013, authorizing the issuance of the District’s Tax-Exempt Certificates of Participation, Series
2013A. This is not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the interest
expense savings currently available to the District.

interests of the District, and if so, to select a surety provider to issue a reserve fund insurance policy for all or
any portion of the Reserve Fund Requirement related to such series of 2013 Certificates and execute any related
documents or agreements required by such commitment.
The delegation set forth in this Section 3 shall be effective for one year following the date hereof.
Section 4.
Approval of Documents. The Lease, the Continuing Disclosure Agreement and
the Certificate Purchase Agreement in substantially the forms thereof presented to the Board and filed with the
District, are in all respects approved, authorized and confirmed, but such documents may be completed,
corrected or revised as deemed necessary by the parties thereto in order to carry out the purposes of this
Resolution and as the General Manager or Chief Financial Officer shall approve, the execution thereof being
deemed conclusive approval of any such changes by the District. The Chair of the Board (the “Chair”) is
hereby authorized and directed to execute and deliver the Lease and the Continuing Disclosure Agreement for
and on behalf of the District. The Certificate Purchase Agreement and the Sale Certificate shall be executed by
either the General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer as authorized pursuant to Section 3 hereof.
Section 5.
Approval of Official Statement. The Official Statement, in substantially the form
of the Preliminary Official Statement filed with the District, is in all respects approved, authorized and
confirmed, and the Chair is hereby authorized and directed to affix her signature to the Official Statement for
and on behalf of the District, with such changes as may be approved by the General Manager or the Chief

Section 6.
Authorization to Execute Collateral Documents. The Secretary or Assistant
Secretary authorized to act on behalf of the Secretary is hereby authorized and directed to attest all signatures
and acts of any official of the District in connection with the matters authorized by this Resolution and to place
the seal of the District on any document authorized and approved by this Resolution. The Chair, the Secretary,

directed to execute and deliver for and on behalf of the District any and all additional certificates, documents
and other papers, and to perform all other acts that they may deem necessary or appropriate in order to
implement and carry out the transactions and other matters authorized by this Resolution. The approval hereby
given to the various documents referred to above includes an approval of such additional details therein as may
be necessary and appropriate for their completion, deletions therefrom and additions thereto as may be approved
by the General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer prior to the execution of the documents. The execution
of any instrument by the appropriate officers of the District herein authorized shall be conclusive evidence of
the approval by the District of such instrument in accordance with the terms hereof.
Section 7.
No General Obligation Debt. No provision of this Resolution, the Lease, the
Indenture or the 2013 Certificates shall be construed as creating or constituting a general obligation or other
indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within the meaning of any constitutional
or statutory provision, nor a mandatory charge or requirement against the District in any ensuing fiscal year
beyond the then current fiscal year. The District shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to
the 2013 Certificates except in connection with the payment of the Base Rentals (as defined in the Lease) and
certain other payments under the Lease, which payments may be terminated by the District in accordance with

Packet Pg. 106

13.E

the provisions of the Lease. Neither the Lease nor the 2013 Certificates shall constitute a mandatory charge or
requirement of the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year or constitute or give
rise to a general obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District
within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation and shall not constitute a multiple fiscal
year direct or indirect District debt or other financial obligation whatsoever. No provision of the Lease or the
2013 Certificates shall be construed or interpreted as creating an unlawful delegation of governmental powers
nor as a donation by or a lending of the credit of the District within the meaning of Sections 1 or 2 of Article XI
of the Colorado Constitution. Neither the Lease nor the 2013 Certificates shall directly or indirectly obligate the
District to make any payments beyond those budgeted and appropriated for the District’s then current fiscal
year.
Section 8.
Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and declares that the
Base Rentals due under the Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized pursuant to Section 3 hereof, constitute
the fair rental value of the 2013 Leased Property and do not exceed a reasonable amount so as to place the
District under an economic compulsion to renew the Lease or to exercise its option to purchase the 2013 Leased
Property pursuant to the Lease. The Board hereby determines and declares that the period during which the
District has an option to purchase the 2013 Leased Property (i.e., the entire maximum term of the Lease) does
not exceed the useful life of the 2013 Leased Property.
Section 9.
Exercise of Option; Direction to Trustee. In the event that the General Manager
or the Chief Financial Officer determines to proceed with the Refunding Project and executes a Sale Certificate
in accordance with the provisions set forth herein, the Board hereby elects and hereby declares its intent to
exercise on the behalf and in the name of the District its option to purchase all or a portion of the 2005A Leased
Property and to redeem all or a portion of the 2005A Certificates (the “Refunded Certificates”), as applicable,
on the redemption date and at the redemption prices set forth in the Sale Certificate related to the Refunding
Project. Upon the execution of the Sale Certificate related to the Refunding Project, the District hereby
irrevocably instructs the Trustee to give notice of refunding and defeasance to the Owners of the Refunded
Certificates in accordance with the provisions of the Sale Certificate, the Mortgage and Indenture of Trust, as
amended, related to the Refunded Certificates and the Escrow Agreement between the Corporation and the
Trustee, as escrow agent.
Section 10.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 11-57-209 of the
Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District acts in good faith, no civil
recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for payment of the principal, interest or prior
redemption premiums on the 2013 Certificates. Such recourse shall not be available either directly or indirectly
through the Board or the District, or otherwise, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law,
enforcement of penalty, or otherwise. By the acceptance of the 2013 Certificates and as a part of the
consideration of their sale or purchase, any person purchasing or selling such certificate specifically waives any
such recourse.
Section 11. Repealer. All bylaws, orders and resolutions of the District, or parts
thereof, inconsistent with this Resolution or with any of the documents hereby approved are hereby
repealed to the extent only of such inconsistency. This repealer shall not be construed as reviving any
bylaw, order or resolution of the District, or part thereof, heretofore repealed.

Section 12.
Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, clause or provision of this
Resolution or the documents hereby authorized and approved (other than provisions as to the payment of Base

Rentals by the District during the Lease Term, provisions for the quiet enjoyment of the 2013 Leased Property
by the District during the Lease Term and provisions for the conveyance of the 2013 Leased Property to the

the invalidity or unenforceability of such section, subsection, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect any
of the remaining provisions of this Resolution or such documents, the intent being that the same are severable.

Subject:

2013-2015 Title VI Program Update

Board Meeting Date: March 26, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors adopt
the Title VI 2013-2015 Program Update to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related
to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to Section 12 of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Master Agreement, RTD must comply
with 49 CFR part 21 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, which effectuates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 (Title VI), as a condition of federal financial assistance. Title VI prohibits discrimination on the
basis of race, color and national origin from recipients of federal financial assistance (grants, loans, etc.).
DISCUSSION
Per guidelines the Guidelines detailed in the Title VI Program requirements as specified in the FTA
Circular 4702.1B, Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration Recipients,
and the Department of Transportation Order 5610.2(a) to Address Environmental Justice in Minority
Populations and Low -Income Populations, were the basis for the selection of elements reviewed and
summarized in this Title VI Program Update. The Title VI Program Update details the manner in which
RTD intends to achieve compliance with the following objectives of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964:
1. To ensure that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are equitably
distributed without regard to race, color, or national origin;
2. To ensure that the level and quality of FTA-assisted transit services are sufficient to provide equal
access and mobility for any person without regard to race, color or national origin;
3. To ensure that opportunities to participate in the transit planning and decision-making are
provided to persons without regard to race, color or national origin;
4. To ensure that decisions on the location of transit services and facilities are made without regard
to race, color or national origin; and
5. To ensure that corrective and remedial action is taken to prevent disparate impacts borne by any
beneficiary based on race, color, or national origin.
The update itself includes an Executive Summary and is an attachment to the board report. Since the
appendices of this document contain a high volume of pages, the appendices will be made available
separately in the Board Office for review.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update doesn’t result in any direct or foreseeable
financial impacts.

ALTERNATIVES
1) Adopt the Title VI 2013-2015 Program Update, achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 and secure current and future federal funding.
2) Delay the adoption of the 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update and jeopardize current and future
federal funding.
3) Reject the adoption of the 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update.

13.F.a

Promoting equity in Mass Transit is a core belief and guiding principle of the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) of Colorado. RTD believes that its patrons
are entitled to the peaceful enjoyment and full benefits of all provided services,
free of discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin or disability. It is
this principle of promoting equity that has allowed RTD to comply with Title VI of
the Civil Rights act of 1964, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Order
5601.2(a) (Department of Transportation Actions to Address Environmental Justice
in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations) and related federal and state
laws, regulations and guidance. The objective of this 2013-2015 Title VI Program
Update is to summarize RTD’s efforts to promote equity in transit in compliance
with Title VI of the Civil Rights of 1964 and US DOT Order 5610.2(a).

New Guidance on Title VI Requirements
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) issued new guidance, effective October
1, 2012, to help recipients of FTA grant funding better understand and comply
with federal civil rights requirements. The new guidance, in the form of a revised
circular, helps funding recipients to comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, which protects people from discrimination based on race, color or national
origin in programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. One of the
most significant changes to the revised Title VI circular was the removal of several
references to Environmental Justice that will help transit agencies better
understand the important distinctions between Title VI and Environmental Justice.
The revised Title VI circular provides more detailed guidance to FTA funding
recipients on how to comply with DOT’s Title VI regulations, which require careful
evaluation of the impact of proposed service and fare changes on minority riders,
and the provision of language access to persons with limited English proficiency.

Title VI Overview
Since 1972, The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Office of Civil Rights has
required recipients and sub-recipients of federal financial assistance to certify
compliance with the Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations and FTA
guidance effectuating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. RTD is a recipient of
FTA financial assistance and is therefore subject to the Title VI compliance
conditions associated with the use of federal funding as outlined in FTA Circular
4704.1B, “Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration
Recipients,” dated October 1, 2012 and Section 12(b) of the FTA Master
Agreement. These regulations and guidance require recipients to:

2. ensure that opportunities to participate in the transit planning and decisionmaking are provided to persons without regard to race, color or national
origin;
3. ensure that decisions on the location of transit services and facilities are
made without regard to race, color or national origin; and
4. ensure that corrective and remedial action is taken by all applicants and
recipients of FTA assistance to prevent discriminatory treatment of any
beneficiary based on race, color, or national origin.

Environmental Justice Overview
In April of 1997, the DOT issued U.S. DOT Order 5610.2(a) affirming that it will
monitor its programs, policies and activities to ensure that disproportionately high
and adverse effects on minority and low-income populations are avoided,
minimized or mitigated in compliance with Executive Order 12898, “Federal
Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low–Income
Populations.” On August 15, 2012 the FTA issued Circular 4703.1,
“Environmental Justice Policy Guidance for Federal Transit Administration
Recipients,” effectuating DOT Order 5610.2(a).
Previously, the Environmental Justice (EJ) requirements were summarized in the
now superseded FTA Title VI circular (4704.1A). In the recently created EJ Circular
4703.1, the FTA provides a much more comprehensive set of guidelines for
inclusion in transit planning, decision-making and management of adverse effects
of resulting from transit decisions with respect to minority and low-income
populations.

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update - Executive Summary (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

sufficient to provide equal access and mobility for any person without regard

13.F.a

As previously stated, the new Title VI and EJ circulars are more specific regarding
the regulatory requirements with regard to service and fare Changes. The major
appendices of this document include equity analyses for two different sets of major
service changes and one fare change over the past three years:
1. The January 2011 Fare Change: A 12.5% increase in fares.
2. The January 2012 Service Changes: District-wide service optimization
resulting in significant service reductions and increases.
3. The West Corridor Service Plan: Opening of the FasTracks West Rail Line
and reconfiguration of other associated transit services in the West
Corridor.

The January 2011 Fare Change and January 2012 Service Changes
From 2008-2012, RTD was faced with budget shortfalls caused by the historic
lows in sales tax revenue, as seen nation-wide due to the economic recession.
The strategies used to cover these economic impediments resulted in the January
2011 Fare Change and the January 2012 Service Changes.
In general, RTD is very diligent in ensuring the impact of service and fare changes
do not disproportionately affect minority and low-income populations through
careful planning and community outreach. The equity analysis of these changes
reflected this practice as no disparate impacts were identified in the January 2011
Fare Change and the January 2012 service changes. The full analyses can be
found as an appendix.

The West Corridor Service Plan
The West Corridor Service Plan Equity Analysis included in this report, was
conducted in compliance with the new Title VI guidance of FTA Circular 4702.1B.
The West Corridor service plan includes the opening of a brand new fixedguideway and over 37 bus route changes (17 of which were major), representing
one of the largest service changes in the RTD’s history. Accordingly, RTD
completed its most comprehensive equity analysis of impacts to minority and lowincome populations.
Evaluation of this major service plan again revealed the intent to promote equity in
mass transit, providing the diverse communities of the West Corridor with
significant service enhancements of the FasTracks program. Directing the nature of
the West Corridor Service Plan Equity analysis was the newly adopted Equity
Analysis Policies.

13.F.a

Equity analysis policies were established which define parameters for what
constitutes a major service change, defines adverse effects and establishes
thresholds which define either a disparate or disproportionate impact. In addition,
RTD solicited public comments on the draft policies through formal/informal
meetings, mail, email and telephone to meet Circular public decision-making
requirements. Most of the resulting responses focused on the application of the
policies and were minor in nature, requiring no significant changes to the policies
which were approved as final by the RTD Board of Directors in November of 2012.
The adopted Equity Analysis Policies are summarized in this document, with the
full policies attached in the appendices.
The remainder of this document outlines the more routine steps toward ensuring
equity in mass transit, as required and specified in the Title VI FTA Circular
4702.1B and EJ FTA Circular 4703.1 to include, but not limited to:
1. Notifying Beneficiaries of their rights under Title VI
2. Compliant Management
3. Racial Breakdowns of Advisory Boards
4. Community Outreach
5. Transit Monitoring

Promoting equity in Mass Transit is a core belief and guiding principle of the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) of Colorado. RTD believes that its patrons
are entitled to the peaceful enjoyment and full benefits of all provided services,
free of discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin or disability. It is
this principle of promoting equity that has allowed RTD to comply with Title VI of
the Civil Rights act of 1964, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Order
5601.2(a) (Department of Transportation Actions to Address Environmental Justice
in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations) and related federal and state
laws, regulations and guidance. The objective of this 2013-2015 Title VI Program
Update is to summarize RTD’s efforts to promote equity in transit in compliance
with Title VI of the Civil Rights of 1964 and US DOT Order 5610.2(a).

New Guidance on Title VI Requirements
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) issued new guidance, effective October
1, 2012, to help recipients of FTA grant funding better understand and comply
with federal civil rights requirements. The new guidance, in the form of a revised
circular, helps funding recipients to comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, which protects people from discrimination based on race, color or national
origin in programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. One of the
most significant changes to the revised Title VI circular was the removal of several
references to Environmental Justice that will help transit agencies better
understand the important distinctions between Title VI and Environmental Justice.
The revised Title VI circular provides more detailed guidance to FTA funding
recipients on how to comply with DOT’s Title VI regulations, which require careful
evaluation of the impact of proposed service and fare changes on minority riders,
and the provision of language access to persons with limited English proficiency.

Title VI Overview
Since 1972, The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Office of Civil Rights has
required recipients and sub-recipients of federal financial assistance to certify
compliance with the Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations and FTA
guidance effectuating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. RTD is a recipient of
FTA financial assistance and is therefore subject to the Title VI compliance
conditions associated with the use of federal funding as outlined in FTA Circular
4704.1B, “Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration
Recipients,” dated October 1, 2012 and Section 12(b) of the FTA Master
Agreement. These regulations and guidance require recipients to:

Executive Summary

13.F.b

1. Ensure that the level and quality of FTA-assisted transit services are
sufficient to provide equal access and mobility for any person without regard
to race, color or national origin;

3. ensure that decisions on the location of transit services and facilities are
made without regard to race, color or national origin; and
4. ensure that corrective and remedial action is taken by all applicants and
recipients of FTA assistance to prevent discriminatory treatment of any
beneficiary based on race, color, or national origin.

Environmental Justice Overview
In April of 1997, the DOT issued U.S. DOT Order 5610.2(a) affirming that it will
monitor its programs, policies and activities to ensure that disproportionately high
and adverse effects on minority and low-income populations are avoided,
minimized or mitigated in compliance with Executive Order 12898, “Federal
Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low–Income
Populations.” On August 15, 2012 the FTA issued Circular 4703.1,
“Environmental Justice Policy Guidance for Federal Transit Administration
Recipients,” effectuating DOT Order 5610.2(a).
Previously, the Environmental Justice (EJ) requirements were summarized in the
now superseded FTA Title VI circular (4704.1A). In the recently created EJ Circular
4703.1, the FTA provides a much more comprehensive set of guidelines for
inclusion in transit planning, decision-making and management of adverse effects
of resulting from transit decisions with respect to minority and low-income
populations.

Highlights of the 2013-2015 Update

1. The January 2011 Fare Change: A 12.5% increase in fares.
2. The January 2012 Service Changes: District-wide service optimization
resulting in significant service reductions and increases.
3. The West Corridor Service Plan: Opening of the FasTracks West Rail Line
and reconfiguration of other associated transit services in the West
Corridor.

The January 2011 Fare Change and January 2012 Service Changes
From 2008-2012, RTD was faced with budget shortfalls caused by the historic
lows in sales tax revenue, as seen nation-wide due to the economic recession.
The strategies used to cover these economic impediments resulted in the January
2011 Fare Change and the January 2012 Service Changes.
In general, RTD is very diligent in ensuring the impact of service and fare changes
do not disproportionately affect minority and low-income populations through
careful planning and community outreach. The equity analysis of these changes
reflected this practice as no disparate impacts were identified in the January 2011
Fare Change and the January 2012 service changes. The full analyses can be
found as an appendix.

The West Corridor Service Plan
The West Corridor Service Plan Equity Analysis included in this report, was
conducted in compliance with the new Title VI guidance of FTA Circular 4702.1B.
The West Corridor service plan includes the opening of a brand new fixedguideway and over 37 bus route changes (17 of which were major), representing
one of the largest service changes in the RTD’s history. Accordingly, RTD
completed its most comprehensive equity analysis of impacts to minority and lowincome populations.

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Final (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

As previously stated, the new Title VI and EJ circulars are more specific regarding
the regulatory requirements with regard to service and fare Changes. The major
appendices of this document include equity analyses for two different sets of major
service changes and one fare change over the past three years:

Evaluation of this major service plan again revealed the intent to promote equity in
mass transit, providing the diverse communities of the West Corridor with
significant service enhancements of the FasTracks program. Directing the nature of
the West Corridor Service Plan Equity analysis was the newly adopted Equity
Analysis Policies.

13.F.b

Equity analysis policies were established which define parameters for what
constitutes a major service change, defines adverse effects and establishes
thresholds which define either a disparate or disproportionate impact. In addition,
RTD solicited public comments on the draft policies through formal/informal
meetings, mail, email and telephone to meet Circular public decision-making
requirements. Most of the resulting responses focused on the application of the
policies and were minor in nature, requiring no significant changes to the policies
which were approved as final by the RTD Board of Directors in November of 2012.
The adopted Equity Analysis Policies are summarized in this document, with the
full policies attached in the appendices.
The remainder of this document outlines the more routine steps toward ensuring
equity in mass transit, as required and specified in the Title VI FTA Circular
4702.1B and EJ FTA Circular 4703.1 to include, but not limited to:
1. Notifying Beneficiaries of their rights under Title VI
2. Compliant Management
3. Racial Breakdowns of Advisory Boards
4. Community Outreach
5. Transit Monitoring

The Colorado General Assembly created the Regional Transportation District (RTD)
as a political subdivision of the State in 1969. According to Section 32-9-102,
C.R.S., the creation of the RTD was intended to “promote the public health,
safety, convenience, economy, and welfare of the residents of the district and of
the state of Colorado.”
Approximately 99.1 million passengers boarded RTD service vehicles in 2012. This
figure represents an average of about 328,109 in weekly boardings. The RTD’s
transportation network includes 148 regular fixed bus routes, 10,025 bus stops,
75 park-n-Ride transit facilities, 35 miles of light rail track and 36 light rail stations.
In addition, the RTD has a fleet of 1,025 regular buses and 153 Light Rail vehicles.
Since 1983 the RTD has been governed by a statutorily-created, 15-member Board
of Directors. Each member is elected to serve a four-year term. There are
approximately 173,000 voters in each of the 15 director districts and most of the
individual director districts cross county boundaries. In addition, the daily activities
of the RTD are administered by the General Manager and eight department offices.
The 2011 total operating budget was $377.2 million. The single largest source of
revenue to the District is the sales tax.

RTD’s Family of Services

1. Local: Local routes provide service in higher density/urban areas. Due to
urban growth, shifting boundaries, or District minimum ridership standards,
these routes may also cross through areas of lower density. These routes
stop an average of every 600 feet or no more than 1 or 2 blocks apart.
a. Limited: Limited routes provide service in higher density/urban areas,
some may even cross all of the metro area. Compared to Local routes,
these routes only make specific selected stops, usually high-volume
transfer points or major traffic intersections. This allows for faster
running times and for passengers to reach their destination quicker
than riding the Local route.
2. Express: Express routes provide service from high-transfer or high-density
ridership locations such as Park-n-Rides, to other points of high ridership
such as the downtown Denver stations. These routes only make selected
stops on the outer parts of their route. They collect passengers and then
continue without stopping to their final destination.
3. Regional: Regional routes provide service from one urban/suburban area to
another. These routes run the majority of their route on major traffic
corridors such as highways or interstates. Regional service can act as a
'Local' route on the first part of a trip, collecting passengers on its way
through town to a Park-n-Ride or station. It can also start at a Park-n-Ride or
station and then continue without any further stops to its final destination.
4. Sky Ride: SkyRide buses depart from each SkyRide stop at least once an
hour and as frequently as every 15 minutes. SkyRide buses operate seven
days a week, 365 days a year.
5. Call-n-Ride: Call-n-Ride is an on-demand, personalized bus service that
travels within select RTD service areas that do not meet the service standard
to demand fixed route service.
6. Light Rail: Light Rail lines generally provide transit service to the equivalent
of Local and Express bus service along a fixed guideway dedicated to Light
Rail vehicles; providing trips as long as 12 miles and as short as one city
block.

RTD believes in and is committed to the public involvement process including the
use of community advisory committees, panels and boards. Each advisory group is
tailored to meet the specific needs of its program or activity. During the formation
of these advisory groups, RTD consistently seeks participation from minorities by
directly soliciting organizations which represent minorities. RTD appoints members
of the public to three advisory groups:
1. The RTD Customer Panel
2. The WIN Steering Committee
3. The FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee

The RTD Customer Panel
The RTD Customer Panel, comprised of 16 panel members, is a matched cross
section of the RTD ridership as determined from the most recent Customer
Satisfaction survey. A new panel is selected each year. This year we obtained
over 300 applications.
There is one panel member selected from each director district, as determined by
the address supplied on the application. There is also one alternate selected, the
alternate can be from any district.
Some panel members have been new riders, others have ridden their entire
lives. The diversity in demographics has contributed to the right mix of opinion
and experience.

The Community Participation Plan is a guide for the Regional Transportation
District’s (RTD) ongoing public participation endeavors. Its purpose is to ensure
that RTD utilizes effective means of providing information and receiving public
input on transportation decisions from low income, minority and limited English
proficient (LEP) populations, as required by Title VI and the Civil Rights Act of
1964 and its implementing regulations.
Under federal regulations, transit operators/agencies must take reasonable steps to
ensure the Limited English Proficient (LEP) persons have meaningful access to their
programs and activities. This means that the community participation
opportunities, normally provided in English, should be accessible to persons who
have a limited ability to speak, read, write, or understand English.
In addition to language access measures, other major components of the
Community Participation Plan include; public participation design factors; a range
of public participation methods to provide information, to invite participation and/or
to seek input; examples to demonstrate how population-appropriate outreach
methods can be and were identified and utilized; and performance measures and
objectives to ensure accountability and means for improving over time.

Summary of Developing a Comprehensive Plan
In order to engage the low income, minority and LEP populations in the
development of the Public Participation Outreach Plan, RTD will conduct multilingual community meetings throughout the RTD service area. RTD will coordinate
with community-based organizations, offering translation services in multiple
languages. RTD will give surveys and accept comments and take notes during the
meetings. All of this information will be gathered and used to develop a
comprehensive Community Participation Plan.
RTD will supplement the extensive public participation process by conducting
informational meetings with the community-based organizations serving LEP
populations in the RTD service area. RTD will also conduct telephone interviews
and focus group meetings throughout the RTD service area.

RTD must develop a comprehensive Community Participation Plan to guide public
involvement efforts and enhance access to RTD’s transportation decision-making
process by low-income, minority and LEP populations. Based on input collected
from these populations regarding effective public involvement and RTD will develop
the overall goals, guiding principles and appropriate outreach methods that RTD
could use to reach out to the low income, minority and LEP populations.
Pursuant to Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Title VI regulatory guidance,
federal funding recipients and sub-recipients should seek out and consider the
viewpoints of minority, low-income and LEP populations “in the course of
conducting public outreach and involvement activities” (FTA Circular 4702.1A).
This guidance also requires that an agency offer “early and continuous
opportunities for the public to be involved in the identification of social, economic
and environmental impacts of proposed transportation decisions at RTD.” To meet
these requirements, RTD will develop a Community Participation Plan, a document
intended as a guide for how RTD will deepen and sustain its efforts to engage
diverse community members throughout its service area. The Community
Participation Plan will include example public participation strategies, designed by
using the Community Participation Plan goals, principles and methods.
The Community Participation Plan will offer early, continuous and meaningful

diverse community members throughout the service area. The Community
Participation Plan will also include examples of public participation strategies, using
the plans goals, principles and methods.
RTD currently conducts community outreach and has public participation during
service changes and construction projects by offering public meetings, mailing
campaigns, door hangers, flyers, working with community organizations and other
methods. To develop a comprehensive plan RTD must first gather information from
the minority, low-income and LEP populations, then develop a comprehensive plan.
The next step would be to have a position that would educate and implement this
plan across the district.

RTD is fully committed to ensuring that Limited English Proficient (LEP) individuals
are provided meaningful access to our various services and programs. Presently,
RTD is in the process of completing the four-factor analysis to determine the
combination of means and methods necessary to provide meaningful access to LEP
communities. While in the beginning stages, RTD has made considerable progress
toward completing the first two steps of Task One in the four-factor framework:
Task 1) The number or proportion of LEP persons eligible to be served or likely to
be encountered by the program or recipient. The first two steps involve
the following:
Step 1) Inquire with staff to determine how LEP persons interact with the
agency;
Step 2) Identification of LEP communities, and assessing the number or
proportion of LEP persons from each language group to determine the
appropriate language services for each language group;

Contact with LEP persons
In general, RTD interacts with the public at large in a multitude of ways that
include but are not limited to:
1. Transit Service (bus, light rail, etc…)
2. Fare Media Sales Outlets
3. Administrative Offices
4. Public Meetings and Events
Thus far, inquiries with staff have revealed that our most frequent contact with
LEP individuals comes by way of our Transit Service, particularly, Local and Limited
bus service. Local and Limited bus routes provide service in higher density/urban
areas, which holds the District’s most diverse communities.
In an effort to obtain a better indication of the nature in which LEP individuals are
encountering RTD, the Title VI Manager will be conducting focus groups and/or
surveys with the various employees who directly interact with the public at large
on a regular basis. Central to this inquiry of staff will be LEP groups identified via
the most recent American Community Survey (ACS) and Census data.

To identify the LEP communities and assess the number and proportion of LEP
persons from each language group in the RTD service, ACS and Census data were
analyzed. According to ACS data, 219,543 of the 2.6 million people in the RTD
service area speak another language while speaking English less than very well. Of
the 39 languages spoken by LEP individuals in the District, 17 language groups
meet the safe harbor threshold. Below is a breakdown of those languages and the
percentage of the service area population they represent:

RTD is currently in the process of completing the four-factor analysis identifying
the specific concentrations of each language group, the frequency in which LEP
individuals come in contact with RTD programs and the nature of importance of
RTD programs to LEP individuals. Once this data has been collected and analyzed,
a language assistance plan addressing the needs of the LEP community will be
developed and implemented. The target date to complete the language assistance
plan and begin its implementation is June 2013.

RTD Title VI Sub-recipient Compliance Process
As a recipient of Federal Transit Administration (“FTA”) assistance, RTD and its
sub-recipients must comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VI
prohibits the exclusion from participation in, denial of benefits or subjection to
unlawful discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal assistance
on the grounds of race, color, national origin.
To meet its enforcement
responsibilities under Title VI, RTD has implemented a sub-recipient monitoring
process.
On an annual basis, the RTD Title VI Manager will ensure the following actions are
taken and documented in writing affirming that RTD and its sub-recipients comply
with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and FTA Circular 4702.1B;
Each year sub-recipients must provide RTD with an FTA Civil Rights
Assurance/Signed Assurance signed by its Chief Executive Officer which attest
that all records and other information required under FTA Circular 4702.1B have
been or will be compiled, as appropriate, and maintained;
Each sub-recipient must implement a Title VI complaint process and provide RTD
with a list of active lawsuits and Civil Rights Complaint summary alleging
discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin;
Each sub-recipient must post its Title VI Policy Statement in prominent
conspicuous and accessible locations throughout its facilities.

Sub-recipients must take responsible steps to ensure meaningful access to the
benefits, services, information, and other important portions of their programs and
activities for individuals who are Limited English Proficient (LEP);

In general, sub-recipients should have a public participation process that offers
early and continuous opportunities for the public to be involved in the identification
of social, economic, and environmental impacts of proposed transportation
decisions. Efforts to involve minority and low-income people in public involvement
activities can include both comprehensive measures, such as placing public notices
at all stations and in all vehicles, and measures targeted to overcome linguistic,
institutional, cultural, economic, historical, or other barriers that may prevent
minority and low-income populations from effectively participating in a recipient’s
decision-making. Sub-recipients must file with RTD documentation of its public
participation plan.
Each sub-recipient further agrees to comply with, and assure compliance by its
third party subcontractors at any tier under the Project, with all requirements of the
FTA Title VI Program pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B and 49 CFR 21.5(b)(2) and
49 CFR 21 .5(b)(7), Appendix C to 49 CFR Part 21.

In order to comply with the FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, as mentioned
above, RTD has established a Major Service Change policy, a Disparate Impact
policy and a Disproportionate Burden policy. Each of these polices govern what
service changes will be evaluated and how those service changes will be
evaluated. These policies and their applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25%
addition or reduction in the service hours of any route that would remain
in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All major service changes will
be subject to an equity analysis which includes an analysis of adverse
effects.
a. Adverse Effect: is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in
service which includes but is not limited to: elimination of a route,
shortlining a route, rerouting an existing route and an increase in
headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects, and
analyze those effects, when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely
affect a minority population 10% more or less than non-minority
populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not
adversely affect a low-income population 10% more than non-low-income
populations; this level of impact is considered a disproportionate burden.
A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty
Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a
disproportionate burden, RTD will consider modifying the proposed service
change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden.

Title VI Equity Policies

22 | P a g e
Packet Pg. 151

The Circular also requires that the formation of these policies endure the public
decision-making process. To accommodate this requirement, RTD’s Civil Rights
Division circulated a draft of the Title VI Equity Analysis policies and solicited
public comment through various channels of communication to include formal
meetings, informal meetings, U.S. mail, email and telephone. Through the
various mediums we reached out to a wide array of individuals, groups and
organizations and received fairly consistent feedback on the proposed policies.
Once educated on Title VI and the new requirements of the FTA Circular, we
found that most participants are primarily concerned with the low-income
community and the disproportionate burden policy. Most consistently the public
expressed a great interest in the definition of a disproportionate burden on lowincome communities. Additionally the public inquired about access to the equity
analysis of disproportionate burdens of the low-income community. Fortunately,
the public feedback generally provided concurrence with the draft policies,
requiring no significant changes to the policies.
After consideration of public input, the policies were finalized and are attached
herein. With these policies in place, RTD completed its equity analysis of the
West Corridor Service plan.
The RTD Board of Directors approved each of the Title VI Equity Analysis
policies. The meeting minutes from the RTD Board meetings in which the
policies were reviewed are included within the Equity Analysis of the West Rail
Line included as an appendix.

The FTA requires transit providers that operate 50 or more fixed route vehicles
in peak service and are located in urbanized areas to monitor their service
standards and policies with respect to fixed route services. These standards and
policies are monitored by comparing the performance of minority routes to nonminority routes, to ensure that service standards are adhered to indiscriminately.
A minority route is defined as any route that has 1/3 of its revenue mileage in
proximity to a minority population above the average of the entire service area.
Per the most recent data RTD has seen an average of 21% minority population
per census tract (see Demographic Profile maps for greater detail).
RTD has chosen a representative sampling and compared routes from Local
(urban and suburban), Light Rail and Express fixed route service to ensure equity
in the application of our service standards and policies. Regional and Sky Ride
fixed route services were excluded from this exercise (as permitted by the
regulations) since none of the routes in these service categories meet the
threshold to be classified as minority routes.
Results of the service monitoring are presented in the tables below:

The results of service monitoring in this report reveal no disparities or
justification for service adjustments.

As RTD continues to expand its service via the FasTracks project, service
standards and policies will continue to evolve to suit the nature of the service
demands in the District. RTD is currently in the process of revisiting the current
service standards and creating new standards. Included in the new standards to
be developed is a Service Availability standard and a Transit Amenities Policy in
compliance with the new Title VI requirements.
The projected date for creation of the Service Availability standard and Transit
Amenity policy is June 2013. RTD will have documented the results of service
monitoring associated with the newly adopted Service Availability standard and
Transit Amenities Policy by September of 2013.
