COVID-19 Service Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Board of Directors approve adjustments to RTD services in order to respond
to dramatically decreased ridership as a result the Corona Virus COVID-19. The COVID-19 Service
Change package is summarized in Attachment A, and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted
by these changes
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Core Goal #4 – Strengthen Safety & Security
RIDERSHIP INFORMATION
The last weekday with near normal ridership levels on our buses and trains was Thursday, March 12 th.
The ensuing ten-day period has seen a steady and dramatic decrease in ridership that is unrivaled in
public transportation history.
We have trended down in this period by 70% through last week from an early March count of 347,000
passengers per day to 100,000 per day and dropping. Based on new restrictions from our state and local
leaders, we anticipate further reductions in ridership.
In order to continue to provide essential transportation services to medical workers and their support
personnel, as well as first responders and others with no other options to access medical and grocery
trips, we are recommending a significantly lower level of service effective April 19th.
We are recommending a Saturday level of service for our bus passengers and a Sunday level of service
for our rail passengers.
There are some modifications to these levels as outlined below.
These changes would be implemented at the same date and time as the Driver Shortage reductions
requested in the earlier regular board meeting. Combined, they represent a significantly reduced level of
service that will be responsive to the current emergency, begin to address the reduced revenue shortfalls
that are inevitable and provide our best level of support and protection for all our employees.
I do want to thank the leadership of the Amalgamated Transit Union for their leadership in protecting
their members’ interest with common sense and compassion.
This new reduced level of service would be scheduled for the period of April 19th through September 20,
2020. We would restore services as ridership returns on a case-by-case basis, hopefully sooner rather
than later. We would be excited to return the services prior to September based on ridership.

DISCUSSION
To respond to dramatic decreases in transit ridership and concerns for RTD employees and the health
and welfare of the transit riding public, RTD has developed the COVID 19 service reductions as outlined
in Attachment A. While these service adjustments have been developed to meet the extraordinary times
that we are all experiencing, the service reductions are still guided by RTD’s guiding principles for
service changes. We anticipate that the District will constantly monitor changes in Public health
guidelines regarding travel in the District in order to maximize flexibility in restoring services as quickly as
warranted and as practical.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards.
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets.
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders.
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible.
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED COVID 19 SERVICE CHANGES
Bus Service
Weekday Fixed Route bus service will be provided as currently provided according to existing Saturday
routes and schedules except for the route 67 and 169L which have other service available in close
proximity. Service will essentially be provided between 5:00 AM and midnight. In addition, some
services will be augmented above the existing Saturday service levels as described in Attachment A.
Saturday and Sunday services will operate as they currently do with the exception of routes 67 and
169L. in addition, the following express and regional service that do not operate on Saturdays or that do
operate at lower levels of service, will operate M-F as per Attachment A:
FF1,120X,CV,LD1,GS,EV, and,RX
FlexRide service
All 25 FlexRides service areas will continue to operate with service hours to be modified to operate from
6:00 AM- 6:00 PM Monday thru Friday. The number of vehicles in service in any service area may
fluctuate due to operator availability. Saturday and Sunday service will continue to operate according to
current plans
Light Rail service
Weekday, Saturday and Light Rail service will be provided according to the current Sunday service plan
with service terminating at midnight.
Commuter Rail
Commuter rail will operate as currently provided pending discussions with the operator.
RTD OPERATORS
We have been asked about the steps we are taking to support our operators. Here are some of those
steps that we have taken:
 Communicating with our operators daily providing updates on the COVID-19 impact to RTD



Stepping up leadership visits to divisions to answer questions and say Thank you.
Providing Nitrile gloves to all operators
Providing Hand Sanitizer to all Operators
Providing Sanitizing wipes to all Operators to sanitize their workstations before each shift.
(Currently experiencing some gaps in availability due to supply chain shortages)
Providing Lysol spray (Currently experiencing some gaps in availability due to supply chain
shortages)
Stepped up the scope and intensity of overnight vehicle cleaning and disinfecting
Wiping down operator workstations/areas on vehicles between morning and afternoon trippers

We have not issued masks to operators at this time as the CDC has not recommended that operators
wear masks except in certain specific circumstances. However, the mask that would be recommended in
special circumstances, the N-95 which won’t necessarily provide 100% protection from COVID-19, is
currently out of stock worldwide (billions backordered). Surgical masks will be available by next month,
but there is absolutely no scientific proof or CDC recommendation that the surgical mask will protect
people from the COVID-19 virus.
