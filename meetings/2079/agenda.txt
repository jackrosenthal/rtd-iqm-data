C. Resolution Regarding Waiver of Sovereign Immunity and Indemnification of Claims

It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt the attached resolution. The
resolution commits to (i) waiving sovereign immunity for and indemnifying the Union

RTD by the attached Resolution waives sovereign immunity to the extent it may be
applicable up to the amount of available insurance and agrees to indemnify the UPRR for
claims arising out of RTD’s ownership and/or use of the property acquired for RTD’s West
Corridor Line from UPR’s Burnham Yard Lead, including but not limited to right of way,

in similar amounts. Pollution liability insurance in the amount of $5 million (five million
dollars) per claim is required along with other insurance applicable to construction projects
or required by law. The resolution acknowledges that indemnity and insurance
