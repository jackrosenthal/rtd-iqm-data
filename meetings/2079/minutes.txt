Eligibility Functional/Cognitive Assessments.

DISCUSSION:

Director Anderson indicated that it would be nice to
have competition and that she would be supporting this.

against this. However, concerning innovation, the Board
can look at Access-A-Ride and how the service is
provided while cutting costs yet still serving the people.
Fuel and vehicle costs will also need to be considered.
Director Tobiassen noted that the he fully supports the
Easter Seals. It is a nonprofit 501C3 organization that
employs extremely disadvantaged individuals. The
Director of Easter Seals does not make much of a salary
because she is there for the love of the organization and
what they stand for.

It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt the attached resolution. The
resolution commits to (i) waiving sovereign immunity for and indemnifying the Union

Pacific Railroad (UPRR) for claims arising out of RTD’s acquisition of, and construction
and operation on the UPRR’s Burnham Lead for RTD’s West Corridor Line; and, (ii)
purchasing insurance in amounts specified to provide funds in the event the need for
indemnification arises.
RTD by the attached Resolution waives sovereign immunity to the extent it may be
applicable up to the amount of available insurance and agrees to indemnify the UPRR for
claims arising out of RTD’s ownership and/or use of the property acquired for RTD’s West
Corridor Line from UPR’s Burnham Yard Lead, including but not limited to right of way,
flyover easements, and structural support easements and obligates RTD to purchase
insurance for various types of claims. Liability insurance in an amount up to $200 million
(two hundred million dollars) during construction and $400 million (four hundred million
dollars) after commencement of operations is required, as is automobile liability insurance
in similar amounts. Pollution liability insurance in the amount of $5 million (five million
dollars) per claim is required along with other insurance applicable to construction projects
or required by law. The resolution acknowledges that indemnity and insurance
requirements may increase based on changes in law or market conditions.

Indemnification of Claims for Union Pacific Railroad’s
Moffat Subdivisions – RTD West Corridor-Burnham Yard
Lead.
